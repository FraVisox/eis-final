The 20-year-old’s mother and five older siblings were worried about him: they feared he was mixing with the wrong crowd, and doing so at a time when tit-for-tat violence among youth gangs was costing lives. But this was considered a safe area: a tree-lined street of Edwardian family homes, coffee shops and a flower shop. Elwin called a friend and they arranged to meet. He walked 200 yards to the south: by the time he turned left into Penwortham Road he had broken into a jog. By this time, police now believe, Elwin had already sustained the knife wound that had pierced his chest. He collapsed, and died within minutes. On the first anniversary of Elwin’s death, his friends gathered at his graveside, where they danced and sang. Some wore T-shirts bearing his picture beneath the message “RIP Lewis”. Also present was a young film-maker who filmed and recorded the group. Using a camera on a drone, he also shot footage high above the 14-storey tower blocks of a housing estate in Tooting where some of the young men lived. The film was edited and handed over to Elwin’s friends, who posted it on YouTube on 21 April 2017. Now, thousands of people could see that a number of Elwin’s friends were members of a gang that called itself 417. They could not see their faces, however: all but one were wearing balaclavas. But they could listen as the gang members sang about how they planned to “ching ching” and “wet their opps” – stab rival gang members. “March to the opp block, samurai down my leg,” they sang. The following night, members of the gang drove to Wandsworth, four miles’ north of Tooting. They were armed with a number of weapons, including a 27-inch (69cm) sword. In the early hours of the morning, they cornered Mahamed Hassan, 17, who was cycling past and stabbed him several times. Mahamed’s cries alerted a resident who called an ambulance. Asked to check for injuries, the man lifted the boy’s top and saw that his intestines were hanging out. The boy died a short time later in hospital. Four of the attackers were in custody within days and went on trial for murder at the Old Bailey at the start of the year. When all four were found guilty, one, Tyriq Aboagye, was clearly surprised. “How can you find us all guilty,” he shouted at the jury. “Let me know coz, tell me bruv, the fuck you think it’s like bruv.” As he was led away, still screaming, the judge, Nicholas Cooke QC, turned to the jurors and said: “I think you’ll understand I see this quite often.” The four teenagers were each jailed for life. Their tariffs – the minimum terms they must serve – totalled 85 years between them. Aboagye was given 27-and-a-half years. The taking of two young lives and the waste of four others is another example of the apparently senseless violence gripping London in particular over the last two years: there have been more than 89 murders in the capital so far this year, most of them knife crimes. Serious youth violence increased by 9.6% in the 12 months to April in London; knife crime by 18.3%. But a small number of criminologists, sociologists and youth workers have been attempting to make sense of “senseless” youth gang violence. They find that while gang members’ lifestyles may initially appear bewildering, it was possible to see a logic and a structure in the choices these young people make and the violence they inflict and suffer. Separately, they were also coming to strikingly similar conclusions about the complex causes of that violence. Unsurprisingly, many of them point to the economic and social factors that result in a small number of young people becoming marginalised, and then attempting to make their way in life in the brutal and unpredictable world of the drug trade. More surprising, perhaps, was the conclusion that many gang members were traumatised and frightened young men – and that the most vulnerable were frequently the most dangerous. Last year Ebony Reid, a sociologist at London Metropolitan University, published a PhD thesis based on her study of 29 gang members on the north London housing estate where she grew up. She called the estate Northville, and the gang’s members called themselves the mandem, a widely used slang term for a group of men or boys. Reid found that 17 of the 29 had been permanently excluded from secondary school and two others had attended pupil referral units. Only three completed A-levels or further education. Four had part-time jobs. The remaining 25, including all but one of those excluded from school, were unemployed. Reid concluded that the gang’s members were trapped in the drug trade because they could not find work. “A precarious drug economy in Northville offered various menial jobs and some lucrative career opportunities for its participants,” she said. Last month a report published by Waltham Forest council in north-east London noted schools’ concerns that the word “gang” should not appear in any of their Ofsted inspection reports, and pointed to the high proportion of gang members who had been excluded from school. A former member of a London gang described to the Guardian how he was excluded and sent to a pupil referral unit at 12. “I just had one fight, outside of school. We was from the same school. He was severely injured. He said that I stabbed him, but I didn’t. I punched him and his tooth went through his face. “I was sent to a school for bad kids. I had a lot of free time. I was there in the morning from nine until 12, and then I was out. We didn’t wear uniform, my mum was at work, my dad was at work, I was left to my own devices. I would meet up with all the kids who were in the same situation as me, been kicked out. “I got sucked into the group lifestyle, the street lifestyle. I was young, I wanted to be popular, I wanted to be respected by the older boys. I did what I thought was right to get the credentials I wanted. Fighting, showing my strength, and being feared in the area. This is when I was 12.” At 14 he was stabbed seven times. A year later he was jailed for 18 months for his role in an affray in which another teenager died. By the time Aboagye was adopted at seven he had had a number of homes and was said to already be deeply troubled. He too was sent to a pupil referral unit. “That was a disaster,” his adoptive mother Jennifer said. “He’s a bright boy, but he’s gullible, and he wants to be liked, he wants to be loved.” By the time he was arrested for murder, Aboagye already had 15 convictions. “I don’t like to think about the length of his sentence,” she said. In her thesis, Reid concluded that the mandem were trapped not only in drug dealing but also in their neighbourhood, because they feared being attacked if they strayed into a rival gang’s territory. “Some can’t even cross the road without putting themselves into a dangerous location,” she said. This postcode rivalry is rooted in real fear. The film-maker who made the 417 video – and who has made many other similar films of gang members – said he had met many who have never been outside their neighbourhood. “Some guys in Tooting have never left Tooting, for example. When I have suggested shooting videos in, say, Westminster, they would say: ‘Bro’ I’ve never left Tooting, there is no way I’m going to Westminster’. “One of them actually said to me: ‘I don’t want to go to Westminster and see opps’. They think if they go to Westminster they would have to carry a knife. They don’t know that there’s no gangs in Westminster. It’s crazy.” Finally, Reid judged, the mandem were trapped in a “hypermasculine” sense of identity. “There is a need to be perceived ‘on road’ as tough or bad, and yearning to retaliate when masculinity comes under attack. To survive requires a certain kind of mastery: defend your manhood or become a victim.” The young men she studied would defend their manhood by “earning stripes”, which in practice meant attacking a member of a rival gang. Gavin Hales, a criminologist who has worked closely with the Metropolitan police, agreed that boys and young men in the most deprived communities could be acutely anxious about their status. “The young men concerned often have a particularly fragile sense of self-worth” and being shown disrespect was often given as a motive for assaults and even murders, he wrote. “In this world, reputation is absolutely critical and signs of vulnerability may be ruthlessly exploited by others … to allow someone to disrespect you without consequences is to admit weakness and invite trouble.” The anxiety gnawing at these young men has been particularly acute after a killing. In Wood Green, north London, last March, after the fatal shooting of Kelvin Odunuyi, a 19-year-old who rapped as DipDat (stab that), teenagers stiffened in fear whenever they saw an unfamiliar figure approaching. “Anything could happen at any time,” said one. “All people have to do is go into the kitchen and get a knife, it’s so easy.” Four weeks later and two miles to the east in Tottenham, on the Northumberland Park estate, the territory of Odunuyi’s rivals, the streets were deserted for several days after the fatal shooting of Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, 17. The motive for that shooting remains unclear. “You can really feel the tension, can’t you?” said one young man hurrying past. A series of surveys have established that the main reason young people carry knives was for self-defence. “For a young person whose life is dominated by fear and survival, carrying and even using a knife may seem completely rational and indeed essential,” said Hales. Perhaps the most difficult factor to unpick, when attempting to make sense of “senseless” youth violence, was the current influence of UK drill, the rap music that is a cousin of Chicago drill, and whose lyrics not only describe gang warfare, but sometimes include threats and taunts against particular gangs and/or individuals. A number of rappers have been murdered in London in recent years, and postcode feuds have been fuelled by “diss tracks” posted on YouTube and other sites where they quickly gather thousands of views. The music that 417 recorded at Elwin’s graveside was drill music, for example, and had been viewed almost 50,000 times by the time Aboagye and his friends were jailed for life. There has been no end of headlines about “the brutal rap that fuels gang murder”. But does the music arise out of youth violence, or fuel it, or both? After another Old Bailey trial, at the end of which two gang members were jailed for life for stabbing a music producer to death, Cooke, again presiding, observed: “Music, of course, does not kill people. Music is a great cause for good, whatever genre or type.” He added, however, that there was legitimate concern about the glamorisation of violence in some of the videos that feature in the murder cases he had been hearing. Ciaran Thapar, a writer and youth worker in Loughborough Junction, south London, described drill as “a war report on life in the urban trenches of austerity Britain”. While acknowledging that it could normalise violence, and could also contribute to acts of violence, Thapar said the young men making the music endured deep-rooted problems involving family life, communities and state education. “Most, if not all the young men making drill are angry, neglected and have no investment in formal society. That is the reason why there is a connection. The music reinforces its source, so let’s cut the source.” Reid said that even more important than giving gang members economic opportunities was the need to broaden their horizons, and to offer them counselling for the anxiety they suffered. This is not what has been happening. Instead, in May, YouTube took down about 30 music videos after a request from the Met. The police said they ask that videos be taken down only when they raised the risk of violence, and also used a range of criminal behaviour orders such as curfews and non-association orders to limit gang violence. Last month, drill musicians who were members of a gang, and who had admitted conspiring to cause violent disorder, received a court order that banned them from making music without police permission. In May senior officers also promised to start treating those who made the films in the same way as those who promote terrorism online. Nobody has been more critical of these measures than the members of that small group of people who have been attempting to make sense of gang violence, and who fear that attempts to suppress drill will lead to the further alienation of those young men who regard the music as the soundtrack to their difficult lives. Hales was particularly critical of the tendency of politicians and senior police officers to latch on to easy solutions. “Youth violence is a long-term, entrenched problem,” he said. “It can’t be solved by a quick fix.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/20/turkey-elections-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T04:00:30Z","webTitle":"Erdoğan has Turkey in his palm as key elections loom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/turkey-elections-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/turkey-elections-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan","fields":{"headline":"Erdoğan has Turkey in his palm as key elections loom","bodyText":"All along Istanbul’s boulevards, the face of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan looms large. For 16 years he has ruled over his country, victorious in election after election, vowing every time that Turkey is on the path to reclaiming its status as a great power in the Middle East and beyond. Turkey’s largest city is home to a variety of grandiose projects that channel this vision. In October, the government is scheduled to complete work on Istanbul’s third airport, which will serve 90 million passengers a year. A project to bypass the Bosphorus with new 28-mile (45km) waterway linking the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea – a project first proposed in the 16th century – will cost billions of dollars. Turkey is less than a week away from arguably its most important elections in modern history. The victor in the presidential race will assume an office with extraordinary powers, which were narrowly approved in a referendum last year, and rule until 2023 – the centennial of the republic’s founding from the ashes of the Ottoman empire. Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development (AK) party faces the prospect of losing its majority in parliament, but the 64-year-old, who has sought to position himself as a leader of the Muslim world as well as his country, is predicted to retain the presidency. He remains Turkey’s most popular and powerful politician despite an unexpectedly dynamic opposition. “He’s a really great leader,” said Rumeysa Kadak, an AK parliamentary candidate likely to become the country’s youngest MP. “We can see that there is great pain in the world, and he is the leader to say the world is bigger than five [the permanent UN security council members], to say ‘stop’ to the world, and he’s the first person to say that.” Independent polls suggest an easy victory in the first round, though without an outright majority, before more narrowly defeating a second-round challenger. Muharrem İnce, a physics teacher and the main secularist opposition candidate, is most likely to make it into the final round with Erdoğan. His lively campaign has drawn thousands of people to rallies across the country. He has vowed to overturn restrictions on fundamental freedoms and restore the rule of law in Turkey. Meral Akşener, the leader of a breakaway nationalist party, has energised young voters in her attempt to outflank Erdoğan from the right, while Selahattin Demirtaş, the charismatic Kurdish leader, is running a presidential campaign from his prison in Edirne. On Monday, he gave a groundbreaking televised speech from the jail calling on voters to reject one-person rule. However Erdoğan, often classed by human rights campaigners as a strongman leader alongside Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán, is likely to be re-elected. “Great Turkey wants a powerful leader,” say his election posters. “There are two Turkeys I believe: one imagined Turkey, by western writers, and one real Turkey, here, and we are witnessing that Turkey,” said Fahrettin Altun, an expert at the Foundation for Economic, Political and Social Research, a thinktank with ties to the government. “Voters believe that a powerful Turkey can be obtained by Erdoğan’s leadership [and] they believe that Erdoğan is a symbol of mainstream Turkey. Erdoğan is the voice of Turkish society.” That last claim is arguable. In the last major vote – the referendum on presidential powers – Erdoğan won by a razor-thin margin amid allegations of fraud. Altun said, however, that opposition leaders’ attempts to imitate Erdoğan proved he offered a good representation of Turkish society. İnce has a populist veneer to his speeches and occasionally adopts crowd-pleasing, anti-western slogans, such as vowing to close the İncirlik airbase used by the US if Washington fails to extradite Fethullah Gülen, a Pennsylvania-based preacher accused of masterminding the 2016 coup attempt. Mimicking the president’s religious piety, both Akşener and İnce have emphasised that they are personally devout. Erdoğan and the AK party’s promise to its voters has often rested on two pillars: economic growth and democratisation, which in effect has meant a greater voice for their once-beleaguered base. Supporters of the president admire his public piety, largely because it has allowed those who identify as devout Muslims to be part of mainstream society after decades of vilification by their secular countrymen and women. Under Erdoğan’s leadership, headscarves are allowed in parliament, universities and public buildings, a transformation that few of his supporters are likely to forget. “As a teenager in Ankara in the 1980s we couldn’t wear the headscarf at school,” said Ravza Kavakçi, an AK party MP. “So on the weekends or outside of school, if people didn’t insult me I would feel like I was invisible, I would worry that they could not see me. “But with the democratisation I was accepted as a human being. As a Muslim it didn’t matter what others said or did, I was accepted the way I was.” The economy, in the meantime, has suffered a few shocks. Youth unemployment remains high, and the value of the Turkish lira has plummeted against the dollar. But the strong leader image has left most voters convinced that only Erdoğan can fix what ails Turkey. Kiraz, a 55-year-old AK party voter, said she had little patience for opposition leaders claiming to be religious or wanting to save the country. She was sitting with friends in the courtyard of the Fatih mosque in Istanbul, named in honor of Mehmet the Conqueror, who wrested control of Constantinople from the Byzantines. She called the opposition presidential candidate İnce “a liar who will ruin everything”. “There are no lines in the hospitals, we have roads, parks, everything, what more do we want?” she asked.

Angela Merkel has rescued her coalition by promising to negotiate a deal within the wider EU about the settlement of refugees. The CSU, the Bavarian party in her conservative parliamentary grouping, had threatened to close the border to refugees trying to re-enter the country after being denied asylum once; this will not now happen until a more general deal has been reached. The crisis goes to the heart of the question – both moral and political – of what are the obligations that the settled world owes to the migrants who come to our frontiers. The question is increasingly being posed in religious terms. The Bavarian state government, which has been in the hands of the CSU since 1966, started to display crosses on the front of all public buildings – a move opposed by the Catholic Church in Germany, even though the CSU identifies as strongly Catholic. The CSU claimed that the cross was not in this context a theological symbol, but a marker of culture. This is not entirely disingenuous. Religion and culture cannot be completely disentangled from each other: a religion that is not nourished by cultural practice will die in a generation. Yet some of the anti-immigrant parties claim the danger of dark-skinned migrants is posed by their religion; others that it arises from their culture. The effect of these various scruples may well be the same: closed frontiers, families split, children imprisoned apart from their parents, refugees tortured, raped, drowned, or left to die in deserts on their journeys, all to discourage the others – but the rhetoric will be different and the different emphases matter. The established parties, such as the CSU, claim their hostility is cultural, while the insurgents, like the AfD in Germany, or Steve Bannon in the US, claim that it is religious. This is the underlying belief of the new global right, from Vladimir Putin all the way through Europe and on to Donald Trump. It has grown into an existential challenge to all universalist and humanitarian ideologies, whether they are religious or secular. These movements of peace have often been instruments of war. The gap between theory and practice persists in our politics to this day, only now it is domestic. Is Christianity a badge of European identity against the Muslim hordes, or is it a way of understanding refugees as strangers whom the Bible commands Christians to welcome? Did Enlightenment values demand the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, or should they have warned us off? Piety and preaching won’t make Europe welcome refugees, nor soften the heart of the US Republican party, which has sunk under Mr Trump into a fetid swamp of ethnonationalism. Only the slow growth of a culture shared between migrant host populations will do that. But humanitarian ideals do allow us to understand that the problem is a global one, which demands global solutions. This crisis is not just about the attractions of Europe or the US. It is just as much about the dreadful conditions in Central America, Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan. So long as these countries are sunk in anarchy or ravaged by war, desperate people will leave them. Mrs Merkel wants the burden of refugees spread across Europe and that is right. But any lasting solution must reach beyond the borders of the countries of refuge. This does not mean filling north Africa with internment camps. In the long run, generous aid to bring peace and the conditions of prosperity to the countries which refugees now flee will prove essential."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/18/sunsafe-rx-sunscreen-pills-taken-off-shelves-chuck-schumer","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T19:03:51Z","webTitle":"Senator demands edible sunscreen be taken off shelves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/18/sunsafe-rx-sunscreen-pills-taken-off-shelves-chuck-schumer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/18/sunsafe-rx-sunscreen-pills-taken-off-shelves-chuck-schumer","fields":{"headline":"Senator demands edible sunscreen be taken off shelves","bodyText":"Sunsafe RX is a product that promises “to help protect you from both UVA and UVB rays”. On its website, there are glowing user testimonials and photos of young, attractive people enjoying the weather. It’s the kind of marketing you might expect from a sunscreen brand, except that Sunsafe RX isn’t a cream or a spray – it’s a pill. It’s one of a number of products to be taken orally that make claims about protection from the sun – potentially heralding a new era when, instead of slathering yourself in lotion, you could swallow a pill and head to the beach. It sounds too good to be true. According to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), as well as Chuck Schumer, that’s because it probably is. Last month, the FDA explicitly warned the public that these pills were “misleading consumers and putting people at risk” and named four companies, including Sunsafe RX, Advanced Skin Brightening Formula, Solaricare and Sunergetic, which “make unproven drug claims about protecting consumers from the harms that come from sun exposure without meeting the FDA’s standards for safety and effectiveness”. The FDA sent letters to each of the companies asking them to rethink the way the products are being marketed. The Democratic senator has demanded the FDA go further, asking that the products be pulled from shelves and online retailers. At a speech on Sunday, he said: “Sunscreen pills are a fraud ... right now thousands and thousands of Americans are taking these pills and not putting on sunscreen. And they are endangering themselves.” Those worried about the ability of Sunsafe Rx to prevent sunburn or skin cancer might head to the FAQ page on its website. There they would be assured that “Sunsafe Rx is not only effective but also completely safe” and that “all the ingredients in Sunsafe Rx are recognized as safe and approved by the FDA for sale in the United States”. The site does not mention that the FDA has explicitly said the pills are “putting people’s health at risk by giving consumers a false sense of security that a dietary supplement could prevent sunburn”. In a statement to the Guardian, the company said “Sunsafe Rx is made with ingredients that published clinical studies show protect skin from sun damage” but that Sunsafe isn’t marketed “as a sunscreen, and we certainly don’t tell consumers that they don’t need any other protection from the sun or that they don’t also need to use a topical sunscreen”. On Sunsafe’s website, however, the company strikes a different tone. The site has a specific page about traditional sunscreen suggesting that sunscreen is ineffective and damaging compared with the oral products it is marketing. The site claims: “Most sunscreen lotions are unstable, toxic and only moderately effective against UVA rays. Sunsafe Rx is healthy and safe.” It does not explicitly tell people not to use sunscreen but uses such language as “if you have to use a sunscreen lotion” and “potentially, sunscreen could actually be contributing to the damage of the very skin it was intended to protect!” When asked about the traditional sunscreen page on the site, a company spokesperson said: “The sunscreen page has recommendations toward the end of it on the best ingredients for sunscreen lotions. You will also notice a disclaimer on every page of the website that says the product is not intended to replace topical sunscreen. But in addition to this, we are currently already working with the FDA to figure out the best messaging for the product, and those updates will be incorporated into the product messaging to best educate consumers about how the science shows the ingredients in the product help them.” About 90% of non-melanoma skin cancers and 86% of melanoma skin cancers are associated with exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. More people are diagnosed with skin cancer each year in the US than all other cancers combined. There have been numerous claims over the years from inventors who say they’ve found a way to ingest protection from the sun. In 2011, researchers who had been examining the ways in which coral protects itself from UV rays said that algae inside the coral produced a compound that could be synthetically re-created and given to humans to protect the skin. In 2016, a new beverage called UVO was touted by its inventors as drinkable sunscreen, but since then its marketing has pivoted to emphasizing overall positive effects on skin rather than specifically focusing on sun protection. No currently available product taken orally is FDA-approved as an alternative to sunscreen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/23/david-lynch-gotta-be-selfish-twin-peaks","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"David Lynch: ‘You gotta be selfish.

It's a terrible thing’","bodyText":"David Lynch seldom smiles in photographs. His etched Easter Island statue of a face doesn’t glower so much as brood; lips pursed and eyes hooded, he looks every inch the auteur in winter. The quiff completes the effect, its lush swirl seemingly frozen in place by alarming, Lynchian thoughts. In his 40 years of film-making, the director has taken audiences from sunlit American idylls to surreal dimensions populated by demons, doppelgangers and psychotic killers. His are scenes you can’t forget: the whimpering, deformed baby in Eraserhead, the severed ear in Blue Velvet, the blood-spattered, skull-crushing violence of Wild At Heart, the nuclear explosion in Twin Peaks: The Return. Google “David Lynch creepy”, and you get 5.5m results. Lynch works from a studio on a slope above one of three adjacent homes he owns in the Hollywood Hills, just a stone’s throw from Mulholland Drive. He is reclusive and seldom leaves this little realm, let alone grants audiences to journalists – but he is prepared to now, on the eve of publishing an unconventional memoir-cum-biography, Room To Dream. An assistant escorts me through the house (sleek concrete walls and surfaces, floor-to-ceiling shelves of VHS cassettes and CDs) and up through the garden to the studio. A snake slithered across the path earlier this morning, the assistant says. Lynch sits in a corner, hunched over a lithograph. The tabletop brims with paint pots, lotions, chemicals, gel formula cement, lithographic paper, pneumatic drills, cables, wires and paintbrushes. There is a mug of coffee, a pack of cigarettes. The director wears cracked, ancient boots, ragged chinos and the remnants of a black buttoned-up shirt that looks to have been shredded by a badger. It’s a scene that might be intimidating were it not for a great, largely untold secret: David Lynch is a cheery, congenial soul who rivals the Simpsons character Ned Flanders for howdy-doody niceness. “Hey, bud!” he greets the assistant, offering me a handshake and wide smile. He laughs, often, and yearns for peace on Earth. “I love my life and I’m a happy camper,” he says. “It would be nice if we were all able to fulfil our desires and live good, long, happy lives.” The studio is a bunker-like structure of concrete and glass that overlooks a panorama of trees, bougainvillea and villa rooftops. You can feel the morning sun and hear birdsong. “I like it up here, the trees,” Lynch says, speaking with the halting lilt of Gordon Cole, the FBI agent he plays in Twin Peaks (only without the deafness). “It’s a feeling I get in LA, a feeling of freedom. The light, and the way the buildings are not so tall. You can do what you want.” Would he like a coffee, his assistant asks? “Yeah, I’m about ready for a hot one, thank you.” There is no toilet up here, so to save trekking down to the house the boss pees into a sink built into the wall. “See that thing with the handle? It pulls out,” Lynch explains. “You can pee right in there. Then you run the faucet.” A large canvas standing in the middle of the studio, an unfinished work, depicts a tree with children. Closer scrutiny reveals that the boy standing at the base is holding a knife. A girl on the branch above is cowering. Another girl is dangling from a noose. Neither look like candidates for good, long, happy lives. You can find suffering and death anywhere if you look, Lynch says. The other day, a spider’s web next to his desk snagged a bee. The bee broke free, only to get snagged again. “The spider came out, started wrapping him, and pretty soon the spider had him wrapped completely. And I think bit him, too. Then he undoes the packaging and drugs him and drags him.” Lynch smiles at the memory. “Man, that is a violent thing.” LA is glorious, he says, “but you see things.” What Lynch sees, and then puts on screen for us to see, is one of the great enigmas of cinema, one that has launched a thousand film studies PhDs. When the director looks at a manicured lawn, his mind’s eye tunnels beneath it to hidden mystery, mysticism and depravity – visions he has turned into mind-bending television and film. It’s an oeuvre people tend to love or detest, and even devotees don’t claim to fully understand. With the exception of The Elephant Man (1980) and The Straight Story (1999), his films are oblique and non-linear. Who is the chipmunk-cheeked Lady in the Radiator who crushes sperm-like worms while singing to the father of the mutant baby in Eraserhead? How much of Mulholland Drive is real, or dreamed by Naomi Watts’ aspiring actor? And is the ending really the beginning? Lynch is the last man to provide any answers but now, at the age of 72, he has opened up – sort of – in his 577-page doorstopper of a book. Room To Dream declares itself at the outset to be a chronicle of events, not an explanation of their meaning. Chapters alternate between Lynch’s own recollections and those of his friends, relatives and collaborators, as told to his co-author Kristine McKenna. There is his boyhood in 1950s middle America, his early painting career, his four marriages – to Peggy Lentz, to Mary Fisk, to his longtime editor and producer Mary Sweeney, to the actor Emily Stofle – as well as his relationships with other women. What emerges is not so much Lynch, but two very distinct Lynches: the single-minded and reclusive visionary who is also a savvy media player; the hermit who very consciously nurtures his brand. He is at his most animated when discussing ideas. “They’re like fish. If you get an idea that’s thrilling to you, put your attention on it and these other fish will swim into it. It’s like a bait. They’ll hook on to it and you’ll get more ideas. And you just pull them in.” When he puts a story on screen, he does not think in term of beats or plot points. “No, it’s a feeling, more of an intuition. It’s the idea that you’ve fallen in love with, and you try to stay true to that. You see the way that cinema can say that idea, and it’s thrilling to you.” He is not about to make a big-screen film any time soon: while he loves the superior sound and picture quality of cinema, Lynch thinks theatrical releases have become too short. “I would not make a feature film in today’s world because the kind of films I make couldn’t be on the big screen for very long.” Better, then, to make shows for television, a medium that is more comfortable with loose ends and narrative culs-de-sac, where he can tell a “continuing story”. There is a theory that Lynch himself doesn’t always know what is going on in his stories. He shoots this down. “I need to know for myself what things mean and what’s going on. Sometimes I get ideas, and I don’t know exactly what they mean. So I think about it, and try to figure it out, so I have an answer for myself.” Audiences, however, must do their own figuring out. “I don’t ever explain it. Because it’s not a word thing. It would reduce it, make it smaller.” These days he rarely gives interviews, not even during the hugely hyped return of Twin Peaks last year – a show that is still debated as either the best or worst TV of 2017. “When you finish anything, people want you to then talk about it. And I think it’s almost like a crime,” he explains. “A film or a painting – each thing is its own sort of language and it’s not right to try to say the same thing in words. The words are not there. The language of film, cinema, is the language it was put into, and the English language – it’s not going to translate. It’s going to lose.” Lynch takes a cigarette, lights up and inspects his work table, perhaps wishing he could express himself with the gel formula cement rather than these slippery, inadequate words. A film or TV show is like a magic act, he continues, “and magicians don’t tell how they did a thing”. He hates the idea of behind-the-scenes footage or making-of films about special effects. “People do it for sales, for money. But the film is the thing and should be protected.” So no guidance on Twin Peaks: The Return’s finale, which fleetingly resolved some storylines only to fracture them and create new puzzles? Even diehard fans yearned for clarity. Lynch smiles. “No way.” He does, however, squash the theory, much loved by some Peakers, that the last two parts of the 18-hour series should be watched simultaneously on two screens, with dialogue overlapping. “Yeah, I heard that. It’s bullshit. See, it’s beautiful that someone came up with this. You could double-expose scenes in lots of films and it could conjure some fantastic thing.” I heard plenty of other theories at Twin Peaks: The Return’s gala premiere last year, a glitzy affair in downtown Los Angeles where the guests drank cocktails and wore tuxedos and gowns. Lynch and his co-creator, Mark Frost, had such tight control over the script and the edit that the audience had no idea what to expect – not even the Showtime studio executives who had paid for the entire series. Tight smiles masked a collective thought: please God, don’t let it suck. Lynch made a gnomic speech about trees, then the curtains parted and the first two hours rolled, reuniting Agent Cooper, the Log Lady, Laura Palmer and other characters last seen in 1991. Kyle MacLachlan’s Dale Cooper was still trapped in an extra-dimensional Black Lodge, amid an even stranger universe; a school principal was arrested on suspicion of beheading a librarian; a young couple were violently killed by a ghostly entity which sprang from a glass box. There was also a talking tree. When it ended there was a hush, followed by thunderous applause. The most popular adjective at the after-party was “mind-blowing”. Nobody understood the plot or seemed to like the characters, but it didn’t matter: Lynch was a genius. I found one heretic, a Dutch journalist, who confessed he had been bored. Other guests bristled: could he not see the brilliance? The Dutchman filed a negative review but his editors ran a different one, proclaiming a television milestone. The Lynch train was rolling. As Twin Peaks: The Return progressed, even fans acknowledged there was a kind of masochism to watching it – witness a two-and-a-half-minute scene in which a man does nothing except sweep a floor. When Cooper finally escapes the Black Lodge back into the real world, the FBI agent is reborn as a dullard insurance salesman – a character so slow and monosyllabic it is sometimes physically painful to watch his scenes opposite onscreen wife Naomi Watts. “This withholding of pleasure is Twin Peaks’ new secret weapon, and it works,” wrote the Guardian’s Stuart Heritage. Others disagreed, the Hollywood Reporter branding the reboot a “self-indulgent, pointless, meaningless… exercise in misplaced nostalgia and auteur idol-worship”. When I ask Lynch if this kind of thing stings, he says he tends not to read reviews. “The good ones aren’t good enough, and the bad ones will depress you.” Nor does he see much other TV or cinema. When I ask what he likes to watch, Lynch says crime shows and car shows, but declines to elaborate. His favourite film of the past year? He goes silent and scrunches his face, thinking, thinking, thinking. The silence stretches. He puffs on the cigarette. Later I check the tape. Not a word for 46 seconds. “Um,” he finally says. “I saw my son Austin’s movie [Gray House, a documentary] last year and I really liked it. I don’t think I’ve seen any other films.” He must have seen some. The Shape Of Water? “No.” Dunkirk? “No.” Black Panther? “No.” Does he have any curiosity about them? “Not really. I never was a movie buff. I like to make movies. I like to work. I don’t really like to go out.” But these days you can watch them at home. “Uh-huh.” In Room To Dream, Lynch says he used to be angry and thought this gave his work an edge. Then he took up transcendental meditation (TM), lost the anger and gained better focus. He has evangelised about TM ever since, dedicating his book to the late Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi “and the world family”. Sceptics take note: this highly caffeinated, pack-a-day smoker is possibly the least jittery person in Hollywood. He also believes in reincarnation, which keeps him Zen about growing old and losing friends and colleagues, including Twin Peaks: The Return collaborators Harry Dean Stanton, Miguel Ferrer and Catherine Coulson (the Log Lady), all of whom have died since filming. “Life is a short trip but always continuing,” he says, tapping ash. “We’ll all meet again. In enlightenment you realise what you truly are and go into immortality. You don’t ever have to die after that.” Politically, meanwhile, Lynch is all over the map. He voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary and thinks – he’s not sure – he voted Libertarian in the presidential election. “I am not really a political person, but I really like the freedom to do what you want to do,” says the persecuted Californian smoker. He is undecided about Donald Trump. “He could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the thing so much. No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.” While Trump may not be doing a good job himself, Lynch thinks, he is opening up a space where other outsiders might. “Our so-called leaders can’t take the country forward, can’t get anything done. Like children, they are. Trump has shown all this.” Room To Dream contains no Rosebud revelation, no key to unlock Lynch, though it does offer clues in his childhood. A happy boy, he grew up in a loving extended family and made friends easily. They biked, hiked, built backyard forts. His mother, an English language tutor, would not give him colouring books in case they restricted his imagination. With his father, an agriculture research scientist, he inspected diseased and decaying trees; they also hunted deer, skinning and eating them. Lynch recounts a memory of flies crawling on a porcupine they shot. There is another striking scene from childhood. One night, Lynch writes, he encountered a beautiful naked woman walking down the street, bruised and traumatised. “It was so incredible. It seemed to me that her skin was the colour of milk, and she had a bloodied mouth.” He was too young or too transfixed to find out who she was before she vanished. After art school, Lynch hustled for years to make Eraserhead, widely believed to be a response to the birth of his first child, Jennifer, who had club feet. Cineasts still debate what the onscreen infant was made of: skinned rabbit, lamb foetus? But when I ask Lynch he bats it away. “I don’t talk about the baby.” Eraserhead landed Lynch a job directing The Elephant Man. His attempt to personally mould and apply John Hurt’s makeup failed, forcing him to hire a specialist and triggering an extraordinary bout of self-reproach. “I thought it would be better to kill myself because I could hardly stand to be in my body,” he writes. He recovered only to clash with Hurt’s co-star, Anthony Hopkins, who deemed the young American out of his depth and tried to get him fired. Mel Brooks, who produced the film, recalls an angry phone call from Hopkins but not an explicit demand to fire Lynch. In any case, he defended his director and shepherded The Elephant Man to eight Oscar nominations in 1980. Brooks remains a fan, telling Lynch’s co-author: “He’s all screwed up, too, of course, and he projects his own emotional and sexual turmoil into his work and assaults us with the feelings he’s being assaulted by.” One of the great puzzles about Lynch is his relationship with women. He writes strong female leads, and has worked for years with many of the same actors (Naomi Watts, Laura Dern, Sheryl Lee) yet the frequent onscreen violence has led to accusations of misogyny. Offscreen, he can be brutal when it comes to the end of a relationship. In Room To Dream, Isabella Rossellini that Lynch laughed while shooting her rape scene with Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, and “I still don’t know why.” Rossellini went on to have an affair with the director, a relationship that ended his marriage to Mary Fisk. “My heart was truly broken, and I was walking around like a lost person with blood dripping from every pore,” Fisk tells McKenna. She has since forgiven him. It was Rossellini’s turn four years later, around the time Lynch was directing her in Wild At Heart. “David has this incredible sweetness but [he] completely cut me out of his life,” she recalls. “I didn’t see it coming.” Devastated, she wondered if it was because she did not meditate, before realising he had fallen in love with his editor Mary Sweeney, who became Lynch’s third wife. The marriage lasted a matter of months. Throughout the book, and in his own telling, it is clear that Lynch’s most enduring passion is work. When his current wife, Emily Stofle, an actor who appeared in Inland Empire and Twin Peaks: The Return, became pregnant, he warned her that film would still come first. Their daughter was born when Lynch was 66, and Stofle 35. “After I had Lula, he disappeared into his work, which is what he does… he works and that’s where he gets his joy,” she tells McKenna. I ask Lynch how he manages to inspire such loyalty, despite such strict rationing of human contact – from his collaborators, friends, even his exes. He drops his cigarette on the floor and stubs it out with a boot before answering. “I like to have some people around. If I was totally alone I think I’d get funny, and not in a humorous way.” As a father and husband he has often been absent, he concedes. “You gotta be selfish. And it’s a terrible thing. I never really wanted to get married, never really wanted to have children. One thing leads to another and there it is.” That sounds like regret, until he elaborates. “I did what I had to do. There could have been more work done. There are always so many interruptions.” • Room To Dream, by David Lynch and Kristine McKenna, is published by Canongate Books at £25.

Do not read unless you have watched season two, episode nine. Another week, another emotional wallop. This penultimate episode to Westworld’s second season carried a real punch, hitting the Man In Black straight in the gut (twice) and leaving Teddy on the floor. The fight to reach the Valley Beyond is on, but who will be left standing at the final count? First to the Man In Black. That’s the name by which we know him inside the park but, outside, this character has always been William. Thanks to the way the first season was mapped out, we watched William’s youth in parallel with the adventures of the more grizzled Man In Black. We got to know these conflicting aspects of his personality, but never quite saw how they came together. This week, the tension between William’s two lives is finally brought into focus, and with doubly tragic consequences. The first catastrophe we are already aware of; the suicide of William’s wife, Juliet, a year before current events. We meet Juliet properly for the first time this week. She is drunk at a glamorous event celebrating William’s philanthropy and we are led to understand this is a common occurrence. Juliet’s alcoholism is so severe that she refuses rehabilitation. We watch her switch from rowing with William to pleading with him when she senses that her evening’s entertainment might come to an end. Emily, the couple’s daughter, watches all of this. She is fed up with her mother and wants her committed to an institution, even if it is against her will. Over the course of this episode the events of the night are told and retold. We see William encounter Ford at the party, with the dodgy old codger passing William his personal Westworld file. We see Juliet lash out at William, calling him an accomplished liar and a virus that has eaten up her family. William then takes his sozzled spouse to bed, tucks her in, hides his file between the pages of a book and confesses. As he stands over Juliet in their bedroom, fulfilling the duties of a good husband, he admits that, yes, there is something he is hiding and that it is not good. William belongs to another world, he tells Juliet, and that world is Westworld. He thinks Juliet is asleep while he talks. But she isn’t. When William heads downstairs, Juliet gets up, retrieves the file from its hiding place and loads it on to her computer. Contained within are edited highlights of the Man in Black’s very worst deeds. The next time William and Emily see Juliet, she is sitting in an overflowing bath, dead from an overdose. The second tragedy follows on from the first. A year after her mother’s death, Emily has been hunting down her father in the park and, most recently, saving his life. She knows about his obsession and she wants to find out more. She also, ultimately, wants to know why her mother did what she did. Unfortunately for Emily, her father doesn’t believe any of it. He is convinced she is a host, created by Ford to mess with his mind. We have heard the line before and perhaps had thought he had got over it. But he had not. When Delos types arrive to take the Man in Black off the park and give him medical treatment, he shoots them dead. They were proof that Emily was going to turn him in, he says. Emily insists no; she is real and she can prove it. She goes for her pocket to pull out her father’s file (saved for her by her mother in her final act). Her father – addled by his paranoia and his many years in the park – knows only one response to such a movement. He beats his daughter to the draw and shoots her dead. ‘This thing inside me’ As the truth of what he has done dawns on the Man in Black, he contemplates suicide. He decides against it, choosing instead to fight against himself, “this thing inside me”. He cuts at his forearm, like Bernard does when he wants to access his system. At the same time, elsewhere in the park, Teddy puts a pistol against his temples and blows his control unit right out. He does so in front of his lover Dolores, the woman he swore to protect till the day he died. But that day has come; he is not fit for the Valley Beyond, as Dolores always said, and now he must leave. Teddy’s death is the mirror image of the scene a few episodes ago when Dolores told Teddy how much she meant to him, and then forcibly rewired his settings. That left Teddy as the meanest marksman in Westworld, but the change came at a cost. Deep down Teddy knew this was not who he truly was. Despite it all, he still had a conscience. He could never fully subscribe to Dolores’s plan to burn everything to the ground. In his final speech he spins that sentiment into one last statement of fidelity towards Dolores; he had to die before he let her down. So Teddy pulls the trigger and falls to the ground. But then so does Dolores. This ruthless killer, the one known as Wyatt or “Deathbringer” loved Teddy too. Her feelings for him endured, again despite her programming. When she fails, a soundtrack of white noise blares around her. Her face contorts, her mind unable to process what is happening to her. She is malfunctioning, on the verge of a breakdown. These two plotlines alone make for the most suspenseful episode of the entire run, in my book (and, following on from Akecheta’s story last week, quite the late season improvement). But there’s more. Bernard faces down Ford, not only the man who created him but someone currently camping out in his brain. He does so to save himself from killing Elsie. With Ford whispering to Bernard that Elsie will betray him at any moment, Bernard is supposed to do what he has done before, and become Ford’s silent killer. Instead Bernard manages to jack an iPad into his veins and, with just enough time, he deletes Ford’s malignant, codified self from his operating software. (Write it that way and it kind of takes the drama out, but it worked on screen). Finally, among our protagonists, there’s Maeve. She’s shot up in the medical bays of La Mesa and the Delos surgeons are losing interest in keeping her alive. This is mainly because they have worked out how she was controlling fellow hosts and have been able to copy the method. Clementine has now been programmed to do something very similar; she can now make hosts attack each other to the point of destruction. Now that such a weapon is available to Delos, Charlotte Hale says, Maeve can be left to die. What Delos don’t know, however, is that disembodied Ford left Bernard’s head for a minute and paid Maeve a visit. As well as revealing that she was always his favourite host, he also uses the occasion to unlock Maeve’s core permissions, which may yet give her one last shot at saving herself. Notes from the prairie Charlotte Hale really is ending up the big baddie of this second season. I’m sure I remember her as being corporate but likeable early on. Not any more, that’s for sure. A lot of talk of “is this real?” and “is this a dream?” this week. A bit hammy perhaps, but the lines between the experience of humans and hosts; what makes one and what the other; indeed, if there’s really much difference at all, have been bleeding together quite well of late. The MiB’s arm gouging is the latest example – is he self-harming or attacking the hardware? Or is that the same thing? So the Valley Beyond is also the Forge, and it is also the MiB’s secret hidden project. In a twist that many viewers had been expecting, the project is all about digitising human minds so they can live on forever in the form of hosts. Emily is a bit boggled by the process; how did they manage to scan every working of an individual brain? “It was built in,” says the MiB. Emily looks, puzzled, at her hat. Questions What do we want from the finale? Who will make it to the Valley Beyond? Will someone explain to us where Hector went to? One final thing: I will be speaking with Westworld creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan for an interview to coincide with next week’s final episode. So do share your questions and I will attempt to ask as many as I can."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/18/thomas-hitzlsperger-germany-mexico-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T15:52:00Z","webTitle":"Joachim Löw faces biggest test but is unlikely to tinker with tactics | Thomas Hitzlsperger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/18/thomas-hitzlsperger-germany-mexico-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/18/thomas-hitzlsperger-germany-mexico-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Joachim Löw faces biggest test but is unlikely to tinker with tactics","bodyText":"Make no mistake, Joachim Löw is facing his biggest test as Germany’s manager since taking the role 12 years ago. The defeat to Mexico was not only a surprise but also a big concern for a team who are not used to losing games at tournaments, certainly not at the very start. Germans are now waiting to see how Löw reacts before Saturday’s must-win game against Sweden. Germany were outfought and outthought by Mexico. Physically they did not look 100% and simply could not cope with the approach of Juan Carlos Osorio’s side tactically. Mexico were perfect in that regard – they knew Germany like to play with high full-backs so decided to press high-up, targeting Toni Kroos in particular, as well as the two centre-backs, Mats Hummels and Jérôme Boateng. They man-marked Hummels at times to ensure he could not build play from the back, which led to Boateng, who was largely left alone, being the man who tried to get Germany going, but he does not have Hummels’ passing range or accuracy. So Germany lost the ball often and when they did, Mexico went for the kill. They scored once and should have scored more. It was alarming to see Germany exposed time and time again and, ahead of the Sweden game, it’s fascinating to wonder if Löw decides what went wrong in Moscow was more to do with personnel than tactics, that his players let him down rather than the other way around. It’s hard to say for sure but, personally, I expect him to make one or two changes to his lineup while doing little to a way of playing that has proved hugely successful. Germany have reached at least the semi-final of the five major tournament they have contested under Löw and, four years ago, were crowned world champions. Sweden are unlikely to take on Germany in the way Mexico did.They don’t favour to press so high up the pitch and instead are more likely to sit back and aim to counterattack. So Germany will have a lot of possession and will have to make sure they are careful with it. Having watched Germany’s two friendlies before the World Cup, in which they underperformed, there was a sense of complacency. Equally, however, I expected them to go into the tournament fully focused and in ideal shape. After all, this is what Germany tend to do but that has proven not to be the case this time. There was a lot of noise around the team in preparation for the World Cup, with some of that focusing on the photo Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan took with the Turkey president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It became, and remained, a huge talking point in Germany. However, it had little to do with the defeat to Mexico and, in that regard, the players need to take their share of responsibility for what happened, and having proven themselves in the past, they now need to prove themselves again in what is a dangerous, uncomfortable and unusual situation for Germany - on the back foot having lost their first match at a World Cup. The tournament has been interesting. The obvious highlight was Spain’s match against Portugal, which proved to be fantastic entertainment, while from a neutral’s point of view, our game against Mexico was also a great watch, especially Mexico’s approach to it from a tactical point of view. Most of the other big teams have, like Germany, struggled for performances and the overall quality level has not been great, certainly not compared with what we are used to seeing in the Champions League. That should improve as the tournament goes on, as hopefully will Germany. They certainly need to if they plan on continuing at this World Cup and going on to retain the title they won in Brazil. Looking ahead, one problem we may have in regards to that ambition is our options in attack. Germany are not so strong there, certainly compared with the other big teams. For many years, Germany focused on the development of technically gifted players, which led Löw to sometimes play with no striker, or on occasion a false No 9, like Spain did for a while. Overall, however, there is no doubting the quality of Germany’s squad, nor their experience. It is now time for manager, staff and players to come together and react in the right way to a big setback. The game against Sweden is a big test and one Germany simply must pass."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/19/oscar-tabarez-illness-uruguay-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T12:18:53Z","webTitle":"Óscar Tabárez: unbowed by illness and adding beauty to Uruguay’s grit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/19/oscar-tabarez-illness-uruguay-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/19/oscar-tabarez-illness-uruguay-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Óscar Tabárez: unbowed by illness and adding beauty to Uruguay’s grit","bodyText":"The head cocked to one side, the patient expression, the pause while an answer is considered: in some ways this is the same Óscar Tabárez he has always been. His answers in press conferences still ring with intelligence and clarity. He is still the impeccably dressed police chief he always was, a man who somehow includes on his CV both being a primary school teacher and holding a raging Gabriel Batistuta back by the nipple during a riot in Santiago while bleeding from a wound to the cheek and all without it seeming remotely surprising. But Tabárez is older now. The hair is not quite so steely, and thinning so his parting is not as rigid as it once was. And then there is what he describes as “a chronic neuropathy” which means he walks with at least a stick and sometimes with crutches or even, as at the Copa América Centenario two years ago, gets about using an electric cart. He has consistently refused to talk about it in any detail, repeating only that it does not impinge on his work with the players. That work has come to seem increasingly extraordinary. When Tabárez was first appointed Uruguay manager in 1988 it was with a specific brief to improve the image of the national side after the disgrace of 1986 in which a brutal approach had reached its apogee with the red card shown to José Batista against Scotland after 56 seconds. Progress to the last 16 in 1990 just about achieved that, and Tabárez, reputation enhanced, moved to Boca Juniors and that apocalyptic Copa Libertadores semi-final against the Chilean champions Colo Colo in 1991. The battle raged for 17 minutes, with players, coaches, fans, journalists and police involved. Tabárez sustained two cuts from the lens of a camera swung into his face, the violence coming to an end only when a police dog called Ron bit the Boca keeper Navarro “el Mono” [the Monkey] Montoya and left him with a bloody wound to his thigh. Ron, “the dog who bit a monkey”, became a national hero while Boca, having lost 3-2 on aggregate, returned home in disgrace and were fined 98m pesos. Tabárez’s role was characteristic. He was outraged but defended his players to the hilt – a contradiction that flared again after Luis Suárez was banned for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the last World Cup and he railed weirdly against an English media conspiracy. His sense of integrity is clear but there are times when it must wrestle with his sense of loyalty. There was a league title with Boca, to add to the Libertadores he had won with Peñarol in 1987, but the 90s were largely a period of drift: two spells with Cagliari, a short time with Milan, a season at Oviedo and a return to Argentina with Vélez Sarsfield and Boca again. For four years after that Tabárez did not work. Perhaps he would not have come back but when Uruguay lost to Australia in a qualifying play-off for 2006, it became clear that his country needed him. This was the ultimate job: not merely to qualify for a tournament or challenge for honours but also to transform his nation’s football. For 12 years Tabárez has overseen everything, from youth development to the senior side. He led his side to the semi-final of the 2010 World Cup and then to Copa América success a year later. Uruguay have not missed a tournament in his reign. And slowly he has begun to transform Uruguayan football. The central midfield that lined up against Egypt in their opening game, Rodrigo Bentancur and Matías Vecino, would have been unthinkable a decade ago: both are modern, passing, progressive players, the result of the systems Tabárez, now 71, has put in place. They are expected to feature against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, too. And yet there is still a hardness to Uruguay – “la garra charrua” of national myth. As a recent editorial in the Montevideo newspaper El País put it, Uruguayans cling to the idea of a hero who is “more warrior than technician, more gutsy then elegant”. On the wall of his house in Montevideo Tabárez has printed a line attributed to Che Guevara: “You must toughen yourself without losing tenderness.” The Tabárez revolution still believes in winning, still believes in grit and determination and doing what it takes; he just believes it is more efficient to do that by passing than spoiling. This Uruguay still has its flinty core, its Godín, its Giménez, its Cáceres. But it now has more than that. Gerardo Caetano and Ricardo Piñeyrúa, in their book on Uruguay at World Cups, argue that the Maracanazo, when Uruguay beat Brazil to win the 1950 tournament in Rio de Janeiro, has been misinterpreted, portrayed as a victory over courage not ability, when actually it was about both. Their book includes a lengthy interview with Tabárez in which he discusses talking in the late 80s with veterans of that triumph and becoming convinced of the necessity of shifting the balance from warrior to technician. To do that takes time and faith and must be achieved without losing sight of Uruguayan football’s defining features. What happens to them in this tournament is only part of a much wider process but Tabárez, if he succeeds, will have achieved the opposite of the Guevara quote and made the game in his homeland more tender without losing its toughness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/18/nhs-billions-armed-forces-weapons-systems-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T15:04:08Z","webTitle":"As the NHS suffers, billions are wasted on the armed forces | Richard Norton-Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/18/nhs-billions-armed-forces-weapons-systems-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/18/nhs-billions-armed-forces-weapons-systems-uk","fields":{"headline":"As the NHS suffers, billions are wasted on the armed forces","bodyText":"While the NHS is desperately short of funds – and will remain so for many years, despite Theresa May’s latest promises – while there is a shortage of decent housing, while cuts are threatening access to justice, and public transport is deprived of much-needed investment, billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money are being wasted on projects that are untouchable, seemingly immune from rational debate. Chiefs of the armed forces, the navy in particular, have been shamelessly indulged by successive governments. Not with equipment they actually need – as Iraq and Afghanistan so clearly demonstrated – but with the most expensive weapons systems, which will either never be used or are irrelevant in dealing with current and future threats, as well as being increasingly vulnerable to attack. This year alone, the Ministry of Defence will spend more than £5bn on nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered submarines. The MoD does not dispute estimates that Britain’s Trident nuclear missile programme, with a fleet of four new Dreadnought submarines, will cost more than £200bn over 30 years (including the ever-increasing cost of decommissioning nuclear reactors and warheads and protecting one of the world’s largest radioactive waste dumps in the Lake District). Meanwhile, the flight decks of the two largest ships to be built for the navy – the aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, which cost over £6bn, significantly more than the original forecast of £3.9bn – will remain largely empty of the American F35 fighter jets due to fly from them. The MoD has agreed to buy just 48 of these planes for the RAF and navy, at a cost of more than £90m each. Serious questions remain about their weight, how far they can fly with their weapons before having to refuel, and the vulnerability of their software to cyber attack. The 48 aircraft are estimated to cost £13bn over the next 30 years. No defence minister or official is prepared to say whether the rest of the 138 fighters the RAF and navy originally wanted to buy will be forthcoming. In a devastating report published today, the Commons defence committee said the MoD’s refusal to disclose the full cost estimates for the F35 programme was “unacceptable and risks undermining public confidence” in the programme. The cross-party committee warns that the navy is so short of ships that it is unlikely to be able to support the carriers with the two destroyers, two frigates, an Astute nuclear-powered submarine, and other vessels needed to protect them. “Operating aircraft carriers without the sovereign capability to protect them is complacent at best and potentially dangerous at worst,” it says. Independent analysts warn that the carriers will be increasingly vulnerable to Russian and Chinese “hypersonic” missiles, which are also being developed by other potentially hostile countries. While taxpayers are funding a nuclear weapons system that is not a realistically credible deterrent – and certainly not a usable one – and large ships more useful for flag-waving diplomatic or trade missions than protecting British security, the defence committee reports that ships are being kept in port when they should be on patrol, the RAF’s flying hours are being reduced, and cuts are being imposed on training and exercises across all three branches of the armed forces. Meanwhile, the MoD also faces a shortfall of £8.5bn in its housing budget. In a joint letter to Theresa May, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, Julian Lewis, and the Labour chair of the Commons public accounts committee, Meg Hillier, recently pointed to what Britain’s armed forces really needed, including skilled personnel and decent homes. “The existing affordability gap affecting traditional defence equipment and support programmes, combined with the intensification of new threats such as cyber, chemical and biological attacks, risk undermining UK national security as well as our ability to play an effective role in the world,” they warned. They pointed to an “extremely worrying decline in morale” reflected in surveys of military personnel. The army in particular is facing a serious shortage of recruits. New ships, planes, missiles, nuclear weapons and submarines and other weapons that the MoD wants to buy over the next 10 years will cost between £4.9bn and £20.8bn more than its existing £180bn equipment budget. “The equipment plan is not affordable,” is the stark conclusion of the National Audit Office, parliament’s independent financial watchdog, which also points to a worrying shortage of skilled personnel available to provide essential tasks throughout the armed forces. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, grabs every opportunity to indulge in aggressive rhetoric aimed in particular at Russia but more generally at any conceivable putative threat to Britain’s national security from anywhere, including North Korea. But while the NHS and other public services struggle to protect the real needs of the British population, his ministry is allowed to get away with scandalous profligacy. • Richard Norton-Taylor writes for the Guardian on defence and security"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/18/fixed-odds-betting-delay-unacceptable","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T16:30:53Z","webTitle":"Fixed-odds betting delay unacceptable | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/fixed-odds-betting-delay-unacceptable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/fixed-odds-betting-delay-unacceptable","fields":{"headline":"Fixed-odds betting delay unacceptable","bodyText":"We applaud the announcement that there will be a stake reduction of highly addictive fixed-odds betting terminals from £100 a spin to £2. The ability of players, including the most vulnerable in society, to place bets of up to £100 every 20 seconds is a matter of the deepest concern for responsible society. It is of particular concern to faith communities, from which we come, as it is often left to places of worship and faith groups to pick up the pieces when individuals become addicted. It is now reported that a deal between bookmakers and the Treasury will delay implementation to two years, instead of the eight weeks which is required to change the stake (Treasury under fire over delay on fixed-odds betting curbs, 16 June). If these reports are accurate, society and the Gambling Commission must call government to account on behalf of the vulnerable. The higher stake brings in more than £2bn a year for bookmakers, primarily from areas of social deprivation. We cannot allow tax revenues and bookmakers’ profits to be placed before the daily misery caused by these pernicious machines on the high street. Every day of delay means a further day of exploitation of the vulnerable. We all have a responsibility to ensure that action is taken as swiftly as possible.

The European council of EU leaders “supports the development of the concept of regional disembarkation platforms”, according to the draft conclusions of an EU summit due to take place next week. The EU wants to look at the feasibility of setting up such centres in north Africa, where most migrant journeys to Europe begin. “Such platforms should provide for rapid processing to distinguish between economic migrants and those in need of international protection, and reduce the incentive to embark on perilous journeys,” says the document seen by the Guardian. Although the plan is winning influential support, it faces political and practical hurdles, with one expert saying it is not clear how the EU would get foreign countries to agree to be “vassal states”. Migration is high on the agenda of the two-day summit, which opens on 28 June. EU leaders will attempt to reach a consensus on how to manage the thousands of refugees and migrants arriving each month. The German and French leaders, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, met near Berlin on Tuesday to agree on a common approach, amid fears in their camps that the European project is unravelling. Before the meeting France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe was “in a process of disintegration. We see states that are turning inward, trying to find national solutions to problems that require European solutions.” He called for “a new European project” on immigration, as well as economic and financial issues, “to consolidate Europe in a world where you have the United States on one side, China on the other and we are trapped in the middle”. At the end of the meeting, which was dominated by eurozone reform, Macron said the EU would “work with countries of origin and transit” to cut off illegal people-smuggling routes, and build “solidarity mechanisms, both externally and internally”. The EU border and coastguard agency Frontex would be expanded to become “a true European border police”. Merkel is under pressure from her hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, to come up with a European plan by the end of the month. Germany continues to receive more applications for asylum than any other EU member state. Seehofer wants German border guards to start turning people away if there is no EU-wide progress. It was not immediately clear how the EU document’s proposal for “regional disembarkation platforms” would work, or where they might be set up. Elizabeth Collett, the director of the Migration Policy Institute in Brussels, said it was a “watered-down version” of Austrian-Danish proposals that had called for arrivals in Europe to be sent back to their point of departure to have their claims processed. “What has clearly changed is the level of political backing for this,” she said. The plan prompted questions about how it would work and the cost involved, she said. “It looks great on paper, but can you get countries to sign up from outside Europe and basically be vassal states?” The other big problem was ensuring the centres met EU standards, she said. “The conditions, the processing, all of the things that require a high degree of knowledge and are quite hard to manage within the EU, these are big questions.” The plan, however, appears to be helping unite EU countries that are deeply divided on migration. Italy and France support the idea of asylum centres outside EU territory, an idea that helped defuse diplomatic tensions after the two countries clashed when the new populist government in Rome refused to allow the docking of a ship carrying 630 migrants. Macron, who has previously raised the idea, proposed it when he met the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, last week. The EU struck a deal with Turkey in 2016 that drastically reduced migrant flows, but the bloc has found it harder to work with north African governments, especially Libya, from where most sea crossings begin. The European commission has rejected a Turkey-style deal with Libya because of instability in the country. But Italy’s previous government struck deals with Libyan militia and tribes and helped relaunch the Libyan coastguard. These actions contributed to a sharp reduction in the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean, but critics reported an increase in human rights violations. According to the draft document, the EU would like to set up the centres in collaboration with the UN refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration, a UN-related body that has previously criticised the paucity of legal routes for African migrants to travel to Europe. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU migration commissioner, is expected to spell out details of the disembarkation centres later this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/jun/26/good-to-meet-you-nancy-longatan","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T10:59:14Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

I think I’ll stick to being lazy","bodyText":"My problem, if I could be said to have any at all, is that I’m simply too humble to do yoga. I’m too selfless for meditation; too modest for any kind of spiritual practice. I suppose if I was absolutely pushed – and, really, who would try to push anyone as evidently grounded as me – I would say that I am too self-effacing to try any kind of regular “practice” at all. In news that will shake goat shacks, hatha studios and rush matting salespeople across the land, a study published by the University of Southampton has found that neither yoga nor meditation “quiet” the ego; but instead boost self-enhancement. By “self-enhancement” they mean a self-centrality that encourages you to rate yourself highly in comparison to others. Sure, it’s just one study, following around 250 people, but hey, this is science. Science says yoga makes you smug. So put that up your kundalini and see how it transcends. In truth, the reasons I don’t do yoga are manifold: my living space is so small that any attempt at a pose more ambitious than the tree will inevitably end with me crashing into my child’s toys; I have all the self-discipline of a labrador and am therefore unlikely to ever achieve much at home under my own bending steam; when given the choice between spending £14 on a post-natal yoga class in London or spending £14 on the ability to actually travel around London on public transport, I will always choose the latter. So it is with a certain unattractive, unforgivable smugness of my own that I read how, in this study, students interviewed within an hour of a yoga class scored highly in an inventory of narcissistic tendencies and described themselves as more enhanced than the average student. Isn’t that just a peach for lazy cynics like myself? Isn’t it just glorious to be told that all that slow-smiling, soft-voiced, slightly bended-knee, chiming, chanting, sesame-oiled and gently lit activity really is the stuff of self-indulgence and big-headedness? Doesn’t it just take the pressure off for a moment to be told that self-improvement and spiritual hunger makes you an insufferable arse? Of course what we’re talking about here are western yoga courses undertaken by western students. If practised daily, under the supervision of a dedicated and enlightened teacher, with corresponding and concurrent study, and a genuine desire to relinquish human conceit, I have no doubt that yoga and meditation can “quiet” the ego. Sadly, in Britain, examples of that kind of practice number relatively few compared with the heaving ranks of wellness-touting narcissists keen to use a bit of cod-spirituality as yet another excuse for rank self-indulgence. You know who I mean: the image-obsessed neo-hippies keen to purchase, pose and Instagram their way to paper-thin self-esteem, shored up on all sides by the kind of cynical marketing that somehow turns neurosis into commodity. I don’t really believe that yoga or meditation make you an arrogant, self-congratulatory twat – quite the opposite, in fact. But I would venture to say that when an arrogant, self-congratulatory twat is given a full-length mirror, a language of “self care”, and a questionnaire about their own apparent superiority, unpleasant things may start to occur. Not least in their choice of Lycra. • Nell Frizzell is a freelance journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/20/royal-ascot-2018-day-two-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T17:22:12Z","webTitle":"Royal Ascot 2018: Poet's Word beats Cracksman in Prince of Wales's Stakes – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/20/royal-ascot-2018-day-two-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/20/royal-ascot-2018-day-two-live","fields":{"headline":"Royal Ascot 2018: Poet's Word beats Cracksman in Prince of Wales's Stakes – as it happened","bodyText":"So if day one of Royal Ascot 2018 was all about Frankie Dettori, then day two definitely belonged to Sir Michael Stoute. His two winners on Wednesday ensured he passed Sir Henry Cecil’s record as the most successful trainer of all time at the meeting. His fellow Newmarket trainer, who died in 2013, was a close friend and there was a poignant moment in the winner’s enclosure when he discussed Cecil’s qualities and talked about the fact that his rival had racked up his record back in the days when Royal Ascot was only a four-day meeting. Stoute is normally media shy, certainly on racedays when he does his level best to avoid interviews, but he has never looked more relaxed than this afternoon at the track. Ebullient is normally not an adjective one would attach to Stoute but he was positively beaming, and his delight was doubled when Expert Eye romped home in the last race, the Jersey Stakes. That victory, with a horse of undoubted ability but one who appeared to have lost his way when down the field in the 2,000 Guineas, would have given him enormous pleasure. He is a masterfully patient trainer and there has been no better handler of older horses in this generation. Join us tomorrow for the big betting race of the meeting, the Gold Cup. Here you can watch Henry Cecil’s Le Moss, one of the great trainer’s 75 Royal Ascot winners, victorious in 1980 just to get you in the mood. 1 Expert Eye (J McDonald) 8-1 2 Society Power (J Spencer) 8-1 3 Could It Be Love (R Moore) 11-2 And they’re off ... James Garfield out slow and Lake Volta out fast with Could It Be Love, who leads ... Emaraaty is in fifth ... Headway making headway ...

Another victory for Sir Michael Stoute. 9-2 Could It Be Love 5-1 Emaraaty 15-2 Society Power 10-1 Headway Full betting here Here is another prize waiting to be picked up by the Gosden / Dettori combination, represented by Purser. He idled in front when landing a Listed contest under Rab Havlin last time and ought to be well suited by this stiff seven furlongs.

It hardly ever pays to be adamant about these things but yesterday’s Coventry Stakes and last month’s Victoria Cup suggested that those drawn low, towards the far side, have an advantage over the rest, though of course that advantaged can be wiped out, depending on where most jockeys decide to go when the stalls open. My fancy, at least, has a low draw in three. Mick Halford won this race two years ago with a Godolphin-owned four-year-old, carrying a penalty for a recent success at The Curragh, and could turn the trick again with Saltonstall. He was a pleasing winner of a competitive handicap last month on the driest surface he had yet encountered and a 5lb penalty leaves him leniently treated. Sir Michael Stoute became the winning-most trainer in Royal Ascot history when Poet’s Word claimed victory in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes. The Newmarket great is now out on his own with 76 triumphs at the Royal fixture – one ahead of the late Sir Henry Cecil – after the 11-2 chance defeated hot favourite Cracksman by two and a quarter lengths. Stoute said: “It’s a relief because we were stuck on it [75 winners] last year. It [Royal Ascot] is special to every trainer. We’ve been very lucky to have a lot of nice horses over the years.” Cracksman never showed his best form throughout the Group One over a mile and a quarter, whereas Poet’s Word was bright and alert under James Doyle and won handsomely. Stoute added: “Maybe Cracksman isn’t at his best now, but we beat the others comprehensively. He’s a very consistent, brave horse.” Doyle said: “I was travelling all over him [Cracksman], it was just a case of hanging on.” John Gosden, the trainer of Cracksman, said: “I make no excuses whatsoever. The other horse on the day had him covered from two out. To my mind he is just playing around a bit. He did it at Epsom, but he didn’t do it first time out at Longchamp. At no stage was he travelling or carrying Frankie [Dettori].” PA Aljazzi went one better than 12 months ago when routing the opposition in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot. A surprise second to Qemah last year, Marco Botti had plotted the first half of the season around a return to this Group Two contest. Tribute Act was at the head of the chasing pack in second, with Epsom winner Wilamina a fine third. Hydrangea was a big disappointment and was one of the first beaten. After many years of trying and several near-misses, it was a first winner at the meeting for Botti. He said: “We’ve been so close so many times, it’s just nice to have one (a Royal Ascot winner) on the board. William gave her a great ride and she showed a great turn of foot.” PA 1 Poet’s Word (James Doyle) 11-2 2 Cracksman (L Dettori) 2-5 Fav 3 Hawkbill (W Buick) 11-1 And they’re off ...

On an unbeaten run of five, the colt is a fabulous talent who stands out like a beacon in race that otherwise seems short of star wattage. Admittedly, he made his backers sweat at Epsom three weeks ago but in the end he managed to score from an unpromising position, which is arguably another reason to admire him. The one source of doubt here is the ground, which will be easily the fastest he has encountered since his winning streak began. If he takes time to let himself down on it, there is a risk that one of the others might have pinched a few vital lengths in the meantime. Poet’s Word, who trailed Cracksman by seven lengths in October, could not really be called progressive and surely can’t win unless the favourite runs miles below expectations. Hawkbill has it in him to be dangerous but ran no race last time, which could be why the blinkers are now fitted. He’s the one to worry about and I might try him in a reverse exacta with the favourite. Now he’s got going ... 1 Aljazzi (W Buick) 9-2 2 Tribute Act (A Kirby) 10-1 3 Wilamina (L Dettori) 11-2 And they’re off ... Billesdon Bess and Promising Run lead, with Hydrangea close behind ...

A winner for jockey William Buick and trainer Marco Botti. Kew Gardens led home a one-two-three for Aidan O’Brien as he dominated the Queen’s Vase to gain a first winner of the week at Royal Ascot. Only ninth in the Derby when last seen, the 100-30 winner was the choice of Ryan Moore and ultimately ran out a decisive victor. Kew Gardens is now as low as 10-1 for the St Leger, a race connections appear keen to go for. Michael Tabor, co-owner of the winner, said: “We’ve always thought he’s a nice horse, really made for this race. Obviously he needs a trip, so the St Leger, why not?” O’Brien said: “We always thought he’d stay. He loves fast ground. He was a little bit disappointing in Epsom, but we’ve been very happy since then. He can do a lot of things. He can go back to the Irish Derby. He can have a little break and be trained for the Leger. He’s a lot of options. The Leger is a long way away, but in the autumn that would be a lovely race for him.” PA 15-8 Hydrangea 5-1 Aljazzi 15-2 Urban Fox 8-1 Wilamina 12-1 Tomyris 12-1 Tribute Act 22-1 Arabian Hope Full betting here Hydrangea is all class and will be sharper for her reappearance defeat but she could still be vulnerable, giving 5lb to potential improvers over a trip that is probably short of her best. Urban Fox appeals at an each-way price, having shown career-best form on his first run for William Haggas, landing a handicap over this course and distance last month. Fans of the sci-fi series Blake’s 7 may have noted Servalan running a respectable sixth in the Queen Mary, our opening race at Royal Ascot today. The filly is named after the main villain of the series. The colours of her owner, Vimal Khosla, have also been carried in recent years by Hyperdrive and Final Frontier, so I think we’re getting an idea of where his interests lie. 1 Kew Gardens (R L Moore) 10-3 2 Southern France (J A Heffernan) 9-2 3 Nelson (D O’Brien) 9-2 And they’re off ...Nelson has the lead with a mile to go ... and now extends the lead to about five or six lengths ... Yabass is two or three lengths clear of the rest ... Nelson clear on the home turn ... Kew Gardens getting going and takes the lead ... and wins ... and no sooner have I said Aidan O’Brien is having a frustrating meeting he has the first three in the next race! Southern France is back in second and Nelson third. 1st Blue 2-1 fav Signora Cabello narrowly prevailed in a blanket three-way finish to the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. A big-priced winner of a Listed race at York last time out, the powerful Phoenix Thoroughbred organisation bought a three-quarter share into the filly. Still in the care of John Quinn and ridden by Oisin Murphy, the daughter of Camacho was sent off at 25-1 on this occasion, and was never far from the pace. Aidan O’Brien’s Gossamer Wings and the Clive Cox-trained Shades Of Blue were late challengers, but it was the northern raider who prevailed by a short head and the same. Wesley Ward’s favourite Chelsea Cloisters never threatened at any stage under Frankie Dettori. Quinn said: “All she did, really, was improve. She was well on top at the line (at York) and since then she’s trained lovely. She’s very unassuming. She’s terribly, terribly tough. I’m really pleased.” PA 7-2 Kew Gardens 4-1 Nelson 4-1 Stream of Stars 11-2 Southern France 14-1 Lynwood Gold 18-1 Almoghared 25-1 Kings Proctor 33-1 Drapers Guild Full betting here Much as I admire Aidan O’Brien, his Kew Gardens can’t be the right favourite for this, having been beaten at odds-on at Lingfield, followed by a well-beaten effort in the Derby, when he paid for helping to force a strong pace. Can that be the right preparation for this test, just 18 days later? Almoghared, a half-brother to Taghrooda, might be the best of these in time but his stablemate, Stream Of Stars, looks more of a ‘now’ horse and can make the necessary step up on his maiden win around here last month. The draw looked very fair there in the Queen Mary Stakes so there may not be any marked bias towards either side. That is interesting for the Royal Hunt Cup (5.00) later in which it may not pay to go for high or low draws in particular. 1 Signora Cabello (Oisin Murphy) 25-1 2 Gossamer Wings (D O’Brien) 25-1 3 Shades Of Blue (A Kirby) 5-1 And they’re off ... Haats Off slowly away ... Country Rose fast out and leads ... Chelsea Cloisters ridden along ... Shades Of Blue made late progress into third on the line with Gossamer Wings and Signora Cabello fighting out the finish ... photo finish! photo finish! ... Signora Cabello is confirmed the winner for trainer John Quinn and jockey Oisin Murphy. Still no winner for Aidan O’Brien, who is having a frustrating meeting so far, and was second with Gossamer Wings there. Just a quarter of an hour to go until the first race of day two at Royal Ascot, and the betting markets are beginning to bubble. Frankie Dettori’s mount Chelsea Cloisters remains a solid favourite for the opening Queen Mary Stakes at around 7-2, but his partner, Stream Of Stars, in the next, the Queen’s Vase, is quite weak in the market so far today and is out to 9-2 in the face of support for two Aidan O’Brien-trained runners, Kew Gardens and Nelson, who is in to 7-2 joint-favourite with his stable companion from 9-2 this morning. Hydrangea, the O’Brien-trained favourite for the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes at 3.40, is also weak in the betting and is out to 2-1 in a place while William Haggas’s Urban Fox is in to 7-1 from 10-1 thanks to each-way support. In the big betting race of the day, the Royal Hunt Cup at 5.00, Saltonstall has been backed into 9-1 from 12-1 with Hills to give Mick Halford his second success in the race in three years with a runner in Godolphin blue. 7-2 Chelsea Cloisters 9-2 Shades Of Blue 8-1 Servalan 9-1 So Perfect 12-1 Kurious 16-1 Come On Leicester 16-1 Forever in Dreams 20-1 Second Generation Full betting here Supporting Chelsea Cloisters here is a statement of faith in her trainer, Wesley Ward, rather than in the filly herself but faith in Ward would be entirely justified. He has had at least one winner at Royal Ascot in each of the last five years and this has been the most productive race for him, yielding three wins since 2009. Chelsea Cloisters appears to be the pick of his party and gets the sort of fast ground that gives zippy US raiders a big chance. Odds of 9-4 clearly cannot be described as generous in a big field of unexposed types but they are better than I expected just the same. The Duke of Cambridge Stakes is run today today, but no Duke of Cambridge in the royal procession. The Duchess of Cambridge is on maternity leave. He had an official engagement in Liverpool yesterday but not in attendance today. 1st Carriage THE QUEEN Princess Alexandra, the Hon. Lady Ogilvy The Hon. Harry Herbert Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt 2nd Carriage The Prince of Wales The Duchess of Cornwall Mr. Peter Phillips Mrs. Peter Phillips 3rd Carriage The Lord Vestey The Lady Vestey The Lord de Mauley The Lady de Mauley 4th Carriage Mr. Michael Magnier Mrs. Michael Magnier The Lady Susan Hussey Lieutenant Colonel Charles Richards For those who read my note yesterday about the horrors of going to big race meetings, including this one, by train you won’t be surprised to hear there were awful problems for Royal Ascot racegoers getting home on the choo-choo last night. Here is the full story courtesy of Andrew Scutts at the Racing Post. I’ve got my form experts working on the first betting heat of the day and they tell me that up until about an hour ago, pink was the hot favourite at 3-1. However, smartbets.com report that the bookmakers have generally cut the odds on Her Majesty wearing a blue hat from 4-1 to 2-1. So what are the vital facts. Well, since 2005, the Queen has worn blue 13 times, followed by pink which has had 12 outings, white has been worn 11 times, green and purple seven times each, yellow worn five times in recent years, including yesterday, orange twice, and turquoise and brown once each. Here’s today’s betting: 2-1 Blue, 3-1 Pink, 5-1 White, 8-1 Green, 16-1 Orange, 20-1 Brown, 25-1 Red, 100-1 George Cross. Our own snapper, Tom Jenkins, has got the pic of live betting on the Queen’s Hat Stakes from the track. John Gosden 3 wins Willie Mullins 1 Charlie Appleby 1 Eve Johnson Houghton 1 Thank God for Eve J H, for breaking her way into this gathering of Racing’s Most Powerful. The only really big name missing would be that of Aidan O’Brien, who had 12 runners yesterday and had just a second and a third to show for it. Rhododendron running unplaced must have been a sore one and evidently more was expected of U S Navy Flag, though he hasn’t seemed the same horse this year as last. Still, none of O’Brien’s Day One losers started favourite and it would probably be a mistake to read much into their defeats. He was also blanked on the first day last year but ended the week with six winners. Today’s nine runners include two likely favourites in Kew Gardens and Hydrangea. Gosden, meanwhile, could be on his way to his best ever Royal Ascot. Five winners is his current best, achieved in 2012. Frankie Dettori 3 wins Andrea Atzeni 1 Charles Bishop 1 William Buick 1 And let’s not forget that Dettori only had three mounts on Day One. His first ride today is a favourite and his second ride is fancied, so it’s pretty easy to imagine him starting this Royal Ascot on a streak of five consecutive winners. But do you worry about his 47-year-old frame holding up under the strain of it all? Yesterday, he had a race off between each ride. Today, he’s in all six races and perhaps we won’t be getting the very best of him in the 5.35pm contest. Meanwhile, young Ryan Moore has yet to break his duck. Mind you, that was also true at the same stage last year and he ended the week as top jockey. Rides today: 2.30 Dettori: Chelsea Cloisters 5-2 / Moore: So Perfect 7-1 3.05 Dettori: Stream Of Stars 4-1 / Moore: Kew Gardens 100-30 3.40 Dettori: Wilamina 8-1 / Moore: Hydrangea 15-8 4.20 Dettori: Cracksman 4-6 / Moore: Cliffs Of Moher 12-1 5.00 Dettori: Gabrial 25-1 / Moore: Master Merion 20-1 5.35 Dettori: Purser 16-1 / Moore: Could It Be Love 11-2 Further to speculation earlier that Frankie Dettori might set a new Royal Ascot record by winning on four consecutive rides at the meeting if Chelsea Cloisters wins the first, the press room’s resident Fred Archer expert, Dave Yates of the Daily Mirror, has revealed that the great jockey once steered six mounts in a row to victory here back in the 19th century (as pointed out earlier). At the best odds currently available, Dettori is about 200-1 to match Archer’s remarkable record by winning the first three races here today, and about 320-1 to go one better. Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, was asked about Gosden’s comment in an interview with Rishi Persad on ITV’s Opening Show programme this morning and played it with a very straight bat. “I think it’s too early to tell and there haven’t been enough races for me to gauge that opinion,” Stickels said. “There doesn’t feel any [difference] as you walk it and the TurfTrax GoingStick doesn’t give any significant bias, so for me, I think, I won’t jump to conclusions yet, I’ll wait and see how it pans out.” Stickels also reported that 4mm of watering on the course overnight in order to maintain the going at good-to-firm. “There was some evaporation yesterday, about 3mm, and obviously it was drying out through the afternoon. We hadn’t watered before that since early Sunday morning, so with a dry forecast we felt we needed to keep some moisture in the ground to keep it good-to-firm. “We watered with 4mm and we’ve now got a misty morning with a bit of dew on the track. It will feel like there is more moisture in the ground but this will burn off and it will be good-to-firm later.” 2.30 Queen Mary Stakes Supporting Chelsea Cloisters here is a statement of faith in her trainer, Wesley Ward, rather than in the filly herself but faith in Ward would be entirely justified. He has had at least one winner at Royal Ascot in each of the last five years and this has been the most productive race for him, yielding three wins since 2009. Chelsea Cloisters appears to be the pick of his party and gets the sort of fast ground that gives zippy US raiders a big chance. Odds of 9-4 clearly cannot be described as generous in a big field of unexposed types but they are better than I expected just the same. 3.05 Queen’s Vase Much as I admire Aidan O’Brien, his Kew Gardens can’t be the right favourite for this, having been beaten at odds-on at Lingfield, followed by a well-beaten effort in the Derby, when he paid for helping to force a strong pace. Can that be the right preparation for this test, just 18 days later? Almoghared, a half-brother to Taghrooda, might be the best of these in time but his stablemate, Stream Of Stars, looks more of a ‘now’ horse and can make the necessary step up on his maiden win around here last month. 3.40 Duke Of Cambridge Stakes Hydrangea is all class and will be sharper for her reappearance defeat but she could still be vulnerable, giving 5lb to potential improvers over a trip that is probably short of her best. Urban Fox appeals at an each-way price, having shown career-best form on his first run for William Haggas, landing a handicap over this course and distance last month. 4.20 Prince Of Wales’s Stakes A top-class opening day for John Gosden and Frankie Dettori will have the Newmarket pair relaxed and happy as they approach the main business of this Royal Ascot, which, for them, is getting Cracksman to win the Prince of Wales’s Stakes. On an unbeaten run of five, the colt is a fabulous talent who stands out like a beacon in race that otherwise seems short of star wattage. Admittedly, he made his backers sweat at Epsom three weeks ago but in the end he managed to score from an unpromising position, which is arguably another reason to admire him. The one source of doubt here is the ground, which will be easily the fastest he has encountered since his winning streak began. If he takes time to let himself down on it, there is a risk that one of the others might have pinched a few vital lengths in the meantime. Poet’s Word, who trailed Cracksman by seven lengths in October, could not really be called progressive and surely can’t win unless the favourite runs miles below expectations. Hawkbill has it in him to be dangerous but ran no race last time, which could be why the blinkers are now fitted. He’s the one to worry about and I might try him in a reverse exacta with the favourite. 5.00 Royal Hunt Handicap The thing to worry about here is the draw. It hardly ever pays to be adamant about these things but yesterday’s Coventry Stakes and last month’s Victoria Cup suggested that those drawn low, towards the far side, have an advantage over the rest, though of course that advantaged can be wiped out, depending on where most jockeys decide to go when the stalls open. My fancy, at least, has a low draw in three. Mick Halford won this race two years ago with a Godolphin-owned four-year-old, carrying a penalty for a recent success at The Curragh, and could turn the trick again with Saltonstall. He was a pleasing winner of a competitive handicap last month on the driest surface he had yet encountered and a 5lb penalty leaves him leniently treated. 5.35 Jersey Stakes Here is another prize waiting to be picked up by the Gosden / Dettori combination, represented by Purser. He idled in front when landing a Listed contest under Rab Havlin last time and ought to be well suited by this stiff seven furlongs. 2.30 Queen Mary Stakes Chelsea Cloisters 5-2 3.05 Queen’s Vase Stakes Stream Of Stars 4-1 3.40 Duke of Cambridge Stakes Urban Fox (nb) 10-1 4.20 Prince of Wales’s Stakes Cracksman 4-6 5.00 Royal Hunt Cup (Handicap) Saltonstall (nap) 12-1 5.35 Sandringham Handicap Purser 16-1 Given what happened yesterday, I’m feeling pretty good about the fact that Frankie Dettori is on four of my tips today. For those of you who missed it, Dettori managed to win on ALL THREE of his rides on day one, which is a heck of an achievement, even allowing for the fact that two of them were favourite. After all, there were four other favourites on yesterday’s card, ridden by jockeys other than Dettori, and none of them won. Anyway, I had a somewhat less rewarding Day One than our man from Italy, so it would be really terrific if he were able to do the business on Chelsea Cloisters, Stream Of Stars, Cracksman and Purser. The going at Ascot remains good to firm on Wednesday morning. They put down 4mm of artificial watering after racing on Tuesday, to counter the effects of evapotransporation during the day. GoingStick readings are almost identical to Tuesday morning, though the effect of the watering seems to have been marginally greater on the centre of the straight mile than on either side. What it all boils down to is that, as yesterday, fast horses have ideal conditions while ploddy grinders are right up against it. In the round-course races, it will be hard to make up many positions after the turn for home, unless the early pace has been mad. Congratulations to titusisashambles, who won Tuesday’s competition on a final score of +15.25, thanks to Lagostovegas (10-1), Blue Point (6-1) and Without Parole (9-4), leaving him well clear of anyone else who took part.

If we get a tie after all the races have been run, the winner will be the one who posted their tips earliest out of those with the highest score. If you don’t win today, don’t despair. We are running an identical competition on each day of the Royal meeting, up to Friday. Post your tips or racing-related comments below. Actual impromptu research is taking place in the Ascot press room, which is possibly a first. Newsboy of the Daily Mirror has dug up clippings of the Evening Standard to show that Fred Archer rode six consecutive winners at Royal Ascot in 1878. I don’t doubt that most Guardian readers were already aware of this. Perhaps some of you had them in doubles and trebles. Anyway, what this means is that Frankie is not setting any records today unless he can ride the first four winners... Frankie Dettori had the effervescence knob turned up to 11 at Royal Ascot on Tuesday and he will be aiming to keep it there this afternoon when he has two certain favourites, a strong second-favourite and a live each-way chance among his full book of six rides. By this evening, he could have the prize for the week’s top jockey effectively wrapped up with three days to spare, but this being Ascot, this could also be the day when his streak peters out. If Chelsea Cloisters takes the opening Norfolk Stakes for Wesley Ward, Dettori will have scored on four consecutive rides at the Royal meeting since he did not have a mount in either the King’s Stand Stakes or the Ascot Stakes here on Tuesday. James Doyle managed three in a row back in 2013 – which were also his first three winners at the meeting – and it will require some digging in Ascot’s archives to be absolutely certain that four straight winners would be unprecedented. Since three or four winners over the whole meeting was often enough to win the riders’ championship in the past, however, my money would say that it would. Dettori also has a big chance aboard John Gosden’s Stream Of Stars in the Queen’s Vase and a fair squeak on Wilamina in the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes before attention turns to Cracksman’s attempt to win the day’s feature race, the Prince of Wales’s Stakes. Cracksman will be the shortest-priced favourite of the week but it could be argued – by me, at any rate - that he has a few questions to answer after his run in the Coronation Cup at Epsom last time. He did not look like the winner there at any stage bar the final half-furlong, and while it may just be – as both Gosden and Dettori have suggested – that he did not handle the track, he handled it well enough to finish third in the Derby last season. Cracksman did not appear to be travelling easily even in the early stages of the race, long before the downhill run to Tattenham Corner. He is an exceptional talent and he will hopefully put that lacklustre run behind him today, but at 8-13 it is not difficult to sit the race out from a betting perspective as the final field of seven does not lend itself to an each-way alternative. Later on the card, there is the chance of a winner for the course’s owner as the Queen’s Seniority, who had been the second reserve for the race after missing the initial cut-off point of 30 runners, managed to creep in at the bottom of the handicap after Mubtasim, a stable-mate at the William Haggas yard that had made the cut, was found to be suffering from lameness. Funny, that. Seniority is currently the 12-1 joint-favourite to become the first winner here in the Royal colours since Dartmouth in the Hardwicke Stakes two years ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/29/how-do-you-like-your-pinot-fiona-beckett","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-29T15:00:45Z","webTitle":"How do you like your pinot?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/29/how-do-you-like-your-pinot-fiona-beckett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/29/how-do-you-like-your-pinot-fiona-beckett","fields":{"headline":"How do you like your pinot?","bodyText":"What should you expect when you order a pinot? At the very least that you’ll be asked if you want pinot noir or pinot grigio, but you could equally well be offered a rosé or a sparkling wine (the pinot family accounts for two out of the three classic grapes used in champagne and sparkling wines). According to Jancis Robinson et al’s magisterial Wine Grapes, pinot has more than 1,000 permutations that contribute towards making the already-complicated world of wine even more daunting. The fact that pinots go by different names doesn’t help, either. Pinot grigio is also known as pinot gris (pronounced “gree”) and grauburgunder in Germany, where they also use the word spätburgunder for pinot noir. In Italy, it’s pinot nero. Then there are the areas that don’t even mention the P word, most notably Burgundy, where it’s all about the village and the vineyard. But that does provide a clue as to how to approach the pinot family: know where it comes from, and you get an idea of the style. Pinot grigio from Italy, particularly the north-east, will be crisp and dry. When it comes from Alsace and New Zealand, where it’s known as pinot gris, it will be rounder and richer, sometimes with a touch of sweetness. Pinot noir from Burgundy, meanwhile, tends to be light and fresh-tasting, certainly at the more affordable end of the price spectrum. If you want full-on sweet fruit, look to California, Chile and New Zealand again. Romania and Bulgaria tend to have more darkly fruited pinots such as the rich, exotically plummy 2015 Soli Pinot Noir from Bulgaria’s Thracian Valley (£11.95 Caviste, Dorset Wine Company, £12.50 Swig, 13.5%), which couldn’t really be described as a light wine at all. You’d fancy a haunch of wild boar with that, which is more than can be said for most pinots. There’s also pinot blanc, mainly from Alsace and Italy, where it’s known as pinot bianco. That’s a smoother, fuller style than a pinot grigio, and more like an unoaked or lightly oaked chardonnay. With sparkling wine, you’ll know if it has the pinot influence if it’s labelled as a blanc de noirs – a white wine made from dark skinned grapes – either just pinot noir, as in Wiston Estates’s multi-award-winning Blanc de Noirs 2010 (£42.99 Ministry of Drinks, £46.50 Butlers Wine Cellar), or pinot noir and pinot meunier. And that might just be the best English fizz you’ve never tasted.

By 2035, 450 million Africans will have joined the working age population, more than the rest of the world combined in that time. They will power our economies forward, as long as there are jobs they have the knowledge to perform. But our schools and universities have not kept pace with technology. Over half of all jobseekers have few or no skills, while 41% have qualifications but no skills for the jobs available. The gap is wider still in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. I was delighted to participate, along with other government officials and the private sector, in the second African Transformation Forum this week in Accra, Ghana, where restructuring our economies for the digital age was high on the agenda. The forum took place at a time when conditions for the continent’s transformation agenda have never been better. We are experiencing greatly accelerated progress towards the economic unification of our continent. In this year alone, the African Union has adopted the free movement protocol and inaugurated a single African air transport market, which will reduce not only ticket prices but also the need for stopovers on other continents. Most importantly, in March, 44 countries signed the Continental Free Trade Area agreement. Most other member states indicated their intention to follow suit in due course. Joining up diffuse, fragmented markets would be a leap forward. Doing this across borders will require governments to work closely with each other, and with the private sector. By creating a highly networked, frictionless marketplace, we will encourage the best products, services and ideas to rise to the top. This will boost the economy as a whole and open up opportunities for women, rural populations and other marginalised groups. Ultimately, the goal is to make our economies bigger and more dynamic. No country or company will lose out in the long term. This is why business leaders are called upon to be champions of continental integration, first of all by seizing these new opportunities to grow Africa’s firms. Business leaders now participate actively and meaningfully in African Union summits. This is based on the understanding that the shared prosperity at the core of the union’s Agenda 2063 can only happen when the public and private sectors are working closely together. The business community should also contribute to holding governments accountable for putting what has been agreed into action, and pushing all of us to do more, and better. For example, given the transportation and logistical challenges on our vast continent, much more investment in joint regional infrastructure, including digital networks, is required. Globally, there is no shortage of finance, both public and private. We can attract more of it to Africa, and help close the investment gap, by planning big infrastructure regionally. This generates projects of sufficient size to interest major funds, and enhances the business case. It also makes regional integration tangible and irreversible. We also need to match external capital with African capital. African savings are not being mobilised effectively. This can help reduce risk perceptions, and also ensure we share the upside of profitable deals. Building the capacity of African firms creates badly needed jobs and skills right here on the continent and, as African construction and services firms grow, costs and operational risks will decrease. The Continental Free Trade Area goes against the prevailing trend of moving away from regional integration and the multilateral trading system. This is already making Africa stand out to global markets and investors. Finally, prosperity rests on good politics and a secure environment, because the transformation agenda requires a broad consensus that is sustained across decades. Transformation requires leadership and accountability at every level, beginning at the top, but not stopping there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/19/home-secretary-sajid-javid-announces-review-into-medicinal-cannabis-use","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T16:18:59Z","webTitle":"Home secretary announces review into medicinal cannabis use","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/19/home-secretary-sajid-javid-announces-review-into-medicinal-cannabis-use","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/19/home-secretary-sajid-javid-announces-review-into-medicinal-cannabis-use","fields":{"headline":"Home secretary announces review into medicinal cannabis use","bodyText":"Thousands of sufferers of drug-resistant conditions have been offered hope after the home secretary launched a review into medicinal uses of cannabis following public pressure from the families of two sick children. But Sajid Javid ruled out legalising the drug for recreational use following interventions by the former Tory leader William Hague and policing officials. The review by the Home Office and the chief medical officer, Sally Davies, was announced following high-profile coverage of the cases of 12-year-old Billy Caldwell and six-year-old Alfie Dingley, who both have forms of intractable epilepsy that appear to be eased by the use of cannabis oil. Following the announcement of the review, Caldwell’s mother, Charlotte Caldwell, said: “At every stage we have mentioned making history, and we have mentioned it because common sense and the power of mummies of sick children has bust the political process wide open and is on the verge of changing thousands of lives by bringing our medicinal cannabis laws in line with many other countries.” Javid’s decision to review medicinal cannabis marks another major intervention by the secretary of state since his appointment at the end of April. Although some announcements had been set in motion before he took office, he has overseen the fallout from the Windrush scandal, which included the suspension of some immigration enforcement measures, the launch of new counter-terrorism legislation and strategy, and he has removed medics from the skilled migrant cap. Addressing the House of Commons on the issue of medicinal cannabis, Javid said: “It has become clear to me since becoming home secretary that the position that we find ourselves in currently is not satisfactory. “It’s not satisfactory for the parents, it’s not satisfactory for the doctors, and it’s not satisfactory for me. I have now come to the conclusion that it is time to review the scheduling of cannabis. “Before I go into any detail of the review, let me be absolutely clear that this step is in no way a first step to the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use. “This government has absolutely no plans to legalise cannabis and the penalties for unauthorised supply and possession will remain unchanged. “We will not set a dangerous precedent or weaken our ability to keep dangerous drugs off our streets.” Cannabis is currently a schedule 1 drug, meaning it is currently thought to have no therapeutic value and cannot be lawfully possessed or prescribed. It may be used for the purposes of research but a Home Office licence is required. The review will be in two parts. Davies will consider the evidence available for the medicinal and therapeutic benefits of cannabis-based medicines. In the next step, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) will provide an assessment based on the balance of harms and public health needs, of what, if anything, should be rescheduled. The home secretary said if the review identified significant medical and therapeutic benefits, then cannabis could be rescheduled for medicinal use. Alfie and Billy are among around 20,000 children who do not respond to the medication prescribed by the NHS. Dingley’s parents said his seizures almost disappeared after he was prescribed an EU-certified cannabis medicine in Holland. They lived there for six months until the parents, who had spent £30,000 on his treatment, ran out of money. Hannah Deacon, Alfie’s mother, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday: “Before we went to Holland he was in hospital every week having intravenous steroids and other unlicensed medication to stop his severe clusters of hundreds of seizures. “I didn’t know my child for two years, all I knew was A&amp;E, ambulances, purple seizures, panic, fear. That was my life. The miracle was that [cannabis-based drugs] worked and it changed his life.” Similarly, Charlotte Caldwell, Billy’s mother, credited cannabis oil as “life-saving” and said its prescription caused Billy to go around 300 days seizure-free. After they returned to the UK they both launched high-profile campaigns for their children to be able to have access to their anti-epileptic medicine. Their cases also renewed the wider debate over legalisation. In an article for the Telegraph on Tuesday, William Hague, the former leader of the Conservative party, urged Theresa May to legalise cannabis. He said that the “battle [against cannabis] is effectively over” and that the UK’s drug policy is “inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date”. Advocating a major policy change, Hague said it was delusional to think cannabis could be “driven off the streets”. Hague claimed that criminal gangs were the chief beneficiaries of the drug remaining illegal and that many police forces had “stopped worrying about it”. It is understood that around half a dozen police forces have de-prioritised the enforcement of cannabis-related crimes. Accordingly, police chiefs came out in support of Hague’s remarks in respect to the war on drugs. “Hague is right that the war on drugs is not being won,” said David Jamieson, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands. “We need a fresh approach and to treat people with addictions as having a medical problem, not just as an enforcement issue.” “Decisions on the harm of drugs should not be taken by the Home Office, but by medical professionals at the Department of Health,” Jamieson, who served as a government minister between 1997 and 2005, added. Ron Hogg, the Durham police, crime and victims’ commissioner, echoed his remarks. “Lord Hague’s statement that the war on drugs has failed echoes the call for reform of the drug laws which I have been making for some time,” he said. Durham is understood to have adopted the most liberal approach to policing drug offences in the country and is focused on the need to reduce drug-related harm. It is the only force in the country to be rated as outstanding by official inspectors. “Drug users should be able to seek effective treatment without fear of prosecution, and control of the drugs market should be taken out of the hands of organised crime groups,” Hogg said. There were 136,352 recorded drug offences in England and Wales in 2016/17. Just under 76% of all drug offences recorded were for the possession of cannabis and this is likely to be a major drain on police budgets. The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers said it was clear that the current law on cannabis was not working. In a statement Simon Kempton, Lead on Drugs Policy for the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: “It is clear that the current legislation which prohibits the possession, consumption and supply of substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, does not work. “Let me be clear - we are not supporting the legalisation of drugs or de-criminalising drugs we are simply saying that, 100 years after the introduction of prohibition in the UK, it is time to reflect on whether this is the most effective way of curtailing illicit drug use and the social problems that come with it.” The government insisted it would not decriminalise cannabis. “In terms of decriminalising cannabis there are no plans in that respect,” May’s spokesman said. “The evidence is very clear that cannabis can cause serious harm when it is misused.” The Home Office also issued a strong rebuttal which reiterated that the government “has no intention of reviewing the classification of cannabis” and “it will remain a class B drug”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/jun/19/what-are-your-experiences-of-gaming-addiction-share-your-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T13:44:06Z","webTitle":"What are your experiences of gaming addiction?

It has listed and defined gaming disorder as a condition warranting further research in the 11th edition of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), citing an increase in the development of treatment programmes across the world. Gaming disorder is defined as a pattern of gaming behavior characterised by impaired control over gaming, as well as increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other daily activities. For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months. The statement has been praised by some while others argue it may risk stigmatizing too many young video game players.

The inquiry was launched following a police investigation into the deaths of 92 patients of Dr Jane Barton at the Gosport War Memorial hospital in the late 1990s. No charges were brought but inquests held in 2009 and 2013 found that medication prescribed by Barton had contributed to the deaths of six patients. The report, led by Bishop James Jones – who ran the Hillsborough inquiry, is likely to make a wide range of recommendations and to criticise the government, which sat on a damning report into what happened for a decade. It is understood that Theresa May will reference the findings at prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday. But the families that campaigned for many years to find out what happened to their loved ones and hold those responsible to account are unlikely to get what they have always wanted – criminal prosecutions. An investigation by the doctors’ regulatory body, the General Medical Council (GMC), ruled in 2009 that Barton had overprescribed painkilling opiates to a number of her patients. It found her guilty of serious professional misconduct, having made multiple errors, including failing to keep up to date, refer patients to other doctors, tell colleagues what she was doing or keep notes. But the panel allowed her to continue practising as a GP under strict conditions. She then retired, requesting voluntary erasure from the medical register. The inquiry is not expected to press for any criminal investigation or refer anything to the police as this is reportedly outside the remit. There is no suggestion that Barton is guilty of murder. The Jones inquiry has looked at more than 800 death certificates that she signed. But its criticism is likely to go well beyond the doctor, who said she did the best she could for her patients in a hospital that was understaffed and under pressure, with too many referrals to the wards where she worked. A review by Richard Baker of the University of Leicester, commissioned by the then chief medical officer Prof Liam Donaldson in 2003, was damning, but the department of health refused to publish it until 2013. It found “a practice of almost routine use of opiates before death” on the hospital’s Dryad ward, apparently authorised by the words in patient’s notes, “please make comfortable”. He said this could have gone back as far as 1988 and could have preceded Barton’s tenure at the hospital. “The practice almost certainly had shortened the lives of some patients, and it cannot be ruled out that a small number of these would otherwise have been eventually discharged from hospital alive,” said his report. The GMC said the decision of its disciplinary panel not to strike Barton off the medical register in 2009 was wrong. It issued a statement at the time saying it disagreed with the panel, but it did not then have the power to appeal against the decision. That has now changed. Peter Walsh, the chief executive of campaign group Action Against Medical Accidents, which helped the families get inquests held and pressed for an inquiry said: “There are questions to be asked that are relevant today, including why it has taken so long to open up the can of worms. The families need closure. I’m hoping they get something close to closure. “The Department of Health will say it was so long ago and things have changed, but I’m not so sure – particularly if you look at nursing homes. “There are big concerns about using sedatives and drugs like diamorphine in nursing homes and very lacklustre monitoring of prescribing. There have been serious errors in overdosing with diamorphine and inappropriate prescribing of it. “While things have tightened up in particular in the hospital setting where you hope you can’t get a rogue doctor carrying on like Barton did, in nursing homes it is less rigorous. “There are lessons above all to be learned about transparency,” he said. “I’m really hoping they get to the bottom of how government and its institutions contributed to what probably could be described as a cover-up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/20/scientists-genetically-engineer-pigs-immune-to-costly-disease","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T17:00:46Z","webTitle":"Scientists genetically engineer pigs immune to costly disease","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/20/scientists-genetically-engineer-pigs-immune-to-costly-disease","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/20/scientists-genetically-engineer-pigs-immune-to-costly-disease","fields":{"headline":"Scientists genetically engineer pigs immune to costly disease","bodyText":"Scientists have genetically engineered pigs to be immune to one of the world’s most costly animal diseases, in an advance that could propel gene-editing technology into commercial farms within five years. The trial, led by the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute, showed that the pigs were completely immune to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a disease that is endemic across the globe and costs the European pig industry nearly £1.5bn in pig deaths and decreased productivity each year. Pigs infected with PRRS are safe to eat but the virus causes the animals breathing problems, causes deaths in piglets and can cause pregnant sows to lose their litter. There is no effective cure or vaccine, and despite extensive biosecurity measures about 30% of pigs in England are thought to be infected at any given time. After deleting a small section of DNA that leaves pigs vulnerable to the disease, the animals showed no symptoms or trace of infection when intentionally exposed to the virus and when housed for an extended period with infected siblings. “It is what we call complete immunity,” said Christine Tait-Burkard of the Roslin Institute and first author of the work, published in the Journal of Virology. The advance could have huge animal welfare and economic benefits to farming, she said, but added it is “likely to be several years before we’re eating bacon sandwiches from PRRS-resistant pigs”. Genetically modified animals are banned from the food chain in the UK and throughout Europe but it is not clear whether these regulations would apply to gene-edited animals, since the technology and resultant genetic changes are different. It also remains to be seen whether the public will embrace the prospect of genetically edited meat. Gene editing differs from older genetic modification techniques, which often involve transferring genes from one species to another. By contrast, gene editing uses precise molecular tools to remove small stretches of DNA or alter single letters in the genetic code – effectively speeding up processes that could occur naturally over many generations. The PRRS-resistant pigs were made by removing about 450 letters of DNA, causing a receptor, called CD163, that sits on the outside of pig cells to be made lacking one tiny, precise segment that the virus binds to. This means the virus bounces off the cell rather than entering it and multiplying. “The resulting pig is still 100% pig … or 99.9999999% of a pig,” said Tait-Burkard. “It’s not something new that people should be afraid about.” In the trial, the animals showed no signs that the change in their DNA had any other impact on their health, fertility or wellbeing. The work was funded by Genus Pic (Pig Improvement Company), whose nine pedigree herds sire about 30% of the world’s commercially farmed pigs. The company is now conducting further tests ahead of plans to introduce the edit commercially, starting in the US. Jonathan Lightner, chief scientific officer for Genus, said: “We know that farmers are enthusiastic about it and that’s because they’ve seen what this disease does on their farms.” He added: “We’re doing [further] development in the US because the regulatory framework is clearer there … and public acceptance we imagine will be more difficult in the EU than in North America.” PRRS is endemic across the world. There is no treatment, and vaccines are ineffective. A 2011 study conducted by the Royal Veterinary College found that in England 30% of the pig population had the virus, and the figure was higher in areas with dense pig populations. While there is no current treatment for the virus, one of its effects is to hamper the immune system, leaving pigs at risk of picking up secondary infections. So antibiotics are typically used as a blanket treatment for pigs when farms are infected. Georgina Crayford, a senior policy adviser at the National Pig Association, said immunity to the disease could help tackle excess antibiotic use on farms. “We’ve halved the antibiotic use in the pig industry in the last two years, which is really fantastic, but PRRS in the future is going to hamper any further significant progress,” she said. PRRS is just one of several animal diseases being targeted through gene editing. Separately, scientists at Roslin are attempting to engineer resistance to African swine fever, a highly infectious disease that is sweeping through the Baltic states and into Europe. Others are focused on avian flu, E coli, campylobacter and various fish diseases. Darren Griffin, professor of genetics at the University of Kent, said: “There is a still a way to go in terms of efficacy and safety testing ... but the results of this study provide encouragement and hard evidence for an approach that could be applied in the future. “In general terms there is still public concern about gene editing in the food that we consume, but this needs to be countered by hard evidence from well-designed studies. Alarmist titles such as ‘Frankenstein foods’ should play no part in the discussion.” Listen to Hannah Devlin discuss this issue with Crayford and Roslin’s Prof Alan Archibald on the Guardian’s Science Weekly podcast here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/20/no-clear-evidence-probiotics-can-help-with-human-anxiety-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T18:00:48Z","webTitle":"No clear evidence probiotics can help with human anxiety, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/20/no-clear-evidence-probiotics-can-help-with-human-anxiety-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/20/no-clear-evidence-probiotics-can-help-with-human-anxiety-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"No clear evidence probiotics can help with human anxiety, study finds","bodyText":"There is no clear sign that taking probiotics can help dampen feelings of anxiety in humans, according to new research, despite evidence that it works for rodents. A wide range of conditions, from obesity to asthma, have been linked to the microbes living in our guts, with a number of studies suggesting a link to mood and behaviour. As a result, there is a burgeoning interest in psychobiotics: using beneficial bacteria known as probiotics to tinker with the gut’s microbes to affect brain health. But researchers who have examined evidence from previous studies say that while probiotics appear to reduce anxiety in rodents with various problems, there is little to show that they offer similar benefits to humans, whether healthy or not. “If people are suffering from anxiety ... probiotics should not be the solution they look for. They should definitely seek professional treatment,” said Daniel Reis, first author of the research from the University of Kansas, noting that both therapy and medication are available. Reis and colleagues looked at 22 studies involving a total of 743 rats and mice, and 14 involving a total of 1,527 humans, and analysed the data to see if, overall, probiotics reduce anxiety. The results, published in the journal Plos One, show that while such a link was seen among “diseased” rodents – where researchers had exposed the animals to early life stress, infection or other induced conditions – it was not seen overall in healthy animals. Beneficial effects in animals were consistently linked to one type of bacteria – Lactobacillus rhamnosus – although individual studies suggested a number of other species and strains might have an anxiety-reducing effect. By contrast, when the studies were taken together, no beneficial effect was seen for humans, whether healthy or with conditions such as cancer, irritable bowel syndrome or mood disturbance. That said, the team note that none of the studies involved individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, adding that it might be that probiotics only help once certain levels of anxiety have been reached. They also note that for humans, anxiety was based on self-report – which can be unreliable – and that follow-up might not have lasted long enough for effects to be seen. “Before we make any firm conclusions, we really do need to see these probiotics being tested in people who had clinically significant anxiety,” said Reis. The team add that the doses of probiotics given to rodents were up to 100 times larger than those given to humans, once body weight was taken into account, suggesting that researchers should explore whether the lack of effect seen in humans might at least in part be down to probiotics not being given in high enough doses. What’s more, one of the few human studies that did show some evidence of an effect involved Lactobacillus rhamnosus – a finding the team says should be further explored. Prof John Cryan, a neuropharmacologist and microbiome expert from University College Cork who was not involved in the research, disagreed with the study’s conclusion, saying there was some evidence that probiotics might help tackle anxiety in humans. “What [this study] highlights is the importance of bacterial strain selection in mediating such effects. Researchers have long known that only specific strains will have beneficial effects and that most don’t,” he said, adding that clinical trials are needed to explore whether particular microbes offer a health benefit and can hence be termed “probiotics”. Cryan noted that while his team have previously found that one type of Bifidobacteria longum reduces anxiety in humans and animals, other types of Bifidobacteria do nothing. “By ‘lumping’ all strains together in the one analysis, any potential effect is completely masked,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jun/19/trevor-noah-trump-children-separation-late-night-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T14:27:51Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah: 'The federal government is stealing kids from their parents'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jun/19/trevor-noah-trump-children-separation-late-night-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jun/19/trevor-noah-trump-children-separation-late-night-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah: 'The federal government is stealing kids from their parents'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Monday discussed the Trump administration’s crackdown on prosecuting undocumented migrants, which has led to more than 2,000 children being separated from their parents at the border and held in federal detention facilities. Trevor Noah Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah weighed in. “Immigration,” he began. “From the start of Trump’s time in office his administration has been working hard to shut that shit down. “It’s a scary time to be an immigrant in America,” he added, showing news segments addressing the separation of children from their parents at the border and condemnations of the policy from Laura Bush and Pope Francis. “Damn, if even the Catholic church is judging you for how you treat children, you done fucked up,” Noah said. “We’ve all heard the stories about traumatized children, the federal government deporting parents but keeping their kids, we’ve even seen images of how homeland security is holding some of these children in cages. There’s no way you can defend this, unless you work at Fox &amp; Friends.” In a clip from the morning show, host Steve Doocy disputed the characterization of the holding facilities as “cages”, saying they’re “great, big warehouse facility where they built walls out of chain-linked fences”. “We’re not idiots,” he said. “A cage is a cage. “That’s not really the point,” Noah continued. “The point is the federal government is effectively stealing kids away from their parents. If some guy in an unmarked van took your kids from the park, the last thing you’d be worried about as a parent is how nice the van was.” Stephen Colbert “The big story continues to be the Trump administration’s policy of forcibly separating immigrant children from their parents,” began Stephen Colbert. “And faced with almost universal condemnation from both sides of the political aisle, from religious leaders, from the UN human rights council, Donald Trump finally took full responsibility for the policy and promised a swift end to this humanitarian disaster. “I’m just kidding,” the host said. “He blamed the Democrats.” Trump, in tweets sent over the weekend and comments made to reporters, has falsely claimed that by separating children from their parents the administration is following a law passed by Democrats. “There’s two things wrong with this,” Colbert said. “If it was a law, the Republicans are in control of everything – they can fix it. Second of all, it’s not a law. This is a policy. It’s just another scoop from your chum bucket of cruelty.” In a speech made on Monday while announcing his “space force” Trump said: “The United States will not be a migrant camp” or a “refugee holding facility”. “No, it’ll be the all-baby reboot of the Shawshank Redemption,” the host shot back. “Not everyone in the administration blames the policy on the Democrats. Some say the policy doesn’t even exist.” Colbert was referring to the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, who said on Monday that “we have to do our job” and “will not apologize” while also tweeting that no such law mandating the separation of families exists. “Then why are you locking up kids in an abandoned Walmart?” the host asked. Seth Meyers Finally, Seth Meyers called out the administration for its insistence the policy isn’t their own. “If this policy strikes you as monstrous and inhumane and cruel, then you’re a decent person,” he said. “In other words, you are not attorney general Jeff Sessions.” Meyers proceeded to show Sessions invoking the Bible to justify the policy of forcible separation, citing Romans 13. “Obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes,” Sessions said. “White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked how the White House could possibly defend that comment and she immediately doubled down in a tense exchange with a reporter,” Meyers said, showing footage of Sanders declaring: “It is very biblical to enforce the law.” Meyers replied: “It’s also very biblical to stone people to death, to sleep with 600 concubines, to have conversations with flaming bushes and to believe that a 500-year-old man built a giant boat and put giraffes on it. “To be clear, this is not a law,” the host clarified, citing comments by the senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who is seen as one of the architects of the administration’s immigration policy. “It’s a policy announced by choice by the Trump administration. Trump is trying to gaslight the country into thinking it’s actually the Democrats’ fault that this policy exists.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/19/kim-jong-un-meets-xi-jinping-for-third-time","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T13:28:30Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un meets Xi Jinping for third time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/kim-jong-un-meets-xi-jinping-for-third-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/kim-jong-un-meets-xi-jinping-for-third-time","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-un meets Xi Jinping for third time","bodyText":"One week after holding a summit with the US president, Donald Trump, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, his third visit since March. On Tuesday, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV showed Kim and Xi holding talks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, usually used for formal state visits. Analysts believe Kim is in China to brief Xi on the summit, seek economic assistance, as well as pay deference to Beijing, which is eager to emphasise its role in talks between North Korea, the US, and South Korea. “We hope this visit can help to further deepen China-North Korea relations, strengthen strategic communication between both countries on important issues and promote regional peace and stability,” spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing. Kim’s visit comes after a historic summit in Singapore where he and Trump signed a joint declaration pursue complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. In exchange for that pledge, the US has cancelled military exercises with South Korea, something Beijing had previously floated and known as the “freeze for freeze” initiative. Kim is expected to ask Xi for help in easing international sanctions. China is North Korea’s largest trading partner, but international sanctions have crippled North Korea’s economy and drained the country’s foreign currency reserves. After the summit, China suggested international sanctions on Pyongyang could be lifted. “I think Kim seeks sanctions relief and wants to ensure he has Chinese support as North Korea prepares to discuss details of negotiations with the US aimed at denuclearisation, security assurances, and other issues,” said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Xi undoubtedly wants to get a readout of the summit with Trump from Kim.” The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said in a press briefing last week that China had committed to keeping sanctions until Pyongyang had achieved complete denuclearisation. On Tuesday, Geng said sanctions were not “a goal in themselves”. “It is not in the interest of [Beijing] to have an unstable nuclear state at its doorstep, neither is it favourable for it to have US military presence at its borders,” said Anwita Basu, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “A diplomatically negotiated settlement with the main parties involved in the region would satisfy China’s desire to maintain stability in its immediate neighbourhood and prevent the increased militarisation of the region.” On Tuesday, Chinese state media broke with precedent and announced Kim’s two-day visit. Previous visits by North Korean leaders have been shrouded in secrecy and confirmed only after their departure. Security was heightened along Beijing’s Changan avenue as well as the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, where Kim and his wife stayed in March. Kim brought his wife and the two attended a performance as well as a banquet, according to CCTV. On Sunday, Chinese state media reported Kim had sent Xi a congratulatory letter and a floral basket for his birthday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jun/22/glastonbury-town-festival-druids-pagans-travel-holidays","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T05:30:19Z","webTitle":"Pagan paradise: Glastonbury without the festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jun/22/glastonbury-town-festival-druids-pagans-travel-holidays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jun/22/glastonbury-town-festival-druids-pagans-travel-holidays","fields":{"headline":"Pagan paradise: Glastonbury without the festival","bodyText":"‘Summer here is something to behold,” says Kevin Mitchell from behind the counter of Knight’s, his chippy on Glastonbury’s Northload Street. “Hippies, druids, goddesses in their finery, people dressed as elves: you never know who – or what – is going to walk through the door.” Knight’s has been run by the same family on the same site since 1909, although the building itself is medieval, constructed from stone taken from Glastonbury Abbey after it was sacked by Henry VIII. If that stone could talk, it would tell of a town much changed from its roots as a place of Christian pilgrimage to its present reality as the new-age capital of England. That transformation doubtless has much to do with the establishment in 1970 of the Glastonbury festival, seven miles to the east of Glastonbury proper. In a typical June, 135,000 music fans will spend the weekend at Michael Eavis’s farm near the village of Pilton. But Glastonbury’s 9,000 full-time inhabitants represent more than 70 faith groups, and the town has forged a resilient identity of its own. “Some people would dearly love Glastonbury to have stayed the old market town of 50 years ago,” says Mitchell, “but we have survived by embracing the multicultural, multi-faith society. So long as they eat fish and chips, I don’t care.” This being one of the so-called “fallow” years in which the festival has a break to allow the land to recover, it seems a good opportunity to focus on the town from which it takes its name. So what is Glastonbury like without Glasto? To find out, I visit on May Day. This is the gleaming hinge of the Glastonbury year, celebrated as Beltane by the town’s many pagans. On this day, the character of the place is the same as always – small-town mundanity rubbing up against exuberant weirdness – but a little more intense. Put it this way: in a Glastonbury cafe you’re never far from someone in a mistletoe crown eating a full English, but on May Day they might add an extra sausage. It’s a full moon, and the early-morning drive over the Somerset Levels reveals a daguerreotype landscape in silver light. I can just make out the dark mass of my destination: Glastonbury Tor, the steep hill topped by a 15th-century tower that stands as a symbol of the town. For each of the last 30 years, 1 May has been marked by a druidic ceremony on the summit. “The druids are always falling out with each other,” I had been warned by Vicki Steward, who writes Normal For Glastonbury, a blog that takes an affectionate view of the town’s Monty Pythonesque qualities. “There are various druid groups including the OBOD (Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids) the BDO (British Druid Order), GOD (Glastonbury Order of Druids); and then there are the Loyal Arthurian Warband. It’s all a bit People’s Front of Judea.” In fact, the occasion is remarkably collegiate: pipers, folk singers, morris dancers, all welcoming the dawn in their own way. The view is so stunning as to be unphotographable; even one’s eyes aren’t quite up to the job. Rollo Maughfling, archdruid of Britain, leads the ceremony, calling for peace at all points of the compass, the light climbing little by little to reveal his white robe, red cloak, white beard and, finally, cricket umpire-ish hat. He blows a brass hunting horn in fanfare to the risen sun. By 7am, it is shining golden down the High Street. Glastonbury has few chain stores; instead independent shops with colourful fronts give the impression that little has changed since yesteryear, until one looks closer at the displays – healing crystals, wands and cauldrons, incense, tarot cards, and accessories “for the discerning witch”. On Church Lane, an American visitor peers at a pair of stuffed magpies in the window of a shop offering “ethically sourced taxidermy” and declares that it reminds her of the “vegan lapdancing club” back home in Portland, Oregon. Glastonbury is the antithesis of a clone town, which comes with its own challenges. “It’s actually very difficult to buy an ordinary pair of trousers,” says Jamie George, co-owner of Gothic Image, which was, back in 1979, the first “alternative” shop here. “But you can go to the neighbouring village for that.” Outside the Lazy Gecko Cafe, a busker is singing a song from the 13th century: “Summer is icumen in …” A woman with plums in her vowels and flowers in her hair tells a new acquaintance, “Find me on Insta, dah-ling …” There is a strong sense of the centuries swirling together. There is something in the air, and not the obvious. Though Glastonbury seems to run on mead and weed, its hedonism feels rooted in something authentically numinous. One can sense this quality at the abbey. It has that mingled sadness and peace often found in ruined churches. A white dove flies through Romanesque arches, and nothing now remains of the high altar but a stone border within which irreverent dandelions refuse to bow their heads. Yet what still stands is grand and beautiful. “For a thousand years Glastonbury was the most spectacular abbey in Christendom,” says Jon Cousins, the town’s former mayor. “It was so important that in Italy they called it Roma Secunda, the Second Rome. God knows why Geoffrey Chaucer wrote about that other place.” Like many who visit and settle in Glastonbury, Cousins felt “called” there. You hear this a lot: that the town and landscape has some sort of siren presence. To help this sort of visitor, the tourist information office features a “pilgrim reception centre”, which directs “spiritual seekers” to whatever they might need, be it a Christian shrine or a Wiccan ritual. “Someone might stagger in here and say they’ve just seen Archangel Michael on the Tor,” says the centre’s founder, Morgana West. “Glastonbury has an effect on people. But we are non-judgmental.” Back out on Magdalene Street, the 376 bus to Bristol is being held up by a maypole in the road. “Blessings be for public transport,” calls a man with a green face and top hat, soothingly, to the driver. This is the Beltane procession through town. There are hundreds following, among them the Reverend Diana Greenfield, AKA “the goth vicar”, whose dog collar peeps over an elaborate mantle of leather and fur. This servant of the Church of England is strolling companionably alongside Tracy, a woman in full paganish fig – an antlered headdress wound around with ivy. Tracy is walking Oakley, a wirehaired vizsla; the Rev has her own pet, Cara the collie, on a lead. It’s a very Glastonbury, very British scene, the bonds of dog ownership being more important than differences in faith. We all climb the hill to Bushy Coombe, a green field overlooking the town. There, amid drumming and ululation, the maypole is erected. Green ribbons shimmer as people dance around. Some wag mentions the Wicker Man, of course, but that’s not quite right. Today feels more like a celebration of the community and its twin values: open mind and open heart. At around 3pm, as the last ribbon tightens around the pole, the sun disappears behind a bank of cloud and a gentle drizzle begins to fall. The ritual, it appears, has worked – dull and damp, the English summer truly is icumen in. Where to stay The Sheppey Inn is a well-regarded pub and restaurant with three en-suite rooms (£100-£120 a night) and two nearby cottages (£130 and £140 a night). Out in the wilds of the Somerset Levels, four miles from Glastonbury, it offers welcome perspective on the town. The bar, decorated with vintage toys and stuffed animals, carries an enticing selection of cocktails and local scrumpy. “We’ve tried to create a place that is true to where it is,” says owner Mark Hey, “so it feels like a giant cider barn full of weirdness.” Where to eat and drink Hundred Monkeys is an organic cafe and bakery that does a mean veggie breakfast. The Rainbows End was Glastonbury’s first vegetarian cafe; over the decades it has managed to perfect the vegan chocolate brownie. The George and Pilgrims’ is about as old as English inns get, slaking thirsts when the abbey was still a going concern, and should satisfy connoisseurs of low beams, nooks and crannies. Alternatively, the King Arthur has the town’s biggest beer garden, a sun trap full of dogs, kids and dudes with dreadlocks. What to see Glastonbury has two natural springs. The Chalice Well (£4.40 adults, £2.20 children) is associated with the legend that this is where Joseph of Arimathea buried or washed the Holy Grail, the cup used at the last supper, and therefore that the waters (which visitors can drink; they taste of iron) represent the blood of Christ. The nearby White Spring, free to enter, is a former Victorian pump-house. Repurposed as a temple, its candle-lit vaults echo with running water. A sign on the door forbids cameras and phones, warns visitors about the presence of “faerie portals”, and signals that naked bathing is acceptable. • Accommodation was provided by the Sheppey Inn"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/saturdays-best-tv-hidden-the-great-exhibition-of-the-north","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Hidden; The Great Exhibition of the North","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/saturdays-best-tv-hidden-the-great-exhibition-of-the-north","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/saturdays-best-tv-hidden-the-great-exhibition-of-the-north","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Hidden; The Great Exhibition of the North","bodyText":"Hidden 9pm, BBC Four The slate skies and desolate moors of north Wales provide a suitably unsettling backdrop for this excellent bilingual psychological thriller.

Last year, a collaboration between the OED, the BBC and the Forward Arts Foundation to find and define local English words resulted in more than 100 new regional words and phrases being added to the dictionary, from Yorkshire’s “ee bah gum” to the north east’s “cuddy wifter”, a left-handed person. Now, the OED is widening its search to English speakers around the world, with associate editor Eleanor Maier calling the early response “phenomenal”, as editors begin to draft a range of suggestions for inclusion in the dictionary. These range from Hawaii’s “hammajang”, meaning “in a disorderly or shambolic state”, to the Scottish word for a swimming costume, “dookers” or “duckers”, and New Zealand’s “munted”, meaning “broken or wrecked”. The OED is also looking to include the word “chopsy”, a Welsh term for an overly talkative person; “frog-drowner”, which Americans might use to describe a torrential downpour of rain; “brick”, which means “very cold” to residents of New Jersey and New York City; and “round the Wrekin”, meaning “in a lengthy or roundabout manner” in the Midlands. The dictionary has already found that, depending on location, a picture hanging askew might be described as “agley”, “catawampous”, “antigodlin” or “ahoo” by an English speaker, while a loved one could be called a “doy”, “pet”, “dou-dou”, “bubele”, “alanna” or“babber”. “The OED aims to cover all types of English, including standard English, scientific and technical vocabulary, literary words, slang, and regionalisms. So it’s important to include these words to enable us to present a picture of the English language in all its forms,” said Maier. The Words Where You Are appeal is looking for more suggestions. These words will go alongside the regional words suggested by members of the UK public last year, when BBC Radio listeners were asked to send in their local turns of phrase, which were later included in poems by authors including Liz Berry and Hollie McNish for a National Poetry Day project. “We were surprised and pleased by the number of regional words we were able to include as a result,” said Maier. “With the public’s suggestions as a starting point we were able to unearth a rich seam of regional vocabulary.” Some of the words suggested in the UK date back centuries, such as “zamzawed” – Devon’s term for food or a meal that has been spoiled by overcooking – to more recent coinages such as “jarg”, used in Liverpool to refer to something false or misleading. Other additions now in the OED include “antwacky”, meaning old-fashioned, and “barry”, meaning great, with more to come. Maier said that it can be difficult for the OED’s lexicographers to identify regional words, as they are more often spoken than written down, and the editors require citable evidence to include a new definition. “In recent years, resources such as Twitter have been a great way for us to monitor the words that people are using informally in particular parts of the world and this, combined with targeted appeals, allows a lot more of these words to be identified and researched,” she said. “Tarzy”, for example, is a Middlesbrough word meaning a makeshift rope swing used to swing over a river or stream. Lexicographers have so far dated it back to 2003, but Maier said that it is likely to have been used before that, with a colleague’s mother remembering using it as a child in the 1970s. The word can only have arisen in the 20th century, however, as it derives from the Edgar Rice Burroughs’ character Tarzan. “Regional words indicate that their users come from a particular place and often contribute to one’s sense of identity,” said Maier. “You know you are home when words such as tarzy … can be used in the knowledge that they will be understood.” Regional vocabulary has been included in the OED since its first edition, with many of the public’s suggestions, such as “ginnel” (an alleyway), “grockle” (a tourist), “far-welted” (describing a sheep on its back), “nesh” (cold, susceptible to cold), “clarty” (very muddy), “sneck” (a latch), “kaylied” (drunk), and “throng” (busy), already listed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/19/donald-trump-germany-immigration-angela-merkel","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T13:20:27Z","webTitle":"When it comes to Germany, there’s method in Trump’s madness | Alan Posener","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/donald-trump-germany-immigration-angela-merkel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/donald-trump-germany-immigration-angela-merkel","fields":{"headline":"When it comes to Germany, there’s method in Trump’s madness","bodyText":"I’ve given up on trying to find a method in the madness of Donald Trump’s tweets. But his recent attack on the German government at least makes political sense. Under fire over the inhumane treatment of immigrant children at the US border, Trump is telling his supporters that an overly harsh treatment of illegal immigrants is surely better than the chaos Angela Merkel’s open-door policy has created. This is what Trump tweeted: “The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!” And then: “We don’t want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us!” Now I hate to say this, and mainstream media in Germany have been lambasting Trump’s interference in German politics, but Potus has a couple of points. Merkel’s “already tenuous” coalition has indeed just weathered a storm that threatened to bring down the government. Once again the two sister parties, Merkel’s CDU and the Bavarian CSU, have been fighting over immigration. The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, until recently leader of the CSU, wants tighter controls at the German border. Merkel isn’t against a stricter border regime, but wants this to be part of a European agreement, which she hopes to achieve at an EU summit at the end of this month. Seehofer wants to turn back any refugee who is already registered in another EU country or who has already applied for asylum in Germany and been refused. In fact, he threatened to order the federal police to implement this rule – which is consistent with German asylum law – without asking the chancellor, unless she endorsed his position by Monday. The German commentariat wrote themselves into a Wagnerian Götterdämmerung frenzy. However as I write this, on Monday evening, Seehofer has backed down. As she so often does with the men who challenge her, Merkel gave him just enough rope to hang himself. It seems to have dawned on Seehofer that if Germany sends back refugees who are registered elsewhere, a country such as Italy with its new anti-immigrant government might stop registering them, as it did at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015. Unilateral action would also anger our Austrian neighbour, who would be saddled with most of the migrants Germany turns back. Here’s the paradox: Italy and Austria both have anti-immigrant governments. Ideologically, they are on the same page as Seehofer’s CSU. But that is precisely the reason they are not going to pick up the tab if Germany tightens its border regime. Merkel has common sense on her side when she argues that there has to be a European fix. So Seehofer “graciously” gave her two more weeks, upon which Merkel stated that if her minister acted unilaterally, she would tell him where to get off. Good stuff. But – and Trump is right here, again – the coalition squabble has led to sinking approval ratings for the government. And though Trump is obviously wrong when he says that migrants have “violently changed” the culture of Germany and that crime is “way up”, public sentiment at least appears to have changed in recent weeks. The shocking case of a 14-year-old Jewish girl, Susanne Feldman, who was raped and murdered, has provoked alarm, even among supporters of an open immigration policy. The prime suspect is a refugee who fled back to Iraq in the wake of her disappearance. He has since been arrested and has reportedly confessed to the crime. There has been deep disquiet over antisemitic attacks by Muslims in Germany, and this murder – though there is no evidence it was racially motivated – has shamed and angered the nation. Trump’s criticism and Seehofer’s insubordination might strengthen Merkel’s hand and bring the EU closer to a common policy on migration and refugees. Whether this will be enough to head off the frustration that has spread far beyond the populist fringe is another matter. • Alan Posener, a German blogger, writes for Die Welt and Welt am Sonntag"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/if-there-was-a-wine-world-cup-who-would-win-david-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"If there was a wine World Cup, who’d win it? | David Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/if-there-was-a-wine-world-cup-who-would-win-david-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/if-there-was-a-wine-world-cup-who-would-win-david-williams","fields":{"headline":"If there was a wine World Cup, who’d win it?","bodyText":"Darting Estate Dürkheimer Riesling, Germany 2017, £10.50, Marks &amp; Spencer A World Cup of wine wouldn’t be quite as predictable as Gary Lineker’s description of the footballing equivalent – a simple game where 22 men run around for 90 minutes and Germany always wins. But it wouldn’t be far off. The final would always bring together France and Italy, the two giants of diverse, classic fine wine at all prices, with France walking away with the trophy on penalties. But if you were looking at wines from countries with teams actually in Russia right now, sadly Italy wouldn’t make the cut. Nor would wine heavyweights Chile, the USA, South Africa and New Zealand. Still, the defending football champions, Germany, would go deep in the vinous tournament with in-form, pristine, energetic dry whites such as Darting Estate’s riesling. Ai Galera Poetico, Portugal 2016, £6.99, Hennings Wine; Cheers; Noble Green At least 20 of the 32 countries with teams in Russia have wine industries of significant scale. Among them Japan, with its whispery, subtle, sushi-friendly dry whites made from the koshu grape, such as Sol Lucet Koshu 2017 (£14, Marks &amp; Spencer) would make the last 16. So too would England’s increasingly confident young team led by a sprinkling of world-class sparkling stars such as the nervy, toasty Wiston Estate Brut NV (£24.95, Wiston Estate). But the big European teams have strength in depth: the French squad includes classy, peppery southern reds such as Domaine Gayda Syrah, IGP Pays d’Oc 2016 (from £8.22, Cambridge Wine). And from Portugal comes the brambly fruit burst of Ail Galera Poetico, by a rising star south of Lisbon.

There’s also the regional powerhouse, Argentina, with such fine Bordeaux-esque reds as the gorgeously glossy, pure black-fruited Angulo Innocenti Cabernet Sauvignon, Mendoza 2013 (£15.99, Kwoff). All three countries would struggle to deal with the greater range of two others for at least a place in the semis: Spain, with such absurdly good-value plump fruitiness as the Co-op’s Spanish Garnacha (£4.99) and Australia, represented here by the excellent raspberry-scented pinot made for Asda by De Bortoli.

From the get-go he came out pretty good and I wasn’t expecting anything less really to be honest. I feel good, I was out for two-and-a-half months, I had my return in Stuttgart and I’m feeling good ahead of Wimbledon.” Kyrgios pushes the first shot wide – a simple forehand – to gift Murray a 15-0 lead. That’s the fuel required to psyche Kyrgios into game-mode, who promptly sends a punishing forehand return beyond Murray. They jostle to 30-30, with Murray playing a powder-puff backhand eking towards the net and then strikes wide. A third match point is laid on a plate, with Kyrgios obliging to take it this time. How? A painstaking double-fault means Murray ends an impressive comeback performance on a bum-note. Third set: Murray 6-2, 6-7, 5-6 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Every point is being met with a roaring cheer from the bulk of Queen’s; Murray’s arrowing return to level at 30-30 a prime example. They seesaw to deuce, at which point Kyrgios seizes advantage with a monstrous serve. And his 18th ace wraps it up. Third set: Murray* 6-2, 6-7, 5-5 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray clings in there, surviving two match points, with Kyrgios’s rasping attempt at a forehand winner clattering the top of the net in the first, and getting a little lady luck during the second. Queen’s Club is back on its feet; what a momentous effort by Murray. Third set: Murray 6-2, 6-7, 4-5 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios races to 40-0 but Murray plays a marvellous sweeping backhand to give him a leg-up. But it’s a galling finish to the game, with the ball jetting up into the sky, and Kyrgios taking his time before sending the ball lashing beyond Murray. Third set: Murray* 6-2, 6-7, 4-4 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray breezes through a game in double quicktime just when it seems he is about to come unstuck. Third set: Murray 6-2, 6-7, 3-4 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): It just seems to be getting away from Murray now. But, then again, it’s impossible to predict anything when Kyrgios is involved. Will he go on to close out victory? Third set: Murray* 6-2, 6-7, 3-3 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray dips into the reserve tank to fight his way to lead 40-30. But then he returns to the middle of court, essentially into Kyrgios’s baying open arms. From deuce, a faltering Murray continues to fight his corner and a whipped-up crowd help him through; he’s absolutely blowing out there, though this is brilliant training. Meanwhile, in Birmingham, Johanna Konta has lost 6-3, 6-4 to the defending champion Petra Kvitova in the Nature Valley Classic first round. Third set: Murray 6-2, 6-7, 2-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): They are seemingly taking it turns to rally around, with Kyrgios upping the ante this time. Third set: Murray* 6-2, 6-7, 2-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): A puff of the cheeks after a off-colour backhand speaks volumes, with the going a little tough for Murray. That’s followed up by a double-fault. But, with Kyrgios in the driving seat, Murray digs deep to turn things around, with a wayward forehand by the Australian helping the Briton over the line. Third set: Murray 6-2, 6-7, 1-2 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): The Australian’s monstrous second serve helps him to a 40-30 lead before staving off Murray, who seems to be fighting with his own body here, unsurprisingly aching. Third set: Murray* 6-2, 6-7, 1-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Well, Murray rescues an important hold of serve, just as things seemed to be going against him. He lost an early challenge in what looked like being a miserable game. Murray seemed to be becoming agitated, frustrated and, undoubtedly fatigued, after acquiring a niggling back issue – but he pulls through from deuce. Third set: Murray 6-2, 6-7, 0-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): A cunning, disguised backhand helps Kyrgios to 30-0. And after a long time away, it increasingly seems Murray could probably have done with wrapping things up inside two sets. The Australian wins it, 7-4 on the tie-break. Second set: Murray 6-2, 6-6 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): 4-6 ... Second set: Murray 6-2, 6-6 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): 4-5 ... Second set: Murray 6-2, 6-6 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): 3-4 in the tie-break ... Murray is fighting hard to find a way back in. Second set: Murray 6-2, 6-6 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios steamrollers into a 3-1 tie-break lead, powering home his serves ... Second set: Murray 6-2, 6-6 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios picks out a couple of beautiful shots, the last of which results in a tie-break; a sweeping forehand down the line. When he fancies it, Kyrgios is a wonderful player. Can Murray eke out the win? Second set: Murray* 6-2, 6-5 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray leads this second set once more, the just reward for his steely determination to stay in points. Second set: Murray 6-2, 5-5 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Ah. “As great as it is to see Andy Murray back in action, it’s going to play havoc with my summer schedule,” emails Simon McMahon. “World Cup football, cricket, golf and now tennis too. How many live commentaries can someone follow at once?” Second set: Murray* 6-2, 5-4 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray lets out a huge roar after more brilliant tennis. With the momentum from that previous game still in his system, he grinds through the gears to win four fabulous points in a row to hold serve. He’s grooving now, and has a great chance to wrap this up. Will Kyrgios implode or come up trumps to deny Murray a simple finish? Second set: Murray 6-2, 4-4 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): A stunning two-handed cross-court backhand by Murray brings dozens of the Queen’s Club to its feet. But Kyrgios ups the ante a little, powering an unstoppable forehand down the line to get to 40-15. Two sloppy shots by Kyrgios – one straight into the net with the court gaping – allow Murray a route back in. And he takes it with aplomb. Second set: Murray* 6-2, 3-4 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray steamrollers to 40-0 and the other – more erratic – side of Kyrgios’s game is exposed once more. Second set: Murray 6-2, 2-4 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Kyrgios exhibits a few more tricks on his way to very nearly throwing away his two-game cushion. Murray almost comes up trumps after fighting back from 40-15 but Kyrgios stays in it and eventually prospers. Will he go on from here to take the set? Second set: Murray* 6-2, 2-3 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Just as it seems Murray is beginning to show a bit of rustiness, with a double-break looming, the Briton powers through, finishing with an ace for an impressive hold. Second set: Murray 6-2, 1-3 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): A couple of forehand errors and then a long backhand gifts Kygrios a second straight game. Second set: Murray* 6-2, 1-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): It’s turning to a bit of a slanging match, this second set. You wonder how much Kyrgios’s moping is eating away at Murray, who has otherwise looked strong and focused. Kyrgios has twice broken Murray but, on court, he looks like a man 6-0 down. Second set: Murray 6-2, 1-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Murray breaks straight back. Second set: Murray* 6-2, 0-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios seems to be in one of those destructive, cantankerous moods out there. He’s swaggering round centre court, but this time his quality outweighs Murray’s best efforts. Kyrgios is a fascinating individual, teeming with raw ability but the Australian’s not seemingly always intent on showing it. An old-school sore loser. After Murray returns a thumping serve, Kyrgios doesn’t even bother trying to move to respond. Murray soars into a 40-0 lead before the Australian slams in an ace. But, other than that, once things began to not go his way, Kyrgios has given up the ghost, merely whacking shots as hard as possible. Murray won’t mind, though. First set: Murray* 5-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Kyrgios looks a little guilty of tanking out there, disengaged, strutting and shaking his head. As for Murray, he’s back in business and this return could not have gone any better, really. First set: Murray 4-2 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): They seesaw at deuce for a few minutes, before Kyrgios loses his cool, slamming the ball into the net in frustration as he surrenders advantage. Back comes Murray, after another Kyrgios tweener, but he cannot seize the game. Kyrgios powers in an awesome ace, before Murray – somehow – returns a dastardly backhand. Revved-up, the Australian slams a 142mph ace straight down the middle but – again – he can’t finish things off. So, Murray fights back one more time and this time takes it. First set: Murray* 3-2 Kyrgios (*denotes server): A thudding ace sets the tone for Murray, who looks pretty sprightly out on centre court, in his first competitive game since 12 July. Kyrgios’s trick shots are keeping things light too. And, just as the game seems to be getting away from Murray, he digs deep to clinch a third straight service game. He’s missed a couple of ground strokes out there but, otherwise, Murray looks fit, his shots refined, and, so far, he’s firing. First set: Murray 2-2 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): Level-pegging. First set: Murray* 2-1 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray seems to be moving more than OK, shifting cross-court to reach a low backhand. And then more fun and games, courtesy of Kygrios, twice – mid-rally – returning between his legs, much to the explicit delight of the watching spectators. But, after all that, Murray holds serve in a tight game, with a spot of rain the only blemish on centre court. Murray looks momentarily squeamish before getting on with it. First set: Murray 1-1 Kyrgios* (*denotes server): A touch of showboating by Kyrgios at 30-15, swivelling 360 degrees to smash home a forehand. And then a roaring ace, all of 140mph, to finish off Murray and pull level. First set: Murray* 1-0 Kyrgios (*denotes server): Murray, a five-time champion at Queen’s, makes a rasping start but a weak forehand and then an awkward attempt at a winner allow the world No 21 to pull level at 30-30. At deuce, Kyrgios plays a devious, dinked drop shot to earn advantage but Murray powers home a forehand return level. And then a hefty ace. It’s been a healthy start. Murray trudges out on to centre court at Queen’s, given a standing ovation by all in the stands, including Judy, his mother. He replies with a hearty wave. We’ll be thrust into the action shortly, after a quick knockaround with Kyrgios. Andy Murray’s up next on centre court, then. “The expectations for me are very low right now,” he says. “Nick [Kyrgios] had a good run in Stuttgart and when he’s on it, he’s one of the best players in the world, no doubt about it.” Djokovic speaks. “It’s great to be back, it’s eight years since I played here last,” he says. “It’s one of the most beautiful tennis courts that we get to play on round the world. England has a long tennis tradition and it’s great to be on the court. I have struggled a little bit in the last year-and-a-half that has forced me to compensate my game and that has taken a little confidence out of me. I’m trying to get it back.” Djokovic, remember, will also play doubles with Stan Wawrinka at Queen’s. It’s quite the lineup in west London this week. Two match points but Djokovic requires only the one, sealing victory with a cute forehand down the line. On his return to Queen’s, Djokovic had his opponent shifting across court, almost poking fun at the Australian at times. That was fairly routine but things will get tougher, with Dimitrov awaiting Djokovic. Centre court murmurs with the sound of a job well done for the former world No 1. Second set: Millman 2-6, 1-5 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic is within touching distance of wrapping this one up now. Apart from that monstrous fifth game, the Serb has made pretty light work of Millman. Second set: Millman* 2-6, 1-4 Djokovic (*denotes server): A bit hit and miss from Djokovic, summed up by a wayward forehand down the line. Then a big serve at a big moment helps Millman to deuce, simultaneously avoiding a double-break. But it proves just a minor bump in the road, as Djokovic hangs in there, in by far and away the longest game of this match: 14 minutes long. Millman comes unstuck with a tame effort at the net before – eventually – firing a forehand wide. A mammoth effort, nevertheless. Second set: Millman 2-6, 1-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Normal service is resumed, with Djokovic breezing to 40-0, his serve no match for Millman. Second set: Millman* 2-6, 1-2 Djokovic (*denotes server): Millman raises an arm in celebration, is there any way back in for the Australian? Second set: Millman 2-6, 0-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server): A swooning volley racks up another service game for the Serb; it’s all very comfortable. Second set: Millman* 2-6, 0-1 Djokovic (*denotes server): A hands on hips moment as Djokovic wellies a simple forehand into the net at 15-0. But that frustration is not long-lasting, with the Serb battling back, to deuce and then advantage. And then Millman, the world No 63, hits a his forehand long. Second set: Millman* 2-6, 0-0 Djokovic (*denotes server): A wheezing security alarm has stopped play ... it’s a strange time for a break-in. Suddenly, Djokovic finds himself cruising. First set: Millman* 2-5 Djokovic (*denotes server): Djokovic races to 40-0, and though he’s made to work for it, he has a double-break and more importantly a stranglehold in this opening set. First set: Millman 2-4 Djokovic* (*denotes server): Djokovic turns on the style, with a wondrous drop shot on his backhand. That levers him to 30-15, only for Millman to restore parity with a smarting cross-court forehand. It prove insufficient in toppling Djokovic, though, as he powers home the serve. First set: Millman* 2-3 Djokovic (*denotes server): Millman’s a little wasteful, struggles to put Djokovic away at 40-15 and is punished in vintage style, with a powerful forehand down the line. That earns advantage and Djokovic successfully breaks, showing stamina to win a slogging rally. First set: Millman 2-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server): The Australian does brilliant to come out on top of a gruelling rally to take it to 30-0; a gutsy response when seemingly put on the ropes by Djokovic. But his hard work comes undone after a rather pathetic challenge of Djokovic’s first serve and the former world No 1 fights back to take the game. And a little low-key fist pump to boot. First set: Millman* 2-1 Djokovic (*denotes server): Millman plays a wonderful low backhand get to take 15-0 before his serve helps him to 30-15. Djokovic then plays what looks a routine drawn backhand wide before going painfully long. First set: Millman 1-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server): A fairly comfortable hold for Djokovic but he’s certainly still easing his way into things. First set: Millman* 1-0 Djokovic (*denotes server): A flying start by Millman, breezing to 40-0 with no bother at all, finding particular joy off his serve. But Djokovic feels his way in but pays for his slow start, with a weak forehand striking the net and giving the Australian a leg-up and a healthy start. Djokovic and Millman are out on court warming up. Back on grass, it will be interesting to see how the three-time Wimbledon champion – who has been bogged down with an elbow injury over the past couple of years – shapes up. “Right now I’m playing with no pain, which is great and refreshing,” he says. “It means I can focus on my game and go back to that confident state of mind.” A few moments ago, Grigor Dimitrov dispatched Damir Dzumhur 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 on centre court, sealing the game with an ace. Djokovic is next up and, either he or John Millman, the Australian qualifier, will face Dimitrov in the next round. Dan Evans, a wildcard after his one-year ban for a positive drugs test, and Kyle Edmund are also both in action later this afternoon. “A part of me maybe thought just start again, doing something else,” Evans says. “I had a lot of time to think. I was on my own so much, a lot of time to think about what I had done, not just to myself but a lot of people I had let down.” Muzza is back, and so is Djokovic, presumably no longer narky, instead fresh after recovering from a disappointing exhibition at the French Open. Andy Murray’s return after a year out with a troublesome hip injury is the big event, though, let’s not kid ourselves. So much so, that Murray says winning will take a backseat in his first competitive match since that defeat to Sam Querrey last July at Wimbledon. In many ways, Queen’s Club provides the perfect backdrop for the chance to build fitness. “I’m not putting pressure on myself to win,” Murray said. “I’m more concerned with how I feel on court.” We’ll soon find out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2018/jun/20/robots-public-sector-ai-right-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T07:38:04Z","webTitle":"Robots in the public sector?

Bring them on - with the right investment","bodyText":"Earlier this week I heard a robot construct an argument in response to a human being: in San Francisco, IBM’s Project Debater spoke, listened and rebutted. It made me realise the speed at which artificial intelligence is developing. It is not a case that the robots are coming – they are here, and that means the government and public sector managers need to get into the driving seat and start taking some control. Members of the Prospect union include some of the most highly qualified scientists and engineers in the country. Many are on the AI frontline: they are developing this new technology, and they are also affected by it. One of our members, for instance, works in scientific data management, curating large data sets from the natural environment. As a data architect, part of her job was to check the quality and integrity of the data being loaded to the database. She then wrote a computer programs to do the same thing. “I suppose you could say I coded myself out of a job,” she says. “I didn’t see it as cheating myself out of work. If there’s routine work that can be done by a machine, I think my time and my skills are better spent on something more creative and interesting,” she adds. As a result, this professional spends more time developing strategies to manage data from new environmental monitoring technologies, as well as work on international projects. AI is reducing demand for people working on routine, technical tasks. Jobs of the future will be more likely to emphasise human qualities that robots cannot replicate, such as creativity and empathy. This is why it is so important for staff to be consulted AI developments in their workplace. There are a number of ways in which technology has the potential to change the relationship between staff and employers. Using algorithms and AI could help find more rational approaches to social and political change, for instance. And while there are ethical questions about computers managing people, there may also be some benefits, such as a reduction in sexual harassment, or opportunities to share more information and increase collaboration, which would be beneficial to trade unions. Rather than ignoring the current imbalance or power in the workplace, this could an opportunity to reset the relationship, whether people work in the private or public sector. Frontline workers often have the best vantage point to solve productivity problems. They are vital to developing technological solutions, but they must be assured a fair share of the rewards. Few people question the implications and ethics of AI more deeply than those developing it: “I know people worry about losing their jobs to technology,” the member told us, “but what concerned me more was that I was writing software that essentially supervised how my colleagues were doing their jobs.” This is just one ethical concern. Others include hardwiring existing biases into AI, which may then be presented as objective. This could have affect recruitment, immigration, healthcare and many other areas. We already know there are bias problems in recruitment in many areas such as science, technology, engineering and maths, where men are overrepresented. If large datasets are used based on current recruitment and performance management data there is a risk that algorithms will perpetuate existing problems. A similar scenario could also be played out in a key public sector function monitoring and implementing immigration policy. Human-led policy in this area have already resulted in badly thought- out processes, as we have recently seen with the Windrush scandal. If AI is blindly created without proper scrutiny there is a risk of similarly flawed logic being put into practice and being portrayed as objective decision making. It takes human intervention to weed out these biases, which trade unions have been helping do it for years, and we need to be in a position to keep doing it. Algorithms should model real-world phenomena, and if they are going to be applied to workplace decisions about our members, we need to know how those decisions are made, and the models must be scientifically defensible. The public sector has an opportunity to address these issues and set the gold standard of how AI is implemented in the workplace. But this requires the right level of investment. The government AI sector deal announced earlier this year included the creation of a £20m fund to support tech businesses providing innovative and more efficient public services. But this is only a fraction of the funding that will be needed to really allow the government to deliver on this ambition. There are so many opportunities to engage workers, increase productivity and deliver better services for the public. Rather than watching AI from a distance, the government must participate in these changes and get it right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/jun/21/pathologists-the-lab-nhs-patients","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T11:36:26Z","webTitle":"Pathologists like me save lives daily.

Yet so few people know what we do","bodyText":"Anyone who watched BBC2’s fly-on-the-wall documentary Hospital might have heard of “the lab”. I am one of many who work there – and as a pathologist I often feel, as many of my lab colleagues do, like a forgotten or unknown entity. There are nearly 20 disciplines of pathology – and that number is growing – and 70% of all diagnoses made in the NHS involve pathology and biomedical science. The Royal College of Pathologists’ annual report [pdf] tells us that more than a billion tests are carried out annually – and NHS England says the number of pathology tests [pdf] equates to 14 for each person in England and Wales. Sound impressive? Then why are we seen as back office staff by other professionals, with nobody fully understanding what we do? People often assume I deal with dead bodies when I tell them I work in a pathology lab. Postmortem pathologists account for about 1% of the pathology workforce. My colleagues in the lab issue blood products to the scene of a car accident, and carry out screening tests to make sure a newborn baby doesn’t have a condition that would otherwise not get diagnosed until it is too late. They receive tissue from colons or breasts removed during surgery to see if a surgeon has fully got rid of a tumour; they assist in postmortems so that they might answer some of the questions a family may have – and help to ease their pain. Pathologists and biomedical scientists also see what antibiotic would work best for you to help tackle antimicrobial resistance; they investigate hereditary disease so that any future generations might avoid the same illness. This is just a small insight into what we provide as a service. Just because we’re not patient-facing, don’t be under any illusion that we care about them any less. On a number of occasions I’ve left work in tears, trying to get it all out of my system before going home to my family. Sometimes I feel it’s unfair that we know a patient’s diagnosis before they do, because we either see the results from the analyser or produce reports and these get discussed by healthcare professionals in order to approach the patient with treatment or management options. I know that there’s no way of fixing this. However, it still doesn’t feel just or right. Many of us in the NHS spend much of our day feeling guilty: guilty that we can’t do more, guilty that we’re healthy and the patients we care for aren’t – and guilty because in order to care for patients we miss out on our own family time. However, we still spend more of our time helping to deliver good news rather than bad. I remember a case from when I was on rotation in a blood bank many years ago. Doctors and porters were constantly coming up to the department for blood products, because as soon as any blood went into the patient being treated, it was just as quickly coming back out because their injuries were so severe. The patient made what can only be described as a miraculous recovery. The blood bank and Welsh Blood Service played a huge part – yet that patient, and their family, will probably be unaware of this. Another great part of my job is when we get a request for an urgent result or report and we work hard together to deliver the results – or when we find out which specific cancer someone has, so that patient can start their treatment immediately. It’s great being part of something that can make such a big difference to people’s lives. I’m not demoralised and fed up – quite the opposite, in fact. I just want to highlight the variety of work we do and how it impacts on patient care. We are pathologists, biomedical scientists, associate practitioners, medical lab assistants and admin and clerical staff. We play a vital role in not just assisting in diagnosis, but also advising on the treatment and management of patients. Pathology work goes on day and night, every day of the year. I feel so fortunate to have found a career I have fallen in love with – even if bits of it are gory.

Whereas a decade ago rocket salads, Argentine steaks and sushi were all the rage, now – because of economic sanctions and a renewed patriotic mood – high calibre chefs are rediscovering their Slavic roots. They have started to use forgotten or newly created ingredients, such as local marbled beef and Russian mozzarella, and old cooking methods, involving the use of pechka ovens. For most Russians, eating out is still a special occasion, so even the most “democratic” places (a popular term to refer to more relaxed, less exclusive places) invest in expensive design, fabric napkins and table service. With some 12,000 restaurants in this sprawling city, we asked six Muscovite gourmands for their favourites. StrEAT “Venture outside of the touristy centre by taking the metro to Avtozavodskaya station for this gastronomical street,” says chef Karina Baldry who grew up in Moscow during Soviet times. “The food courts of my youth were either bare-shelved or exclusively for the top party echelons.” By contrast, StrEAT offers more than 30 street food stalls (mainly start-ups or small chains) from across the world: Lavka sells Dagestan-style flat pies (£1 a slice), and Crimean oysters; Kurkuma is very popular with a younger crowd for its version of Indian tikka masala, despite Russians traditionally being spice-averse. Opened in April 2018, in the not-quite-gentrified neighbourhood, StrEAT offers affordable prices (£3-£10 per dish) in a communal setting with diners sharing long tables. Karina recommends Georgian khinkali dumplings, pot-bellied pleated parcels with a mixture of beef and pork inside: “To eat them, you hold the dumpling by its doughy knot and carefully bite to suck the stock juices first, then munch on the rest. Delicious.” • Ulitsa Leninskaya Sloboda 26, on Facebook, open daily 9am-10pm Recommended by Karina Baldry, author of Russia on a Plate and co-founder of Produkt pop-up dinners in London Uhvat The word uhvat refers to a long-handled wooden utensil used to slide food in and out of a pechka, a wood-fired oven found in many Russian houses until the late 19th century. Uhvat is one of the restaurants leading the resurgence in traditional Slavic cooking, with slow-cooked dishes such as pumpkin kashas (a type of porridge) with honey and linden dressing (£3.50), baked roe with pickled bramble (£14) schchi soups with fermented cabbage and chichelindas, an old recipe for pate, here made with ox tail (£5). Don’t leave without tasting toplyonoe moloko, a thick creamy dessert made by baking milk for several hours. The pechka oven features in many Russian fairytales – the Baba Yaga witch shoves children into ovens – and takes the centre stage at Uhvat. Daily rituals, such as using goose feathers to dust out the ashes, enhance the magical atmosphere. • Rochdelskaya street 15-41, uhvat.moscow, open daily noon-midnight Recommended by Pavel Syutkin, food historian, blogger and author of the USSR Cook Book Oblomov Tile-clad fireplaces, huge pechka ovens, plush chairs: Oblomov recreates the world of well-heeled and well-fed merchants of 19th century Russia. Oblomov is a character in the eponymous classic novel by Ivan Goncharov. There’s so much attention to detail that even the pet parrot here swears in literary Russian. However, the menu is much more than gimmickry. For a stylish lunch on a budget, start with home-pickled porcini mushrooms (£7), followed by veal and lardo borscht (£5) with half a dozen (“no less!” the menu says) little meat pies (£6). Make sure you’ve space for some home-made wild strawberry ice-cream for pudding (£5). • First Monetchikovsky pereulok 5, restoblomov.ru, open daily noon-midnight Recommended by Pavel Syutkin Severyane “When non-Russian friends visit me in Moscow I try to show them Russia beyond its matryoshka dolls” says Alexander Sysoev, founder of the Russian Restaurant Festival. Alexander suggests starting the day at Severyane (which means “northerners”, referring to the Russian north that has been piquing the interest of Moscow chefs lately). There are twists on traditional cuisine, such as pike caviar on poached eggs (£4), blinis with Russian pastrami (£5), eclairs with crab (£11) from the Kamchatka peninsula (a region that is closer to Tokyo than to Moscow). The dimly lit atmosphere – “a cross between a Siberian hut and Hogwarts, with shaman music” as Alexander puts it – and breakfast until 4pm, makes Severyane a good option for those who’ve been partying the night before. If you come back in the evening (you should, for the slow-roasted duck with apples, £10, for example), order vodka “after which any soul would Russify,” adds Alexander. • Bolshaya Nikitskaya 12, severyane.moscow, open daily 9am-midnight Recommended by Alexander Sysoev, founder of the Russian restaurant festival Lepim-varim This is Russian fast food par excellence: the dumplings are made from scratch on-site – “Lepim-varim” means shaping and boiling. One of a small chain specialising in pelmeni (a Russian version of ravioli), options include “uncle from Kamchatka” (king crab from the far east of Russia), “a mad couple” (venison and boar) and “the Caucasian prisoner” (stretchy Georgian Suluguni cheese). Order at the counter and give your name, just like in Starbucks. Regular long queues prove the success of the concept: from students to government officials and businessmen. “Ravioli are fine, of course, but pelmeni are so much better,” says Alexander. • Several branches, try the one on Prospekt Mira, 26-1, lepimivarim.ru, open daily 11am-midnight Recommended by Alexander Sysoev Ottepel “I was too little to remember Soviet realities but at Ottepel my genetic memory kicks in, registering such details as classic Soviet bevelled glasses and a separate menu section of buterbrody open sandwiches,” says Muscovite foodie Katerina Afonchenkova. These sandwiches (recently renamed bruschettas on the menu) were typical of Soviet canteens, with toppings such as rye with Latvian sprats, or herring and baked beetroot. Ottepel means thaw, referring to the period from 1953 to 1964 under Nikita Khrushchev when the communist regime was relaxed. This kind of nostalgia for the “good old Soviet days” can so easily be overdone with kitsch design elements – the venue is the restored Soviet exhibition pavilion after all – but Ottepel manages to get the balance right. The menu is vaguely Europeanised, but try some reinterpreted Soviet classics, like beetroot borscht soup with duck (£5) or fried potato cakes with mushrooms and marinated onions (£6). • Prospekt mira, 119 building 311, ottepel-restoran.ru, open daily noon-1pm Recommended by Katerina Afonchenkova, director of restaurant marketing agency FoodisPR Staff canteen at Arbatskaya metro station Few know that you can dine deep within the belly of Moscow’s famous palatial metro system (the first lines were built in the 1930s under Stalin). These staff canteens mainly serve train drivers and metro personnel, but are also open to public. One of the quirkiest is Buffet Number 11 (canteens, shops and many other things were numbered during Soviet times) within Arbatskaya station. In a 1930s style, with cashiers wearing starched caps and walls covered in old-school propaganda posters, the menu has traditional Soviet “complex lunches”, including a vitaminnyj salad of shredded carrots and cabbage, a plate of borscht and light cheesecakes with fruit compote. The prices are Soviet-style too, £3-5 for the lunch menu. • Arbatskaya metro station, no website or phone number, open daily 8am-7pm Recommended by Katerina Afonchenkova Pasticceria Don Giulio “The best cannoli in Moscow” states Dmitrij Alekseyev, a food journalist. The bakery and cafe, which also has a satellite restaurant, was set up by expat Italians in the 1990s. The pastries are made in-house daily with Russian ricotta, and strike that perfect Sicilian balance of crispy dough, light cream, citrus and dark chocolate. Try the ricotta cheese in syrniki, a type of cheesecake served with pistachio cream (£3.50). Soups are popular lunch options here, like borlotti beans with sun dried tomatoes (£3) or try the homemade sausages served with sliced oranges (£5.50). Risotto starts from £5.30. The jolly atmosphere created by Giulio, the owner, is what brings many punters back from Muscovite hipsters to Italian expats longing for dishes without dill (the herb Russians use like seasoning). Prices are chilled too, with small mark ups on wines – nothing short of a miracle in the centre of Moscow. • Pokrovka 27 building 1, dongiulio.ru, Mon-Thurs 10am-10pm, Fri-Sun 10am-11pm Recommended by Dmitrij Alekseyev, food journalist and a restaurant critic for restoran.ruDorogomilovsky market How to experience Russian chic on the cheap? Come to Dorogomilovsky food market (Moscow’s equivalent of London’s Borough Market) at around 10am and get a baguette from Khlebnaya Kroshka (The Breadcrumb), then top with slices of wild salmon, smoked on alder or apple tree chips from fish stall 355c (numbers are sometimes used instead of names); or fetch a peeled pomegranate to go with a lepyoshka flatbread stuffed with lots of herbs. • Ulitsa Mozhayskiy Val 10, on Facebook, open daily 7am-8pm Recommended by Arusya Gukasyan, chef and owner of seafood restaurant Rico Cafe at the Kyrgyzstan embassy You could spend weeks trawling through varieties of dumplings across Moscow, from Siberian pelmeni to Georgian khinkali. Some of the best are manti, dished up in the canteen of the embassy of Kyrgyzstan, the Central Asian country on the ancient trade route between China and the Mediterranean. These parcels have wrinkly dough and are filled with juicy minced lamb. “The meat comes from animals normally fed on grass and wild thyme,” Arusya says. The filling must have a generous amount of lamb fat, so best if you have them with a mildly sparkling ayran yoghurt drink or hot tea. The somewhat outdated interior of the restaurant and waitresses in colourful traditional headscarfs make the setting all the more authentic. “Like sitting in a cafe somewhere in the Near East,” adds Arusya. • Bolshaya Ordynka 62C 1, restaurant-1768.business.site, open daily 10am-11pm Recommended by Arusya Gukasyan"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/19/rival-beekeepers-blamed-over-rise-in-hive-heists-in-belgium","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T16:26:02Z","webTitle":"Rogue beekeepers and dirty tricks blamed for rise in Belgian hive heists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/rival-beekeepers-blamed-over-rise-in-hive-heists-in-belgium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/rival-beekeepers-blamed-over-rise-in-hive-heists-in-belgium","fields":{"headline":"Rogue beekeepers and dirty tricks blamed for rise in Belgian hive heists","bodyText":"Dirty tricks by rival beekeepers have been blamed for a rise in hive thefts in Belgium after huge growth in interest in the hobby. Following the disappearance of 150,000 bees from hives near the Flemish town of Tessenderlo, keepers have been advised to keep a keen eye on their insects and alert the police to suspicious activity. Luc Aspeslagh, chair of the General Flemish Beekeepers Association, said he had received a growing number of reports of thefts from Belgian apiaries. Such was the difficulty and danger in stealing bees that the thieves were most likely to have come from within the beekeeping community, he said. Aspeslagh told De Standaard newspaper: “In recent years I have noticed an increase in the number of cases. Bees – and their value – are more of an interest nowadays. “A layman can at most steal the honey from a cabinet [holding a beehive]. Maybe a beekeeper does not have any bees after the winter and therefore he is looking for a quality new bee population. Or it is someone who wants to benefit from the potential yields of a hive. We also see that there is just jealousy in the game: beekeepers who will remove the better bees from someone else.” The thieves in the Tessenderlo case are believed to have had to use a trailer to carry away the hives, such was the size of the haul. Should they pot the honey and sell it at the market rate, it is estimated they could make as much as €1,000 from the crime. The bees’ keeper, named only as Patrick, said the remaining bees had reacted badly to the theft. “The thieves must have come with a trailer, because the beehives do not fit in the car and are too heavy to carry alone”, he said. “The remaining bees are traumatised and aggressive.” The bees had been the subject of monitoring by the University of Ghent as part of research on pollen, and the study will have to start afresh next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/22/wimbledon-has-made-no-progress-on-male-bias-on-top-show-courts-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T11:15:36Z","webTitle":"Wimbledon 'has made no progress' on male bias on top show courts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/22/wimbledon-has-made-no-progress-on-male-bias-on-top-show-courts-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/22/wimbledon-has-made-no-progress-on-male-bias-on-top-show-courts-tennis","fields":{"headline":"Wimbledon 'has made no progress' on male bias on top show courts","bodyText":"Wimbledon is behind the times when it comes to gender parity with a distinct lack of progress on affording women equal time on the championships’ main show courts over the past 25 years, it has been claimed. The novelist, campaigner and tennis fan Mark Leyland found that in every year from 1993 to 2017 more men’s than women’s matches were scheduled on Centre and No 1 courts with an average of 61% men’s and 39% women’s matches. Taking into account that men’s matches are longer than women’s, it suggests that two-and-a-half times more men’s than women’s play has been seen on these courts during the period covered, he says – and the discrepancy shows little sign of narrowing. Leyland calculated last year’s split as 58% to 32% in favour of men. He had released research before the tournament showing an overwhelming gender bias in 2015 and 2016. His latest research, shared exclusively with the Guardian, examines the imbalance over a longer period. To illustrate the lack of progress, Leyland highlights the case of the women’s No 4 seed, Elina Svitolina, who played four matches without ever being scheduled on a main show court last year, while the men’s eighth seed, Dominic Thiem, played his first three matches on No 1 Court. He said: “The 2017 movie Battle of the Sexes portrays representatives of the 1970s world tennis authorities trying to justify vastly different levels of prize money by claiming that men’s play was more exciting and better to watch. The authorities at Wimbledon make no such claims to justify their own inequitable system, insisting that they value fairness and do not intentionally favour the men. “They persist in blaming the imbalance on the complexities of a system which has long since achieved equality at the other grand slam tournaments, an argument which defies all logic. But it may be felt that their actions, in scheduling more men’s than women’s matches on their main show courts every year for more than a quarter of a century, speak louder than their words.” After Leyland’s analysis was published before last year’s tournament, there was more controversy when, on the second Monday, all four men’s matches were scheduled for the main show courts but only two of four women’s matches. That prompted Andy Murray to join those calling for an equal split. The latest statistics have been published as Serena Williams, winner of 23 grand slam singles titles, prepares to return to the tournament, which starts on Monday 2 July, for the first time since giving birth. Williams and her sister, Venus, winner of seven grand slam titles, have complained in the past of being relegated to smaller courts and Leyland’s analysis suggests they were right to be disgruntled. He found that in the decade from 2007 to 2016, over the first four rounds, Roger Federer played 31 times on Centre Court (84% of his matches), six times on No 1 Court (16%) and never anywhere else. By contrast, Serena Williams played 18 times (55%) on Centre, seven times (21%) on No 1, and on eight occasions (24%) on the much smaller Courts 2 or 3. Since first winning the tournament in 2003, Federer has never had any match scheduled anywhere but the main show courts, while Serena Williams, who first won in 2002, has often been scheduled elsewhere, he said. On only two occasions since 1995 have either the men’s No 1 or No 2 been scheduled to play elsewhere than on a main show court – Goran Ivanisevic and Andy Roddick in 1997 and 2004 respectively, both years that were severely affected by rain, Leyland found. By contrast, there was only one occasion (2000) when the top two women’s seeds played all their six first-week matches on the main courts. A spokeswoman for the All England Lawn Tennis Club said it had not seen the latest analysis in detail but claimed previous analyses had offered an incomplete representation of scheduling. She added: “It is fair to say that the expectation of the public has tended to be one of the most important considerations when scheduling matches, particularly regarding Centre and No 1 Courts, and this has been exacerbated in a current golden era of men’s tennis. “However, these expectations are changing as the eras of tennis change. The scheduling at the championships will reflect this over time, and there will be variations from year to year depending on the way the draw falls.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/st-leonards-london-not-so-much-a-meal-out-as-a-funfair-ride-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T04:59:17Z","webTitle":"St Leonards, London: ‘Not so much a meal out as a funfair ride’ – restaurant review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/st-leonards-london-not-so-much-a-meal-out-as-a-funfair-ride-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/st-leonards-london-not-so-much-a-meal-out-as-a-funfair-ride-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"St Leonards, London: ‘Not so much a meal out as a funfair ride’ – restaurant review","bodyText":"St Leonards, 70 Leonard Street, London EC2 (020 7739 1291). Meal for two including drinks and service £75-£120. There is a thin line between “That’s genius” and “What in God’s name were they thinking?” At St Leonards, a new restaurant from chefs Jackson Boxer and Andrew Clarke of Brunswick House in Vauxhall, they walk both sides of that line. If what you want from a restaurant is food as a centrepiece to your conversation which will entice you to thumb the picture button on your smartphone repeatedly so you’ve got something to show your dreadful friends, St Leonards is for you. If what you want is a relaxing dinner, over unchallenging food – if, say, you’re the kind of person who thinks tuna bone caramel is a prog rock band from Sunderland circa 1975, rather than a viable menu option – please stay away. This restaurant will not make you happy. St Leonards, named after its address, occupies the Shoreditch site of what was Eyre Brothers, one of the first ambitious places to open here back in 2001. It’s fitting therefore that it should be replaced by somewhere so cutting edge you could slice your arm off on it. The makeover has used every material known to humankind as long as that material is polished concrete. There are hessian banquettes in a character-forming shade of ochre, sturdy wooden chairs and, at the back, a magnificent wood-burning hearth accessorised with bespoke ironmongery and hung with animal parts, as if modern, industrial society has collapsed and we have fallen back on the old ways. If anyone finally opens a Game of Thrones theme park, this could be its high-end restaurant, though Clarke, with his blond House of Stark-style plaited beard and his tattooed arms like the Bayeux tapestry with a pulse, would have to be a part of the deal. Boxer, a nerdy, clean-cut Lannister, works the next, metal-riveted, steampunk-style station along, plating up the raw and the cured. At Brunswick House, they pursued the best simple thing they could do with the greatest of ingredients. It was all about big, muscular vegetable dishes and salads and long-roasted meats. Here, they obsessively investigate the possibilities of those ingredients. From the short list headed “shellfish” comes an oyster dressed with finely diced pickled greens and another that has been flamed then buried under a drift of crisp-fried breadcrumbs enriched with lardo, the cured back fat of the pig. Because pig helps most things along, even oysters. A scallop the size of a tangerine is sliced up sashimi-style then reassembled and dressed with pickled samphire, elderflower and a lightly acidic broth, dotted with ravishing pools of herb oil. It’s like a pointillist has been at work on your dinner. It is swoon-worthy and so we swoon. It was a swoon too soon, because now comes a sturdy piece of rugged porcelain containing a cool, dark broth, full of smokey acidity which recalls tosazu, the Japanese dashi vinegar. It surrounds an inch-thick square fillet of raw bass, overlaid by thin triangular slices of skin-on kohlrabi, laid one across the other like the scales of the fish. It looks fabulous. Get the right proportions of ingredients on your fork and it tastes fabulous too: subtle raw bass, the crunch of kohlrabi, a broth that jump-starts the saliva glands. The problem is the fish comes as four huge lumps. Each one would make your cat think Christmas had come early. It needed to have been sliced up and reassembled, like the scallop. You’re left wondering if they simply forgot to finish what they were doing, and questioning the £12.60 price tag. Here, “challenging” is a synonym for “I want to like you but I can’t.” From Clarke and his leaping flames comes a plate of blackened onions, dusted thickly with fiery ground red pepper, and laid in that tuna bone caramel. It’s formed by doing something complicated with tuna bones, sugar and stock until it forms a sweet, sticky fish sauce that has us ordering bread to chase dribbles about the plate. This is not a dish for chatting over. It is a dish for talking about. It’s bold and serious; it’s what ambitious onions want to be later in their career. Some will hate it. The prosaically named vegetable plate is the most Brunswick House of the dishes: it’s whatever’s good at the moment, grilled and dressed with salsa verde and glugs of peppery olive oil. Tonight, it is nutty borlotti beans, slippery sheaths of skinned red pepper, artichoke hearts, more onions and the like. It’s the good stuff given due care and attention. Meat has its moment on the menu, but only a short one. There are just two beef dishes, a massive sirloin for sharing at £85 and a much smaller bavette for £18, served in deep, pink slices with curls of cured bone marrow grated over the top, which makes it stridently meatier than it already is. It is beefiness fiercely amplified. Generally, though, meat turns up as a flavouring. It’s there in a side of purple sprouting broccoli with shreds of ham hock, smoked chilli; or, best of all, with half a hispi cabbage, dipped in molten pork fat then blackened on the grill. It’s topped with spoonfuls of pig fat-enriched breadcrumbs. It’s a 97% non-meat dish that laughs hysterically in the face of non-meat eaters. Dessert is conventional by comparison. There’s a beautifully made salted caramel tart in a crisp pastry shell, cut to an acute point, with a perfectly balanced cardamom ice cream. The baba of their rum baba is a little dense but gets points for being properly infused with rum. Pieces of smoked pineapple alongside leave my companion wondering if something has been burned. And that one question sums up St Leonards. Certain dishes leave you wondering if that was what they intended. At one point, knowing my tastes, Clarke passed me a plate of thick-cut, long-simmered pork jowl, with a massive ribbon of ivory fat at its back. It is destined for the next day’s menu and I ask if he’s “gone insane”. Filthy expletives may have been involved. I adore fatty pig more than most, but this is to get armpit-deep in the stuff. Dinner at St Leonards, lubricated by well-priced, classic French wines, is not so much a meal out as a funfair ride. Many people will be completely thrilled. And some may come off mouthing, “Never again.” News bites Ox Club, just off the Headrow in Leeds, describes itself as a “contemporary solid fuel grill restaurant”. Food is intense and they’ve rarely met an ingredient they couldn’t char, or hit with controlled burning. From the wood grill go for aged lamb with black garlic ketchup and dandelion, cod cheeks with smoked butter or grilled hispi cabbage with a ‘hot sauce crumb’ (oxclub.co.uk). Manchester’s Festa Italiana returns to the city’s cathedral gardens for the second year from 13 to 15 July. There will be an on-site Italian producers’ market, a variety of street food options – think hot and hot running pizza – and a live cookery theatre, featuring a bunch of chefs flying over from Italy for the weekend, plus banquets (festaitalianauk.com). Chef Dan Doherty of Duck and Waffle, familiar as a judge on BBC TV’s Britain’s Best Home Cook, has bought the Royal Oak pub in Marylebone, London. He says pubs are “anchors in a community” and is determined to bring the old boozer back to life.

Like Anglesey sea salt, this variety of new potato is legally protected for the particular flavour the local soil imparts. Today’s recipes put them to work: a sort of vegetarian niçoise with a mustard dressing and an easy, cheesy, potato-topped flatbread. Of course, any variety of new potato could be used here. Quick new potato and red onion flatbreads (pictured above) This is essentially a cheat’s way to a white pizza with potato. If you’d like to add a little more green, pile it with shaved asparagus or peppery salad leaves when it comes out of the oven. If you want to make your own flatbreads, try this recipe for yoghurt flatbreads. Prep 10 min Cook 25 min Serves 2 1 red onion, peeled and thinly sliced Olive oil 4 new potatoes A few sprigs of thyme, leaves picked 2 flatbreads Salt and black pepper 4 tbsp creme fraiche or ricotta About 20g parmesan (I use a vegetarian one) Bring a pan of salted water to a boil. Put a frying pan on a medium heat, add a little olive oil and the sliced onions, and cook for about 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Slice the potatoes as thinly as you can – you could use a mandoline here. Blanch the sliced potatoes in the boiling water for about two to three minutes, until they have lost their rawness but still hold their shape. Drain and leave to steam dry, then toss with the thyme, some salt and pepper, and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. Lay the flatbreads on a baking tray and heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas 6. Spread the creme fraiche or ricotta over the breads, top with the onions, then the potatoes, and finish with a good grating of parmesan. Cook for eight to 10 minutes, until everything has melted together. New potato salad with capers and eggs I start making this salad when the asparagus and new potatoes arrive in May, and stop when the nights begin to draw in. The vegetables change with the season, but this version is my favourite – one that makes the most of the best tomatoes and runner beans. The key to this salad is the sharp dressing, which mellows as it hits the vegetables. Pour it over the potatoes while they are warm, crushing them a little so the dressing flavours them all the way through. Prep 10 min Cook 25 min Serves 4 500g new potatoes Flaky sea salt 4 eggs 100g kalamata olives 1 small cucumber 300g mixed ripe tomatoes 2 tbsp baby capers 300g runner or green beans, topped and tailed and cut on the diagonal into 3cm pieces A few sprigs of dill and parsley, leaves picked and roughly chopped Lemon zest (optional) For the dressing 3 tsp dijon mustard 2 tsp wholegrain mustard 4 tbsp olive oil 3 tbsp white-wine vinegar 1 tsp runny honey Put the new potatoes into a medium saucepan with a generous pinch of salt and cover with lots of cold water – you need a good amount of water as you will be adding other things to the pan later. Bring to a boil, then leave to simmer for 12–20 minutes (depending on their size). In another small pan, bring some salted water to a rolling boil, add the eggs and cook for six minutes, so the middles are only just set; if you’d like them hard-boiled, cook for one minute more. Run the cooked eggs under cold water for 30 seconds, then crack the shell on a hard surface and leave to cool. Meanwhile, make the dressing by whisking together all the ingredients, then taste and season. You want it to be quite punchy, because it will mellow when it hits everything else. Pit the olives and rip them in half. Slice the cucumber thickly. Roughly chop the tomatoes into different sized pieces and season well with salt. Put them all into a large bowl with the capers. When the potatoes are nearly cooked, add the beans to the pan and cook for the final three to four minutes. Drain everything and leave to steam dry in the colander. Once the potatoes have lost their moisture, add them to the bowl while they are still warm and pour over the dressing. Use the back of a spoon to crush them lightly, so they split and soak up some of the dressing. Peel the cooled eggs and cut into quarters, dot them around the bowl and finish with the chopped herbs and lemon zest, if using."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/29/adam-lambert-now-theres-an-audience-for-me-being-exactly-who-i-am","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-29T08:00:36Z","webTitle":"Adam Lambert: 'Now there’s an audience for me being exactly who I am'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/29/adam-lambert-now-theres-an-audience-for-me-being-exactly-who-i-am","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/29/adam-lambert-now-theres-an-audience-for-me-being-exactly-who-i-am","fields":{"headline":"Adam Lambert: 'Now there’s an audience for me being exactly who I am'","bodyText":"Despite being dressed like the archetypal US rock star – yellow-tinted aviator shades, black leather fingerless gloves, immaculate facial topiary – American Idol alumnus and adopted Queen frontman Adam Lambert is telling possibly the least rock’n’roll story ever. The night before our interview, he was kept awake at an unnamed London hotel by a “full-ass party” in the next room. “I called four different times, all this shit, and they wouldn’t shut it down,” he huffs, trying to contort his not inconsiderable frame into a tiny chair in his PR’s office. “We just found out it was a celebrity,” he adds, refusing to name names. Here for a whistlestop press tour ahead of another European jaunt with Queen, he’s now half rock cosplayer, half sleep-deprived octogenarian. We talk about getting older. Lambert is 36, having started his pop journey in 2009 on season eight of American Idol. He likes certain things about being in his 30s. “I’ve got myself pretty well sorted. I get who I am. I can call myself out, but man, these hangovers last way too long, don’t they?” he cackles, as he does often. “I do feel my age, but in some ways, it’s a bit of a Peter Pan thing. I play dressup and sing for a living.” As a kid growing up in California, he was inspired to play dressup and sing by “Bowie and Freddie and Boy George”. Lambert – a self-proclaimed “outsider” – found solace in musical theatre. “When I was in middle school, I didn’t have any friends. I was a weird kid. Also, as a gay person, it takes your body changing to go: ‘Oh right, this is how I’m different.’” At the age of 18, shortly after graduating from high school, he came out to his family and friends, eventually side-stepping college and moving to Los Angeles to live out his fantasy of being an entertainer. A 10-month stint on a cruise ship was followed by a role alongside Val Kilmer in The Ten Commandments: The Musical. In 2008, he auditioned for American Idol, performing – somewhat prophetically – Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody. Thanks to his paint-stripping vocals and scenery-chewing stage presence, he became a favourite to win. In the end, he finished runner-up to the decidedly more vanilla Kris Allen, a shock result that seemed to have been influenced by the emergence of photos of Lambert, who hadn’t discussed his sexuality on the show, kissing his ex-boyfriend. The pictures were headline news, with conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly labelling them “embarrassing” and Entertainment Weekly putting Lambert on their cover under the mealy mouthed headline “The Most Exciting American Idol Contestant in Years (And Not Just Because He Might Be Gay)”. Having experienced a fairly stress-free personal coming-out, Lambert was suddenly expected to do so publicly, on one of the country’s biggest and straightest TV shows, and in a pop landscape far removed from that of today, with its openly queer major-label artists. “No one gives you an instruction guide on how to be a queer celebrity,” he says. “Ten years ago, it wasn’t a lane that was really that clear. I’d been in the arts, in LA, my whole adult life at that point, so [my sexuality] wasn’t an issue,” he says. “Then all of a sudden, I was like: ‘Oh shit, this is what homophobia is.’ It was a wake-up call for me. It was sad.” He fiddles with his leather gloves. “Look, I’m not dumb. I’d been watching [American Idol] for years and anyone who’d been obviously gay on the show had been made fun of – [Simon] Cowell would make fun of them and they became jokes. I remember when I auditioned I was worried about that. And then it didn’t happen to me and I was like: ‘OK, cool.’” Cowell did refer to Lambert’s voice in his first audition as “theatrical”, one of many coded descriptions he would go on to hear. “As I started progressing in the competition, and with the [Entertainment Weekly] article, I started to realise that my sexuality was becoming bigger than what I was doing, which, fundamentally, I felt was fucked up.” A month after the show finished, he confirmed he was gay in a cover story with Rolling Stone. “I remember the gay press criticised me for not [coming out] right or well enough,” he sighs. “Then I had fans of the show saying they felt betrayed. People were saying: ‘You didn’t declare it on the show.’ I didn’t, but I also didn’t realise that I needed to. I’d already come out.” With hindsight, could he have handled it differently? “Maybe, if I’d been in a long-term relationship and had my partner in the audience every week it would have come up, but that wasn’t the case.” A big toothy smile appears. “In fact, I had a handful of different guys I was trying to date that I’d invite to the show on different weeks.” The cackle is back. “I wasn’t consistent enough!” He remembers a fraught conversation with the head of his label, RCA, after he selected the knowingly kitsch, airbrushed cover art for his debut album, For Your Entertainment. The concern being that it wouldn’t sit “on the shelves of Walmart for, you know, Suzy and Johnny Homemaker to go buy”. He won that battle, but lost another when it was decided a lyric in his single Whataya Want from Me, written by Pink, needed to be changed from “he messed me up” to the more radio-friendly “it messed me up”. In the end, he acquiesced and the song became his first, and thus far only, US Top 10 hit. “I had to think about it – do I martyr myself for the cause and kiss these opportunities goodbye? It was wrong, but I wanted my chance.” The album was launched with a controversy-baiting performance at the 2009 American Music Awards, during which Lambert snogged his male keyboardist. Following complaints from the censorship advocacy group Parents Television Council the network that aired the awards, ABC, pulled him from a slot on Good Morning America the following morning. “There was a lawsuit pending against me, too,” he adds. He ended up going on CBS’s The Early Show to defend himself, mentioning the notorious VMAs kiss between Madonna and Britney six years earlier. Both clips were aired. “They showed the women kissing, then they showed the clip of me kissing the guy and they blurred out our mouths!” He sits bolt upright. “There was a digital blur covering the kiss. I was gobsmacked.” The constant suggestion that Lambert was “too much” eventually got to him, and led to a pivot in his career. His second album, 2012’s Trespassing – which gave him the curious honour of being the first openly gay artist to reach No 1 on the Billboard album chart – was markedly more sombre, led by the dreary ballad Better Than I Know Myself. His preferred single choice, Cuckoo – a lithe electro-glam stomper – was dismissed by his now former label as “too flamboyant”. Later that year, having performed with Queen at the MTV Europe Music Awards, Lambert joined the band for a six-date tour. “I needed an outlet for me that wasn’t judging. I needed to be in a safe space that didn’t say to me: ‘Don’t do that, people won’t like that.’ Now there’s an audience for me being exactly who I am. There’s permission given.” His Queen sojourn was not meant to last this long (“It’s the gift that keeps on giving,” he laughs) and he says the early shows were “a mindfuck”. “I’ve figured out how to make those songs work for me. I’m not playing a part, I’m interpreting them from my viewpoint and a lot of what Freddie was exploring is stuff I’m exploring.” Does he worry it has sidelined his own career – going back to covering other people’s songs for a living? “No,” he says, slightly agitated. “No. I think I’ve managed to balance it. It’s two different worlds and two different ideas, but right now, I’m trying to get them to coexist.” Understandably, Lambert thinks about Freddie Mercury a lot, discussing with Queen bandmates Roger Taylor and Brian May what he’d have made of a new pop movement that’s seen a raft of queer artists break into the mainstream. “Roger was like: ‘I think he would be really open and upfront about it, because that’s what he was like to all of us.’ [His sexuality] was just taboo in the media. But he was very matter of fact once he’d come to terms with it. And from what I have ascertained, he was fully bisexual. He was dabbling everywhere. I think he was ahead of his time.” There are those who would say the same of Lambert. At a recent event in LA championing gay musicians, singer Parson James said: “A lot of people bashed him for what he did, but to be honest, I think if people like him didn’t come around when the conversations were so mum, then we couldn’t have people like Troye [Sivan] or myself.” How does that make Lambert feel? “Beautiful,” he says. “That was a really nice thing to hear.” He shuffles about in his seat again. “I didn’t get into this to be a role model, but then slowly I realised it was a responsibility I wanted. There’s so much good that can come from being a leader and being open.” Later that evening, Lambert visits the Mosaic LGBT Youth Centre in north London, a space that offers support to young lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. While we wait for his arrival, songs from The Original High, his 2015 Max Martin-produced album, waft out of tinny speakers. Just before 7pm, he arrives and waits, half-concealed, outside the main entrance. His makeup artist hurries past the congregation to re-apply his slap, basically on the street. Briefly, the rock star persona he has been trying on for size returns. That soon dissipates, however, when Lambert breezes in unannounced and starts chatting warmly to the front row. After years of not knowing where or how he fits into a pop world that cautiously embraced his sexuality in theory, but seemingly not in practice, he finally seems comfortable. “I don’t want to go on and on about me, me, me,” he demurs, talking to the crowd as his shades flash in the harsh strip lighting. “That’s not the point of this. I want to hear what’s up with you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/19/what-is-cannabis-oil-and-how-does-it-work","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T13:12:08Z","webTitle":"What is cannabis oil and how does it work?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/19/what-is-cannabis-oil-and-how-does-it-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/19/what-is-cannabis-oil-and-how-does-it-work","fields":{"headline":"What is cannabis oil and how does it work?","bodyText":"What is cannabis oil? Cannabis oils are extracts from cannabis plants. Unprocessed, they contain the same 100 or so active ingredients as the plants, but the balance of compounds depends on the specific plants the oil comes from. The two main active substances in cannabis plants are cannabidiol, or CBD, and delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Oil extracted from hemp plants can contain a lot of CBD, while oil from skunk plants will contain far more THC. THC produces the high that recreational cannabis users seek, while oils for medical use contain mostly CBD. How is it different to cannabis? Other forms of cannabis are solid and are usually sold either as resin or dried plant material. In commercially-produced medical cannabis oils, the concentrations of CBD and THC tend to be well-controlled, which makes it easy to calculate doses. Does it work as a medicine? CBD is an anticonvulsant, and some other compounds in the plant, including THC and cannabidivarin, may be too. There is good evidence from clinical trials in the US and Europe that pharmaceutical preparations of CBD can treat two severe forms of childhood epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Both forms of epilepsy often fail to improve with existing epilepsy drugs. CBD is generally considered safe, but some trials have reported side effects including dry mouth, lightheadedness and altered liver enzyme activity. Don’t we already have cannabis-based drugs? Four drugs based on cannabis compounds are already on the market in Europe. Among them are Nabilone, a synthetic compound that mimics THC, is prescribed for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, and Sativex, an oil that contains equal parts THC and CBD, is used to treat muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis. Both contain too much THC to administer to children. “The only medicines that are approved in the UK would get children stoned,” said David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, London. Is cannabis oil illegal? Cannabis oil can only be sold legally in Britain if it contains less than 0.05% THC. But the nation’s medicines regulator, the MHRA, announced recently that even pure CBD could not be sold as a medicine without first going through the usual clinical testing and safety checks required for all new medicines. This month, the US Food and Drug Administration will consider the approval of Epidiolex, a CBD-based medicine from GW Pharmaceuticals, which has completed such clinical trials. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will rule on the drug early next year. If the EMA approves Epidiolex, it could be available to prescribe to named patients in Britain next year, Brexit notwithstanding. Is it legal in other countries? Europe is a patchwork of cannabis legislation. In the Netherlands, doctors can prescribe cannabis and cannabis preparations for symptoms caused by multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, cancer, long-term pain and the tics associated with Tourette’s syndrome. Other European nations are following suit. In the US, at least 29 states allow medical uses of cannabis, and earlier this year, California became the eighth state to permit recreational use of the drug, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/20/iran-women-kat-khosrowyar-fifa","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T07:00:34Z","webTitle":"‘The fact we exist is huge’: Iran’s women plotting course to world stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/iran-women-kat-khosrowyar-fifa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/20/iran-women-kat-khosrowyar-fifa","fields":{"headline":"‘The fact we exist is huge’: Iran’s women plotting course to world stage","bodyText":"To say things have changed for women’s football in Iran since Katayoun Khosrowyar first arrived in the country more than 12 years ago would be as understated as the coach of the newly established under-19 side herself. Back then the 30-year-old from Oklahoma known as “Kat” arrived in Tehran on a family holiday, was scouted for Iran’s newly formed futsal team and ended up captaining the national side after moving there permanently. “I didn’t speak the language or know anything about my culture – all I knew was that the food was really good,” Khosrowyar tells the Guardian. “Twelve years ago there were a lot of restrictions – people would ask: ‘Why do you want to play football? Just stay at home and learn to be good wives.’ But now we get lots of help from people who are outspoken about supporting women’s football.” Football had been widely played before the revolution in 1979 but strict laws that required all women to wear a headscarf in public meant that for more than two decades riflery was the only international sport open to Iranian women. That began to change after students from the Alzahra University in Tehran set up a futsal team in the early 1990s, with the formation of a national league soon after. In 2005 Jordan invited Iran to send a team to compete in the West Asian Championships and the new national side was born. “There was a lot to be learned from those years because men weren’t allowed to be physically involved with women’s football, even though they had all the education,” Khosrowyar recalls. “We had to get special permission to put on training courses but after all these years things are beginning to change.” Having retired from playing in 2013 after eight years’ service in which Iran climbed from the very bottom of Fifa’s rankings to the top 50, Khosrowyar had already planned the next stage of her career. Since becoming the first Middle Eastern woman to earn her Fifa A-licence, she has taken on the task of coaching two of Iran’s youth sides as well as appearing regularly as a speaker, including a TED talk in 2015 entitled Empowering Women Through Sports. “We get hardly any budget so the fact that we exist is huge,” she says. “The federation is doing the best that it can to get sponsorship for us but it’s difficult. My role in this is to create a pathway for the youth in order to be able to compete in world events.” With no domestic youth leagues in the country for prospective players to hone their skills, that is easier said than done. But Khosrowyar describes the introduction of new regulations that will allow 16-year-olds to train with senior clubs as a “huge step” as Iran prepare to qualify for the 2022 Olympics in September. “This will help prepare a squad for the Asian games because at least they have experience of training camps and competitions. The shift is going to take a few more months but we will get there. I’m always on the lookout for more players and I really select them randomly sometimes – I’ll be walking down the street and see a girl beating up boys. That’s my player right there!” In April a group of Iranian women made global headlines when they disguised themselves as men so they could watch a league match at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran. While that is not illegal Khosrowyar says many are discouraged by the large number of hooligans who often go to matches at the national stadium but is hopeful that this is starting to change, with men now permitted to attend female matches as spectators. “They’re like: ‘So what if a man wants to come and watch me play?’ We’ve made the topic a bit more comfortable for everyone and not such a big deal,” she says. Iran’s men are contesting their third successive World Cup finals after breezing through qualification but face an uphill struggle to get out of a group containing Spain and Portugal despite their victory over Morocco in the opening match. But Khosrowyar, who knows all about upsetting the odds, is confident Team Melli can cause a shock. “I really believe in Carlos Queiroz and his method,” she says. “Hopefully we will be in for a big surprise at the World Cup. He has really changed the face of Iranian football. When I was appointed he said he was always here if I ever need any help.” Not that she has needed it so far."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2018/jun/20/welcome-to-brumbria-should-the-west-midlands-become-a-national-park","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T06:15:33Z","webTitle":"Welcome to Brumbria: should the West Midlands become a national park?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/20/welcome-to-brumbria-should-the-west-midlands-become-a-national-park","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jun/20/welcome-to-brumbria-should-the-west-midlands-become-a-national-park","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to Brumbria: should the West Midlands become a national park?","bodyText":"“I think we have an extraordinary landscape here waiting to be discovered by millions,” says landscape architect Kathryn Moore, unrolling a jauntily coloured map of her visionary new park in a Birmingham City University office. The professor isn’t talking about of Cumbria, Umbria, Snowdonia or Amazonia. She’s talking about the touristic potential of the West Midlands plateau, the heart of England that threw itself into the fiery crucible of the Industrial Revolution and still bears sacrificial scars. It is here that Professor Moore wants to create the United Kingdom’s 16th national park. In the 19th century, Queen Victoria would lower the blinds on the royal train so she didn’t have to see the smokestack hell of the Black Country. Tolkien was inspired to create Mordor from nocturnal visions of its blast furnaces. If Moore has her way, though, in a decade or so Queen Kate will raise the blinds as the HS2 train passes the reconfigured Tame Valley between Birmingham and Coventry. “Look!” she’ll exclaim to King William. “What a vista of allotments, fisheries, fields, orchards, forests, hi-tech agriculture, green industries, creative hubs and cycle paths!” She’ll gaze in admiration at how the Tame has been rerouted using water from Birmingham city centre’s aquifer, all crisscrossed by new footbridges linking together suburbs long isolated by the city’s motorised arterial routes. And finally, as the train makes its approach to Philip Hardwick’s recently reopened grade I-listed, Roman-inspired, 1838 Curzon Street rail terminus, King William too will look out of the window. “Gosh!” he’ll exclaim. “Is that the famous Birmingham Central Park?” I know what you’re thinking. Make the Black Country green? Royal trains that stop in Birmingham? Understandably, Moore is steeling herself for the derision she’s going to get for daring to suggest the West Midlands might become green and pleasant. “Everybody talks about how this landscape is ugly or whatever,” she says. “But we can give it a new identity, and in so doing reimagine what it is to live in cities in a way that lives up to UN sustainable development goals.” Not since Mayor Joseph Chamberlain sought to make Birmingham the new Athens at the end of the 19th century has anyone round here dared to dream this big. On Thursday, Moore will unveil her plans for a new national park for the West Midlands at a conference in Birmingham. Last month, environment secretary Michael Gove asked if there is scope to expand the current network of national parks. Moore’s plans are a response to Gove’s invitation for ideas: a new vision for what a national park could be. Forget about trying to find new forests, coastlines or ancient wildernesses, Moore suggests: let’s re-green the West Midlands instead. “Birmingham was once famous as the city of a thousand trades,” she says. “Imagine if it became famous as the city of a thousand cycle and footpaths, a thousand parks and a thousand lakes.” Maybe she’s imagining a West Midlands akin to the post-apocalyptic England imagined in nature writer Richard Jefferies 19th-century novel After London, in which cities revert to nature – and the few survivors to a quasi-medieval way of life? “Not at all!” protests Moore. “I love cities, but I want to give them a better 21st century identity so they’re better to live in, more productive as well as more attractive.” Consider, for example, what’s wrong with suburban lawns. “If you look at wartime maps or aerial photos you’ll see that the landscape was used in a very different way. I want to bring back agriculture to the West Midlands, in part to increase food security. I want to create a new connection between the communities and the countryside people here haven’t experienced for decades.” Among the conference speakers will be James Corner, the landscape architect who changed perceptions of what cities could be like when he created a linear park from an abandoned elevated railway line in inner New York City and called it the High Line. Moore wants to do something similar, but with a twist. Instead of repurposing an abandoned railway, she plans to use a new one – the HS2 from London to Birmingham – as a catalyst. “It’s had so much bad publicity, but now we want to use the arrival of HS2 to create a better, greener West Midlands.” Moore serves on HS2’s design panel and hopes just as Birmingham led the world with the industrial revolution, it will lead the world in reimagining how an urban landscape can be married to a new notion of the countryside: a post-industrial revolution. Her proposal also aims to capitalise on Coventry becoming UK city of culture in 2021, and Birmingham hosting the Commonwealth Games in 2022. “The point is to harness all that energy to create something lasting that improves the quality of life of people here.” East London’s award-winning Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park was part of the legacy of the 2012 Olympics, and in that sense was something of a precursor for what she wants to achieve here. “The park would focus on encouraging active healthy lives and and wellbeing.” Moore’s national park proposal blames traditional development practices for long-term social, economic and environmental damage. Birmingham in particular and the West Midlands in general have long been considered proof of such blindness. Herbert Manzoni, Birmingham’s city engineer and surveyor, was in the 1960s and 70s what Baron Haussmann was to Paris a century before, building arterial routes and ring roads no matter what the cost to communities or aesthetics. The city became known for its underpasses filled with bad smells and worse buskers, while above traffic often as not sat in rush-hour gridlock. Manzoni created roads for drivers to sit in their private little boxes but neglected public spaces where you might want to walk or sit without having to cough up for a coffee. Moore’s proposals for a national park are an elegant counter to that car-based, free-market, environment-despoiling ideology. The worst aspect of what Manzoni did to the heart of England, Moore thinks, is that his roads carved up poorer neighbourhoods and made them more deprived as a result. “If you look at the map of multiple deprivation in the West Midlands,” she explains, “you’ll see how deprived communities are often ringed by roads that are hard to cross. They can’t get out of their neighbourhoods very easily to get to work or to education. The roads that were meant to connect people actually serve to leave some behind.” She has a point. Before meeting Moore, I get the 67 bus along the Tyburn and and Lichfield Roads, a route which goes through some of east Birmingham’s most deprived areas. Sue, a nurse heading home to Pype Hayes after her shift tells me she thinks estates like hers have been neglected by planners for too long. “Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood, and lots of other estates in the West Midlands are cut off from the rest off the city by the M6 and by the big main roads. They become ghettoes. Your professor’s dead right about that and something needs to be done.” But she’s sceptical about plans for a national park. “People have always had big ideas for how to improve Birmingham,” she says. Fair point: I remember interviewing Birmingham council leader Mike Whitby in 2010 when he told me he thought the new central library might be better known as “a palazzo of human thought”. “But they always come unstuck when it comes to money,” says Sue. Again, fair point: that glamorous new library’s opening hours have been reduced because of council cuts. Potential sources of funding for Moore’s national park include the Department for Transport, the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Canal and River Trust and the Maria Nobrega Foundation. Later I ask a group of criminology students picnicking outside Birmingham’s Thinktank science museum if they like the idea of a Central Park over the wastelands they can glimpse from their flats. “I’d certainly like to stay here if it was a little less harsh and had more public parks,” says one. “I can imagine making a good life in this city if it wasn’t just for people with cars and lots of money,” says another. “I like the idea of having a national park on your doorstep and I suspect it would increase tourism.” What should it be called? “Heartlandia,” suggests one. “Mordor 2.0,” offers another. I’d like to see it called Brumbria, and picture tourists wondering why this looks nothing like Assisi or Keswick. Back in Birmingham City University, Moore explains that a tourism bump is certainly part of her agenda, but so is developing new skills in sectors that the West Midlands has hardly been known for in recent years – such as agriculture, horticulture, food production. “The park would boost the economy because it would make it more attractive for people to want to live here and that would make it more attractive for business.” No wonder, perhaps, that support for her project comes from Andy Street, former head of John Lewis and now the West Midlands’ first elected mayor, as well as Meriden MP Dame Caroline Spelman – the latter in part wooed by Moore’s idea that the Forest of Arden should be extended as part of the project. But Moore admits to dodging the question when I ask her if planners for the West Midlands are all behind her scheme. Perhaps just as importantly, Moore is hoping to reveal the West Midlands’ forgotten identity to its nearly three million inhabitants. To emphasise the point, she shows me two more maps. One is an recent Ordnance Survey map of the county with multicoloured roads and grey built-up zones, the other a relief map from the mid-19th century. Her point is that today most West Midlands citizens map their native land through its roads, not through its natural landscape – its rivers in particular. Her Brummie husband, she tells me, did not know that his home city was built on a plateau, still less could he point out where the area’s many rivers – the Tame, Rae, Blythe and Stour among them – flow. Like everybody round here, he knows that Birmingham has more miles of canals than Venice and more trees than Paris, but that’s not the kind of landscape his wife has in mind. “The plans I’m creating involve inverting maps. Traditionally the maps of the region highlight roads and building infrastructure. The ones I’ve drawn up highlight the contours of the landscape, the rivers and the green parts. I want to make people here proud of where they’re from. Not just because of the industrial heritage but because of the landscape that made that industry possible.” I look out of the window from Moore’s office, past the railway tracks, terraced roofs, abandoned factories and run-down pubs, wondering if in my lifetime the West Midlands National Park will join the Yorkshire Dales, the Pembrokeshire Coast, the Lake District and the Cairngorms as one of the precious, beautiful parts of Britain. “It’s all about changing perceptions,” says Moore.

His spellbinding words are the inspiration for the exhibition African American Portraits: Photographs from the 1940s and 1950s, which opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City on 26 June. More than 150 studio portraits from the mid-20th century will offer a rarely seen view of African Americans during the second world war, a time of cultural change, uncertainty and growth of the middle class. “These photos have a certain quality and beguiling characteristic that separate themselves from the huge population of images we see every day,” said Jeff Rosenheim, the Met’s photography curator. “They tell stories that other stories from the same time do not.” The exhibition features classic photo portraits of parents with their newborns, or standing proudly in lavish fur coats, suits and ties. Standing before picturesque, painted scenery of forests, many are smiling while wearing their Sunday best, like feathered hats, pearl earrings and leather gloves, or clutching their purses with perfect nail polish. However, most of the photographers and their subjects featured in this exhibition are unknown, making it an exhibition of anonymous portraits said Rosenheim, who is the author of 10 books on Depression-era photojournalist Walker Evans. He also previously curated the Met’s Photography and the American Civil War exhibition from 2013. One of the few known studios in the exhibition is Daisy Studio, which was on the historic Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. Many of Daisy’s photos (which are marked by the brand’s logo on a wooden slab in the bottom left corner of each photo) show young people in the south taking their portraits before enlisting in the war. “They’re leaving home for the first time, their future is uncertain,” said Rosenheim. “Without too much fanfare and with economy of means, it makes these pictures just stunning. They allow us to look at a time and a place that changed the country. It’s on the cusp of the civil rights era and there was great stress because of the war, but it was also a time of introspection.” But the people in the photos are anonymous and there is no real way to trace them, besides the Met’s visitors being able to recognize their loved ones. As most of the photos here show people going off to war in their late teens and early 20s, and having been photographed in the 1940s and 1950s, the subjects could be in their 80s or 90s today. “We hope that with the public’s attention, we can identify some of the subjects, as most of them are unknown,” said Rosenheim. “People might be able to recognize a family member or a friend and attach a name to these faces.” These photos build on the museum’s ever-growing photography portraiture collection, which starts with the 1840s and continues to the present. They were acquired by the Met between 2015 and 2017 from the Rose Bowl flea market in Pasadena, California, though many were believed to be photographed in the midwestern and southern cities of Memphis, New Orleans and Kansas. “The power and meaning of these collections are sites of collective memory,” said Rosenheim. “Most of the people are at the end of a long life right now and the photos are moving around as part of their natural progress.” It was a tradition to go to photo studios and pose in a new military uniform, either alone or with parents, siblings or loved ones, which would then be printed and mailed to the soldiers and sailors abroad as a memory. “It was a time people were more thinking about the fragility of life,” said Rosenheim. Photo studios thrived during Pearl Harbor and during the 1950s, right before mass media culture took over in America. “It’s a sweet spot,” said Rosenheim. The fashion of the time was utilitarian but stylish. While many posed in military garb, others show women wearing smart A-line dresses with plastic handbags, whimsical brooches, stylish wristwatches and high heels. It was an act of personal individualism going to a photo studio. “For those individuals who chose to pose for themselves, it was an act of self-expression,” said Rosenheim. “These pictures show that it was a time of transition for these individuals; they are choosing to pose for their own reasons – it’s not because their parents or the military told them to do so.” Some of the photos are hand-painted with color, whether it’s the background to give the portrait more life, or as makeup, like plump red lip color for the women. Rosenheim explains that studio photographers could make extra money by applying color to photos by hand, which would help increase their revenue. Just as the population in the south was segregated, so was the military. “There was the civil rights struggle for African Americans, not just voting rights but every other freedom,” said Rosenheim. “In these pictures, we see them in reflection of where they are and what their conditions are.” African American Portraits: Photographs from the 1940s and 1950s is on view 26 June through 8 October at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/live/2018/jun/20/tender-age-trump-children-separations-detention-shelters-latest-news-updates-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T03:52:32Z","webTitle":"Trump ends his policy of family separations with executive order – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2018/jun/20/tender-age-trump-children-separations-detention-shelters-latest-news-updates-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2018/jun/20/tender-age-trump-children-separations-detention-shelters-latest-news-updates-live","fields":{"headline":"Trump ends his policy of family separations with executive order – as it happened","bodyText":"We are wrapping up the live coverage for the day. Today’s dramatic events, as Trump signed an executive order ending the policy of separating children from their parents at the US-Mexico border, follow days of outrage from the public and politicians about the policy. When signing the order, Trump said it was because: “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.” In a speech to a rally in Minnesota, Trump said the public outrage at the policy was drummed up by Democrats to distract from the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton, and he reiterated that he would maintain a tough stance on immigration, as opposed to what he calls the Democrats’ “open border policy”. Critics of Trump’s immigration policy, say there is still much to be concerned about. The executive order instructs government officials to continue its “zero-tolerance” policy, prosecuting all immigrants who enter the US illegally. While children will now be able to stay with their parents, this will be in detention, with “alien families” detained together “where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources”. The president’s action also directs the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to go to court to ask for a modification to a 1997 court settlement, known as Flores, which currently prohibits the detention of migrant children for more than 20 days. If it is successful, children could be held in detention until proceedings have been completed. We’ll continue following this story as it unfolds, thanks for following along today. After days of public outcry, Trump’s signing of the executive order putting a stop to the policy of separating children and parents at the US-Mexico border, is not the end of the issue, as many people have pointed out. Trump’s plan could see children detained indefinitely with their parents, and there are concerns about the lack of plans in place to reunite the 2,300 children currently in detention with their parents. Olivia Solon writes how the burden of reunited families falls on NGOs. Only hours after signing an executive order to end the practice of separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border, Donald Trump said the public uproar over his administration’s policy was a distraction by Democrats to hide the crimes of Hillary Clinton and the FBI. Speaking to packed rally in Duluth, Minnesota, on Wednesday night, Trump tied the issue to the inspector general’s report about the FBI’s handling of its investigation of Clinton during the 2016 elections. “Right now they are building up immigration, they are building up immigration,” said Trump “they don’t want to show what’s happening in Congress where this scam has been revealed.” Read Ben Jacobs’ full report from Duluth here. Reuters have more on Donald Trump’s claims in tonight’s speech that North Korea today returned the remains of 200 US troops missing from the Korean War. “We got back our great fallen heroes, the remains sent back today, already 200 got sent back,” Trump told a crowd of supporters during a rally in Duluth, Minnesota. There has been no official confirmation of the move from military authorities. But US officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday that in coming days North Korea would hand over a “sizeable number” of remains to United Nations Command in South Korea, and they would then be transferred to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. About 7,700 US military personnel remain unaccounted from the 1950-1953 Korean War, U.S. military data show. According to the Pentagon, North Korean officials have indicated in the past that they have the remains of as many as 200 US troops. More than 36,500 US troops died in the conflict. If you fancy watching the president’s speech in full, he has helpfully tweeted a link to the video of it. It goes for an hour, though Trump does not speak for that whole time; four minutes are given over to Pete Stauber, the Congressional candidate, whom Trump was appearing in support of. Fox News, which was the only network to broadcast the rally, is predictably supportive of the president. Speaking after the rally, Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson condemned “the Left” for their coverage of Trump’s immigration policy, saying “the debate wasn’t about what they say it’s about” and that they had been “whipping their supporters into a frenzy of mindless rage” which was “the shortest way of shutting down rational debate”. In particular, Carlson said he was perplexed that people who had been calling for an end to the separation of families were still angry, even after the president signed an executive order putting an end to the policy. Critics have raised concerns that Trump has sought to extend the time limit that children can be held in detention, meaning children and their parents might be subject to indefinite detention. Trump’s speech tonight at a rally held in Duluth, Minnesota in support of Pete Stauber, who is running for a seat in Congress, was long - nearly an hour - and wide-ranging. Here are some key moments: Trump slammed Senator John McCain without naming him, when talking about his attempts to repeal Obamacare. “We had a gentleman, late into the morning hours, go thumbs-down,” Trump said of McCain’s refusal to support Trump’s push for the repeal. “That was not a good thing he did ... He went thumbs-down. Not nice! That was not nice.” The practice of shaming protesters at Trump rallies continues. Two protesters were singled out by Trump, who asked for them to be removed from the arena, as the crowd booed and jeered. Of one he said: “Is that a man or a woman? I couldn’t tell. He needs a haircut more than I do.” Of the other protester, Trump said: We have a single protester, there you go, goodbye darling, goodbye darling, we have a single protester, he’s going home to his mum, say hi to mummy. Trump has claimed that the repatriation of the bodies of soldiers from North Korea, which he announced in the aftermath of last week’s summit in Singapore, had already begun, saying: “Today, already, 200 have been sent back.” If this is true, this is new and significant. The Guardian’s Tom McCarthy is looking into this, but so far the White House has not replied to his requests for confirmation and there is no word on which agency was handling the repatriation, or when and where the remains had been received. Trump has reiterated his plans for a “Space Force”, to patrol the heavens. “We’re reopening Nasa,” he told supporters, prompting chants of “space force”. We have the airforce, but now we’re going to have the space force. We need it! We need it! This is Kate Lyons taking over from Sam Levin. Well, Trump took a while to get onto the subject of his executive order during tonight’s speech, but once he started on the subject, he had a lot to say. Here are some of his quotes on the subject, in which he blamed the current situation on Democrats’ “open border” policy. So the Democrats want open borders, let everybody come in, let everybody pour in, we don’t care, let them come in from the Middle East, let them come in from all over the place, we don’t care. We’re not going to let it happen. And by the way today I signed an executive order, we’re going to keep families together but the border is going to be just as tough as it’s been. Democrats don’t care about the impact of uncontrolled migration on your communities your schools, your hospitals, your jobs or your safety. Democrats put illegal immigrants before they put American citizens, what the hell is going on? Trump also spoke about how the US needed immigrants, but only wanted those who came through “merit”. We do want people to come across our border, to come through our ports of entry, but we want people to come through merit, not just through luck or happenstance. We want them to come in through merit and we need people because we have so many companies right now… moving back into our country, we need people to help. But we want them to come in through the merit system, not a system where we get MS-13 and everybody else that other countries don’t want. The Democrats open border policies have also allowed MS-13 to come into our country and drugs to pour into our streets and we’re stopping them. Trump repeated threats he made earlier in the week that the US would cut aid to countries that people crossing the border came from and referenced the speech he gave when he launched his campaign for the presidency back in 2015, when he referred to those coming over the border from Mexico as “rapists”. These countries, we’re sending them back, we’re putting in legislation, we’re not giving them anymore aid. They send people up, remember the original speech, my original speech, they are sending, remember my words, they are sending and they’re not sending their finest, I can tell you and we’re sending them the hell back. A summary of some of the key developments today: Donald Trump reversed course and signed an executive order to “keep families together”, ending his policy of separating migrant children and parents at the border. The text of the order, however, makes clear that Trump will stick to his hardline approach and “zero-tolerance” enforcement policy of criminally prosecuting everyone who crosses the border unauthorized. The government is also seeking a policy change through the courts to allow for the detention of migrant children for more than 20 days. Critics say Trump is seeking to effectively replace family separation with indefinite family detention and are calling for further reforms. US officials said there are no immediate plans to reunite children who have already been separated from their parents. Protesters are planning actions for later this month, and on Wednesday, some activists occupied an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) building in Oregon, forcing it to shut down. In Mexico, some women and children hoping to cross into the US say they are choosing between death at home or brutal treatment in Texas. Trump held a campaign rally in Minnesota where he repeated his signature attacks on Hillary Clinton, Democrats and immigrants. Guardian reporter Oliver Laughland has been reporting today at a federal magistrates court in McAllen, Texas where dozens of migrants faced a judge. Here’s a dispatch on what they are facing: At a mass plea hearing in a federal magistrates court in McAllen, Texas, at about the time of Trump’s announcement, 74 migrants, mostly from Central America, sat in a packed-out courtroom. Each was charged with illegal entry misdemeanor, the vast majority never having committed a crime in the US. Before Judge J Scott Hacker, lawyers informed the court that 24 of the defendants were parents who had been separated from their children by US authorities after being apprehended near the border. As most of the men and women were sentenced to time served, Óscar Rox-Flores, a Guatemalan migrant apprehended with his daughter two days ago, spoke before the judge. “In my case I am here with my daughter,” he said. “I want to be deported with her so we can both go home together.” Judge Hacker was able to offer no assurances. “I don’t have an answer that question,” he said. “Hopefully there are procedures in place.” The Trump rally has come to a close with some predictable lines from the president: The Republicans will win ... We will never stop fighting for our flag, for our country, for our freedom. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again.” Trump is now arguing that the controversy over family separation at the border is meant to distract from Hillary Clinton: “Crooked Hillary – have you been watching what’s been going on? ... How guilty is she?” Trump said, prompting “Lock her up!” chants. “They wanted to put us in trouble, and it’s not working too well, I’ll tell you. Disgusting ... phony witch hunt ... They’re building up immigration. They don’t want to show what’s happening in Congress.” Trump is now bragging about his wealth and intelligence: They always call the other side ‘the elite’. Why are they elite? I have a much better apartment than they do. I’m smarter than they are. I’m richer than they are. I became president and they didn’t. And I’m representing the greatest, smartest most loyal best people on earth - the deplorables, remember that? Trump has also made false claims at the rally about the construction of his proposed border wall on the US-Mexico border: Trump is now praising the “heroic agents” of Ice and DHS: They save millions ... thousands and thousands of lives. They are so brave, so tough. If you want to create a humane lawful system of immigration, then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders. He also said: The media never talks about the American victims of illegal immigration... As your president, I will always fight to protect American families. I will always fight for an immigration system that protects our borders and takes care of our sovereignty as a nation. The president has returned to his campaign message focused on people killed by undocumented immigrants. Research has contradicted Trump’s claims linking immigration to crime, with studies suggesting that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes than people born in the US. Two protesters have interrupted the rally so far, prompting taunts from Trump: “We have a single protester. There we go, goodbye, darling. We have a single protester, he’s going home to his mom. Say hello to mommy and tomorrow, the fake news will say, ‘Massive protests at the trump rally.’ One person.” To the second protester: “Get him out of here, go home to your mom, darling. Get him out of here. Out. ... Was that a man or a woman? Because he needs a haircut more than I do.” Trump has just spoken briefly about his executive order and misrepresented the positions of Democrats on immigration: So the Democrats want open borders: ‘Let everybody come in. Let everybody pour in, we don’t care. Let them come in from the Middle East … We don’t care.’ We’re not going to let it happen.” Today I signed an executive order… We’re going to keep families together, but the border is going to be just as tough as it’s been. Democrats don’t care about the impact of uncontrolled migration on your communities, your schools, your hospitals, your safety. Chants of “Build that wall!” have broken out in the crowd. Trump has called out the New York Times for past reporting on his crowd sizes at events and boasted about the turnout at tonight’s rally: It’s fake news, I’m telling you, it’s so fake. Usually they don’t show the arena ... I don’t want to show my face, I want to show the crowds, it’s much prettier.” Trump is now predictably slamming the media, sparking loud chants of “CNN sucks! CNN sucks!” ... “These are very dishonest people,” the president said before praising his recent meeting with Kim Jong-un: I met Kim Jong-un and we had a great meeting, great chemistry. We got along really well ... Everybody was amazed that we had the meeting. … It was an incredible success... I got along with Kim Jong-un. And that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. ... The fact that we do get along means we’re safe.” He also said, “We’re going to keep winning, winning, winning.” Trump has taken the stage at his rally in Duluth, Minnesota – his first rally in a state he lost in the 2016 election. The president begins his rally saying he won’t lose in 2020: We came this close to winning the state of Minnesota, and in two-and-a-half years, it’s going to be really easy I think … I needed one more visit, one more speech.” So far, he has made no mention of immigration or his executive order in the start of his speech, instead shouting out local Republicans. While speaking at a roundtable in Minnesota before his rally, Trump slammed US immigration laws: We have the weakest, most pathetic immigration laws anywhere in the world. Nobody has laws like we do.” He also claimed Minnesota has “plenty of problems ... with respect to people coming in”. The president is expected to speak soon at his rally. Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs is reporting from the Trump rally in Duluth, where Lara Trump is speaking in advance of the president’s remarks: Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, received a massive standing ovation, saying the issue of family separation was a distraction from Trump’s visit to North Korea. She said the media was focusing on “people coming into our country illegally, breaking our laws and paying the consequences about it”. She went on to lay the blame for Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy implemented by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the Obama administration. “People are hysterical about it. The media is going crazy about it, but this has been going on for years and years and years. It happened for eight years under President Obama. Where was hysteria? Where was uproar? Where where Democrats calling out for him to change it?” US officials are now saying there are no immediate plans to reunite children who have already been separated from their parents, despite the executive order ending this practice, according to multiple reports. The New York Times reports: [A] Health and Human Services official said that more than 2,300 children who have already been separated from their parents under the president’s “zero tolerance” policy will not be immediately reunited with their families while the adults remain in federal custody during their immigration proceedings. “There will not be a grandfathering of existing cases,” said Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. Another reporter said there will be no “special efforts” to reunite children already torn from their families, meaning the government will continue for now to treat them as “unaccompanied” minors: Democratic leaders have continued to slam Trump’s executive order and plans to effectively replace the practice of family separation with family detention. Here are a few of the latest statements. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi: The President’s Executive Order seeks to replace one form of child abuse with another. Instead of protecting traumatized children, the President has directed his Attorney General to pave the way for the long-term incarceration of families in prison-like conditions... Using terrified small children as leverage to push the President’s anti-immigrant agenda represents an unspeakably appalling moral low-point for our nation. Yet, House Republicans continue their complicity in the President’s atrocities and cravenly cheerlead the President’s policy. Senator Jeff Merkley: Senator Cory Booker: Incarcerating families and children fleeing violence and oppression is an unacceptable response to the family separation crisis created by President Trump and his administration. The lack of any plan to reunite children with their parents and undo the damage that has been done by President Trump’s family separation policy is profoundly concerning to me. President Trump should immediately reverse his abhorrent ‘zero-tolerance’ policy, which undermines America’s highest ideals and doesn’t make our country any safer. Reveal, an investigative news website, has a disturbing report out on court documents alleging that some immigrant children have been forcibly injected with powerful psychiatric drugs at one of the US government’s shelters: The federal suit alleged that children reported being held down and injected, and Reveal said one child was prescribed 10 different shots and pills. The treatment center in question, which is a government contractor, did not respond to Reveal’s requests for comment on the lawsuit. A US official has confirmed that the government is seeking a policy change in courts to allow for the detention of migrant children for more than 20 days. Gene Hamilton, counselor to the attorney general, told reporters that the 20-day maximum will, however, remain in effect unless Congress or the courts change the rule: Trump’s effort to eliminate the time limit is one of the most controversial components of his new executive order. If successful, it means that even though children would not be separated from their parents, families could be detained together for lengthy periods of time as their immigration cases move through the process. Hamilton also said he could not say when migrant children already separated from families might be reunited with their parents, deflecting a question to other federal agencies. Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs is reporting from the Trump rally in Duluth, Minnesota where the president will speak later tonight. Jim Lundy, a Trump supporter from Lindstrom, Minnesota, said he was unconcerned about the reports about children being separated from their parents at the border: “I think it is bullshit.” He also said he believed the government was following the law: “I don’t understand what the problem is.” Another reporter said that a common theme at the rally was supporters suggesting that photos and videos from the detainment center were fake or photoshopped: While some critics are celebrating Trump’s decision to end his family separation policy, others are pointing out that the executive order offers no plan to reunite parents with the more 2,300 children recently torn from their families. Some Democrats are calling for an immediate plan: Some reports have suggested that the government currently has no process in place for reuniting families divided by the Trump administration’s policies. Earlier today, John Sandweg, who led Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) from 2013 to 2014, said he expects hundreds of separated children will never be reunited with their parents. Here’s a new statement from the American College of Physicians, critiquing the order and calling for more robust solutions: Accordingly, the EO does not ensure that there will be a permanent end to the policy of separating children from their parents at the border, as ACP advocates. The order also fails to address what is going to happen with the thousands of children who have already been separated from their families and remain in the custody of the U.S. government since the zero tolerance policy went into effect. Those children need to be reunited with their parents immediately. Any delay in reunification will exacerbate the negative health consequences inflicted on the children and their families. Additionally, ACP remains concerned about the negative health consequences that have already been borne by the children and parents who have been separated. Those negative health impacts cannot be reversed. The children who were taken from their families are more likely to experience increased mental health impacts like depression, an increased likelihood of engaging in risky behavior such as smoking and alcohol abuse and drug use, and increased likelihood to develop preventable illnesses like heart disease, cancer, or stroke. These are effects that will last their entire lives. Trump appears to be facing some backlash on the right for his executive order ending the widely criticized policy on family separations. Breitbart, the rightwing news outlet once run by former White House strategist Steve Bannon, has accused the president of giving in to “left-wing hate” on the site’s homepage: Presidential candidate John Delaney will debut a new campaign ad on Morning Joe about immigrant detention. Delaney, a three term Maryland congressman who is mounting a long shot bid for the White House in 2020, talks about his grandfather being detained when he tried to immigrate to the United States in 1923 and ends with the now-famous image of a crying young girl being separated from her family at the border. Guardian reporter Lauren Gambino has more analysis of the language in Trump’s executive order: However, the text of the executive order makes clear that a hardline approach to prosecutions will continue. The order instructs government officials to continue its “zero-tolerance” enforcement policy of criminal prosecution for every immigrant who crosses the border illegally, but says that officials will seek to “maintain family unity” by detaining parents and children together instead of separating them while their legal cases wind through a severely backlogged immigration court system. The language leaves a great deal of wriggle room for exceptions, however, noting that “alien families” would be detained together “where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources”. The president’s action also directs the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to go to court to ask for a modification to a 1997 court settlement, known as Flores, which currently prohibits the detention of migrant children for more than 20 days. A successful legal battle could see parents held with their children in detention until proceedings have been completed. After signing the executive order on family separation, Trump is already shifting attention to a different subject on Twitter, launching another attack on Mark Sanford, a Republican critic of the president who recently lost his re-election bid: The Washington Post has more on the GOP meeting and Trump’s remarks about Sanford. Trump also just tweeted angrily about “Fake ABC News”. In Portland, Oregon, activists are occupying an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) building in protest of the family separation policy. Guardian reporter Jason Wilson has details: Ice now says the agency has temporarily shut down the operations facility “due to security concerns”. The agency did not provide a timeline for reopening: The occupation in Oregon grew at the same time as Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump’s homeland security secretary, faced protesters while dining at a Mexican restaurant on Tuesday. Sam Levin in the Guardian’s San Francisco bureau here, taking over our live coverage of Trump’s executive order on family separations. Here are some initial reactions to the details of the text. Notably, the order says the government aims to keep parents and children in detention during immigration proceedings, which can take months or more than a year: The order specifically directs the US attorney general to ask the courts to alter a 1997 agreement that required the release of children without “unnecessary delay”, which has been considered 20 days. In other words, the US is seeking permission to detain children without time limits: Some have also pointed out that the language around keeping families together seems to provide quite a bit of wiggle room and the potential for loopholes. The first section includes this caveat: “It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.” Others further noted that the order repeats falsehoods about the origins of the separation policy: Here is the latest reaction from Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, to her father’s executive order. She calls it a “critical action ending family separation at our border”. Again, the administration initiated the “zero tolerance” policy that lead to the separations. As you may have noticed from the title of Trump’s executive order (“Affording Congress an opportunity to address family separation”), Trump blames the legislative branch for the “zero tolerance” immigration policy which lead to the separations. Some have also pointed out that the order’s title appeared to be misspelled when it was initially released. Here is the full text of the executive order signed by President Trump: AFFORDING CONGRESS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS FAMILY SEPARATION By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration laws. Under our laws, the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is at a designated port of entry at an appropriate time. When an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else, that alien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment under section 1325(a) of title 8, United States Code. This Administration will initiate proceedings to enforce this and other criminal provisions of the INA until and unless Congress directs otherwise. It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. It is unfortunate that Congress’s failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law. Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order, the following definitions apply: (a) “Alien family” means (i) any person not a citizen or national of the United States who has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States, who entered this country with an alien child or alien children at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained; and (ii) that person’s alien child or alien children. (b) “Alien child” means any person not a citizen or national of the United States who (i) has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States; (ii) is under the age of 18; and (iii) has a legal parent-child relationship to an alien who entered the United States with the alien child at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained. Sec. 3. Temporary Detention Policy for Families Entering this Country Illegally. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary), shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any criminal improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their members. (b) The Secretary shall not, however, detain an alien family together when there is a concern that detention of an alien child with the child’s alien parent would pose a risk to the child’s welfare. (c) The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, upon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law. The Secretary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be responsible for reimbursement for the use of these facilities. (d) Heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, make available to the Secretary, for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry, any facilities that are appropriate for such purposes. The Secretary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be responsible for reimbursement for the use of these facilities. (e) The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores v. Sessions, CV 85-4544 (“Flores settlement”), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings. Sec. 4. Prioritization of Immigration Proceedings Involving Alien Families. The Attorney General shall, to the extent practicable, prioritize the adjudication of cases involving detained families. Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, June 20, 2018. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump, sitting at the Resolute desk, said: “Thank you very much. We’re signing an executive order. I consider it to be a very important executive order. It’s about keeping families together while at the same time being sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border, and border security will be equal if not greater than previously. “So we’re going to have strong, very strong borders, but we’re going to keep the families together. I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated. “We’re gonna have a lot of happy people,” Trump said as he signed the executive order. Vice president Mike Pence was at Trump’s left and Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was at his right. In signing the order, Trump said the “zero tolerance” prosecution policy would continue. That policy leads families to being separated because it subjected all migrants who crossed the border illegally to criminal prosecution. When parents were taken to detention, children were reclassified as “unaccompanied minors” and sent to government-run facilities. It is not immediately clear how that will continue while families stay together. This reversal comes after the Trump administration faced withering criticism over the policy from politicians on both sides of the aisle, humanitarian groups, pediatricians, religious groups and others. Donald Trump has signed the executive order ending family separation at the White House. He announced this afternoon he would be ending the practice. Though the family separation policy is due to be ended at any moment, the nationwide protests against it planned for 30 June are still on. Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn Civic Action, said the demonstrations would go forward because of reports that the adminstration plans to use indefinite detention for families, which is illegal under current law. About an hour ago, we reported on the airlines refusing to fly separated children who are in government custody. The homeland security department’s press secretary, Tyler Houlton, condemned this decision in a series of Tweets. For insight into the Trump administration’s decision to implement family separation, the Guardian’s Tom McCarthy spoke to David Horowitz, whose protege was Stephen Miller, the 32-year-old architect of Donald Trump’s immigration policy. Horowitz, a 79-year-old former Black Panther party activist turned conservative firebrand, was feeling defensive on behalf of Miller in an expletive-laden phone interview with the Guardian. “He’s a very smart young man,” Horowitz said. “Here’s the issue: should America, like every other fucking country in the world, particularly Mexico, have borders? That’s the issue. And the Democrats have just demagogued it to make it anti-immigrant. It’s bullshit.” Trump’s announcement that he would end family separation follows a parade of statements by his adminstration claiming that it was outside their power to do such a thing. On 15 June, Trump told reporters: “I hate the children being taken away. The Democrats have to change their law. That’s their law.” On 14 June , White House press secretary Sara Huckabee Sanders said: “It’s the law, and that’s what the law states.” And on Monday, one of the most strident defenses was made by the homeland security department secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who addressed reporters at a White House press conference. Nielsen told reporters the homeland security department was merely enforcing the law in a way that past administrations had failed to do. “Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring the law. We are enforcing the laws as they exist on the books.” The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a class-action lawsuit in March against the family separation practice, expanding an individual lawsuit filed on behalf of a Congolese woman who hadn’t seen her seven-year-old daughter for four months. They have since been reunited. The ACLU’s executive director, Anthony Romero, said in a statement Thursday: “President Trump has been brought to his knees because of the lawsuit we filed on February 26 and the ensuing public outcry. Kids should not have been separated from their parents in the first place and they still don’t belong in jail. His alleged solution to a crisis of his own making is many months too late. It is a crisis that should not have happened to begin with. He has caused irreparable damage to thousands of immigrant families. The devil is in the details. This crisis will not abate until each and every single child is reunited with his or her parent. An eleventh-hour executive order doesn’t fix the calamitous harm done to thousands of children and their parents. This executive order would replace one crisis for another. Children don’t belong in jail at all, even with their parents, under any set of circumstances. If the president thinks placing families in jail indefinitely is what people have been asking for, he is grossly mistaken.” Among those putting pressure on the Trump administration to end the family separation policy were major US airlines, American Air and United. In the past few days, people had been posting on social media about children being transported on these airlines flights. Within three days of being apprehended at the border, children are transported to shelters operated by the health department. Those shelters are all across the country, which is why they are transported by air. It’s possible some of the children described on social media had actually traveled across the border on their own and had not been forcibly separated by their parents because they are the population usually transported to those shelters. But American Air and United airlines have released statements clarifying they will not let the US government fly separated children on their aircraft. “We have no desire to be associated with separating families, or worse, to profit from it,” American Air said in a statement. “We have every expectation the government will comply with our request and we thank them for doing so.” It has been a busy morning. To summarize events: This afternoon, Donald Trump reversed course and pledged to sign an executive order that would stop family separation. The latest news story on that is here. Trump and his adminstration have repeatedly said their hands are tied in putting an end to this practice. Though the practice of family separation is set to end, there is lingering concern about what will happen to families who have already been separated. There are children in US custody whose parents were deported months ago, according to advocates. A former immigration agency head warned “permanent separations” are possible. Last night, Trump declined to end family separations on his own. At a closed-door meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday evening, Trump told members he was “1,000%” behind their immigration reform effort. But he did not offer a clear plan of action. The reversal came after the Trump administration has faced withering criticism over photographs, video and recordings of young children crying for their parents as they wait in metal cages at Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processing centers. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said Wednesday morning that the lower chamber of Congress would vote on Thursday on a pair of immigration bills. “We don’t think families should be separated, period,” Ryan said at a press conference. Anthony Scaramucci, the White House communications director for six days last year, has blamed the family separation policy on John Kelly, the White House chief of staff. Of the 15 members of Congress invited to Trump’s cabinet meeting, one was a woman – Liz Cheney, the Wyoming representative who is also the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney. The senators were: Lamar Alexander, John Cornyn, Tom Cotton, Lindsey Graham, John Hoeven, Jim Inhofe, Ron Johnson, David Perdue, Dan Sullivan, Roger Wicker and Mike Crapo. The representatives were: Liz Cheney, Mike Gallagher, Adam Kinzinger, Mac Thornberry and Mike Turner. Vice-president Mike Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo were also at the table, as well as White House director of legislative affairs Marc Short and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders standing in the room. Notably absent was Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security department secretary who has been overseeing the family separation program. An immediate concern for families, attorneys and advocates will be whether or not the government includes a system to reunite families in the executive order. There is currently no system in place to reunite families, including those where the parents have already been deported while the children are held in US government custody. Kids in Need of Defense (Kind), which has been working with separated children, said as recently as 12 June it had met with a two-year-old who was separated from her father in March. The father was deported within a month, but as of 12 June, the girl was still in the custody of the US government. They are also advocating for a four-year-old who was separated upon entry in Dec 2017. The father was deported and the daughter was still in custody as of 12 June. Trump continues: “If you’re weak ... if you’re really, really pathetically weak, the country’s going to be overrun with millions of people. And if you’re strong, then you don’t have any heart. That’s a tough dilemma.” He goes on to speak about trade. “Honestly, we need people coming into our country,” Trump said. He explains that we want “great” people coming into the country “based on merit.” Sitting in the White House cabinet room, Donald Trump announced he will sign an executive order to end family separation. Trump said: “We’re looking to keep families together. Very important. We’re going to be signing an executive order. We are also going to count on Congress, obviously, but we are signing an executive order in a little while. We’re going to keep families together but we still have to maintain toughness or our country will be overrun by people, by crime, by all of the things that we don’t stand for and that we don’t want. So I’m going to be signing an executive order in a little while before I go to Minnesota but, at the same time, I think you have to understand, we’re keeping families together but we have to keep our borders strong. We will be overrun with crime and with people that should not be in our country.” Trump said that if immigration policies didn’t change “millions” of people would flood the border. From 1 October 2017 to 31 May 2018, more than 252,000 people were apprehended at the border, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Trump said he will sign an executive order to end family separations, according to the White House pool report. Trump said in the cabinet room: “We’re going to be signing an executive order in a little while... We’ve got to be keeping families together.” Bloomberg White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs has updates from inside the White House, where senators are meeting with Trump. She says Trump confirmed to the group he will be signing an executive order on family separation today. Reports are coming in that Trump plans to sign “something” about immigration. And Bloomberg’s senior White House correspondent is reporting that Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was at the White House minutes ago. The homeland security department has been overseeing family separation. Near the border, women at a Tijuana, Mexico migrant shelter spoke to the Guardian’s Nina Lakhani about family separation and how it impacted their efforts to enter the US. The adminstration has also imposed stricter standards for asylum-seekers Ana Ramirez, like most women here, is unaware of the new curbs on victims of gang violence and domestic abuse announced last week by the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Asylum is for people fleeing persecution because of their religion, political beliefs or membership in a social group, he said, not those fleeing crime. Ramirez has come prepared with a police report and believes this will persuade US immigration authorities to grant them asylum. “I have proof, if we go back, they will take my son or kill us all, I’m trying to keep my family together … I’m seeking asylum, I wouldn’t enter illegally. Our correspondent Richard Luscombe in Florida reports on federal detention centers for children: A recently reopened federal detention camp housing unaccompanied child immigrants close to Miami is causing tensions between Rick Scott, Florida’s Republican governor, and the Trump administration. Scott, a vocal Trump cheerleader who has won the president’s backing for his run at a US senate seat in November, has written to health and human services secretary Alex Azar calling for an immediate end to the forced separation of families, and demanding answers about conditions inside the “temporary shelter for unaccompanied children” in Homestead. It is unclear how many of the 1,200 children at the camp have been separated from their parents per Trump’s zero tolerance policy, or how many arrived in the US unaccompanied, but according to the Miami Herald, the camp was only reopened this spring and houses teenagers aged 13 to 17. “I absolutely do not agree with the practice of separating children from their families. This practice needs to stop now,” Scott wrote in the letter. He said he had received “unconfirmed reports” that children in the Homestead facility had potentially been forcibly removed from their parents and asked Azar what health, educational and social services were being provided to them. On Tuesday, Florida’s Democratic senator Bill Nelson accused the Trump administration of a “cover up” over the camp after he and US Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz were turned away by federal officials when they attempted to visit for a “welfare check”. “It’s clear this administration is hiding something,” Nelson said in a series of Tweets. “The Trump administration’s actions to block us from checking on these kids is inexcusable.” Wasserman Schultz said the politicians had received assurances they would be allowed in, but were then turned away by federal officials who warned them they were trespassing. The Associated Press, meanwhile, is reporting that the agency that has overseen family separation, the homeland security department, is considering its own order to end the practice. Fox News chief White House correspondent, John Roberts, said the president is considering ending family separation today through an executive action. Roberts said the action would allow children to remain with their parents while their case goes through immigration court. This is how family cases were traditionally managed until Barack Obama’s adminstration faced sharp criticism for overseeing prolonged family detention after a surge of families and children approached the border in 2014. The Obama adminstration faced several legal challenges and was eventually forced to stop detaining families indefinitely. Many families were then released and asked to return for a future court date. Late-night hosts continue to discuss the backlash to family separation, and last night, The Daily Show suggested another form of activism: having people who oppose family separation call Fox News. “Get on the phone and call the people who can do something about this. I’m not talking about Congress,” host Trevor Noah said. “I’m talking about the policy makers at Fox News.” CNN senior editor Alex Koppelman noted on Monday that the story was missing from Fox News’s headlines: Donald Trump’s former presidential campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, has refused to apologize for dismissing the separation of a mother from her daughter with Down’s syndrome. In response to a panelist on Fox News mentioning the separation last night, Lewandowski responded: “womp womp,” suggesting the separation was not that serious of a situation. The next morning on Fox News, he was asked whether he wanted to apologize. “An apology? I owe an apology to the children whose parents are putting them in a position that is forcing them to be separated,” he said. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed on Wednesday that it separated a child with Down’s syndrome from her mother earlier this month. The agency said in a statement that this was not a result of the “zero tolerance” policy that results in family separation, but because the mother was being held as a witness in a “smuggling incident.” The mother was traveling with her five children, three of whom were US citizens, in a car driven by another US citizen, when the group was stopped, according to CBP. The agency said the three children with citizenship were released to an aunt in the US. “The mother was not prosecuted, but is instead being held as a material witness to support the prosecution of the smuggler, which precipitated the separation of the two other children, both Mexican citizens,” the statement said. Advocates and attorneys are extremely concerned that there is no system for families to be reunited. John Sandweg, who led the immigration enforcement agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), from 2013 to 2014, has told reporters he expects hundreds of separated children will never be reunited with their parents. “Permanent separation. It happens,” Sandweg told NBC News. Separated adults are quickly being sent to immigration court, where they could be deported. Children, meanwhile, are low priority for immigration courts and may have to wait years before their case is heard. “You could easily end up in a situation where the gap between a parent’s deportation and a child’s deportation is years,” Sandweg said. Kids in Need of Defense (Kind), which has been working with separated children, told the Guardian one of their tactics for reuniting parents and children is putting educated guesses into the case tracking system in the hopes it would lead them to parents they were seeking. “You just play around: maybe the child’s number ends in five, so the adult’s number could end in six,” said Megan McKenna, Kind’s senior director of communications and community engagement. “So you put that in the system and see if you get a hit. Or it could be the other way around.” That tactic has worked a few times, but is not a solution. Donald Trump continues to blame Democrats for the family separation practice he implemented. He is also mischaracterizing party position’s on immigration laws. People from both parties oppose family separation and the Democrats do not support open borders. A few minutes after sending that Tweet, Trump retweeted his son Eric Trump, who wrote: “It is hard to believe that the historic North Korea / Kim Jong Un summit was exactly one week ago. Truly amazing to see the lengths the left / the media will go through to change the narrative.” Small protests have dotted the US in recent weeks as the impact of the family separation policy became clear. More demonstrations are planned, including a nationwide day of action on 30 June. Opposition to the Trump administration policy has also resulted in Facebook’s largest fundraiser, with people across the globe contributing more than $7.5m in four days to an immigration non-profit, Raices. “We’ve been occasionally crying around the office all day when we check the fundraising totals … There are terrible things happening in the world. And there are many people who are deciding not to look away but to do something,” wrote Raices on Facebook. Local efforts have also sprung up across the country, including in New York City, where a public Google doc titled: Family Separation - What Can I Do is circulating. Last night, protesters brought their frustrations to Kirstjen Nielsen, the head of the homeland security department, which is overseeing family separations. Nielsen was eating in a Washington DC Mexican restaurant when people began shouting at her. “How can you enjoy a Mexican dinner as you’re deporting and imprisoning tens of thousands of people that come here seeking asylum in the United States?” one person yelled. The Trump administration is defending family separation by saying it is enforcement of a law and claiming the only way to end the practice is through Congress. Neither of those statements are true. The Trump administration in April announced a “zero-tolerance” policy, stating “our goal is to prosecute every case that is brought to us”. Under the Trump administration’s new enforcement policy, every migrant who crosses the border illegally – even those seeking asylum in the US – is subject to criminal prosecution. Immigration rights groups had been warning about family separation since last year, when they documented hundreds of cases of US immigration authorities separating parents and children at the border. How the practice has developed since then is explained in this Q&amp;A: As Donald Trump’s administration continues to separate children, including babies and toddlers, from their parents, citizens and politicians are increasing pressure on the government to end the practice of family separation. Trump has so far declined to end family separations on his own and instead last night backed a plan for Congress to end the practice through legislation. We’ll be providing live updates today on efforts to end family separation, analysis on the chaotic implementation of the practice and dispatches from the border and the shelters where children are being held."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/20/disney-raises-offer-for-21st-century-fox-to-713bn-and-outflanks-comcast","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T13:24:59Z","webTitle":"Disney raises offer for 21st Century Fox to $71.3bn and outflanks Comcast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/20/disney-raises-offer-for-21st-century-fox-to-713bn-and-outflanks-comcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/20/disney-raises-offer-for-21st-century-fox-to-713bn-and-outflanks-comcast","fields":{"headline":"Disney raises offer for 21st Century Fox to $71.3bn and outflanks Comcast","bodyText":"Disney has boosted its offer for 21st Century Fox to more than $71bn in a bid to knock rival Comcast out of the battle to buy the bulk of Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment empire. Disney has upped its offer to $71.3bn (£54bn) – from $52.4bn – trumping Comcast’s $65bn all-cash hostile offer tabled last week. Disney has also moved from its original tactic of an all-stock deal for Fox, owner of assets including X-Men film studio 20th Century Fox, and a 39% stake in Sky, to a 50/50 mix of cash and shares. Fox, which backed Disney’s original bid, said that in light of the new offer Comcast’s bid cannot be considered to result in a better deal for shareholders. “We are extremely proud of the businesses we have built at 21st Century Fox and firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace at a dynamic time for our industry,” Murdoch, the executive chairman of Fox, said. “We remain convinced that the combination of Fox’s iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney’s will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world.” Disney said it expects to pay a total of about $35.7bn in cash and issue 343m new shares to Fox shareholders, representing about a 19% stake in Disney. “The acquisition of 21st Century Fox will bring significant financial value to the shareholders of both companies and after six months of integration planning we’re even more enthusiastic and confident in the strategic fit of the assets and the talent at Fox,” Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney, said. Comcast, the US cable operator and media group, is not expected to go away, however. It has also lodged a separate £22bn bid to buy all of Sky, and under chief executive Brian Roberts it is expected to respond with an improved offer as a bidding war hots up over the summer. Fox said the company directors remain open to “evaluating a competing proposal”. Fox’s share price closed 7.5% higher at $48.08, indicating that investors believed a bigger bid from Comcast was likely. Murdoch has faced shareholder pressure over his preference for Disney’s original deal, which was 19% lower than Comcast’s offer. One analyst said bidding for the Fox assets could rise to between $75bn and $80bn. “Above $80bn would be a tough pill to swallow for Disney shareholders given the steep price,” said Dan Ives, analyst at market research firm GBH Insights. “That said, this poker game appears to be just getting started and now it’s Comcast and [Comcast CEO Brian] Roberts move to show their next hand.” Christopher Hohn, the activist investor behind hedge fund TCI, last month wrote a letter to the Fox board pointing out that Murdoch has a potential conflict of interest as capital gains tax issues could lead him to preferring a lower priced stock offer from Disney over the cash deal from Comcast. Disney has sought to address that issue, sweetening its offer while giving Fox shareholders the choice between taking cash or stock. Culture secretary Matt Hancock is set to clear Rupert Murdoch’s £11.7bn bid to take over the 61% of Sky that he does not own, with conditions that include selling off Sky News to reduce his power over UK news media. However, if Murdoch wants to raise his bid for Skyin order to compete with Comcast, he must get the green light for an increased bid from Disney. On a call with analysts on Wednesday, Disney’s Iger refused to say where he stands on the progress of Fox’s bid for Sky. “I don’t have update on Sky,” he said. “Fox is in the driver seat ... You’ve seen the regulatory [developments]. I won’t say more than that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/21/how-to-eat-like-chef-less-than-20-pounds-week-thrifty-recipes","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T05:30:02Z","webTitle":"How to eat like a chef for less than £20 a week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/21/how-to-eat-like-chef-less-than-20-pounds-week-thrifty-recipes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/21/how-to-eat-like-chef-less-than-20-pounds-week-thrifty-recipes","fields":{"headline":"How to eat like a chef for less than £20 a week","bodyText":"Food sustainability isn’t just about protecting our environment, it’s about protecting us, the consumers, and supporting the farmers who make our food. Affordability is a key element of what a sustainable diet looks like. I call my approach Root to Fruit eating. It is a philosophy that aims to make it easier for people to cook good food, blending a little chef’s knowhow with academic research, and making it applicable to home cooks and professionals alike. My shopping list comes in at just over £18 a week – cheaper than the average national weekly spend per person of £24. Over a year, that’s a saving of about £300 while still enjoying top-quality food (I buy everything from my local independent health-food shop or market, or organic items from the supermarket. Of course, if you need to bring the cost of your shopping down further, buy non-organic). I’m a vegetarian, so there is no meat on my shopping list, and eating less meat is certainly a good way of keeping costs down. However, if you are buying meat, opt for cheaper cuts of higher-welfare animals. Every head chef works to a tight budget to make a profit. When we invent a dish, we cost and portion it gram for gram to calculate a gross profit of 70-75%. So a dish we sell for £5 must cost less than £1.25 to make, including any waste, which we are always looking to minimise. That margin is there to cover the cost of rent, staff, utilities and, if you’re lucky, a profit. But chefs love good produce, so they devise other ways to keep their costs down, turning scraps that cost pennies into a fine meal for which patrons are happy to pay pounds. Noma, for example – one of the best restaurants in the world – serves cod’s head as a main course. Taking on board a chef’s thrift in the kitchen will help you save money while eating healthily and sustainably – as my guide and recipes show. The weekly shop The best chefs will buy local and seasonal ingredients where possible. Pineapples and pomegranates are luxuries to be enjoyed, but base the bulk of your weekly shop on seasonal produce from the market or through a veg box scheme and you will have a double win, improving the taste and economy. Alongside your basics (eggs, milk, butter, cheese, bread etc) choose a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables including legumes, brassicas and roots. The monthly shop Chefs buy in bulk; it’s cheaper in the long run and reduces unnecessary packaging. Store cupboard items are an investment – you can build up a variety over time. Having a few key items in the store cupboard is a great way to ensure there is always an affordable meal in the house. Dried pulses come with a low price tag – even when they are organic – and a little goes a long way. Just 5p’s-worth (60g per person) will provide the bulk of a meal. Other items such as lentils, grains, dried fruit, nuts and seeds will give you a variety of delicious ingredients to experiment with making your own dishes. Weekly shopping list Budget: approx £25 a week for two £1 6 onions 50p 1 head garlic £1.50 1.5kg potatoes £1.50 1 bunch roots with their tops – carrots, beetroot, celeriac etc £1.50 1 bunch leafy greens or celery with leaves £1.50 1 bunch beans – broad, runner etc £2 2 heads brassicas – cauliflower, broccoli etc £42 bags fruit £2.70 6 eggs £21 litre milk £2 250g butter £2100g cheese £3.50 1 loaf wholemeal bread Monthly shopping list Budget: approx £50 a month for two £1.05 250g sea salt £1.79 40g pepper £1.55 50 teabags £2.60 1kg oats £6.50 500ml olive oil £2.80 500ml sunflower oil £1.70 350ml vinegar – cider, malt etc £1.99 1.5kg wholemeal flour £6.30 2kg short-grain brown rice £3 1.5kg dried pulses – kidney beans, chickpeas etc £3.60 2kg grains – barley, spelt etc £3.60 1kg dried lentils £3.60 250g nuts and seeds £2 375g raisins or other dried fruit £1.30 40g spices – coriander, cumin etc £1.30 500g whole wheat pasta £1.70 700ml passata £1.99 200g creamed coconut £1.89 340g spread – honey, Marmite etc Breakfast Keep it simple: porridge, pancakes, toast and eggs. When making porridge, allow 50g of oats (about 14p) per person and use three times the water. Drop scones, AKA American pancakes, are a delicious breakfast and a real treat that take minutes to make and cost very little. Mix 75g of wholewheat flour with half a teaspoon of baking powder, a teaspoon of vinegar and 100ml of water. Then fry little pancakes in a pan with the slightest drop of oil and serve with honey, jam or fruit. Sample recipe: Porridge with roasted rhubarb, hazelnuts and molasses 1 portion = 50p Porridge is no longer thought of as gruel-like – now it is celebrated and topped with endless combinations of wonderful ingredients. Ingredients 14p 50g oats, flaked buckwheat or spelt 11p 1 stick rhubarb 21p 15g hazelnuts 4p 2 tsp molasses or dark sugar Place the rhubarb and hazelnuts on a tray in the oven at 190C/370F/gas mark 5 for 10 minutes. Simmer the oats with 150ml of water and a pinch of salt, stirring until it thickens, adding more water if necessary. Top with the nuts, rhubarb and molasses. Lunch Eat like Yotam Ottolenghi and make colourful lunch salads using nutritious grains, seeds, dried fruit and seasonal vegetables. Use up the odds and ends from the fridge and take advantage of those leftovers. My pesto pasta recipe is a great example of how you can make a meal out of store cupboard ingredients and everyday vegetables. Sample recipe: Carrot- and beetroot-top pesto pasta 1 portion = 72p Edible greens from root vegetables are delicious ingredients in their own right. Use them to replace pricier greens in dishes such as this one to reduce the overall cost of your shopping. Ingredients 33p 100g wholemeal pasta 5p 2 tsp vinegar 16p 1 tbsp olive oil 5p 25g carrot tops or herbs, washed 5p 25g beetroot leaves or another root green, washed 5p 10g stale bread 3p 1 small clove garlic Boil your pasta following the packet instructions. Blend the rest of the ingredients with a pinch of salt. Mix the sauce and pasta together and serve topped with more carrot leaves. Dinner Time to be creative: cook simply and channel your grandparents with classics, whether it’s shepherd’s pie or a nut roast. Otherwise, invent your own dish. With fresh vegetables, you can’t go wrong. Roast, saute or simmer vegetables, toss them with herbs or toasted spices and serve them with a grain of your choice. About 50g of rye, barley, spelt or rice (10-16p) is a good portion. Or be inventive and concoct your own soup or stew to use up the withered vegetables hiding at the back of the fridge. Sample recipe: Spiced rice, roasted broccoli, carrot and peanut salad 1 portion = 92p I live off salads such as this. They are very forgiving; go to town and experiment with what ingredients you have. Base your salad on a grain, and use vegetables – raw or cooked – for colour, nuts or seeds for crunch and dried fruit for a little sweetness. Ingredients 24p 50g short-grain brown rice, boiled 25p ¼ head broccoli, cut into florets, stalk cut into 2-3cm pieces 7p 1 small carrot with leaves 16p 1 tbsp olive oil 5p 25g celery tops, chopped 8p 15g peanuts, toasted 8p 15g raisins 5p 1 heaped tsp garam masala 6p green chilli, sliced Remove the carrot leaves, and wash and cut them up finely. Slice the carrot and toss with the broccoli and olive oil. Roast in the oven at 200C/390F/gas mark 6 for 15 minutes, or until the edges are charred. Mix with the other ingredients, season and serve.

With northern Europe already battling a CO2 supply problem, three of the largest UK plants producing the gas have closed for maintenance, sparking panic among brewers, pub groups and food suppliers. Trade bodies said they held talks with the government to address the prospect of an interruption in the supply of fizzy drinks, beer and a wide range of foods that are kept fresh during storage and transit using CO2. The pub chain Wetherspoons and the Tottenham-based brewer Beavertown said the flow of beer and soft drinks could be cut off within days. Poultry producers said chicken processing plants, many of which use CO2 in the slaughter process, could also be affected. “There’s a good chance that some drinks won’t be available very soon,” said a spokesperson for Wetherspoons, which has nearly 1,000 pubs across the UK. “We’re aware of the situation and working with suppliers to minimise any disruption. But the fact is that there is definitely going to be a problem that will affect not just Wetherspoons but all pub and bar operators.” Most other pub chains are also expected to face disruption. The drought could take hold before the end of the World Cup, which concludes in mid-July. The gas is in short supply across Europe amid high summer demand for fizzy drinks and beer, coupled with shutdowns at ammonia and bioethanol plants, key sources of CO2. Beavertown said it had enough CO2 to last until next Tuesday and may have to halt production after that. The process requires CO2 to be pumped into cans and bottles to rid them of oxygen and keep the beer fresh. “It’s come at absolutely the wrong time because it’s the World Cup and the height of summer. People want to watch the football and have a pint, so demand increases,” a spokesman said. “This will be right the way across the industry, from a micro-brewery to a larger brewer.” He said Beavertown had limited supplies in reserve if CO2 supply did not resume. “We’re almost always sold out but in this situation you want stock as backup. We could probably tide ourselves over for another week.” Food supplies are also facing disruption because suppliers use CO2 to keep products fresh during storage and transit. The British Meat Processors’ Association said it had asked the government to prioritise CO2 supplies to pork and poultry slaughterhouses because the gas is used in the most humane form of slaughter. Without increased supplies, farms could end up with a backlog of animals that cannot be slaughtered, a spokesperson said. Poultry producers said on Wednesday that 60% of chicken processing plants could be out of operation within days. Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said he was in urgent talks with government about securing supplies. He said if gas could not be secured then plants would have to consider reducing or stopping production or using temporary measures such as electrical stunning. With 90% of chicken and other poultry sold in British supermarkets produced domestically, halting production could have a swift impact on stocks in stores. “These are big plants processing more than 10,000 birds an hour. That would be a significant amount of food not being produced,” Griffiths said. “The government is aware that there are reports of a CO2 shortage affecting the food and drink sector and that industry is working to find a solution. Whilst this is an issue for industry, the government is in contact with the relevant companies and trade associations, including those within the food and drink sector and main CO2 suppliers.” The British Retail Consortium has written to retailers informing them that drinks and meat supplies could be affected. Camra, the organisation for devotees of cask ales, seized on the opportunity to urge drinkers to abandon artificially carbonated brews. “Beer drinkers concerned about the supply of beer this summer can rest easy,” said Tom Stainer, Camra’s chief communications officer. “There are plenty of fantastic real ales, ciders and perries that will be completely unaffected by the impending CO2 shortage. “Real ales are naturally carbonated by live yeast that is left in the bottle or cask, and are therefore ‘living products’ compared to keg beers, which artificially inject CO2 into the brew for carbonation. In addition, real ciders and perries are naturally still, making them a refreshing beverage choice in the summer heat.” Camra members recently turned down a motion that would have led to it promoting the interests of products such as keg beer, which requires CO2."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/20/parents-urged-to-set-boundaries-around-childrens-use-of-the-internet","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T13:28:01Z","webTitle":"Parents urged to set boundaries around children's use of the internet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/20/parents-urged-to-set-boundaries-around-childrens-use-of-the-internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/20/parents-urged-to-set-boundaries-around-childrens-use-of-the-internet","fields":{"headline":"Parents urged to set boundaries around children's use of the internet","bodyText":"The culture secretary has said it is up to parents to set boundaries around their children’s use of the internet and has condemned unlimited and unsupervised access to smartphones. Matt Hancock, whose brief includes digital issues, agreed parenting in the digital era was difficult but he said it was not impossible and he urged parents to set boundaries around new technology in the same way they have always set boundaries for their children. His comments on parental responsibility followed his earlier call for more headteachers to ban mobile phones in schools. In a speech to an NSPCC conference on children’s online safety, he said: “It’s easy to see why some parents feel uncomfortable with the technology their children are using, especially when their children may know far more about it than they do. Parenting in this digital age is hard but it does not mean it’s impossible,” he told the audience. “Setting boundaries on the use of new technology is important just in the same way as we set boundaries for children in every sense. The technology may be new but the principles have not changed.” He warned: “Unlimited and unsupervised access to smartphones can be a portal to some very serious risks. And the chief medical officer has highlighted growing concerns around the impact on children’s mental health. This backs up every parent’s instinct; that children must be protected.” Responding to his comments, an NSPCC spokesperson said: “Of course parents need to help their children navigate the online world, and to agree rules and boundaries as a family. “The problem is that at the moment parents can often struggle with those decisions as they are faced with no consistent child safety standards across social networks.” Hancock, who has three young children, told the Guardian in a recent interview that he does not allow them mobile phones, saying: “They don’t have access to the devices. They don’t have phones. Why do they need phones? They’re children, they’re 11.” Elaborating during his speech at Wednesday’s conference, he added: “I firmly believe that very young children don’t need to have access to social media at all. After all, they are children. “Social media is not designed for under-13s. It is often against the terms and conditions for children to be using these platforms.” On mobile phones in schools, the culture secretary said: “Whilst it is up to individual schools to decide rather than government, I admire the many headteachers who take a firm approach and do not allow mobiles to be used during the school day.” He also quoted a recent study in the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research which showed that mobile phones could have an impact on working memory and measured intelligence, even if the phone was on a table or in a bag. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Headteachers already, of course, have the power to ban mobile phones in schools and we support their right to do so. “We know that 95% of schools already impose some kind of restriction on mobile phones use during the school day, with a substantial number banning them from the school premises altogether.” The NSPCC said there needed to be more evidence that banning children from using mobile phones in schools altogether would help keep them safer. “What we do know is that children are being exposed to unacceptable risks online from bullying, grooming and harmful content. “We want to help children and adults identify risks so they can use the internet safely. That’s why the government must legislate to force social networks to improve child safety, and design safety in from the start, not as an optional extra.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/20/homeless-couple-who-shared-windfall-with-friends-on-trial-for-money-laundering","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T12:50:16Z","webTitle":"Homeless couple who shared windfall with friends on trial for money laundering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/homeless-couple-who-shared-windfall-with-friends-on-trial-for-money-laundering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/homeless-couple-who-shared-windfall-with-friends-on-trial-for-money-laundering","fields":{"headline":"Homeless couple who shared windfall with friends on trial for money laundering","bodyText":"A homeless couple who found €300,000 (£264,000) in an old Singer sewing machine while squatting in an abandoned building are on trial for money laundering after giving away some of the windfall to people who had helped them in the past.

And the people who took the money should have known that Joey and Kimberley could not have come by such sums of money in a normal way.” A lawyer for Kimberley, Sofie Vermeir, told the court her client had hoped the money would change the course of her life. She said: “They wanted to buy a house, because they know all too well that such shelter is the start of a normal life.” The owner of the abandoned building is said to want the cash returned. Jesse van den Broeck, acting for Joey, said his client was an “honest finder” and should be allowed to keep the cash. “In the first hour procedural errors have already been made, so the investigation is void,” he said. “I ask that Joey get his money back and not be punished.” The couple’s windfall was only discovered after the property of a friend with whom they were staying was searched during a drugs raid. Officers found 1.5kg of speed (amphetamine) and more than 1,000 pills in the house, while Joey was found to have €50,000 in cash on him. The prosecutor’s office is seeking 18-month suspended prison sentences and fines of €6,000 each for the couple. The judge is expected to give his decision in two weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/23/berlin-to-broadway-kurt-weill-le-nozze-di-figaro-bbc-symphony-orchestra","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T13:00:06Z","webTitle":"The week in classical: Berlin to Broadway with Kurt Weill; Le nozze di Figaro; BBC Symphony Orchestra – reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/23/berlin-to-broadway-kurt-weill-le-nozze-di-figaro-bbc-symphony-orchestra","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/23/berlin-to-broadway-kurt-weill-le-nozze-di-figaro-bbc-symphony-orchestra","fields":{"headline":"The week in classical: Berlin to Broadway; Le nozze di Figaro; BBC Symphony Orchestra – review","bodyText":"Festival madness aside, midsummer is the time for national opera companies to shake themselves out and venue hop. The Royal Opera has gone east and south to Hackney and Southwark with two chamber-sized premieres (by Na’ama Zisser and Tansy Davies). Welsh National Opera is on tour with Elena Langer’s racy new suffragette opera, Rhondda Rips It Up. English National Opera will follow a praised Acis and Galatea, staged at its West Hampstead studio, with Benjamin Britten’s The Turn of the Screw outdoors at Regent’s Park this week. Opera North – the list ends here – brought its classic Cole Porter musical Kiss, Me Kate to the London Coliseum last Wednesday, and staged a new show in Leeds in collaboration with West Yorkshire Playhouse, nimbly directed by Giles Havergal. Berlin to Broadway with Kurt Weill, the story of the composer’s journey from prewar Germany to exile in America, featured a nine-strong ensemble of chorus members, performing at Leeds City Varieties music hall. This beautiful red plush and gold Victorian theatre, venue for the likes of Houdini, Buster Keaton and Danny La Rue, is a jewel. No cod German or American accents; top quality singing and nifty footwork set the tone for Gene Lerner’s musical revue, created in 1972, with music by Weill (1900-1950) and songs from the highlights of his career. An informative narration, shared between the performers, linked the early brilliance of The Threepenny Opera (1928) to the final, touching but problematic Lost in the Stars (1949). Amy J Payne swooned and spat, catlike and furious, in Surabaya Johnny from Happy End. Amy Freston, originally trained as a dancer, and Dean Robinson twirled perfectly in the Pimp’s tango, and the entire lineup delighted in Ice Cream (Street Scene), first up after the interval when many in the audience were still polishing off their vanilla tubs. The female ensemble caught the sharp irony of That’s Him from One Touch of Venus (1943), with lyrics by Ogden Nash (“He’s like a plumber when you need a plumber: satisfactory”). For the final “that’s him”, mezzo-soprano Laura Kelly-McInroy draped herself over the resolutely undistracted music director, Martin Pickard, who deserved the accolade: directing from a grand piano to the rear of the extended City Varieties stage, he held all together with pinpoint timing, making the instruments sound rhythmic and rough; silken and caressed. Moving south to rural Leicestershire, a handsome new theatre of similar size – 400 seats – has been built within the stable block of Nevill Holt Hall, a Grade I-listed grand pile owned by the Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross, whose initiative this is. Designed sympathetically in wood and stone by Witherford Watson Mann, the theatre is functional and comfortable, with a crisp, generous acoustic by Sound Space Vision (also responsible for Garsington’s pavilion, and many concert halls worldwide). It helps, from the pleasure point of view, that the estate has spectacular walled gardens, its own private sculpture park and vistas over middle England. To open with Mozart’s Le nozze di Figaro, prettily done in Chardin-style mob caps, tricorns and breeches, might seem a safe bet, though whether The Marriage of Figaro, full of dark complexity and genius, can ever be an easy ride is debatable. The season’s other opera, Thomas Adès and Philip Hensher’s Powder Her Face, shows a different kind of brave intention. Two top ensembles – the Northern Sinfonia in Mozart, the Britten Sinfonia in Adès – are in harness. After an initial association with Grange Park Opera, Nevill Holt has had an opera festival for four years. Its young artists’ programme, and a strong connection with local schools, are key to its endeavour. Like other country house companies, it makes a point of giving singers in the early stages of their career a chance to try big roles: in 2015, rising star tenor, David Butt Philip sang Don José in Carmen. This year the name on everyone’s lips was that of Leicestershire-born baritone James Newby, 25, already the recipient of many prizes, making an outstanding debut as the Count in Figaro. He has a golden tone and he can act. The theatre’s intimate size, and the recessed pit preventing too dominant an orchestral sound, gives fine support to developing voices. Lawson Anderson’s robust and animated Figaro and Aoife Miskelly’s wry Susanna led an able cast, with memorable cameos from Rowan Pierce (Barbarina) and, now rarely seen on stage, the doyenne soprano Joan Rodgers (Marcellina). Joe Austin’s direction, with white Spanish-Moorish designs by Simon Kenny, tended towards the fussy, but Nicholas Chalmers, artistic director, conducted with assurance and, after a slow start, plenty of zest. You can hear Figaro in Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 23 in A major, K.488, finished just before the opera’s premiere. It featured in a BBC Invitation Concert given by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Gergely Madaras with 25-year-old Mariam Batsashvili as a superbly poised soloist – a name to watch. The BBC has just announced plans to close Maida Vale studios, which have been home to the BBCSO since 1934. We shouldn’t be too nostalgic about the closure of a windowless building full of asbestos, but it’s part of broadcasting history. The real hail and farewell isn’t until 2022. Since someone’s bound to say it, I’ll go first: ave atque Maida Vale.

Crafted by its creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy to be an experience like no other, Westworld’s flourishing mythology is in its DNA. Themes of identity, agency and morality inevitably lend themselves to fervent theorising. The fan base cracked most of season one’s big twists far in advance, so ahead of The Passenger (which is simulcast on Sky Atlantic early on Monday morning and repeated at 10pm the same night), we look at the six best theories currently circulating among the Westworld fandom. The Futureworld conspiracy In Futureworld, the 1976 sequel to the Westworld movie, Delos create near-perfect replicas of the world elites who visit the park, in the hope of infiltrating the one percent with automated sleeper agents under their control. It has been speculated this could happen in the TV show. It would be exactly the kind of psychotic robot espionage we have come to expect from Delos. Are we really saying, however, that the public could not discern their leaders from a bunch of power-crazed androids controlled by a faceless corporation? Westworld is in China Beyond it being huge, unforgiving and having that authentic frontier air about it, we know very little of Westworld’s location. Early on, the clever money was on Westworld being out of this world, maybe on a satellite, perhaps even on Mars. Over time, though, fans have honed in on the Far East as the location, most likely close to China. The Delos soldiers who come to take back the park from the hosts speak Chinese and have uniforms looking very much like those of the People’s Liberation Army. Perhaps taking their cue from the Firefly universe, China and the US are the two big superpowers of the future. The Sphinx is the key It has always been difficult to get a handle on Westworld’s creative maverick Robert Ford. Equal parts storyteller and metaphysical prankster, he delights in pulling the rug from under us and confounding our expectations. But maybe he showed his hand in this season’s fourth episode, The Riddle of the Sphinx. The theory runs that the Riddle of the Sphinx is the heart of the real motivation behind Westworld. The ancient parable on the inevitability of ageing reveals what has been staring at us all along, according to Reddit. “The Delos Experiment is trying to create a true host-human hybrid – a baby host who will age and grow up,” says user Seize-The-Meanies. It definitely has a certain elegance to it and it would hardly be the first time man and machine ended up breeding to create a new beginning. Bernard is Teddy As if the issue of identity wasn’t fraught enough, the possibility emerges that Westworld’s host Head of Programming has been taken over by conflicted gunslinger Teddy. For the first time in season two we see the core control units of the hosts, spherical objects known as pearls. They are removable and therefore perhaps transferable, like game cartridges. Bernard’s strange behaviour in the immediate aftermath of the gala massacre timeline and his “I killed them – all of them” confession in the weeks later timeline suggests to some that the later Bernard is not Bernard at all. He dresses rather like Teddy and we get a flash of him looking down at his white hands on Teddy’s train to Sweetwater in the season two primer. The nub of it is that something happened between these two timelines to turn Bernard into Teddy. It would be exactly the kind of switcheroo Westworld loves to pull off. This one has legs. William is insane You will no doubt have heard the scurrilous gossip that the Man in Black is a host, but that is frankly yesterday’s news. Hot off the press after the events of episode nine comes the theory that he has, in fact, lost his mind. William’s journey from white hat to black hat may be the most tragic of all the Westworld character arcs. It would be enough to drive anyone mad and the glimpse we get in the episode of his character profile reveals him as a persecutory and paranoid subtype, suffering from delusions. His Dolores hallucination at the party adds weight to the theory. That the murdering sex offender has mental health issues is not in itself a big reveal, but casting doubt on his reliability as a narrator has big implications for the rest of the Westworld universe. How much of his interaction with Robert Ford is really just in his head? Westworld’s wolf is from Winterfell The FlashForward kangaroo was just a kangaroo and the Lost polar bear was just a big dumb bear but maybe finally we have a rogue animal with some symbolic significance. The Westworld white wolf mainly appears in the flashbacks of Dolores and Teddy, typically cantering its way through a street littered with bodies. Reddit Philosophers have intriguingly suggested that the wolf represents sentience and is only visible to those who have attained consciousness. Even more seductive, though, is the theory that the wolf is Nymeria, one of the Winterfell direwolves from Game of Thrones. The prospect of a Marvel-style HBO universe throws up endless possibilities. If winter is coming, maybe Omar’s coming too?

We need to reinvent it","bodyText":"Our once brilliant welfare state is out of kilter with modern troubles, modern lives and much of modern public opinion. A set of institutions and services designed for a different era now looks threadbare and beyond repair. They can sometimes help us in an emergency, but in many cases, from our health, to work, to care in our old age, they cannot support us to flourish. In recent years, our public services have been devastated by cuts. Invest more money, argue those on the left. Better management, counter those on the right. The truth, I have learned in my work with communities across Britain as a social entrepreneur, is that our troubles run deeper. I don’t think we can fix these systems, but I think we can reinvent them, with human connection at their heart. When people feel supported by strong relationships, change happens. And when we make collaboration and connection feel simple and easy, people want to join in. Yet our welfare state does not try to connect us to one another, despite the abundant potential of our relationships. Most of our services – for young and old people alike – are aimed at managing risk and getting by. “A good adolescence? It’s getting through, innit? I’ll get to the other side without a criminal record and stuff,” is how Mo, 19, puts it. But too many people are not making it. Adolescence was a concept that did not exist when the welfare state was designed, and yet today we know that these in–between years are a vital time of development and, crucially, that if things went wrong in the early years, adolescence is a second chance. If the help is there. Ten years ago, as part of an effort to understand what young people really needed from services, I rented a bus stacked with pizza and parked at night on London estates and in seaside towns. I hung out on rough ground and, when it rained, I fled with my new friends to the youth centre. I wanted to listen and to think about what could be. What I heard again and again was a hunger for connections, for the relationships needed to get on. Ben wanted to be a chef, Amelia to write. They knew they had little chance. Others like Mo were frustrated and angry. They didn’t want better youth services. They felt imprisoned in youth–only spaces. They wanted to get out. With the young people, I started an experiment. We knocked on doors – of arts centres, workshops, hotels and more. Could they spend time with a young person doing something of shared interest together? “Yes!” came the almost universal reply. “Thank you for asking, we would love to be involved.” And, powered by mobile phones and a website, we invented something new: a way to knit young people back into the communities around them. It was low-cost, so we could include everyone – those who were thriving, those who had the connections and those who needed help and encouragement. Through doing things together – cooking, dancing, making – then meeting up to share experiences, relationships grew between the young people and the adults they got to know. Demeanours changed, possibilities opened up and those who grew came back to help others. This mismatch between the services on offer and the challenges of today goes well beyond adolescence. Most people who are poor today are in work. Almost half of British families rely on low-paid jobs, dependent on in–work benefits to survive as they rotate between one precarious job and another. No one wants to live on handouts, but research shows most decent jobs are not advertised. “Get me out of here!” read the poster emblazoned across a false door I hastily erected in a jobcentre. I asked people to cross the threshold and join our effort to design a new approach to finding work and progressing in it. Those out of work know that they will not find work in the queue – like those looking to climb the ladder, they need new relationships. But where can they start? Together, we designed simple tools and used public meetings to connect those in and out of work. Again, low-cost digital platforms enabled us to reach many people cheaply. We had real impact. Independent evaluation of our work showed that it cost one-fifth of others that were on offer, and 87% of members found work or progressed. Contrast this with the 66% failure rates of standard jobcentre approaches. In modern Britain, we don’t know each other any more. As inequality bites, we live in different neighbourhoods, go to different schools and join different clubs. But social research shows conclusively that it is who we know that will determine the shape of our lives: what work we find, how healthy we can be and, at the end of our lives, what care we will receive. The British welfare state was perhaps the biggest social revolution the world has ever seen. The principles laid out by William Beveridge in 1942 transformed the nation: we were offered healthcare, good education, decent housing and support when out of work or unwell. Just six years after the publication of his bestselling report, Beveridge wrote another pamphlet on voluntary action. In it, he declared he had made a mistake. His welfare state left out people, communities and the bonds between us. In this century, we need new collaborative models that can support us in our current economic transition. The labour movement in Britain was informed by a long history of mutual self–help: the work of Octavia Hill, Samuel Smiles, the co–operatives and the new forms of organising found within communities and the unions. Today, we need to start where Beveridge left off and learn again from this history and from the work that is growing across Britain. The approaches I am describing are all around us, but they are marginal and often have to work in spite of our formal welfare systems. We need to invest in the new and move it to the centre ground. We must create a new framework that better supports us collectively to expand our capabilities and address both the internal feelings and the external structural realities that hold us back. Some 70 years ago, we created a transformation out of the ruins of war and the economic depression that preceded it. We can do this again – if we start in the right place, in people’s lives. Beveridge did not reinvent from scratch. Instead, he told a powerful story of what could be and developed a new structure within which good things that already existed could grow, and other things could be transformed. We can and must do the same. • Hilary Cottam is a social activist and the author of Radical Help"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/tvs-best-pop-spoofs-from-paper-boi-to-peeno-noir","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"TV’s best pop spoofs: from Paper Boi to Peeno Noir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/tvs-best-pop-spoofs-from-paper-boi-to-peeno-noir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/tvs-best-pop-spoofs-from-paper-boi-to-peeno-noir","fields":{"headline":"TV’s best pop spoofs: from Paper Boi to Peeno Noir","bodyText":"Paper Boi Atlanta Sounds like: Gucci Mane If it wasn’t for the fact that it’s only a few seconds long, the song Paper Boi would probably have been No 1 in 57 different countries – we see you, Hungary and Norway – by now.

The latest rhetorical ploy is that young children are being taken to “tender age” shelters. The adjective “tender” here officially describes the youngsters’ age, but it implies that the policy is itself an example of official tenderness. This idea is reinforced by the use of “shelter”, as though the children are being protected from a storm or bombing raid, whereas they have in fact been deprived of the shelter of their parents. What do you do to children of a “tender” age? Why, you put them in cages, of course. But they must not be called cages, lest people realise that you think of these humans as little more than feral dogs. Instead, Fox News host Steve Doocy suggested, the authorities had simply improvised a bit of hipster interior design, building “walls out of chain-link fences”. This is reminiscent of the contest over what Israel called a “fence” built well into the occupied territories. Since much of it was a concrete wall, the opposition preferred to call it a “wall”. A room whose walls are built out of chain-link fencing is a cage. What, meanwhile, should we call all the places in which the US is holding children near its southern border? “Internment camps” reminds some embarrassingly of the ignoble treatment of Japanese people during the second world war, while “concentration camps” seems to others, well, a bit too Nazi. (It was in fact the British who invented the term “concentration camp”, as a euphemism, during the Boer war.) The official term remains “detention centres”, as though the children have just been a bit naughty and are required to stay for an hour after school. That there can be such a relentless blizzard of dishonest unspeak to describe the kidnapping and imprisonment of children in 21st-century America might seem astonishing – but, as we are learning, in Trump’s world anything is possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/21/world-cup-fiver-argentina-leo-messi-him","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T11:25:09Z","webTitle":"Carrying the weight of a nation on their shoulders | World Cup Fiver","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/21/world-cup-fiver-argentina-leo-messi-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/21/world-cup-fiver-argentina-leo-messi-him","fields":{"headline":"Carrying the weight of a nation on their shoulders: World Cup Fiver","bodyText":"MUM’S THE WORD Coping with the intensity of a World Cup isn’t easy, especially when your colleagues are always looking to you for inspiration. Enough about The Fiver, though, let’s talk about Him, who was at it again against Morocco on Wednesday. Some players would buckle if they had to carry the weight of an entire nation on their shoulders. For Him, however, the extra load is merely a chance to make His 10,000 press-ups a little bit more taxing every morning. Nothing fazes Him these days – even the prospect of Morocco’s manager Hervé Renard stealing the limelight with his dashing good looks couldn’t throw Him off his stride at the Luzhniki Stadium. There really is no point trying to stop Him. It’s getting ridiculous, especially when you compare the Portugal forward’s one-man mission to prove some sons of Gollivan wrong by turning José Fonte into a world champion with the early struggles of His great rival, Lionel Messi, whose Ethics World Cup highlight so far is having a penalty saved by an Icelandic film producer. See, single-handedly taking on a country’s unrealistic expectations isn’t as simple as it looks. Pressure can do funny things to people and Messi was already showing signs of feeling the strain during Argentina’s 1-1 draw with Iceland last Saturday. The angst, which is hardly helped by Jorge Sampaoli selecting W1lly Caballero as his goalkeeper, is clear. “His aim is to bring the Cup home,” Celia Cuccittini, Messi’s mother, cheered on Argentinian TV the other day. “It’s one of his biggest desires. We see him suffer and cry at times.” No, The Fiver’s not crying, you are. It’s just … mum … mummy. It’s enough to make the bottom lip tremble, even if Cuccittini did stop just short of showing the world pictures of a two-year-old Messi in the bath, and hopefully her words of support will have an invigorating effect when Argentina take on Croatia, the new perennial dark horses, in Group D on Thursday night. Croatia are top after their comfortable 2-0 win over Nigeria, who face Iceland on Friday, and it’s unlikely that Argentina can afford to lose to Zlatko Dalic’s dangerous side. Encouragingly, Sampaoli is said to be considering changes, with Cristian Pavón set to join Sergio Agüero up front, but all eyes are likely to be on Messi again. Especially those of Him. It seems a bit unfair. Maybe the other Argentinian mothers can tell their sons to be nice to Leo and buck up their ideas.

Why can’t Northern?","bodyText":"Are there any words more dispiriting for the regular rail traveller than “bus replacement service”? Worse than leaves on the line, more irritating even than the talking toilets on the Virgin Pendolino, buying a ticket for a train and ending up on a bus is one of life’s great disappointments. Spare a thought, then, for travellers to and from Windermere, the honeypot of the Lake District, which two and a half weeks ago was cut off from the national rail network when an operating company decided to shut it after a timetabling and engineering snafu. Northern rail, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company, closed the Lakes line on 4 June for what it initially said would be two weeks “in order to stabilise service levels”. Coaches were put on instead – not enough, naturally, and with a timetable that ignored the fact the bus journey took twice as long as the train, meaning everyone missed their mainline connections at Oxenholme. Before long the fortnight had become a month, with Northern now estimating it would be back to business in the Lake District on 2 July. How hard could it be to run a railway line with only five stops, wondered Patricia Marshall last Tuesday, as she cancelled a visit to the Lakeland shop in Windermere after discovering she would have to take a bus to the temple of Tupperware. Marshall is the managing director of West Coast Railways, a tiny train operator based 18 miles down the line at Carnforth, an old station famed for its appearance in Brief Encounter. She doesn’t do buses. West Coast specialises in vintage locomotives, and runs a steam train called Olton Hall, better known as the Hogwarts Express since its appearance in the Harry Potter films. She contacted Tim Farron, the MP for neighbouring Westmorland and Lonsdale, after he led a protest march along the dormant line. “We could run the service,” she told him, saying she had a train at Carnforth and could spare a driver and guard until Northern got its act together. Though it wasn’t a steam locomotive, the 45-year-old diesel to be used was still a vintage act — important, in this case, because Chris Grayling cancelled the Lakes line’s electrification last year for various phoney reasons, so the railway can’t handle anything too modern. What a marvellous idea, thought Farron, who, together with his staff in Kendal, spent the next few days on the phone trying to persuade the rail overlords that a heritage railway company specialising in steam was in a better position to run the Lakes line than a multinational company responsible for transporting 2 billion passengers around Europe each year. “I’ve never seen so many spanners thrown in the works at each junction,” says Farron, of his days of frantic negotiation with the Department of Transport, Network Rail, Northern Rail, the Office of the Rail Regulator and Transport for the North. He said the sheer number of conversations necessary is a reminder of the lunacy of our fractured rail system. Farron, a man who literally believes in miracles, was undeterred. By Saturday evening, when he was in a curry house in Blackpool after taking his wife to see Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark for her birthday, he had worn the mandarins down. By Sunday morning a train was chugging up the line to Oxenholme from Carnforth, ready for a few test runs. The shuttle service wasn’t supposed to start until Monday but by Sunday afternoon they were already carrying passengers along the nine-mile line. “People were absolutely loving it,” said Robert Talbot, a retired teacher who is part of the Lakes Line Rail User Group, which has been complaining about the reliably awful service for months before Northern woes made the national news. (Northern cancelled 160 Lakes line trains in April, and 300 in May – and they only run 36 each day). As soon as West Coast stepped into the breach, a gang of enthusiasts from the local community rail partnership sat down with some timetables and worked out that 12 trains – six in each direction – should plug the gap during peak times. “It was a triumph of ‘can do’ over ‘can’t do’,” says Farron, who sat in the cab in the first test run as locals cheered from every bridge. He has persuaded Transport for the North to foot West Coast’s £5,500 daily bill for running the shuttle service, and believes strongly that Northern Rail should be stripped of the franchise. If I were David Brown, Northern’s chief executive, I’d hand over the franchise in shame, head bowed. When a bunch of steam freaks behind the Hogwarts Express can run a modern train line better than you can , it’s time to go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/donald-glover-atlanta-robbin-season","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Donald Glover on the return of Atlanta: ‘I’m not making a TV show, I am making an experience’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/donald-glover-atlanta-robbin-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/23/donald-glover-atlanta-robbin-season","fields":{"headline":"Donald Glover on the return of Atlanta: ‘I’m not making a TV show, I am making an experience’","bodyText":"“There’s that saying that you have your whole life to make your first album, and then eight months to make your second,” says Donald Glover. “And when the first one’s fire, and everybody loves it, then they will all come up to you and say: ‘Hey don’t let me down with the second one, now.’ That was the way we were feeling about season two of Atlanta.” For the 34-year-old actor, writer, director, singer, rapper and producer, it’s likely there is more than a modicum of pressure weighing on him given the success of Atlanta. The debut season of the comedy, which he created and stars in, launched in the autumn of 2016 and went on to win a run of awards including two Golden Globes and two Emmys, one for outstanding direction for a comedy, the first time an African-American has ever received the award. Set in the southern US city, which is beleaguered by crime and poverty yet bursting with creative output, particularly in rap music, the show portrays the struggles of three young men lurching through life: Earnest (Glover), an Ivy League college dropout trying to establish himself in the music business by managing the career of his cousin Alfred, AKA Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), a trap artist on-the-up, whose recent mixtape was certifiably “fire”; and their spaced-out friend, Darius (Lakeith Stanfield). The show soon established itself as dark, weird and very funny. Which came as something of a surprise to Henry, for one. “We honestly didn’t think Atlanta was going to be seen as a comedy but you have to be able to laugh at the absurd, in order to keep from crying,” he says when I meet him and Glover in Los Angeles. Not that they’re calling it anything so prosaic as season two, however; this is Atlanta: Robbin’ Season. “We filmed it in the autumn and winter. And, in Atlanta, that’s the time that people flex [show off]. And people are going to jack you for that,” explains Henry of the rise in crime during this time of year. “There’s a bigger threat of home invasion, there’s a bigger threat of getting mugged. Robbin’ Season is about exploitation. There’s a greater sense of danger and darkness for these characters, too.” Indeed, the season begins with a shootout at a drive-through fast-food joint; Earn is now homeless and Paper Boi under house arrest, while later episodes see a hostage situation in a Neverland-esque mansion and strange goings-on in at Drake’s house. For the actors, there was a tangible sense of life mirroring art. The show continues to be filmed “in the ’hood”, as Glover describes some of the city’s most deprived neighbourhoods. “And we’d not been in Atlanta since the first season,” says Henry. “And now everyone recognises us, we’re like: ‘Oh, that’s great. But actually, we might get mugged.’” “I kind of forgot that everybody on the show wasn’t super-famous before this,” admits Glover, with a giggle. Indeed, the boost that the show has brought to its cast and their careers has been enormous. Later this year, Henry will be seen alongside Daniel Kaluuya and Liam Neeson in Widows, directed by Steve McQueen, while Stanfield stars in Sorry to Bother You, a film about an African-American who adopts a “white accent” in order to progress in his job, released next month. However, this is undoubtedly Glover’s year, with his role as Lando Calrissian in Solo: A Stars Wars Story, and his much-discussed single as Childish Gambino, This Is America. He also won a Grammy earlier this year for his track Redbone, and last year was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world. Atlanta steers clear of direct political commentary, though “there is no way of waking up in the morning, and walking through this country as a black man and not have it be political,” shrugs Henry. But the show – much like Insecure, Issa Rae’s HBO comedy which she describes as being “about black people being basic” – does not get bogged down with references to the current, or previous US administrations. “The way I look at it, the years Obama was in office, and the year after Trump was inaugurated, if you were poor, you really didn’t see the difference. That stuff really didn’t touch you,” says Glover. “We just look at what happens when someone is really poor, when someone really doesn’t have a stake in any of this. I think half the reason we are at the place we are at with politics is because so many people do feel that they don’t have a stake in it.” Glover’s buzz-creating video for This Is America – featuring the startling scenes of him shooting a gospel choir among other loaded images – was more overtly political, taking aim at US issues including police brutality and gun violence. It was directed by Hiro Murai, who also directs much of Atlanta, and injects the show with a somewhat surreal flavour. “We have a really great chemistry, and it’s rare that you find that,” says Glover of their dynamic. “I think we keep each honest about what’s actually daring. I don’t like shows when they become risk-averse. I don’t think that’s the point – trying to self-preserve. I’m not here to make seven seasons and a movie. That would be really bad.” He giggles again: “Unless we get to seven seasons, and I’m like: ‘This is actually perfect: somehow Atlanta became Game of Thrones.’ “But I’m not making a TV show, I am making an experience,” he adds. When putting together his writers’ room for the show, Glover deliberately selected people with no television experience. “You are much more willing to take a risk if you don’t know you are taking one, if you aren’t aware of the problems that could arise.” Along with his team’s blissful ignorance, Glover is also blessed with an impressive level of creative confidence. “I think a lot of people are afraid to fail because, being black, you don’t get a chance to fail,” he explains. “But I am not afraid to fail.” It’s probably a moot point. Given the rapturous reception Robbin’ Season has received in the US and worldwide already, failure would not appear to be on the cards any time soon.

Advocates argued it would end refereeing injustice at the World Cup. With a week gone, what are the key incidents that have been decided so far by the video assistant referee system (VAR) – and did the officials get it right? Diego Costa: Spain v Portugal What happened: In the buildup to Diego Costa’s 24th-minute equaliser, he challenged Pepe for the ball, leaving the Portuguese defender on the floor, dramatically clutching his jaw. What should have happened: Portugal were after more VAR-VAR than jaw-jaw, but the goal should have stood, and it did. VAR verdict: 👍 Risdon and Griezmann: Australia v France What happened: Josh Risdon dived in and tripped Antoine Griezmann just inside the box, in a tackle which the referee initially waved on as good. A shout in his earpiece from the VAR room led Andrés Cunha to the pitch-side screen, and he awarded the penalty. What happened: Even with multiple angles, TV pundits still argued over whether Risdon had got enough of the ball before touching the man to make it a legal challenge. VAR seemed to have swapped one borderline decision for the opposite borderline decision. VAR verdict: 👎 Kim and Claesson: South Korea v Sweden What happened: Play was called back after Kim Min-woo’s forceful challenge and follow-through upended Viktor Claesson. What should have happened: Sweden’s coach said it was “crystal clear” and it was. The correct decision. VAR verdict: 👍 Harry Kane: England v Tunisia What happened: Nothing, despite Kane repeatedly being wrestled to the ground when Tunisia were defending corners. What should have happened: Kane should have been awarded at least one penalty during the match. He described his eventual last-minute winner as a form of “justice”. VAR verdict: 👎 Mohamed Salah: Egypt v Russia What happened: The referee awarded Egypt a free-kick on the very edge of the penalty area after Salah was hauled over by Roman Zobnin for the hosts. What should have happened: The foul on Salah continued into the area and the correct decision was a penalty. After the review, the spot-kick was given, and Salah smashed in his first World Cup goal. VAR verdict: 👍 Guerreiro and Amrabat: Portugal v Morocco What happened: Morocco’s Nordin Amrabat and Portugal’s Raphaël Guerreiro tangled in the penalty area. Morocco appealed for a spot-kick that was not forthcoming. Morocco’s coach, Hervé Renard, was furious, making the TV review signal to the fourth official on the sidelines, and was ultimately spoken to by the referee. Guerreiro later lifted his shirt which appeared to show marks left on his skin where he had been on the receiving end during the exchange, possibly from Amrabat’s boot as they fell. What should have happened: Replays suggested that both players had a firm grasp on each other’s shirts, and that no penalty was probably the correct call. VAR verdict: 👍 Ronaldo: Portugal v Morocco What happened: In the 85th minute, with Portugal still only leading 1-0, Ronaldo took a free-kick on the edge of the penalty area which struck the wall. Running in to the area to try to pick up the rebound, he fell under a challenge. Ronaldo himself made the gesture to ask for VAR when the penalty was not awarded. What should have happened: It may have been an exaggerated fall, and there was a lot of criticism on social media of CR7 for daring to dive and then ask for VAR himself, but the still images speak for themselves, there was definitely contact in the area, and it should have been a penalty. VAR verdict: 👎 Pepe: Portugal v Morocco What happened: In the 90th minute, Morocco’s captain, Medhi Benatia, tapped Pepe on the shoulder to get his attention when the ball was out of play. Pepe collapsed to the ground. Gary Lineker tweeted: “See Pepe is still a dick.” What should have happened: Retrospective punishment for Pepe for simulation VAR verdict: 👎 Ezatolahi: Iran v Spain What happened: Saeid Ezatolahi appeared to equalise against Spain, and all hell broke loose as the Iranians celebrated. But the referee’s arm was raised to caution them to wait for the VAR check. What should have happened: The goal was correctly disallowed for offside. The looks on the faces of the referee and his assistants suggested that is the verdict they would have reached more quickly left to their own devices, but VAR made the right call. VAR verdict: 👍 Poulsen: Denmark v Australia What happened: The referee consulted the pitch-side screen and awarded a penalty against Yussuf Poulsen for handball. Poulsen was three feet away from where the ball was headed, had his arm out because he was jumping, and didn’t move it towards the ball – but having viewed it, the referee did move his hand to point to the spot. What should have happened: Probably not a penalty, but it wasn’t clearcut. ITV pundits Eni Aluko, Slavan Bilic and Martin O’Neil argued about it for most of half-time. It was a harsh decision – but maybe, given how Australia fell foul of a VAR penalty in their opening game, just like old-fashioned refereeing mistakes, VAR will also even itself out over the course of a tournament? VAR verdict: 👎 Aquino: Peru v France What happened: The referee was going to issue a yellow card to the wrong player. What should have happened: He should have booked Pedro Aquino. VAR stepped in, and he did, exactly as the system was designed. VAR verdict: 👍 Rebic: Croatia v Argentina What happened: In the 40th minute Ante Rebic plants his studs on Eduardo Salvio’s shin. The referee brandishes his yellow card quickly, so VAR isn’t used to turn it into the red it should have been. What should have happened: Croatia should have been down to 10 men, and Rebic should not have been on the pitch to profit from Willy Caballero’s howler to later give Croatia the lead and set them on their way to demolishing Argentina. VAR verdict: 👎"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/21/ethnic-tensions-rise-in-uganda-as-world-cup-row-leaves-four-refugees-dead","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T09:00:06Z","webTitle":"Ethnic tensions rise in Uganda as World Cup row leaves four refugees dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/21/ethnic-tensions-rise-in-uganda-as-world-cup-row-leaves-four-refugees-dead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/21/ethnic-tensions-rise-in-uganda-as-world-cup-row-leaves-four-refugees-dead","fields":{"headline":"Ethnic tensions rise in Uganda as World Cup row leaves four refugees dead","bodyText":"Ugandan officials have begun segregating refugees after a rise in ethnic tensions led to the deaths of four South Sudanese, including a teenager. Security agencies have been heavily deployed in northern Uganda’s refugee settlements, home to more than 1 million people, in response to unrest between the warring ethnic groups that have fled conflict in South Sudan. Three men and 13-year-old boy were killed and a further19 injured in a fight that erupted during a disagreement over a seat as South Sudanese refugees watched football in a video hall in a camp in Uganda’s north-western Arua region. The dead and injured were all members of the Dinka community, the tribe of incumbent President Salva Kiir, who became involved in a clash with Nuer tribesmen loyal to rebel leader Riek Machar. According to Josephine Angucia, the West Nile regional police spokesperson, the quarrel began during Sunday’s World Cup match between Brazil and Switzerland and quickly exploded into violence. After the deaths of Thon Majok, 18, his 50 year-old father, Mabok Jimak, John Mayang, 13, and Aleu Anei Aleu, 32, the warring factions have been mobilising for counter and revenge attacks, said Angucia. “The two communities are generally in fear and are anticipating revenge attacks,” she said. “Officials are relocating the two groups to separate camps so as to prevent further clashes.” The civil war that broke out in December 2013, leaving tens of thousands of people dead and nearly 4 million displaced, is between government troops loyal to President Kiir, most of whom are Dinka, and Nuer soldiers, reinforced by poorly armed civilian militia. Teresa Ongaro, regional spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, described the clashes as regrettable. “We regret the loss of lives. This is a security matter. We are working with the national authorities to establish the facts of what happened and how to deal with it,” said Ongaro. Hillary Onek, Uganda’s minister for refugees said: “We don’t accept such barbaric behaviours. We condemn it in the strongest possible terms. “Police have been working hard to defuse those clashes in the settlements, together with our people from the ministry. “Maybe we haven’t done enough psychosocial programmes on the ground to calm down the situation and harmonise the relationship between them. “I know in their country they are fighting and killing each other all the time. It’s a routine for them. In their country, they are always at war with each other. We can’t accept it here.” “They need to begin to accept each other and maybe, by the time they go back to their country, they would have reduced the level of tension and violence to live together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/20/grenfell-tower-borough-behaved-like-property-developer-barry-quirk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T11:49:47Z","webTitle":"Grenfell Tower borough 'behaved like a property developer'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/grenfell-tower-borough-behaved-like-property-developer-barry-quirk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/grenfell-tower-borough-behaved-like-property-developer-barry-quirk","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell Tower borough 'behaved like a property developer'","bodyText":"The chief executive of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea told survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster that the council had been behaving like “a property developer masquerading as a local authority”, MPs have been told. Barry Quirk, who took over at the borough one week after the fire in June 2017, made the comment in a private meeting with Grenfell United, the survivors’ group, one of its leading members, Edward Daffarn, told the House of Commons housing select committee. “Think about that,” Daffarn told the MPs. “They were property developers masquerading as a local authority. They failed to keep us safe because they had higher priorities – getting their hands on the land, this massive goldmine they had.” The council said it accepted Daffarn’s remarks and agreed. It indicated its strategy has changed since the fire, which sparked the resignations of the leader and deputy leader, Nick Paget-Brown and Rock Feilding-Mellen, the latter of whom works as a property developer. Kim Taylor-Smith, current deputy leader, said: “We know we have to change, to listen to our residents and to act on their wishes. We respect Ed Daffarn’s views … The new council has pledged to build new social homes in the borough and have also taken on private developers like Capco, who are building high-end flats in Earl’s Court, and have made them include more social homes in their developments.” Daffarn also criticised the council’s evidence to the public inquiry into the disaster, which claimed 72 lives. He said it was not being honest about “the little cabal of senior councillors and senior council officers from housing, from corporate property and from planning who have decided to asset strip the whole of our community, sweat our public buildings, disregard the people that live there and force them from the land they were living on because it was a gold mine.” The committee heard from residents’ leaders that a year after the fire the relationship between the Conservative-led council and residents was riven with mistrust, particularly over the process of rehousing. It also took evidence from Elizabeth Campbell, the leader of the council, and Quirk. Quirk told the committee that several of the senior executives at the council have been changed, notably in the housing department. Sixty-eight households from Grenfell Tower and the walkways below have yet to move into a temporary or permanent home, according to the latest figures. Nineteen households have yet to accept any offer, although Campbell, said 18 of these cases were in hand. Quirk said errors had slowed down rehousing by up to three months. Sophie Earnshaw, of the North Kensington Law Centre, told the MPs: “The level of mistrust between the council and survivors and residents is significant. In initial months there was a lot of pressure on survivors to make very important decisions about their housing and survivors felt under pressure to accept unsuitable offers. The council has improved to a certain extent but residents do still feel that pressure.” She said the council bought 100 properties soon after the fire that disregarded the needs of survivors, with some in high-rise buildings. Jacqui Haynes, from the Lancaster West Residents’ Association, which represents residents in the wider area, said the problem with rehousing them was similar to those of Grenfell itself. Of the 127 Lancaster West residents only 39 have moved into a permanent home. “They are being given one offer that they have to take,” Haynes said of some residents. “Some of the policies that surround their tenancy effectively mean they feel they are being forced to move out when they are unsure or uncertain. This is years of disempowerment and years of being looked upon as if we don’t matter and it is something that has cascaded. “We have been suffering this sort of treatment for years and decades and it has been OK. It was just the fact that this disaster happened that everything blew up into the air and we can see this cannot continue. We don’t trust them and possibly that won’t happen for years.” Campbell said: “Each household will come to a different decision. We hope that some of them will return home”. If they don’t they will be given high priority in bidding for other homes, she said. Quirk told the committee that the council had addressed the rehousing challenge early on “without genuinely appreciating the depth of grief and despair”. He said the council had made housing its priority, but it should have been the humanitarian response. The council has bought 320 properties for rehousing in all. Daffarn told the committee that some of the properties had not had fire risk assessments carried out. “Residents weren’t informed of that when they were viewing and choosing,” he said. “Examples like that show the way that we feel we are not being treated with the respect we deserve. Even if they didn’t have the fire safety certificates, they should have informed us these properties would have to undergo further tests.” Campbell denied the council had shown indifference. “We absolutely do care,” she said. “People have been in hotels a long time, but it’s complicated. We have worked extremely hard to build that [trust].”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/20/music-industry-wins-key-vote-in-youtube-copyright-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T12:02:05Z","webTitle":"YouTube faces paying billions to music stars after copyright vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/20/music-industry-wins-key-vote-in-youtube-copyright-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/20/music-industry-wins-key-vote-in-youtube-copyright-battle","fields":{"headline":"YouTube faces paying billions to music stars after copyright vote","bodyText":"YouTube stars from Taylor Swift to Ed Sheeran, Beyonce and Jay-Z could be in line for big paydays after the video giant lost a crucial vote in Brussels over new copyright laws that will force it to pay billions of dollars in fees for users watching music videos. For years the music industry has argued that YouTube exploits the lack of legal protection around music videos being viewed on its service to pay minimal amounts to artists and labels when they are viewed. The music industry has lobbied that this “value gap” between the true worth of the music videos and what YouTube decides to pay needs to be addressed with legislation. On Wednesday, a crucial vote by the European parliament’s legal affairs committee went the way of the music industry with an agreement to adopt copyright laws that will force platforms such as YouTube to seek licences for music videos. “The importance of today’s vote cannot be overstated; this proposal is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a new balance in the online world,” said Helen Smith, the executive chair of the European music body Impala, which represents labels behind acts including Adele, Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand. “It is about copyright and making sure creators and their partners get a fair share of the value they create.” YouTube has an estimated 1.3 billion users who regularly watch music videos and it paid $856m (£650m) in royalties to music companies last year – an estimated 67 cents per user annually. In the UK, record labels and artists earn more than double the royalties from the sale of 4.1m vinyl records than they did from the 25bn music videos watched on YouTube last year. By contrast, income from the 272 million music fans who paid for ad-supported services such as Spotify, generated $5.6bn in royalties, or about $20 per user annually. While the legal affairs committee vote marks a landmark moment – it is the lead committee on the legislation that has been the subject of vociferous lobbying by tech companies and the music industry for 18 months – it will face a further challenge before becoming law. The committee voted 15 to 10 to adopt the controversial article 13. It is expected that a challenge will be lodged by members of the European parliament opposed to it, which will result in the entire parliament voting in July to decide whether to approve or reject Wednesday’s result. A final vote on the adoption of the overall legislation will be made later in the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/2018/jun/21/radical-lessons-knife-crime-beyond-the-blade","type":"article","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"The radical lessons of a year reporting on knife crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/jun/21/radical-lessons-knife-crime-beyond-the-blade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/2018/jun/21/radical-lessons-knife-crime-beyond-the-blade","fields":{"headline":"The radical lessons of a year reporting on knife crime","bodyText":"They call it the “reachable” and the “teachable” moment: that brief window when a young person who has just been stabbed will be most receptive to a message about how to make changes in their life. Just as the most propitious time to talk to people about diet and exercise is when they’ve just had a heart attack, the best chance for this lesson is right after they turn up in hospital with a stab wound. “When you say, ‘There’s a one in 100 chance of that happening to you,’ nobody thinks they are going to be the one,” says Dr Emer Sutherland, clinical director for emergency medicine at King’s College Hospital in south London. “But when you are the statistic, everything suddenly becomes relevant to you.” So just upstairs from the accident and emergency ward at King’s is a team of youth workers, employed by a charity called Redthread. They are not doctors, but have been trained to work in a hospital environment and have access to young patients’ records. “I tell them I’m a youth worker,” says Lucy, who runs the unit at King’s. When she first meets a patient, she tells me, she starts by pointing to the doctors and nurses and saying: “These people will take care of you medically.” If the police are also there, she will say: “They will investigate the crime.” Then she describes what Redthread offers. “What I will do is all the other stuff. Think about where you’re going home to. Maybe you need help with housing, college or employment, or to process what has happened. Anything else that is outside of your body that you need, that’s me.” “Often they will start off with the most urgent needs. Food. Drink,” Lucy explains. “I always feel it’s a test. They want you to do something practical for them. They might want a Lucozade. One guy wanted me to ring probation because he was worrying about a breach. I did that. Then he called probation to check that I’d done it. Once he realised I could deliver, he was cool.” Not all of the young people engage. But most do. “When we can get to someone and talk face to face, especially if they stay overnight, then 80% of them want to have a conversation – but if they’ve left the hospital, only 40% answer the phone.” Redthread will help them with almost anything – from an outpatients’ letter to help with finding a new place to live, away from an area or a clique that is unsafe. “I tell them: ‘I don’t want to see you here again,’” Lucy says. “I don’t want to see you here until I’m holding the hand of your partner who’s having a baby.” Redthread are treating more than just a stab wound. They are trying to tackle some of the conditions that made the stab wound possible. Earlier this year, a handful of fatal stabbings (and shootings) in London launched another one of Britain’s episodic fixations with knife crime and youth violence. In what is now a familiar cycle, headlines depicting the capital as a cesspit of murderous villainy provoke dramatic declarations from politicians, who respond to the coverage rather than the crime. With context scarce, and tales of human tragedy and incendiary predictions plentiful, a sense of moral panic burns brightly for a few weeks, and then fades as the news cycle moves on. For the papers and politicians alike, hyperbole takes over where facts are absent – often mistaking London for all of Britain, and mistakenly assuming that race, not class, is the only common thread. At one stage, the news was dominated by the claim that London had a higher murder rate than New York, which was true if you counted February and March but not January, and ignored the fact that New York saw more than twice as many homicides as London the year before. The tabloid depiction of London’s streets running with blood was also picked up by Donald Trump, in a desperate attempt to justify America’s lax gun laws. The fact is that a child or teenager was 16 times more likely to be shot dead in America in 2016 (the last year for which figures were available) than they were to be stabbed to death in Britain last year. For young people in London – which Trump likened to a “war zone” – fatal stabbings are 4.5 times less likely than shooting deaths across America. So in the toughest place in this country in one of the toughest years, British kids are safer than American kids in any year. This is not to say that Britain – and particularly London – does not have a problem. A growing number of children carry knives, many to protect themselves, and a growing number are getting stabbed. Last year was the second worst in four decades for teenage knife deaths in London – and this year could be worse. But it’s still not even remotely the problem our leaders think it is. That much is clear in the way they talk about it. Almost every time the term “knife crime” appeared in the national press last year – outside of this paper – it was referring to black kids in London. (There was one exception, for the death of Sait Mboob, a black 18-year-old stabbed in Manchester.) So the term is not used to describe all crimes committed with knives, just those where young black men in London are involved. Much like “mugging” once only denoted black street crime and “street grooming” only refers to Asian sexual predators, “knife crime” is a racialised construct. Working on the assumption that gangs – another term generally reserved for black kids – are driving the rise in knife crime, politicians tend to call for stiffer sentences and tougher laws, and target cultural expressions most popular with black youth. In 2007, then prime minister Tony Blair told an audience in Cardiff: “We won’t stop this by pretending it isn’t young black kids doing it.” A year earlier, David Cameron, then the opposition leader, suggested in a speech that hip-hop was partly responsible for youth violence. “I would say to Radio 1, do you realise that some of the stuff you play on Saturday nights encourages people to carry guns and knives?” More recently, drill music in particular has come under scrutiny, with police blaming videos they claim are inciting violence on social media. Almost everything about these assumptions is wrong. In a year-long series called Beyond the Blade, the Guardian gained access to previously unavailable data on young people and knife crime from the past 40 years, and counted all the children and teens killed by knives last year. We discovered that roughly half of all teenage knife deaths, on average, take place outside of London. The overwhelming majority of those killed by knives in Britain in the last 40 years are not black. The overwhelming majority of young people caught carrying knives today are not involved with gangs. This matters because it makes it more difficult to tackle the issue when you consistently and persistently misidentify it. Treating knife attacks as a criminal issue that affects black kids in London removes the majority of young people who are fatally stabbed from the equation altogether. The longer sentences fill up jails; the stop and searches make it more difficult to build trust and cooperation where the police most need it; it makes people who aren’t black or living in London complacent that their children are not vulnerable. Every stabbing is a crime. But the most effective way to deal with “knife crime” is to treat it as a public health issue, and to tackle all the contextual elements – housing, employment, mental health, addiction, abuse, as well as crime – that make some people and communities more vulnerable to it. But that would take public spending and a coordinated and compassionate strategy that focuses on it for the long term. The government has the capacity to do this, but there is no evidence yet that it has the will. It takes longer than a tabloid news cycle to see the patterns and engage with the people affected. * * * Near the end of the 12 years that I spent reporting in America, I wrote a book about gun crime, which told the stories of the 10 children and teens who were shot dead on a single day in November 2013. The aim was to humanise those involved and challenge prevailing assumptions by telling the stories behind the grim statistics. When I moved back to London, a few people asked me if I would do something similar about Britain. I could not, I replied, because – thankfully – there just aren’t that many gun deaths here. But perhaps, some suggested, it would be possible to study knife crime over a much longer period than one day. That was the genesis of this series, which has sought to track each individual death of a child or youth who had been stabbed – and, by telling their stories, to better understand the many issues and causes connected to knife crime. Thirty-nine children and teens were stabbed to death in 2017. The demographic breakdown of those young people might not challenge many stereotypes. With the exception of Matthew Cassidy, who was killed in Wales on 29 May, they all fell in England. Of the 39 cases of alleged stabbing, 22 were black, 14 were white and three were Asian. Twenty died in London, with the next-highest concentration being three in Manchester. The average age was 16. But the stories behind those deaths did confound the usual assumptions about knife crime. They died in all sorts of places, from rural Essex and Oxfordshire to the inner city; outside nightclubs and schools, and at an Eid celebration. The youngest was Mia Kelly, who was just minutes old when her mother, Rachel Tunstill, stabbed her 14 times in the neck and back with a pair of scissors, in Burnley, one of two infanticides in 2017. After killing Mia, Tunstill wrapped her body in a carrier bag and put her in a bin, while her unsuspecting partner played Xbox in the next room. Many of the children fell in clusters, which would in turn provoke those flurries of media interest, followed by protracted periods of relative calm and complacency. On 8 August, three young people died in one day. The five weeks and three days between 28 August and 5 October was the longest stretch in which no child was stabbed to death. That relative calm was breached on 6 October when two young men were killed within 24 hours. In many of the stories, it was not clear what had led to the stabbing. Some succumbed to the pettiest of rivalries. Jordan Wright of Blackheath in London died after a WhatsApp altercation with his friend Paul Akinnuoye about who was more “gay”. (Social media can accelerate and amplify the tiniest slights.) Akinnuoye, 19, who was sentenced to 21 years for murder, called Jordan a “batty boy”. “On your mum’s life, I’m straighter than you,” responded Wright, who was autistic. Two hours later, Akinnouye came for him with a small knife and stabbed him in the chest, arms and neck. One of the challenges of sustained reporting on knife crime is that it takes months for cases to come to trial – and it is only then that the accuracy of the original reports of a killing can be measured against a full account of what happened. In the 39 deaths we chronicled, there have been 24 convictions. In five cases, people have been charged and are awaiting trial. One case has gone to a retrial, and in another six, nobody has been charged, or the person charged has since been released. In just three deaths – those of 19-year-old Abdullahi Tarabi in Northholt, 15-year-old Koy Bentley in Watford, and 17-year-old Abdirahman Mohamed in Peckham – the accused were found not guilty. After the acquittal of the two 17-year-olds accused of killing Abdullahi, the judge, Nicholas Cooke QC, lamented that “very few people are prepared to help the police … had somebody helped, the outcome might have been different”. Earlier this month, a judge banned five drill artists from referring to Tarabi’s death in songs or on social media. Of the 41 people found guilty in fatal stabbings (there was often more than one assailant), in cases in which we know the race of the assailant (roughly a third of those convicted were under 18 and so could not be identified), only five were a different race from the victim. When crime is this segregated, it renders the term “black-on-black crime” a nonsense. Unless we are also going to refer to “white-on-white crime” – which we don’t – it makes more sense just to call it what it is: crime. The assailants were often older, with an average age of 19. The oldest person convicted was 48-year-old Leslie Baines, who, along with David Woods, was found guilty of murdering 19-year-old Matthew Cassidy, with whom they had been in a dispute over a drug deal in Connah’s Quay in north Wales. The youngest were two 14-year-olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons. They were both sentenced to life for killing 18-year-old Saif Abdul Majid in Neasden in north-west London – the result of a dispute that had festered for all of a day. Majid had fought with the two boys the day before, and sustained a facial injury. He saw them in the same place the next day and they set upon him again, stabbing him several times, including a fatal thrust to the neck, before leaving him to die on the pavement. The average sentence was 19 years. The potentially shortest sentence was for the 15-year-old killer of seven-year-old Katie Rough, who was found guilty of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility and sentenced to a minimum of five years. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, slashed Katie on her neck and chest in a park near Katie’s home, and then called emergency services to tell them what she had done. The girl had been struggling with mental illness for some time. Her barrister told the court she had been telling people of “delusional and bizarre thoughts” for many months before the killing, including the “genuine belief … that her family and many others were not human and may be controlled by a higher and hostile force”. The longest sentence was handed down to Aaron Barley, 24, a child of incest who was orphaned at the age of six. He had been given help and support by Tracey Wilkinson in Stourbridge in the West Midlands after she saw him sleeping rough near a supermarket. The Wilkinsons found him work, fed him often and paid for his mobile phone. Not long after they stopped his phone payments, Barley stabbed Wilkinson and her 13-year-old son, Pierce, to death and tried to kill Peter, her husband. He was initially sentenced to 30 years, but a court of appeal decided it was “unduly lenient … in this most exceptional and grave case” and added another five years. In almost all of these cases, there was clearly a series of social challenges beyond the crime itself: mental health, school exclusions, poverty or unemployment that make the susceptibility to violence – either as a victim or a perpetrator – more likely. By the time the criminal justice system intervenes, it is really adjudicating a crisis that has been created elsewhere. * * * On the 10th floor of the University of Illinois’s School of Public Health, Dr Gary Slutkin pointed to a map of Chicago bearing round stickers showing where murders have taken place. The north of the city was mostly clear, but you could barely see some of the South Side for all the dots. “It’s the same pattern on a map of the incidence of cholera in Bangladesh,” he said. “This is an infective process.” I was interviewing Dr Slutkin in January 2013, shortly after a spate of shootings in Barack Obama’s hometown had piqued the curiosity of my editors back in the UK. Slutkin, the executive director of Cure Violence, specialises in infectious-disease control and fighting epidemics, and used to work for the World Health Organisation. He thinks violence behaves like infectious diseases, which can be stamped out by challenging and changing behavioural norms. He showed me a graph of Chicago shootings over several years – a rollercoaster of peaks and troughs. “It’s the same curve for almost every city,” he explains. “It’s an epidemic curve.” The most significant step in understanding knife crime – and thus in solving it – is to grasp that it is a public health matter. Those who understand it as a criminal issue will seek solutions in longer sentences, stiffer laws, stop-and-search and greater powers for police. That has long been the central response of the state, in London and beyond, and it chimes with the demands of the bereaved and the tabloid and local press. But it is difficult to find criminologists who agree with that approach. Most insist that tackling poverty and social exclusion would have a far greater impact than tougher policing or sentencing. A public health approach does not deny that policing has a role, but it regards law enforcement as just one part of a broader, more holistic programme of intervention. “The public health approach,” said Emer Sutherland at King’s College Hospital, “means trying to make it not just about what happened with the stabbing on that day, but looking at the life story of the person in front of you, and the whole of the community in which that one day happened. It means looking at all the ways you can modify things in that life story, and that community, to make that day less likely to come.” If that sounds like the kind of indulgent liberal tosh that just undermines the law, bear in mind that it is the strategy favoured by the head of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick. “We are all committed to the notion that prevention is better than enforcement, which is, after all, the public health approach,” she said in January. Dick said most offenders “are people who have suffered some kind of adverse experience of a significant sort when they are young, and/or have limited or problematic family lives and parenting – all things that can lead to other negative outcomes, not just serious violence.” A few months later, Dick visited Scotland, the one part of Britain that has embraced the public health model. In Glasgow, where the knife-crime problem had been most acute, the police identified the core group of people who were most likely to offend, and a newly created Violence Reduction Unit – which has an arms-length relationship with the police – invited the likeliest offenders to a meeting to discuss the problem. Once there, they were told that if they continued offending, the police would come down on them hard – but were also offered help with housing, employment, relocation and training, and given a number to call if they wanted further assistance. Of the 39 fatal stabbings of children and teenagers last year, none were in Scotland. This is no panacea: Glasgow still has a murder rate about twice as high as London. But the trend is moving dramatically in the right direction. Roughly a decade ago, the UN ranked Scotland as the most violent country in the developed world. Between April 2006 and April 2011, 40 children and teenagers were killed in knife deaths in Scotland; between 2011 and 2016, that figure fell to just eight. Glasgow witnessed the steepest decline – from 15 young people in the five years before 2011, to zero in the five years afterwards. Policing did play a role. There was a lot of stop-and-search in the early days of the shift towards a public health approach, and the average sentence for carrying a knife trebled in 10 years. But there was always an understanding that this would never be enough. “You can arrest as many people as you like,” explains Christine Goodall, a surgeon who, along with two colleagues, founded Medics Against Violence in 2008, a campaign group that works with health professionals, law enforcement, social services and other bodies to thwart violent behaviour. “You can search as many people as you like. You can throw away the key if you want to. It just won’t solve the problem.” Scotland is its own place, and not all of this is replicable elsewhere. But it is a demonstration of what can be achieved if the political will is there. One of the big differences between Scotland and London is political: in Scotland, the public-health approach is funded by and answerable to a single democratic authority at Holyrood. In London, there are 32 boroughs, and most of the innovative work on youth violence and young people is being done by multiple different charities; the capital does not have the joined-up thinking it needs. Another dramatic difference is that the Scottish police do not have a history of mistrust from the very section of society that a public-health approach needs to engage with. “In London, institutional racism creates a barrier,” argues Susan McVie, professor of quantitative criminology at the University of Edinburgh. “If people see something going wrong, they are less likely to tell the police, because they don’t trust them.” There is a concerted effort for the rest of the country to learn from Scotland. Last year, the MP Sarah Jones set up the all-party parliamentary group on knife crime, fulfilling a promise she made while campaigning in Croydon, where the issue kept coming up. Jones believes Britain needs a long-term strategy on a par with the last Labour government’s efforts to tackle teenage pregnancy, the rate of which halved in 20 years and continues to fall quickly, even though it is one of the highest in Europe. The teen pregnancy strategy “was coordinated from the centre,” Jones explained. “It was multi-agency. It was partly about education and making sure they had access to information, it was partly about their life choices, it was partly about funding. It was a broad strategy and I think that’s what we need for knife crime now,” she said. “The thing that’s both positive and depressing is that a lot of these things we know the answers to. We can fix this. We can stop children dying if we actually have the will.” * * * Not only do the politicians not have the will – they have not had the facts. For all the ink spilt and speeches delivered about young people and knife crime, nobody could say for sure what they were talking about, because national data on the number of children and teens killed by knives had never been publicly available. Indeed, it is not hard to discern a relationship between the lack of will and the lack of facts – most political responses, from longer sentences to tougher new laws, are prompted by newspaper headlines rather than empirical data. While it has been impressive to see the work of so many charities, civic organisations and some parliamentarians on this issue over the year, it has also been worrying to see how little strategic thinking the government has done. In April, with stabbings in London all over the news, the then home secretary, Amber Rudd, vowed to do “whatever it takes” to make Britain’s streets safe. Her successor, Sajid Javid, has more recently said he will make tackling knife crime a priority. There is little evidence he has any idea what this would mean. Indeed, it often seemed the government didn’t know any more than our team did – and in fact, since the Guardian obtained the knife crime figures, they knew less. After almost a year of making Freedom of Information requests, being shunted between the Home Office, the Office for National Statistics and 45 regional police forces, we managed to obtain figures for the last 40 years. The numbers had always been kept – but for reasons that remain unclear, they were not publicly available until we obtained them. They revealed a complex picture that belied most of the prevalent notions of who is at risk. From 2005-2015, on average, one in five people stabbed to death were female, and one in 10 were under 14. These, too, are victims of knife crime, though they are rarely included in discussions of the issue. With 39 young people stabbed to death in 2017, we now know that it was the worst year for almost a decade, and the third-worst since 1977, which is why it’s worrying that this year could be worse still. The trend is more alarming than the raw numbers. When we talk about “knife crime”, one of the major obstacles to understanding the problem has been the disparity between London and the rest of the country. The capital comprises roughly one in eight of the UK population, but is home to around half of young people killed by knives. In the rest of the country, victims are of varying races; in London, they are overwhelmingly black. But not all of London is equally dangerous. Very few stabbings take place in central London, with most occurring in the outer ring – travel zones three and beyond – as if London seemed intent on replicating the Paris banlieues. Two of the deaths last year, which took place seven months apart, happened in the same London street. The pain is concentrated in certain areas. And while class is an important factor everywhere, race is undeniably a key factor in London. There is a large population of working-class white and Asian youth in London, and they are not dying in stabbings at anything like the rate of their black peers. In London, there is something particularly deadly about being a young black man. Still, if we are talking about “knife crime in Britain”, it cannot be reduced to race and culture in the capital – but very often has been. Half of the children killed by knives in Britain are not in London; of those, only around 15% have been black in the last decade. Indeed, taken as a whole, two-thirds of the young people killed by knives in Britain, including London, are not black. Our obsessive focus on one group of people in one place has hindered our capacity to engage with the far broader range of people in the far broader range of places that are actually being affected. Meanwhile, the punitive responses proposed offer little hope of making things better, and the funding necessary for a public-health approach has not been forthcoming. * * * It is difficult to adopt a public health approach when your stated agenda is to shrink the public sector. For all the talk of personal responsibility, when it comes to knife crime, there is a general understanding that societies have a collective responsibility for children and young people. But without adequate funding, our capacity to meet those responsibilities is severely diminished. One Friday evening in the Black Country, I drove around with Bryan Kellsey, looking for a youth club that was open. The first place we went to, in Wolverhampton, had closed down. The next had been vandalised. “Would have been a time, not that long ago, we’d have passed three or four by now,” said Kellsey, who has been a youth worker in this area for decades, as we turn into Dudley’s Wren’s Nest estate, where the community centre was shut suddenly in October, and finally up a dark lane to a facility just off Meadow Road. In front is a basketball court strewn with litter and leaves; out the back, an adventure playground had long since closed. Inside, the small hall hosts table tennis, pool, table football and an electronic game called Dance Dance Revolution. As dusk gave way to darkness, the smaller children at the kids’ club run by Dudley Community Church left with their parents, and youth workers got ready for the teenagers who were due to arrive for a council-funded session. Two years ago, Dudley lost around 30 youth workers through voluntary redundancy and redeployment; this year there will be more cuts, with staff being asked to reapply for fewer posts. I asked one of the youth workers where the kids will go instead. “They’ll drink in the parks, hang around and just get in trouble,” she said. Youth services have not disappeared from Wolverhampton altogether. As the council shut down smaller clubs around the city, some on working-class estates on the outskirts, it went into partnership with local businesses and foundations to set up the Way Youth Zone. The council also gave small grants to voluntary organisations to work with harder-to-reach groups. The Youth Zone stands in the centre of Wolves – a huge, impressive structure offering everything from boxing to indoor rock climbing, a junior gym, music, film, arts, fashion, mentoring and training. Phil Marsh, openings manager for OnSide Youth Zones, described it as a “world-class, 21st-century youth club” – one of a chain of similar centres across the UK. Everybody agrees it is an excellent facility. But not everyone believes it fulfils the needs of the area. Danny Millard, a youth worker and Labour councillor in nearby Sandwell, said that, by concentrating youth provision in the centre of Wolverhampton, the council is failing to get to those estates most affected by poverty, where young people are most vulnerable to antisocial and violent behaviour. “A lot of the kids you really need to be talking to aren’t going to get on a bus and go into town. You have to go to them and reach them where they are,” he said. Of the 20 authorities that have faced the steepest cuts in youth work in the last few years, two have been in the West Midlands. Between 2014 -2017, Walsall saw a 67% cut in funding for youth services. In Wolverhampton, it was 86%. Here, the council shut 15 youth centres and 31 “delivery points”, and went from a 100 full-time and part-time workers to just eight full-timers. “They gutted it, basically,” said Millard. This steep fall in funding has coincided with a precipitous rise in knife crime. In the West Midlands, it has almost doubled in the last five years. More than 1,600 people were cautioned or sentenced for carrying knives and offensive weapons in the West Midlands and Staffordshire last year – the highest rate for eight years. Most of them were young men between 15 and 19 who claimed they were carrying weapons for protection. One of the two young people killed in West Midlands last year died in Walsall. Already this year, several young people have been stabbed to death in the area, including an eight-year-old girl in Brownhills, near Walsall, and an 11-year-old girl and 15-year-old boy in Wolverhampton. In April, after a spate of knife and gun deaths, the home secretary insisted that drawing a link between austerity and the increase in crime was “too simplistic”. “I want to hear solutions instead of constant shouts of: ‘Cuts, cuts, cuts!’” she said. But it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, while there are many reasons for knife crime that have nothing to do with funding, some of the solutions reside in reversing those cuts. Since 2010, resources have been channelled away from young people in all sorts of ways. In 2011, the government scrapped the £30-a-week education maintenance allowance for low-income students in school or college. Between 2010-2014, funding for education for 16- to 19-year-olds fell by 14% in real terms, and more recently there have been severe cuts to urban schools. NHS cuts have also made child and adolescent mental health services far more difficult to access. Children and teenagers have less support financially, socially and emotionally, giving them fewer places to go, fewer things to do and less professional adult supervision outside of school and home. And having created the conditions for more turmoil, the government has then slashed the capacity to deal with the fallout by making swingeing cuts to policing, too. All of this takes a toll. Quamari Serunkuma-Barnes was stabbed in January outside his school in Willesden, north-west London – the same school that Saif Abdul Majid, who was killed nine months later, had been to. After interviewing Quamari’s parents, I spoke to the mother of the boy who killed him, who tearfully detailed her efforts to steer her son away from violent crime. On 23 March 2015, she sent an email to her MP with the heading “PLEASE HELP ME SAVE MY SON!!!” She described how the behaviour of her then 13-year-old was “[deteriorating] rapidly, involving himself with the wrong crowd”, and her fears for the impact this could have on his siblings. She detailed how she had enrolled herself in parenting classes, consulted with social workers and psychologists, sought referrals for mental health assessments, requested to move him from his school and asked for help to move her family out of London, but felt she was getting nowhere. At the bottom of many of the responses from Brent council came the impersonal sign off: “Brent Council needs to save £54m over the next two years. Find out more about our budget consultation events and have your say before February 4th, 2015.” * * * At King’s College Hospital in London, the busiest day for young knife victims is Saturday; but on an average day, as many kids come in wounded between 4pm and 6pm as between 8pm and 10pm. “You get a big peak after school,” explained Emer Sutherland. “And then a big peak about 9.30pm before they go home. For the older kids, it could be any time day or night. We get kids getting stabbed on the way to school.” Sutherland reviews the notes of every young person admitted each week. “I know some of these names,” she said. “I know their stories. So I know that quite often we’ve seen them before and we’re getting them back.” Without the numbers, we can’t possibly know the scale of the problem. But it’s only through the stories behind those numbers that we can begin to navigate how those numbers might be reduced. Vernon, 19, came in to King’s around 8pm. He had been waiting for friend on a south London estate when he sensed a man looking at him across the road. He started cycling away when the man chased him in a car, knocked him down and then started hacking at him with a machete. He sliced away at Vernon’s body, almost severing a finger before leaving him lying in the road with his face slashed. A woman heard the screaming and brought towels for the blood and called an ambulance. “I was just thinking, I’m about to die,” said Vernon when I spoke to him in January. “I was asking in the ambulance, ‘Am I going to die, am I going to die?’ And they kept saying: ‘No, you’re not going to die.’” The next morning, Alex, a senior youth worker from Redthread, scanned the referrals from the night before, read the hospital notes and then went up to find Vernon with casts on his hands and legs, and a huge bandage on his face. They bonded over football, with Alex ribbing Vernon over his support for Arsenal and Vernon giving as good as he got. Alex, who had seen several cuts like this in the past, mentioned bio oil, which can help with scar tissue, and offered to get some for Vernon if he came and saw him when he was discharged. Vernon was in for a few days – plenty of time to reflect on what he had been through and why. “I was just looking at the air and crying really, thinking, ‘Why did I go out today?’” he said. “My face is never going to be the same again. My life is pretty much done now.” He had been about to go back to university in Northampton, where he had just finished his first year of business studies. “I always thought a stabbing could happen to me,” he said. “Not because of anything I did. But because some of the people I associated with used to hang around with the kind of people that might happen to. But I never thought it would actually happen, because I didn’t know them or hang around with them. I would just hear stories about the kind of stuff they would do.” The second day, Alex opened up a sensitive line of questioning. “We didn’t chat about it yesterday, but that’s a lot of shit that you’ve been through,” he said to Vernon. “If it was me, I’d be thinking: Who’s done this? Why have they done this? They’re not going to get away with this. Justice needs to happen.” Vernon nodded. “I’m pissed off. I want to find out who did it. This shouldn’t have happened to me. I’m going to find out who did it.” This, said Alex, was the teachable moment. Vernon was in a place to think about safety and retaliation in a safe setting. “There’s imprints on your body and imprints on your mind,” Alex explained. “It’s actually easier for your body to recover … but your mind can quickly go back to remembering what happened. And can quickly go back to the anger and emotions as well.” Alex told him that thoughts of retaliation and revenge are normal, but asked if Vernon thought he’d feel good about himself if he went through with it. “But where’s the justice?” asked Vernon. “What happens from here? This youth is going to get away with it and I’m left with this scar.” “I can’t answer some of these questions,” said Alex. “You feel that rage, and that’s normal. But you’re in a position now to decide what happens. So you could be thinking, ‘Since my time in hospital I’ve started running three times a week and got my life together.’” Alex had planted a seed. It took a while to reach full bloom. “When I came out of hospital, my friends were egging me on for vengeance,” says Vernon. “They were saying: ‘We need to do something about this’. And I thought we needed to as well. Over time, I just sat down and realised, why would I risk my freedom and my life for something that didn’t actually kill me and is healing anyway? “It was a difficult conclusion to come to, pride-wise. It hurt. But I talked myself out of it. Because it’s not worth it. My friends didn’t really say much. But I could see there was a disappointment. I’d let the person get away with it.” Alex kept visiting, bringing questionnaires that Vernon liked to do, gauging his emotional wellbeing. Meanwhile, Vernon resolved to make some changes. He decided to drop the course he was doing at university, which he wasn’t enjoying, and study closer to home. Alex scoured job ads, sending him notices of vacancies for football-coaching courses and a civil-service apprenticeship, based on the kinds of things Vernon had said interested him. He also got a temporary job and started mixing up his friendship circle. “I feel like I’ve got my own mind now. I’ve made decisions to better my life. It has elevated me to a different level. We’re not at the same level that we used to be. They were dragging me down a bad route.” Additional reporting by Caelainn Barr and Damien Gayle.

In a tweet, Juncker said the “informal working meeting” was designed to “work with a group of heads of state or government of member states interested in finding European solutions” before next week’s European council summit. According to reports in German media, representatives of the governments of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria and Bulgaria are expected attend the emergency gathering. The meeting comes as debates around migration curbs and asylum rules are driving a wedge between the parties in Germany’s coalition government. Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany stood by its obligation to protect people fleeing war and terrorism and its commitment to keeping Europe together. “However you cut it, migration is a European challenge perhaps our greatest challenge at the moment,” she said, after the UN refugee agency released figures showing that 68.5m people were forced to flee their homes in 2017, as a result of war, persecution or other violence. The German chancellor is under pressure from her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who is threatening to turn away at the German border from 1 July any asylum seekers already registered in other EU countries, unless Merkel can find a multilateral solution to the dispute with Germany’s EU partners. “We are expecting German proposals for the solution of the refugee problem for us to comment on,” a senior Greek government official was quoted as saying in German newspaper Bild. “They will be presented at a gathering of the countries affected this weekend.” The political row in Berlin centres on how to treat people who have already registered an asylum claim in one country, but moved to Germany. This “secondary movements” issue affects Germany more than any other EU state, after 1.1m asylum seekers arrived in 2015. In a bid to tackle the issue, EU leaders will call for better implementation of existing rules to speed up returns to the EU country of arrival. The EU should “take all necessary internal legislative and administrative measures to counter such movements and to closely cooperate amongst each other to this end,” according to the draft conclusions of a summit declaration to be signed off by all EU leaders next week. Overnight, politicians of Seehofer’s Bavarian Christian Social Union, sister party to Merkel’s CDU, criticised Monday’s Franco-German pledge to create a joint eurozone budget. Markus Söder, Bavaria’s state premier, accused Merkel of trying to gain bilateral deals with EU member states in exchange for compromising Germany’s stance on financial burden-sharing in the eurozone. Merkel’s spokesperson, Steffen Seibert, on Wednesday rejected the accusation that the chancellor was using concessions on the eurozone budget to “buy” a solution to the migration conflict. Speaking at a press conference with Austria’s prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, on Wednesday afternoon, Söder called for a “turning point in our migration policy” and endorsed Kurz’s proposal for the creation of military “secure zones” for refugees in north Africa. Kurz said: “In Europe we face a choice. Either we return to internal borders, or we secure our external borders.” In another sign of the dominance of migration politics, Hungary’s parliament on Wednesday passed laws to criminalise any individual or group offering to help asylum claimants. The law would mean that anyone helping asylum seekers could face a year in prison. Known officially as the ‘Stop Soros’ law, it seeks to highlight the role of the billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who has become a target of Hungarian government anger, because he funds organisations to promote democracy and human rights in the country. The key amendment was passed by 159 to 5 votes, as the ruling Fidesz party picked up the support of the far-right Jobbik. Viktor Orbán, who was re-elected as prime minister in April after an anti-immigrant campaign, has said Soros encourages migration to Hungary. Hitting back, Soros has accused Orbán of waging an “unrelenting propaganda campaign” against him. Hungary has long taken an uncompromising stance on migration and has rejected EU proposals for taking quotas of refugees, to ease the burden on frontline states, Greece and Italy. Following this weekend’s summit, all 28 EU leaders will discuss migration at an EU summit on Thursday. A proposal to study the creation of refugee processing centres in North Africa is likely to win the backing of EU leaders, although the plan faces numerous political and legal obstacles. At the weekend summit EU leaders will pledge to “significantly intensify” work with the main transit countries for migrants, including Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia, according to draft conclusions. These countries could get more financial aid to protect their land borders and combat people smugglers. While this proposal is likely to be uncontroversial with the rest of the EU, another part will raise tensions with central European leaders, who are not expected at the weekend summit. According to the draft communique, Germany, France, Italy and other countries at the weekend summit, will make clear they are not backing down from a refugee “burden-sharing” scheme. The leaders will call for “swift completion” of a new EU asylum law, stalled for two years over the idea of compulsory refugee quotas, while reiterating the need for “an effective solidarity mechanism” - a shorthand for all member states to help deal with refugees in Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/20/hunt-and-may-apologise-for-gosport-hospital-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T12:39:24Z","webTitle":"Hunt and May apologise for Gosport hospital deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/hunt-and-may-apologise-for-gosport-hospital-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/20/hunt-and-may-apologise-for-gosport-hospital-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Hunt and May apologise for Gosport hospital deaths","bodyText":"The UK government has apologised to relatives of hospital patients who died as a result of being given life-shortening opioid drugs without medical justification and said criminal charges could follow. An independent inquiry, published on Wednesday, found that 456 patients died and possibly 200 more had their lives shortened because of the routine practice at Gosport War Memorial hospital. In a statement after prime minister’s questions, the health and social care secretary, Jeremy Hunt, described the inquiry’s findings as deeply troubling and said there had been “a catalogue of failures” by the local NHS, the police, the coroner, and the Department of Health (now the Department of Health and Social Care). He said: “Nothing I say today will lessen the anguish and pain of families who have campaigned for 20 years after the loss of a loved one, but I can at least on behalf of the government and NHS apologise for what happened and what they have been through. “Had the establishment listened when junior NHS staff spoke out, had the establishment listened when ordinary families raised concerns, instead of treating them as troublemakers, many of those deaths would not have happened.” He said the police working with the Crown Prosecution Service and clinicians would consider whether criminal charges should be brought. Hunt suggested that Hampshire constabulary should consider whether the investigation should be conducted by another force given its “vested interest”. Earlier, in response to a question at PMQs, Theresa May offered her own apology for the length of time bereaved relatives have had to wait. She said: “The events at Gosport Memorial hospital were tragic, they are deeply troubling and they led to unimaginable heartache to the families concerned … I am sorry that it took so long for the families to get answers from the NHS.” The inquiry, led by the former bishop of Liverpool James Jones, concluded that Dr Jane Barton, the GP who ran wards at Gosport War Memorial hospital, routinely overprescribed drugs for her patients in the 1990s. Consultants were aware of her actions but did not intervene. The panel said concerns were raised as early as 1988, and three years later when a staff meeting was held supposedly for nurses to address the issue it “had the effect of silencing the nurses’ concerns”. Caroline Dinenage, the MP for Gosport, told the BBC: “It is utterly chilling. It’s almost heartbreaking. I don’t think any of us realised the scale of this. There are potentially over 450 lives shortened as a result of this. The report talks about a culture of shortening lives, it talks about a disregard for human life. It talks about families who thought their loved ones were there for respite and rehabilitation only to find that they were on a terminal care pathway. It is just almost unimaginable, this report and what it says. “The government needs to look at this as a matter of extreme urgency. This is too big to ignore. This is over 450 lives shortened as a result of care.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/20/coalition-inches-towards-success-for-its-143bn-tax-package","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T06:23:10Z","webTitle":"Coalition inches towards success for its $143bn tax package","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/20/coalition-inches-towards-success-for-its-143bn-tax-package","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/20/coalition-inches-towards-success-for-its-143bn-tax-package","fields":{"headline":"Coalition inches towards success for its $143bn tax package","bodyText":"The Turnbull government is now 24 hours away from securing its $143bn personal income tax cut package after the Senate passed an amended version of the package on Wednesday night. The victory looms despite the Senate successfully stripping out the tax relief for higher income earners due to start in 2024. The legislation will return to the House of Representatives on Thursday morning, where the Senate’s amendments will be rejected, and it will return to the Senate and be passed with a minimum of debate. It will be passed in its original form because the Centre Alliance bloc of two senators will not insist on amendments they secured on Wednesday. The procedural skirmishes on Wednesday flushed out Pauline Hanson, who lined up with the government to support the stage three tax cuts for higher income earners, which was the final piece of the puzzle for the Turnbull government. During chamber debate, Labor, the Greens, the South Australian independent Tim Storer and the two Centre Alliance senators, Stirling Griff and Rex Patrick, successfully amended the government’s package to knock out stage three, which involves flattening the tax scales so workers earning between $40,000 and $200,000 pay the same rate. Labor, the Greens and Storer also wanted to knock out stage two of the package, but they lacked the numbers because the two Centre Alliance senators intended to vote with the government. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Stage two, which begins in 2022, lifts the top threshold for the 19% rate from $37,000 to $41,000 and lifts the top threshold for the 32.5% tax rate from $90,000 to $120,000. Once it had locked in a deal on Wednesday, the government moved to guillotine Senate debate to ensure the bill could emerge expeditiously from the chamber and go to the House. The government insisted it would not split the package, and demanded it be passed as a whole. The Centre Alliance bloc signalled an unwillingness to sink the entire package in the event it came to a take-it-or-leave-it vote. Support of the Hanson bloc adds to pre-existing support from Derryn Hinch, Cory Bernardi, David Leyonhjelm and Fraser Anning. The major parties are using the political fight over the tax package as part of their byelection campaigns, and as the spine of their pre-election messaging on economic policy. Reflecting the high political stakes, question time in the House has been surly over the past 48 hours, with Malcolm Turnbull seeking to categorise Labor as the enemy of aspiration and Labor seeking to portray the prime minister as arrogant and out of touch with the concerns of ordinary workers. Labor has rejected all but stage one of the tax package, and will take its alternative plan to voters at the election. The plan involves a more generous rebate for low- and middle-income earners earning up to $90,000, and a temporary higher tax rate on the highest income earners. Labor said it would repeal the stage two and three tax cuts if it won the next federal election, a stance reminiscent of the GST “rollback” campaign in the early 2000s against the Howard government. On Wednesday Turnbull railed against the “aspiration-denying smugness of the Labor party” and declared the party was fading because it was “not able to connect to aspirational Australians”. At one point Labor asked him what the median personal income was in Australia, catching Turnbull flat-footed. He had to take the question on notice. He was also asked what the government had offered Hanson in return for a positive vote on the tax package. Turnbull declined to answer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/20/senate-to-probe-great-barrier-reef-grant-of-444m-to-small-charity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T04:12:58Z","webTitle":"Senate to probe Great Barrier Reef grant of $444m to small charity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/20/senate-to-probe-great-barrier-reef-grant-of-444m-to-small-charity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/20/senate-to-probe-great-barrier-reef-grant-of-444m-to-small-charity","fields":{"headline":"Senate to probe Great Barrier Reef grant of $444m to small charity","bodyText":"A parliamentary inquiry will examine how a $444m grant for work on the Great Barrier Reef was awarded to a small not-for-profit charity, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, with no competitive tender process. Labor, Greens and crossbench senators have backed the inquiry, which was moved by a Greens senator, Peter Whish-Wilson. And Labor’s environment spokesman, Tony Burke, has asked why there was no correspondence between the Great Barrier Reef marine park authority and the office of environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, in the weeks leading up to the grant being announced in April. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon A request by Labor under freedom of information laws for communications relating to the foundation between the authority and the minister’s office during the month of April produced no documents, a letter from the authority said. “It beggars belief that a record-breaking donation to a private foundation would take place without the minister seeking any advice from the Great Barrier Reef marine park authority which is charged under Australian law as being the principle adviser on matters about the Great Barrier Reef,” Burke said on Wednesday. “It is still not clear that the Great Barrier Reef Foundation is even able to cope with a grant of this size. Their previous revenue for 2015 and 2016 was $9.6m and $8m respectively. The foundation has six full-time and five part-time members.” The Senate inquiry will examine the foundation’s capacity to deliver components of the reef 2050 plan, whether other organisations and agencies would have been better placed to manage such work, the governance of the foundation and the process by which the grant was awarded. Public hearings are likely to take place in Canberra and Queensland and the Senate committee will report in July. Whish-Wilson said the inquiry was a case study in how the government was outsourcing its core environmental obligations to the private sector. “In this case we have seen them outsource the control of the purse strings for reef science and repair, and in other cases we have seen the government seek funds from the private sector to save endangered species or help manage its own national parks,” he said. “There can’t be any more important task for the Australian government than being steward of the Great Barrier Reef, one of the true natural wonders of the world, and with this Senate inquiry we will get to the bottom of what it means to have had this funding redirected away from the existing public agencies.” The foundation has come under scrutiny since the government announced before the federal budget in May that it would receive the record grant. It has said it did not apply for the funding and was contacted by the Australian government before the initial announcement in Cairns on 29 April. “The foundation is in the unique position of working across the entire science community and all levels of government, with leading scientists from different institutions, and the Great Barrier Reef marine park authority – the reef managers,” a spokeswoman said previously."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/21/no-way-to-die-peak-medical-bodies-call-for-dying-refugee-to-come-to-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T18:00:48Z","webTitle":"‘No way to die’: peak medical bodies call for dying refugee to come to Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/no-way-to-die-peak-medical-bodies-call-for-dying-refugee-to-come-to-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/no-way-to-die-peak-medical-bodies-call-for-dying-refugee-to-come-to-australia","fields":{"headline":"‘No way to die’: peak medical bodies call for dying refugee to come to Australia","bodyText":"A dying Afghan refugee currently held in offshore processing on Nauru must be brought to Australia for palliative care, doctors groups have told the government. The Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians have both told the government 63-year-old Ali*, who has lung cancer, should be moved to Australia to “be allowed dignity and respect at the end of his life”. The medical groups’ statements follow an open letter signed by more than 2,000 doctors calling for Ali’s transfer, and a public petition to the prime minister that has garnered more than 22,000 signatures. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Last month, Guardian Australia revealed the details of 63-year-old Ali, an Afghan Hazara man suffering advanced lung cancer. Sources on Nauru and doctors familiar with his case say the palliative care he is receiving inside the Australian-run regional processing centre is “totally inadequate”. His prognosis is “dire” and he has only weeks or months to live. The Australian Border Force has told Ali he can go to Taiwan to die – an option he has rejected because he does not know anybody there, is concerned there would be no translator from his language, Hazaraghi, and that there would be no one to perform the Shia Muslim rituals and ceremonies on his body when he died. The ABF has also offered him $25,000 to return to Afghanistan, the country he fled after facing threats on his life. Ali is a member of the persecuted Hazara minority and has been formally recognised as a refugee – he faces a well-founded fear of persecution in Afghanistan and cannot be forcibly returned there. Australia is legally obliged to protect him. Ali should be immediately brought to Australia for palliative care, the AMA said. “He has advanced lung cancer. He needs significant palliative care services that he cannot receive on the island. This is not in dispute,” AMA president Dr Tony Bartone said. Moving Ali to Taiwan was neither medically nor ethically appropriate, Bartone said. “The AMA has always held that all people who are under the protection of the Australian Government have the right to receive appropriate medical care without discrimination, regardless of citizenship or visa status. “They should be treated with compassion, respect and dignity. On any score – international obligations, conventions, respect, standards of clinical and ethical care – we must not fail to provide the requisite medical care on Australia’s watch.” The AMA has consistently called for an independent statutory body of clinical experts with the power to investigate and report to parliament on the health and welfare of asylum seekers and refugees in Australia’s care. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians said people suffering terminal illnesses should not be subjected to indefinite detention at the end of their lives. “Someone who is suffering from a terminal illness and where treatment is out of the question, should not be held in detention,” RACP president, associate professor Mark Lane, said. “This man should be brought to Australia for palliative care and be allowed dignity and respect at the end of his life.” An open letter from Sydney GP Dr Sara Townend has now attracted more than 2,000 doctors’ signatures, including former heads of the AMA and doctors who have worked on Nauru. “If he goes to Taiwan, where there are no Hazara, he will die isolated and without community. This is no way to die,” the letter says. “If he remains on Nauru, he faces a potentially catastrophic death, without medical expertise to ease his pain and symptoms. This is no way to die. “His only chance of a good death is to come to Australia so that he can have both community and medical expertise. Our international reputation depends on it. Our humanity demands it.” Townend told Guardian Australia: “it hurt so much to read of this man’s situation because I work so hard for my own patients to make their deaths the best they can be. “I work with adults who are dying, and with children who are dying. Even here in Australia with excellent palliative care available, a good death is challenging to achieve. I could not bear to think of this man dying alone in a room without family or community or appropriate medical expertise. I could not believe this was a deliberate act of exclusion by my government.” A change.org petition, calling for Ali’s transfer to Australia, has now been signed by more than 22,000 people. “He has one incredibly simple request: to come to Australia and receive some relief from the pain and die with some dignity and comfort,” the petition says. On Nauru, several sources have told Guardian Australia that ABF staff have made repeated requests to Canberra for intervention in his case. High-profile or politically-sensitive medical cases are decided not by the ABF but by executive-level officials of the Department of Home Affairs: in some cases as high as the secretary of the department or the minister for home affairs. ABF recommendations from Nauru are often overruled at executive level inside the department. The decision to offer Taiwan as a medical transfer can only be made by senior department staff. IHMS, the Australian government’s contracted health provider on Nauru, has refused to answer questions about when it had become aware of Ali’s critical health needs, when it first requested he be moved, or how many transfer requests it had made. The department said it would not comment on individual cases, but that medical transfer decisions “occur on a case-by-case basis according to clinical need, in consultation with the contracted health services provider and the government of Nauru … [and] with the permission of the individual”. “Australia has provided significant funding and support over a number of years to improve health infrastructure in Nauru.” Friends on Nauru say that Ali – who had previously worked in construction while being held on Nauru – has deteriorated badly in recent weeks. He is finding it increasingly difficult to speak, has lost most of the use of his right arm, and can no longer dress himself. “He [Ali] is very angry, he is very upset as well,” a friend on the island said. “He said these people do not have a human heart.” *Ali is a patronym, his full name is withheld to protect his family."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/20/telstra-to-cut-8000-jobs-in-major-restructure","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T23:12:14Z","webTitle":"Telstra to cut 8,000 jobs in major restructure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/20/telstra-to-cut-8000-jobs-in-major-restructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/20/telstra-to-cut-8000-jobs-in-major-restructure","fields":{"headline":"Telstra to cut 8,000 jobs in major restructure","bodyText":"Telstra has announced plans to cut 8,000 jobs in a major restructure. It wants to split its infrastructure assets into a new wholly owned business unit in preparation for a potential demerger, or the entry of a strategic investor, in a post-national broadband network rollout world. The new business unit will be called Telstra InfraCo. The company says it will abolish one in four executive and middle management roles to flatten its structure. Andrew Penn, Telstra’s chief executive, says customers will start to benefit from its new plans as quickly as July when the company launches “peace of mind data” across a range of new post-paid plans, making excess data charges a thing of the past. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The stock market was informed of Telstra’s plans on Wednesday morning and its share price fell 7% in early trade. It has recovered dslightly but is still down 5.5% at $2.75. Telstra has roughly 32,000 employees so the plan could affect one quarter of its workforce. Penn said he understood the plan would affect thousands of staff but Telstra needed to remain an industry leader. About $50m will be set aside for a transition program for affected staff. “The rate and pace of change in our industry is increasingly driven by technological innovation and competition,” he said. “In this environment traditional companies that do not respond are most at risk. We have worked hard preparing Telstra for this market dynamic while ensuring we did not act precipitously. “However, we are now at a tipping point where we must act more boldly if we are to continue to be the nation’s leading telecommunications company. “In the future our workforce will be a smaller, knowledge-based one with a structure and way of working that is agile enough to deal with rapid change. “We understand the impact this will have on our employees and once we make decisions on specific changes, we are committed to talking to impacted staff first and ensuring we support them through this period.” The Communications Workers Union reacted angrily to the announcement, accusing Penn of putting short-term profits above long-term services for the community. “Telstra’s decision to slash 8,000 job will devastate thousands of Australian families and have a significant impact on Telstra’s ability to deliver for consumers,” the union’s national president, Shane Murphy, said. “Today’s jobs purge is the low-point of 20 years of privatisation, which has consistently taken the low road of cutting jobs rather than investing in vital community infrastructure. “This is a recipe for reduced services, with Telstra’s highly skilled workforce of employees and contractors replaced by casuals and piece-workers.” The union is currently bargaining for a new enterprise agreement to cover the Telstra workforce. It will meet Telstra executives on Wednesday afternoon. Scott Morrison, the treasurer,has also expressed concern at Telstra’s decision. “I’m very disappointed to learn that news,” Morrison said. “There’s only one thing I can say in response, it’s that the government has been working hard to ensure that the economy they will go back into now, to find another job, [has] more jobs ... today than there were before.” Mitch Fifield, the communications minister, says his thoughts are with Telstra’s staff and he has spoken to Penn about the company’s $50m transition program. “It’s important to recognise that our telecommunications companies operate in a highly competitive environment that is constantly evolving,” Fifield said. “It’s up to each telco business to make judgements as to the best way to meet the needs of their customers and the best way to satisfy their shareholders. Telstra have determined that this is the program that they will pursue to provide the service that their customers expect.” Telstra has named its strategy Telstra2022, because it is a three-year plan. It includes $2bn of asset sales and 8,000 job losses, and is expected to save $2.5bn annually. Telstra InfraCo will have its own chief executive, reporting to Penn. It will comprise Telstra’s fixed network infrastructure including data centres, non mobiles-related domestic fibre, copper, hybrid fibre-coaxial, international subsea cables, exchanges, poles, ducts and pipes.

Ken Davies, chief executive of Territory Families, conceded on Wednesday that his department should have done more for child’s family earlier, with a history emerging of multiple children exposed to violence, abuse and neglect. “We have taken additional children into care since that incident as a consequence of the lessons learned, 15 in fact in that region,” he told a parliamentary estimates hearing on Wednesday. It came as it emerged that Malcolm Turnbull would send two senior ministers to the town next month, exploring the possibility of a multi-government regional deal to address long-running social and economic issues. Steve Edgington, the town’s mayor, and several other Tennant Creek councillors – including a traditional owner of the Warumungu land, Ronald Plumber – met the prime minister on Monday. The meeting was announced after blistering criticism of Turnbull in the local newspaper, the NT News, accusing him of not caring about the territory or responding after the February alleged rape of a two-year-old girl in Tennant Creek, 500km north of Alice Springs. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon A 25-year-old man has been charged with the crime, and a 24-year-old – previously charged and held on remand for three months – released. Strict alcohol limitations were enacted and extra child protection staff were sent in response, and inquiries revealed rampant failings by the NT’s Territory Families department. On Monday evening Turnbull tweeted that the meeting was “constructive and positive” and said the indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, and the social services minister, Dan Tehan, would go to Tennant Creek in July. He did not address requests from traditional owners that he visit himself. Edgington told Guardian Australia the meeting discussed the “general issues” of housing, child protection and liquor restrictions, and that the Tennant Creek representatives proposed a regional deal between the NT, federal and local governments. Such a deal would see the governments consulting with residents and “working together with the non-government sector, Aboriginal organisations, and the new cultural authority group”, Edgington said, referring to a newly formed group of traditional owners to help guide services to Tennant Creek’s Indigenous community. “There’s a fair bit of collaboration in town, but we’d seen the development of a detailed plan part around social and economic development,” he said. “We’d like to get a plan together around investment in housing, and how we attract new industry and business to Tennant Creek. “The way we see it, and what we said to the prime minister was that we need to break the cycle of unemployment and poverty if we’re going to make some serious change ... We see that as an opportunity to move forward to help alleviate unemployment, lack of housing. “There’s already a lot of collaboration going on now, we think we can build on that.” Edgington said Turnbull had “a very good understanding” of the issues in Tennant Creek, which include alcoholism, violence and poverty. “He was very concerned about that two-year-old’s alleged sexual assault. He expressed his concerns,” Edgington said. “He wants to see some things change in Tennant Creek.” Edgington declined to say if he thought the NT News front page and subsequent coverage was unfair. “I’ll leave that to the NT News. He’s committed to coming to the NT,” he said.

The midfielder announced his decision on Tuesday evening after claiming his “playing time would be significantly reduced” under the club’s new manager, Unai Emery. Wilshere made 197 appearances for Arsenal, 38 of which came last season – his best total since 2013-14 – and said it was always his intention throughout the recent contractual discussions to remain an Arsenal player. “Such was my desire to stay that I had in fact recently agreed to sign a financially reduced contract in order to commit my future to the club, said Wilshere in a statement on social media. “However, following my meeting with the new manager I was made aware that, although the reduced contract offer remained, it was made clear to me that my playing time would be significantly reduced should I decide to stay. “I am sure everyone can understand that at this point in my life and career I need to be playing regular first team football and following my meeting with Mr Emery I came away feeling that it would be very difficult for me to do so at Arsenal. Given this, I feel I have no option but to pursue other opportunities in order to progress my career on the pitch.” Wilshere was left out of England’s World Cup squad by Gareth Southgate in May and failed to make the stand-by list. Everton, West Ham and Juventus have been linked in the past with signing the central midfielder but Wilshere declined to say where he sees his future next season. “I’m feeling fit, sharp and strong and will be working tirelessly to ensure I am in peak condition ahead of the new season,” he continued. “I’ll now be taking the time necessary to consider my options before deciding on the next stage of my career. I would like to place on record my respect for Mr Emery and my appreciation for his honesty and candor [sic], and I wish him, the team and the club all the very best for the future.” Wilshere became Arsenal’s youngest-ever player when he made his debut aged 16 and 256 days in a Premier League win over Blackburn Rovers in 2008 and spent 17 of his 26 years at the London club. He was named PFA Young Player of the Year in 2010-11 and also earned a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year that season. Wilshere singled out Arsène Wenger for special praise and thanked “everyone at the academy for helping me to fulfil my dream and of course the fans, who I have always shared such a special relationship with.” Arsenal also released a statement: “Everyone at Arsenal would like to wish Jack Wilshere a successful future following his decision to seek new opportunities. Since joining our Academy more than 17 years ago aged just nine Jack has been a tremendous player for the club and a much-loved member of the Arsenal family. Thank you Jack for your contribution and the fantastic memories. Good luck in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/22/nhs-internet-addiction-clinic-london-gaming-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T16:00:36Z","webTitle":"NHS to launch first internet addiction clinic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/22/nhs-internet-addiction-clinic-london-gaming-mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/22/nhs-internet-addiction-clinic-london-gaming-mental-health","fields":{"headline":"NHS to launch first internet addiction clinic","bodyText":"A London hospital is preparing to launch the first ever NHS-funded internet addiction centre for young people and adults, the Guardian can reveal. The move comes at a time of growing concern about internet and gaming dependency, with the World Health Organization (WHO) classifying gaming disorder as a mental health condition this week. The centre, run by the Central and North West London NHS foundation trust, will initially focus on gaming disorders, with a plan to expand its services to cover other internet-based addictions. It will be a place of treatment and research, offering advice to families. “Gaming disorder is finally getting the attention it deserves. The distress and harm it can cause is extreme and I feel a moral duty on behalf of the NHS to provide the evidence based treatment these young people and their families need,” said psychiatrist Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the clinic’s founder. “We are unlikely to witness an epidemic of young players with an addiction to gaming but for the ones who do struggle, the Centre for Internet Disorders will be a life-changer.” The WHO’s decision has been praised by some while others argue that the move is premature. At present there are some private hospitals in the UK where gaming disorder is being treated but none offer free treatment. Funding has so far been secured for a weekly therapy group for gaming addicts, according to Bowden-Jones. Subject to clearing some final hurdles, the centre will be financed by the NHS, research grants and philanthropic sources. “This is the first step, but the Centre for Internet Disorders will deal with other internet compulsions, if and when needed, when funding is available. If we end up with 20 people or 30 wanting to be treated for porn addiction, for example ... if we have got the funding for that then we could provide help,” she said. Bowden-Jones said that they were initially focusing on gaming because they were keen to protect young people from dropping out of school. Gaming disorder is defined by the WHO as a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour so severe that it takes “precedence over other life interests”. Symptoms include impaired control over gaming and continuation or escalation of gaming despite negative consequences. Some countries had already identified it as a major public health issue, and addiction experts, charities and parents are becoming increasingly concerned about the amount of time children are spending playing online games. “Other countries have free services, for example there are some in Asia. We are really behind. I am not sure how it took us so long. Maybe it’s because we had no champion and I will identify as that champion. You just need one person in the right place at the right time,” Bowden-Jones said. She said there was no consistency in the use of screening tools to determine the scale of internet or gaming addiction. The WHO will work on producing a global tool that everyone can use. Bowden-Jones called for prevalence surveys every one or two years. Bowden-Jones said that while she was aiming to get NHS funding for the centre, she also recognised the limitations and restricted budgets, saying she also hoped for philanthropic donations, research collaborations and to work alongside charities. “I am also realistic and as someone who is trained in psychiatry and has dealt with frontline psychosis cases I know other things need to be addressed as well,” she said. Jeff van Reenen, addiction treatment programme manager at the Priory’s hospital in Chelmsford, said an internet addiction clinic would be incredible and was long overdue. “Internet, social media and gaming addictive or dysfunctional behaviour has been rife for a long time and completely unaddressed other than by people like us,” he said. But other experts were more sceptical. Anthony Bean, a licensed psychologist and executive director of a nonprofit mental health clinic in Fort Worth, Texas, is among those who oppose the WHO’s decision to include gaming disorder in its International Classification of Diseases. “I don’t think a centre for gaming or internet addiction is a good idea ... the worry is that it means you are only paying attention to what is going on in front of you rather than around you, which in this case would be the concept of a gaming disorder possibly suggesting that there could be no other reason why a person is seeking mental health treatment. A pigeonhole tactic could lead to misdiagnosis,” he said. Eytan Alexander, a recovering addict and founder of UK Addiction Treatment Centres (Ukat), which runs seven facilities in England, welcomed the news of a treatment centre but noted a difference between people playing as hobby and being addicted. “The fact the NHS is preparing to open a treatment facility is welcoming news. It’s a step in the right direction, but I do believe the NHS should not pigeonhole its limited budget on one particular addiction following lots of media hype,” he said. He said the budget would be better spent on treating addiction generally rather than gaming dependency specifically and that there should be attempts to raise awareness about gaming responsibly. Data from Ukat centres show the number of people asking for help with gaming addiction has increased from four in 2014 to 16 in 2017. But Alexander said this data was limited because people could be referred for other addiction problems, with gaming later turning out to be the problem. Adam Cox, a clinical hypnotherapist specialising in addiction, said internet addiction was a growing problem. “People who work for social media companies, porn sites, or gaming developers, their goal is to monetise the content they are creating. They are using every trick in the book to get people to spend more time online,” he said. People now spend money in games on things such as better guns or additional lives, said Cox. Loot boxes, an in-game purchase consisting of a virtual container that awards players with items and modifications based on chance, have attracted controversy and comparisons to gambling in recent months. “The freemium model where the game is free but then you pay for extras, is putting the emphasis on game developers to make them incredibly addictive and meet psychological needs such as significance and connection, to incentivise players to spend money and time on these games,” said Cox. He added that people can invest hours competing against other players. “If they need to leave the screen for even a few moments it could undo all the effort they have invested up to that point. This is why we’re seeing people urinate into bottles or even their beds: they simply can’t leave the game once it’s started.” Experts said parents should not become alarmed, however, saying only a minority of children would become affected in this way. “It’s those who naturally have an addictive personality or are vulnerable [who will be most affected],” Cox said. He added: “There are benefits to using these games in moderation, for example in helping children to learn hand-eye coordination. But if playing them is the first thing kids do when they wake up and they do that doing instead of other things then it’s a problem.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/21/trump-immigration-rules-vulnerable-children","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Why Trump thinks domestic violence victims don't deserve asylum | Jill Filipovic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/21/trump-immigration-rules-vulnerable-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/21/trump-immigration-rules-vulnerable-children","fields":{"headline":"Why Trump thinks domestic violence victims don't deserve asylum","bodyText":"If there is one theme to the Trump administration’s immigration rules, largely crafted by Jeff Sessions and the White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, it is this: target the most vulnerable. We saw that at play in the egregious policy, reversed on Wednesday after a public outcry, of separating children from their parents at the border, and warehousing them in cages where they cry for their parents. And we see it in a less-remarked-upon policy shift, too: Sessions’s directive to refuse grants of asylum to women fleeing domestic violence. To hear Trump tell it, these increasingly authoritarian immigration rules are to protect Americans from the “bad hombres” coming across the border. And transnational gangs like MS-13 are a real threat and do real violence. It’s telling, though, that the Trump immigration policies don’t do anything to target these potentially dangerous men. Instead, they pick off the lowest-hanging fruit: women and children. What else, other than out-and-out hostility and a desire to hurt the most vulnerable, justifies Sessions’s decision to remove asylum protections from women suffering violence at the hands of their partners? Well, there’s one other thing: misogyny, and the attendant lack of understanding of how domestic violence works. In his opinion on the matter, Sessions classifies intimate partner violence as “private”, and leveled against women “for personal reasons”. That’s significant because obtaining a grant of asylum requires that the asylum seeker show they are persecuted for their race, religion, political views, national origin, or membership in a particular social group. While of course some men suffer domestic violence as well, and some women are perpetrators, overwhelmingly it is women who are abused at the hands of men – it’s not just “domestic violence”, it’s gender-based violence, perpetrated because men believe they have a right of absolute control over women, and often ignored by law enforcement because, like Sessions, police and governments all over the world considered raping and beating your wife or girlfriend a private, personal matter. Women who are unable to leave abusive relationships are a particular social group who face particular forms of mistreatment and persecution, which immigration courts have recognized, and which the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which more or less sets broad rules for the immigration court system, also formally recognized in 2014 (even before 2014, many immigration judges found domestic violence to be grounds for asylum; the BIA decision simply formalized it). Sessions used his position to change the rules. The Trump administration casts itself as a law and order government made up of people who are just enforcing the rules. That’s not true. They are creating new, crueler, tighter rules, including this one. Years ago, I was a lawyer who did a significant amount of pro bono work on asylum cases. I focused on cases that turned on questions of gender, representing clients who were transgender, lesbian, attempting to escape forced marriage, had undergone female genital mutilation, were HIV positive, and who were escaping domestic violence. I saw firsthand how broken our immigration system is – the years-long backlog of cases, the fact that immigrants aren’t entitled to attorneys and only a lucky few get reliable representation. And I saw why it’s so crucial that we provide safe harbor to those fleeing persecution. Make no mistake, women who suffer domestic violence in places where the government refuses to protect them are being persecuted. That is what asylum law requires: membership in a particular social group, and a government that is either the persecutor or unwilling or unable to protect you. Women in abusive relationships are a distinct social group. Law enforcement in many nations routinely refuses to protect them. The reason Sessions offers for removing these protections is the same one that police officers give when they treat partner violence differently than nearly all other forms of violence: it’s personal and private. That law enforcement officers used “it’s private” to shirk their responsibility to protect women is exactly why those women were entitled to asylum protections in the first place. How awful and scary that now, our own chief law enforcement agent uses the same reasoning to draw the same conclusion: that violence against women is personal, private, and none of our business. That reasoning is precisely why intimate partner violence continues to stalk women around the world, and why feminist groups routinely focus on bringing that violence out of the shadows and demanding accountability. Not every victim of a crime is entitled to asylum – most are not. But when a particular kind of crime is leveled against a particular group of people because of their membership in that group, and when a nation’s government refuses to get involved, that is what asylum is for. Sessions, because of his deep antipathy toward immigrants and his misogynistic worldview that domestic violence is a private family matter, has undercut this promise of safe harbor – and taken a law meant for protection and turned it into a cudgel of sexist cruelty.

In the near dark of Melbourne’s Princes Park, beneath a slither of moon, babies cried, dogs barked and adults stifled sobs but after a handful of quiet words from the organiser, no one spoke. There were no words left to say. This is not our first vigil or the first dreadful death. In the past, we hoped that government action would make a difference. But after at least six years of intense public attention, and increased action by governments, gender-based murders are not slowing. And so now we must find words. We must ask why we are failing to stop these murders, and what more needs to be done to halt men’s deadly violence against women and children. Let me suggest three parts to the answer, that add to the solutions already articulated in recent years. The first words many heard about Dixon’s death were painful. With her killer unknown and amid reports of a separate rape days earlier, Victoria Police asked people to be “mindful” and show “situational awareness”. As countless women pointed out, neither is enough to shield us from men’s violence. This is the first thing we can ask to change. The Victoria Police code of practice for the investigation of sexual assault should be expanded to include guidelines for speaking about gendered atrocities. In times of threat, the police speak as the state; their words reassert community standards and set the agenda for how a crime is understood. This is what guidelines could help police say: We speak first to women. Many of you are feeling justifiably frightened and angry. We want you to know that Victoria Police will do everything in our power to find this perpetrator and bring them to justice. If you feel under threat, if you need to report a crime against you, if you have information that can help us identify a perpetrator, we are here to listen to you and will back you. Be assured that Victoria Police affirms your right to life, to safety, to freedom of movement. We do not accept that men’s violence is inevitable; it is the rotten fruit of men’s supremacy. Together, we will continue to challenge the lie that men are better than women. Now we speak to men. Be mindful at this time that women may be understandably fearful of you; they cannot tell which men are violent and which are not. Show situational awareness when you are around women; do everything you can to minimise ambiguous or threatening behaviour around them, and to affirm women’s equality and right to safety. Now we speak to men who fear they could harm someone: this is a choice you should not make; ring the Men’s Referral Service, get help. If you go on to commit a crime, we will do everything possible to find you. The time when police turned a blind eye to men’s violence against women and children is over. Words like this could use the power of the police to change the conversation about who is to blame for men’s violence. We need other words as well. We finally have government action plans for family violence and, to a lesser extent, sexual assault. We must continue to take accelerated action here. But we cannot stop men’s pervasive violence if we describe only one manifestation or site; we need to name and act on all forms. For example, the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children makes no mention of sexual harassment, forced marriage, female genital mutilation and other gender-based violence. There’s no point telling men not to be violent against family members at home if they think they can act with impunity against colleagues or strangers at work or in the streets. We need to articulate other connections too. Violence against women is not a stand-alone, moment-in-time thing; its corrosive impact ripples out for decades, across communities. We need to properly fund trauma recovery and, more ambitiously, reorient society to value all women and children and to attend to harm in all its forms. A state that invests in mental health services, supports parents when they’re doing it tough, dismantles systemic racism, makes sure all children access early childhood development and pays women fairly is the sort of state that can undo the systemic devaluing of women that enables men’s violence. We need too to say things that we don’t normally mention together. We must transform our approach to accountability and so to incarceration. It is counterproductive to now tell men they can’t be violent against women in their lives and then send some of them, disproportionately poor men, Indigenous men, other men of colour and men with disabilities, to violent jails where they will be brutalised. Currently, whether it is Turnbull overseeing brutal refugee camps or Daniel Andrews justifying locking children in solitary confinement, too often our leaders act like violent fathers, punishing and cruel. Prisons as they are now reinforce the dangerous attitudes of dominance that allow men’s violence to thrive. These are some first, partial words, to add to the important existing commitments from governments. If we are to stop the next woman from being murdered, we must lift our voices up, find the words to describe the scale and depth of the changes we need, and not stop speaking out until every woman and child, everywhere, is safe.

At 17, Breayley hadn’t considered rugby league as an option for girls. She came from a union background, but was lured into league by the chance to play alongside Jillaroo Ranae Kunst in her regional hometown of Mackay. With Kunst as inspiration, Braeyley was an instant convert. “Playing alongside Ranae, I knew there was a career in league, a chance to make the Queensland and Australian sides, so I chose to pursue a footy career,” she says. “I chose to live by the motto, ‘dream, believe, achieve’. So I set myself the dream goal to make the Queensland side, believed in myself that I could do it, and was able to achieve that aim the year after.” Since then, the Australian hooker has achieved much more than making the state side. At 27, she has won a World Cup with the Jillaroos, had a Dally M nomination every year since the award was inaugurated for women in 2015, and was Queensland player of the year for the past two seasons. Now, with the rebrand of the Interstate Challenge to State of Origin, Breayley says she wants to ensure that those lining up for QLD pause to recognise how far women’s rugby league has come. “It’s a huge honour to get the same brand as the men, to play under that banner is really quite exciting for us,” she says. “It shows how much work has gone on in previous years, from past players – how many sacrifices they had to make to get the game to where it is now. “[As Queenslanders], when we come into camp we make sure we respect that, and pride ourselves on that. We always reflect on the past and instil that in the girls – that the jersey you put on, the fibres in it have all the sacrifices of past players in them.” Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Having watched men’s Origin games for years on TV, Breayley says she is thrilled that crowds and viewers will now have a chance to witness the same “Origin spirit” on display amongst the women who take the field on Friday night under lights at North Sydney Oval. “Growing up, you’d watch the men go at it on TV, see the hard hits, but until you’re actually involved in it, you don’t know exactly what the Queenslander spirit is,” she says. “It’s really hard to describe [that spirit]. I’d say it’s [embodied in] the hard Queenslander; the never give up feeling that we pride ourselves in. The Maroon jersey means we all play for each other, and our mates beside us.” Breayley will also be focused on setting the ledger straight against NSW: the Blues have won the last two Interstate Challenge games, but before 2015 (which was a draw), Queensland had won 17 in a row. Asked what enabled such dominance, Breayley credits a strong, “core group” of Queenslanders like the now-retired Karyn Murphy. “I was lucky enough to play with Karyn when we last defeated NSW – it was her last Interstate Challenge – but full credit to them, they’ve improved their pathways and strengthened their game, [and now] they’ve got a solid core,” she says. “We’re fighting back, we’re doing everything right, and the future is bright for us. Come Friday we’re hoping we can start our winning streak back up again. We have the team to do it.” Regardless of the result, Breayley says the best part of the added exposure for women’s State of Origin is that girls can now aspire to be like her in the same way that she looked up to Kunst when she first took up league: “To be here now and to have girls aspiring to be like me and looking up to me as a leader on the field, you’d think it’d be an added pressure but it’s not, it’s just an absolute honour. “Now my nieces go to school and are like ‘oh my god, my aunty plays for Australia!’ It’s cute but it’s also really exciting. Just knowing that girls back at home, when I come back they’re excited to see me and want photos... I’m so glad they have opportunities now to look forward to, and hopefully want to pursue and be in a position like we are now.” With excitement building towards Friday’s game, and also to the inaugural season of the national competition in September, Brealey is hopeful that attitudes are changing towards women’s sport. “We play sports that are very male-dominated, so to be recognised and accepted [with State of Origin and the new NRL competition] is such a huge step,” she says. “We’ll have our critics out there, and there’s going to be positives as well as negatives, but we just have to go out there, train hard, play hard, showcase a great product and show people that women can play.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/20/scott-lloyd-lta-save-british-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T09:00:36Z","webTitle":"Scott Lloyd: the man who will have to save British tennis after Andy Murray | Kevin Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/20/scott-lloyd-lta-save-british-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/20/scott-lloyd-lta-save-british-tennis","fields":{"headline":"Scott Lloyd: the man who will have to save British tennis after Andy Murray","bodyText":"Scott Lloyd is five months into the most challenging job in British sport, outside steering England into the quarter-finals at the World Cup, but he seems to be up for it.

As the nation’s best got down to business at Queen’s Club in west London this week, Lloyd added some heft to a 10-year strategy designed to keep the game afloat when Andy Murray eventually decides his hip is giving him too much gyp. “Tennis has been a constant in my life for as long as I can remember,” he said, a reference to his father, David, a stalwart of the game alongside his brother, John, and from whom Scott inherited much of his business nous. “It’s been inextricably bound up in family, friendships and, of course, my work.” So, with Murray entering his autumnal years, what next for British tennis? “It’s the second most followed sport in this country after football, with some 29 million fans, whether it’s those that just have a passing interest right the way through to the super fans for whom life just wouldn’t be complete without it.” But those numbers are, he admits, distorted by the nation’s obsession with Wimbledon, the 150th edition of which starts on 2 July, and he acknowledges the annual jamboree might struggle to sustain the interest of British fans beyond the first week. As he concedes: “The reality is that tennis faces a battle to stay relevant in a world of competing and almost limitless activities.” These are familiar sentiments. As children have become attached to computers and indoor games, more physical pursuits have been chasing a dwindling audience, from tennis to cricket and rugby. Lloyd says the LTA’s research shows competing activities have doubled in 10 years. “But, if I’m honest, a big part of the challenge, too, is that from the outside tennis is seen as inaccessible, elitist, expensive. Too many people in Britain think that tennis starts and ends with Wimbledon.” Or the local club he could have said – because it is there that the first brick wall goes up for any young enthusiasts thinking of giving tennis a go. “Even those who might want to get involved or might think about trying to play, finding somewhere to play, finding someone to play with, is just simply too difficult. Despite the LTA’s efforts over the years, this image of tennis persists and it’s an image that we need to try and change.” These are candid words. And he did not stop there. After canvassing opinion across the tennis landscape for six months before taking on the job, he said he realised, “that the tennis community is fractured”. There were “strong but very diverse opinions” about how to kickstart the sport, he said. There was also “a real lack of understanding as to who is responsible for what in this sport”. Lloyd, like his predecessors, wants to make tennis “enjoyable, accessible, welcoming and relevant to everyone”. He wants to raise its profile from the bottom up, through the 10,000 LTA-approved competitions that exist beyond the ivy-clad walls of the All England Club. “We know … there are something like 113 locations in this country [where] you can’t access an indoor tennis court on a pay-as-you-play basis within 30 minutes’ drive. If we could change that over the next 10 years, we would then know that, for 95% of the population, weather doesn’t need to be such a barrier any more. It’s very clear to me that we need to get better at joining the dots between schools, parks and clubs.” Where all this might get a bit political, as he was reminded, is in the government’s austerity crunch, which has crippled the spending power of local authorities, bodies who are more concerned, rightly, with collecting our rubbish than looking for the next Murray. “It’s challenging,” Lloyd says, “because they’re not our courts. They are the courts of the local authorities.” He speaks vaguely of trying to “find a way to identify those locations that have the best chance of sustaining a viable tennis programme in the longer term”. This is all well and good but kids passing dilapidated council courts with no net and grass shooting up between cement cracks are probably going to keep walking, towards something more attractive. The LTA is subsidising costs for parents of gifted young players, meanwhile, through the two academies it announced last week, at Loughborough and Stirling University. “I know the LTA hasn’t been consistent enough in this respect in the past,” Lloyd confesses, “and I know we need to get it right. I’m fortunate enough to have come through the county and the regional system and to have seen academies like the Slater Squad which Tim Henman and Jamie Delgado came through. I saw how those academies could create the type of environments to foster success.” It is a start. Maybe. Or, rather, a restart. The LTA has tried for years to broaden its base and its appeal. In Lloyd the game at least has an energetic leader, who played the game and is prepared to knock some heads together. He says he is in it for the long haul. So did Michael Downey, the Canadian who left after three years. It is not going to be an easy ride. But it will almost certainly be an interesting one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/20/facebook-silicon-valley-housing-crisis-families-pushed-out","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T11:00:39Z","webTitle":"'Facebook is taking everything': rising rents drive out Silicon Valley families","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/20/facebook-silicon-valley-housing-crisis-families-pushed-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/20/facebook-silicon-valley-housing-crisis-families-pushed-out","fields":{"headline":"'Facebook is taking everything': rising rents drive out Silicon Valley families","bodyText":"Sandra Zamora is quitting Facebook. Not because of Russian election interference, misuse of personal data or any of the social network’s other scandals. For the 29-year-old, it’s personal: Facebook is her neighbor, and the company’s presence, she said, is wreaking havoc on her community. Zamora is part of a group of Menlo Park tenants in four buildings facing massive rent increases from a new landlord, who is pricing out longtime residents while advertising the buildings’ proximity to Facebook’s campus. Zamora is holding out as long as she can. But she knows she will soon have to leave her home of 11 years, and she doesn’t know where she will go. “Facebook is taking everything we have … and giving us what? Nothing. Just pain in our lives,” said the pre-school teacher and restaurant worker, seated inside her dimly lit apartment, a mile from the company’s headquarters. “Facebook is just ruining the community.” The displacement of working-class and low-income Latino families in the shadow of Facebook’s behemoth campus, which is undergoing a major expansion adjacent to their homes, offers a stark illustration of California’s housing crisis and expanding income inequality. By many measures, the tech industry has in recent years exacerbated the crisis of evictions, homelessness and poverty. A group of affiliated real estate companies, including Menlo Gate and Redwood Landing Properties, purchased and began managing the 20 apartments now facing sharp rent increases – using a process that tenant activists say is cruel, but increasingly common. The firms, linked to the investor Jesshill Love, sent notices to tenants saying their rents would soon rise from $1,100 to $1,900 a month, and that they would have to leave in 60 days if they didn’t sign a lease. The anxiety took an immediate toll on Teresa Rivas, 64, who has lived in her apartment on the quiet suburban street since 1992. “I’m very stressed. I have a lot of headaches,” said the housekeeper one recent evening, noting that she often wakes up at 3am and can’t fall back asleep, her mind racing. “I’m feeling so tired, thinking about, what am I going to do?” After the notices arrived at their doors, some residents formed a tenants’ union to fight back. They quickly learned, however, that they had few legal recourses – and no rent control protections. The hikes were especially painful considering their living conditions, said the tenants, who described cracks in the walls, poor lighting, dirty carpets and infestations of roaches and rodents. Love and the associated real estate firms did not respond to numerous inquiries on Tuesday. Eisabel Coronel, 48, said that as soon as she explained the situation to her daughter, the 10-year-old became distressed about leaving: “She says, ‘My school is here. My teachers are here. My friends are here’ … It’s very sad and scary.” Ricardo Colin, Coronel’s 24-year-old son who also lives in the apartment, said he keeps searching for cheaper alternatives, but can’t find anything. The computer engineering student already does part-time janitorial work to help pay rent and said he might have to drop his studies and get a full-time job. Or they may have to leave the region, a pattern Colin has observed for years: “I’ve lost many friends because of the rents and because of Facebook.” Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, a local not-for-profit, represented the tenants and negotiated a short delay in increases, though they still have to pay the $800 hike, plus roughly $100 in new monthly utility bills. For some, the rates are insurmountable. “It is a completely unjust situation, even if what’s happening to these people may be legal,” said Daniel Saver, an attorney for the tenants. At least seven families vacated last month, according to the tenants. Their small Menlo Park neighborhood is “ground zero” for the crisis, said Karen Chappel, professor of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley: “It’s one of the very tightest housing markets in the country.” That’s due in part to the fact that local governments did not prepare for the extreme housing demand and the rapid gentrification of the suburbs, she said. One recent estimate suggested the surrounding county has a shortage of nearly 26,000 affordable homes for low-income renters. A survey also found that only 21% of displaced households stayed in the same neighborhood, and that one in three experienced some period of homelessness or marginal housing. Luis Carriel, 38-year-old father of three who works two kitchen jobs and has been living in his apartment for a decade, said he would like to see Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, step up in some way. “We don’t work for Facebook … Why do we have to pay the high price?” A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment, but pointed to the $20m the company pledged to invest in affordable housing initiatives as part of its local expansion agreement. One of its projects is bringing 1,500 new units to the region – but only 15% would offer below market rate rents. Zamora said the disproportionate impact on Latinos and African Americans in the neighborhood was evident to locals: “They are displacing us. They are pushing us away. Is this purposeful?” Lilian Flores and her fiance are preparing to move out from their apartment, which has been in her family for 10 years, because they can’t afford the new rents. For now, they are moving into a single bedroom in someone else’s house as they try to pay off debts and save up. Eventually, she said, they would likely have to leave the area altogether, even though her family remains in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto where she grew up. She said she was considering relocating to Modesto, a city 90 miles away, and that it was sad to think that her children would not go to the same schools she once attended. “We’ve been here for so long,” she said, “and they just really don’t care.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/20/trump-border-policy-family-separation-abu-ghraib","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Trump's family separation policy is as damaging to America as Abu Ghraib | Michael H Fuchs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/trump-border-policy-family-separation-abu-ghraib","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/20/trump-border-policy-family-separation-abu-ghraib","fields":{"headline":"Trump's family separation policy is as damaging to America as Abu Ghraib","bodyText":"The words “Abu Ghraib” have become synonymous with torture, a black eye for America that has damaged US national security. Donald Trump’s policy of ripping children away from their parents at the border is a new black mark on America that could also undermine US national security. America’s power comes from its values: freedom, the rule of law, respect for human rights. Whatever problems America may face at home, America’s democratic system enables itself to correct wrongs in the pursuit of a fair, just society. Whatever mistakes the United States makes in its foreign policy, America still endeavors to infuse its foreign policy with these values. When America does not live up to these values, it is less safe. The experience of the Iraqi prison Abu Ghraib is instructive. After the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, it used Saddam Hussein’s jail as a place to torture Iraqi prisoners. The torture of prisoners – the picture of a US soldier holding a naked Iraqi on a leash, for instance – became international symbols that shattered America’s image as a global defender of human rights. These illegal acts hurt US national security. Abu Ghraib was used as a rallying cry by terrorist groups who were fighting American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. As one US military interrogator wrote: “I learned in Iraq that the No 1 reason foreign fighters flocked there to fight were the abuses carried out at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo … The number of US soldiers who have died because of our torture policy will never be definitively known, but it is fair to say that it is close to the number of lives lost on September 11, 2001.” Today, America is in a moral crisis as its government takes children away from undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers at the US border. It is difficult to imagine something crueler than taking a child away from parents. These people are often fleeing violence and danger and are in search of a better life. The sounds of children crying in US jails while guards crack jokes are eerily evocative of US guards at Abu Ghraib posing smiling for pictures with naked Iraqi prisoners in humiliating positions. As George Takei – who was imprisoned by the US government in an internment camp as a child during the second world war – pointed out, not even those Japanese-Americans imprisoned during the war were separated from their parents. In America today, border agents reportedly told parents their children were getting bathed and then never came back, evoking Nazis taking away children in death camps and telling people being led to the gas chambers that they were going to take a shower. This inhumane policy will also damage US security. Ripping children away from their families invites criticism from the international organizations charged with upholding human rights. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights has called Trump’s policy “unconscionable”. Ripping children away from their family decimates America’s ability to hold accountable human rights abusers. The Trump administration’s condemnations of human rights violations in other countries seems meaningless, and those countries are likely to point to the US policy as a counter-argument. Furthermore, just as the world grapples with an ongoing refugee crisis, others may try to emulate this policy and point to the US as a model for this horrific behavior. Ripping children away from their families could also become a rallying cry for America’s adversaries. Like Abu Ghraib, the images of children in cages and the sounds of crying children make for powerful propaganda for anyone opposed to America – terrorist groups, authoritarian countries, and others who seek to paint a picture of an evil America. Perhaps most damaging of all, ripping children away from their families will tarnish America’s image. Without living up to its values, America’s massive economic and military is far less potent. If allies do not believe that America upholds fundamental moral standards, support for those alliances will crumble. If partners no longer see America living up to its democratic ideals, America will surrender its ability to work with those countries to solve global problems. The Trump administration has already abandoned America’s traditional support for human rights abroad. Trump embraces dictators, as evidenced by his defense of Kim Jong-un’s brutal repression in North Korea. And on Tuesday the administration announced it is withdrawing the United States from the UN human rights council, the main international organization charged with defending human rights. Perhaps the Trump administration fears that the forced separation of immigrants’ children from parents will make the United States a subject of the council’s criticism. One “solution” now being floated by congressional Republicans would trade the separation of families for the incarceration of families. But warehousing thousands of children for months or years in jail-like facilities operated by private prison companies would be even worse. If these policies continue, it would seem likely that the Trump administration is willing to go to any lengths to turn America into a place that actively deters others from coming. This land has always attracted people seeking a better life. This is a nation of immigrants, and immigration makes America stronger. But policies like forced family separations can deal powerful blows to the United States’ image as a beacon for those around the world yearning for a better life. Whatever one’s views on immigration policy, it seems an unqualified negative to turn America into a country known for its state-sanctioned human rights abuses instead of its admirable ideals.

While you are browsing, you can get to know a courageous widow (Emily Mortimer), a melancholy recluse (Bill Nighy) and a snobbish busybody (Patricia Clarkson), all of whom live in a coastal town in 1959. The only snag is that you may feel as if you have visited this particular shop already. You may get a frisson of deja vu from the china teacups and the crystal champagne glasses; the ankle-length skirts and the three-piece suits; the cobbled streets and the unspoilt woods; and all the other signs that the UK film industry’s latest obsession is Britain as it was a few decades ago. British films have always idealised our great nation’s glorious past, of course, especially when that past is embodied by Henry VIII, Queen Victoria, Mr Darcy, or Helena Bonham Carter wearing a bustle, but never before have so many films, released over such a short time, targeted such a specific period of our history: the outer rings are the 1920s to the 1960s, and the 1940s are the bullseye. Since the beginning of 2017, there have been three films concerning the Dunkirk evacuation: Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour and Lone Scherfig’s Their Finest. Goodbye Christopher Robin opens during the second world war, before flashing back to the creation of Winnie-the-Pooh and its effects on AA Milne’s family in the 20s and 30s. (A Disney film with Ewan McGregor as a grown-up Christopher Robin is due out in August.) The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society opens in 1946, and the narrative then cuts back and forth between the island’s Nazi-occupied war years and their immediate aftermath. Lenny Abrahamson’s The Little Stranger, which is released in the UK in September, is set in 1947. Andy Serkis’s Breathe begins with a friendly game of tennis at the British embassy in Nairobi in 1958. On Chesil Beach, based on Ian McEwan’s Booker-nominated novella, is mostly set in 1962 (with flashbacks); and The Mercy, starring Colin Firth and Rachel Weisz, brings us bang up to date: it is set in 1968. If I broaden the field to include recent British films that don’t take place in Britain, there is Gurinder Chadha’s Viceroy’s House, set in 1947, Armando Iannucci’s The Death of Stalin, set in 1953, and Pawel Pawlikowski’s Film4-backed Cold War, the only vaguely British film in competition at Cannes this year, which starts in 1949 and spans the 50s. And if I broaden the field to include documentaries, there is one about everyone’s favourite second world war fighter, Spitfire, being released next month. But these are outliers. Most Britflicks of the past 18 months have been middlebrow, mid-20th-century dramas. They have been set in the greenest and most pleasant parts of England’s green and pleasant land. They have been inspired by novels and true stories. And the characters have been well off, if not quite as aristocratic as those you would associate with the heyday of Merchant Ivory. There may be the odd lord and lady knocking about, but the protagonists usually see themselves as “just about managing”: the couple played by Andrew Garfield and Claire Foy in Breathe move to a sprawling country mansion, but they get it for a knockdown price, so they’re not that rich. In general, these films paint a cosily positive picture of yesteryear: imagine the bunting-festooned patriotism and retro chic of an episode of The Great British Bake Off shot at Dreamland in Margate. Whichever traumas and dangers they portray are offset by the comforting sight of Domhnall Gleeson or Tom Hollander in a V-necked jumper and flannel trousers, strolling through a meadow. For the reasons behind this trend, look no further than the potential audience, says Damian Jones, producer of Goodbye Christopher Robin and the 2016 big-screen Dad’s Army spin-off. “What’s been bubbling for a while, probably since The Iron Lady and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel came out [in early 2012], is the conviction that the most reliable cinema-going audience are the over-50s. And a period movie falls into the category of films that audience will go to see.” Financiers are responding, he says, to the fact that younger viewers are either sticking to superhero blockbusters or staying at home to watch Netflix. “You’re always hoping that word of mouth will broaden the audience to other ages and demographics,” says Jones. “But the weekday matinee for older audiences has become key to British film’s economics.” As for what those older audiences are getting from their matinee outings, the obvious answer would be that they are spending the “grey pound” on nostalgia. Chris Curling, who produced The Bookshop, disagrees, saying his film has “already done exceptionally well in Spain and Germany, and that can’t be down to a nostalgia for an England that is no more”. Nonetheless, Curling’s next production, Trautmann, is set in the same period: it is a biopic of Bert Trautmann, a former Luftwaffe paratrooper who becomes Manchester City’s goalkeeper shortly after the second world war. “It’s about reconciliation and overcoming prejudice and being open to immigrants,” he says. Yet it is hard to shake the suspicion that many of these films’ fans are also fans of Brexit. Recall, if you can stomach it, the photo of Nigel Farage posing next to the Dunkirk poster and urging “every youngster” to see it. And, needless to say, almost all the characters in these films are white, the salient exceptions being the respectful Indians in Viceroy’s House and the respectful black Londoner (Ade Haastrup) who trades Macaulay quotes with Churchill on the tube in Darkest Hour. “Brexit plays a part,” admits Stephen Woolley, who produced Their Finest and On Chesil Beach, “although Their Finest was very much a ‘remain’ movie. We enjoyed making it because of its lack of jingoism.” (Last year’s other Dunkirk films, he adds, were “slightly more generic although very well made”.) The irony is that while the British film industry is overwhelmingly pro-EU, not least because of the £300m of European funding it has received in the past decade, its evocations of a sun-kissed, pre-Common Market past are embraced by leave voters. Or maybe they are being embraced by viewers who aren’t quite sure whether they should have voted leave or not. Dr Paul Elliott, who lectures on British heritage cinema at the University of Worcester, believes that, to understand the appeal of such films, you have to see beyond the vintage costumes and the picturesque fishing villages, and focus instead on the “simpler ethical framework” they construct. “We are in a period of political and cultural moral complexity where people don’t know what to think, so we look to films to give us that sense of orientation, that sense that there is a clear choice between right and wrong. Films set in the second world war and the postwar period offer that, because you knew who your enemies were. It’s seen as being a more consoling time – not that it would have felt like that if you were living through it.” Indeed, Elliott argues that today’s heritage movies provide older audiences with the same reassuring good-v-evil certainty that the aforementioned superhero movies supply to a younger crowd. “Dunkirk is in essence a superhero film, which is what Christopher Nolan does best,” says Elliott. “It creates a very attractive binary moral image of law-abiding citizens coming together against an evil empire. If you swapped out the khaki for Lycra and the spitfires for spaceships, you’d have Avengers Assemble.” But perhaps there is another, simpler reason for the industry’s fixation on the heart of the 20th century. Perhaps the reason is that Britain excels at heritage movies and no one can remember the Victorian era any more. “We like to tell stories about our parents and their parents, and the 1960s were 50 years ago,” says Woolley. “We’re all getting older.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/19/andy-murray-promising-queens-club-comeback","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T19:39:42Z","webTitle":"Andy Murray shakes off racket rust in promising Queen’s Club comeback | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/19/andy-murray-promising-queens-club-comeback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/19/andy-murray-promising-queens-club-comeback","fields":{"headline":"Andy Murray shakes off racket rust in promising Queen’s Club comeback","bodyText":"Here he comes then, the world No 156. Some plucky old trier from up north of the Scottish border by the name of Andy Murray. The last time he was ranked so low was more than a decade ago, way back in 2005, the year he first turned pro. He has been out of tennis for the best part of a year now, since he lost against Sam Querrey in the quarter‑finals of Wimbledon last year. He spent most of that time struggling with the hip injury that he finally had fixed in January. He has had a lot of false dawns since, the last of them in Rosmalen just a couple of weeks ago. Now here he was, at last, back on Centre Court at Queen’s Club. Of course he received a standing ovation, a full chorus of hoots and claps and hollers and cheers. After that everyone settled into a sort of uneasy silence, unsure exactly what to expect from him. Murray has won this title five times and more than anything else the crowd just wanted one more chance to see him compete. Whether he would manage even to do that much was not clear. He had said that this first match back was about “seeing where my game’s at”. He is 31, and his game has a year’s worth of rust on it, then there is the business of his hip and how the surgery would affect his all‑court game. It was a tough draw, too. Up against his great mate Nick Kyrgios, who had played so brilliantly against Roger Federer in the semi-finals at Stuttgart last Saturday. In the circumstances, plenty believed Murray would do well even to take the match to a third set, let alone win it. There were nerves, then, as he bounced the ball up and down, thump, thump, thump, before his very first serve. Fault. So he started over again. This time he shied away from the toss. Then, third time around, he landed one. And he was off and away for another grass-court season. Kyrgios made hay in those early exchanges. Murray’s movement was fine, even if he did not quite have that old elastic snap back from the tramlines, but his game looked a little off the pace. He was scrapping to fight off break points while Kyrgios ran through his repertoire of trick shots, turning a pirouette before he hit a smash, and whacking balls back from between his legs. Sometimes even the ’tweeners landed in. And then, midway through that first set everything started to change. Murray settled, and Kyrgios started to drift. At 2-2 in the first set, Murray brushed off two break points to hold serve, then broke Kyrgios in the next game, at the third attempt. And all of a sudden, there was a real urgency to the match. Those old, desperate shouts of “Come on Andy!” started to ring around the stands and Murray was muttering imprecations and exhortations under his breath, berating himself after the bad shots, and pumping his fist and shouting after the good ones. These all felt like familiar and reassuring signs that another English summer is here, like the first swallows and strawberries. It turned into a patchy affair, the standard up and down from one rally to the next. But for Murray, the main thing was surely just that he kept plugging away through the best part of three hours’ play. He did hold his hand to his back a couple of times late in the match, and no doubt his body will be plenty stiff and his limbs mighty sore, on Wednesday morning. But still. There was an idea that injury could even end his career but he is still here. He is, after all, a tough and stubborn a player as ever held a racket. Wimbledon will surely come too soon. But there was enough there in this first match back to suggest that he is not done yet. The caveat is that Kyrgios’s interest seemed to ebb and flow, as it so often does. At 23, he still treats his enormous talent in a way that must make people older than he is want to plead with him to just try applying himself. Murray has never done anything but in his glittering career. He leaves it all on court, has spent every last part of himself to the endeavour. And at 31, even after the year he has had, it seems he still has more to give. There s life in the old Scot yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/19/aleksandr-kogan-facebook-cambridge-analytica-senate-testimony","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T23:04:55Z","webTitle":"Cambridge Analytica-linked academic spurns idea Facebook swayed election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/19/aleksandr-kogan-facebook-cambridge-analytica-senate-testimony","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/19/aleksandr-kogan-facebook-cambridge-analytica-senate-testimony","fields":{"headline":"Cambridge Analytica-linked academic spurns idea Facebook swayed election","bodyText":"The academic researcher who harvested personal data from Facebook for a political consultancy firm said on Tuesday that the idea the data was useful in swaying voters’ decisions was “science fiction”. “People may feel angry and violated if they think their data was used in some kind of mind-control project,” Aleksandr Kogan, the now notorious Cambridge University psychologist whose app collected data on up to 87 million Facebook users, said during a US Senate hearing. “This is science fiction. The data is entirely ineffective.” Kogan’s appearance before the Senate comes three months after the revelation that he had transferred his giant dataset to Cambridge Analytica, a now defunct political consultancy that worked on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The scandal set off political shockwaves in the US and UK. The academic was portrayed as a liar and a fraud by Facebook when news of the data harvest broke in March. Kogan has argued in the press and before parliament that he was being scapegoated for behavior that was normal and that Facebook did nothing to prevent. At the hearing on Tuesday, Kogan repeatedly took aim at the field of research – psychometrics – that Cambridge Analytica claimed it could use to predict voters’ psychological traits and influence their votes. “If the goal of Cambridge Analtyica was to show personalized advertisements on Facebook, then what they did was stupid,” Kogan said, arguing that it is much more effective for any advertiser to use Facebook’s own advertising targeting tools. Kogan’s dismissal of psychometrics’ predictive value is certain to irk his former colleagues at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers with the renowned program published a widely cited study showing that Facebook likes could be used to predict a wide array of personality traits. Whether the ability to predict certain traits can be translated into psychologically tailored advertisements is very much open to debate, however, and Kogan is by no means alone in questioning the efficacy of Cambridge Analytica’s targeting practices. The researcher, who studied prosociality and wellbeing before leaving academia to pursue commercial opportunities, also lobbed criticisms at Facebook for its addictive nature. “I think it’s pretty clear that Facebook is in the business of trying to keep you on Facebook as long as possible,” he said. “The model does run counter not only to our privacy but to our wellbeing.” Though Facebook has instituted a number of reforms to its privacy practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analtyica scandal, Tuesday’s hearing was a sign that for some US lawmakers at least, there remains an appetite to regulate internet platforms. “Americans deserve no less privacy than Europeans,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, during his opening remarks, in reference to the EU’s new data privacy protections. Also appearing before the subcommittee were John Battelle and Ashkan Soltani. Batelle, a veteran media entrepreneur who is chairman of an ad tech company and serves on the board of directors of data brokerage Acxiom, said Facebook was incapable of addressing “the externalities it has created”. He argued for a light touch on regulation, however, saying; “The wrong conclusion to draw from Cambridge Analytica is that entities like Facebook must build higher walls around their data.” Soltani, an independent privacy researcher who served as chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) during the Obama administration, said that he believed Facebook had violated its 2011 consent decree with the FTC and that there was a “strong likelihood” the body would impose fines against the company. “I have no doubt that Facebook has violated its consent decree,” said Blumenthal. “The only question now is what should be done about it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/commentisfree/2018/jul/19/drugs-alone-wont-fix-our-epidemic-of-depression","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-19T10:00:43Z","webTitle":"Drugs alone won't fix our epidemic of depression | James S Gordon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2018/jul/19/drugs-alone-wont-fix-our-epidemic-of-depression","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/commentisfree/2018/jul/19/drugs-alone-wont-fix-our-epidemic-of-depression","fields":{"headline":"Drugs alone won't fix our epidemic of depression","bodyText":"The New York Times recently published an important investigative report shining a long-overdue light on the painful, sometimes disabling experience of withdrawing from antidepressants – drugs that millions of Americans have been taking, sometimes for decades The recent deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain threw into stark relief the human toll that depression can take. But the problem is complex, with multiple factors. We are seeing a striking increase in the number of Americans diagnosed with depression, and an accompanying increase in suicides. This is coupled with the promiscuous and sharply increasing prescription of antidepressants to 34.4 million Americans in 2013-2014, up from 13.4 million just 15 years earlier. And this pervasive prescribing continues despite the lack of proof of the drugs’ long-term effectiveness; their mixed results even with short-term treatment; the frequent side-effects – weight gain, gastrointestinal problems and sexual dysfunction – that are themselves depressing. Meanwhile, we are paying the prohibitive financial costs of depression – an estimated annual average of $210.5bn in treatment and lost productivity. These numbers raise critical questions: why are so many Americans becoming depressed? Why do rates of suicide, depression’s dire and irreversible consequence, continue to increase – by 25% since 1999 according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report? Why are we treating vast numbers of these depressed and suicidal people with drugs that are of limited effectiveness? How can we do better? Depression is characterized by low energy and despondency, negative self-esteem, pervasive pessimism, difficulties with eating, sleeping and sexual functioning, and helplessness and hopelessness. It is caused by biological, psychological, social and economic and spiritual challenges which are increasing in number and severity and often compound one another. These include decreases in social support and the loneliness that follows; high levels of stress about the economy, and the future; the hyper-competitiveness and hypercritical self-assessments of youth; sedentary lifestyles and poor diet; and our addiction to our digital devices. The prevailing psychopharmacological treatment is based on the theory that depression is a neurotransmitter disorder. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and physicians are fond of making an analogy between depression and type-1 diabetes. The bodies of type 1 diabetics do not produce enough insulin, so diabetics receive insulin by injection. Depressed people, the analogy goes, are incapable of producing adequate amounts of neurotransmitters and must be prescribed drugs to increase them. This is incomplete and misleading. Some depressed people may have lower levels of serotonin or norepinephrine. But no one knows how many, and doctors rarely measure these levels before prescribing drugs. A variety of emotional, social, nutritional and environmental factors affect a person’s fluctuating neurotransmitter levels, which in turn affect how a person functions. In other words, low levels are likely to be the symptoms, not the cause, of depression. Unfortunately, the prevalent view of depression as a “Prozac deficiency disease” prevents many Americans from seeking out a more comprehensive, safe and effective approach, grounded in self-care and group support. Meditation is fundamental to this approach. Slow, deep breathing relaxes our body, quiets our mind, and lowers the stress which often precipitates depression. It quiets activity in the amygdala, a portion of the emotional brain responsible for fear and anger, and enhances activity in the hippocampus, which mediates stress and memory and is damaged by depression. Meditation thereby promotes functioning and increases tissue mass in the frontal part of the cerebral cortex, where depression has inhibited judgment, self-awareness and compassion. Meditation also makes it easier for us to connect with others who may provide comfort, intimacy and support. It gives us perspective – helping us see that what seemed insurmountable is manageable. It promotes compassion, and facilitates finding mood- and life-enhancing meaning and purpose. Physical activity complements meditation. As a depressed person moves, she overcomes her inertia, releases tension and reclaims and enjoys a body that seemed alien, even hostile. Jogging, tai chi, yoga and dance all lower stress and stress hormones, may help rebuild the hippocampus and enhance activity in the frontal cortex. Exercise by itself can be at least as effective as drugs in relieving depression. Food is a third healing ally. Deficiencies in vital nutrients that are low in the standard American, processed food diet are more prevalent in people with lower incomes, but widespread among all Americans. At least 30% of adults are deficient in vitamin D, preventing them from effectively synthesizing serotonin and making them more vulnerable to depression. Other nutrient deficiencies – including folic acid, vitamins B6 and 12, magnesium, zinc and chromium – may also play a crucial role in depression. Populations high in omega 3 fatty acids (present in fish and fish oil) are less depressed, as are people with a healthy balance of bacteria in their intestine. Supplementing one’s diet with vitamins, minerals and the gut-healing bacteria of “probiotics” may be crucial in relieving depression. These self-care tools enhance the production of the neurotransmitters that drugs are aimed at – serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine – without damaging side-effects. And the active engagement that self-care requires may itself be the most effective antidote to depression’s hallmark symptoms of hopelessness and helplessness. Speaking to a compassionate, knowledgable professional and participating in supportive, stigma-free, educational small groups also helps. This human support helps depressed people overcome loneliness and develop more effective strategies for dealing with self-defeating behavior, and encourages them to rediscover – or discover – connection, meaning and purpose. When we are suicidal, it can be life-saving. Scientific evidence and common sense tell us it’s time to make comprehensive programs of self-care and human support the norm for relieving depression, promoting resiliency and renewing enthusiasm for life. Prescription drugs, which can sometimes be helpful, should be a rarely used last resort.

Labour will provide it","bodyText":"The last eight years has been a period of almost unparalleled waste and destructiveness in British economic policy. Even the prime minister now admits that the NHS has been damaged by the austerity spending cuts. But the problems with our economy run deeper than brutal political choices to prioritise tax giveaways for the super-rich and giant corporations over spending on public services. They run even deeper than the uncertainty and damage being inflicted by this government’s bungling of Brexit. This country suffers the lowest rate of investment in the G7. Our infrastructure – the essential networks of transport, utilities and telecommunications – is creaking under the strain, and suffering from decades of privatised mismanagement. On technology, we are falling even further behind, with the latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures showing that British manufacturing has the lowest rate of industrial robot use in the developed world – even allowing for the small size of the sector – and spending by business on research is far below the OECD average. Real wages remain lower than they were eight years ago. Yet amid the public squalor and worsening conditions for the many, there are huge new investments in luxury flats and, at least in parts of London, extraordinary private wealth. When I asked a respected City economist, Graham Turner, and his team to take a look into the functioning of the finance system, it was with this fundamental problem of low investment in mind. Their interim report, published in December, drummed home some startling facts. Our financial system was taking money from manufacturing and lending it to invest in property; promising growth in new tech sectors was overwhelmingly concentrated in and around London; and some of the issues we saw in the run-up to the financial crisis have still not gone away. The team’s final report is published today, and proposes fundamental shifts in how our financial system is organised. Reform of the Bank of England’s mandate is at its centre. It should retain operational independence, but – more than two decades after this was granted it is time to reassess its guiding principles. – Turner’s team have recommended that alongside the Bank’s existing inflation target it should set a 3% target for productivity growth. This will be backed by new powers that steer the financial system towards investment to maximise productivity growth. The report also proposes that a new government should agree an accord with the Bank, showing how each will work towards achieving that productivity target. And the Bank , they suggest, should be charged with assessing such measures in an annual budget. Along with other detailed proposals, including the creation of a dedicated applied scientific research fund and a Strategic Investment Board to oversee investment, the authors’ aim is guided by the belief – entirely correct, in my view – that almost a decade after the global financial crisis caused the worst recession in living memory, the time for a fundamental transformation of our financial system is long overdue. It means building on the immense strengths of our financial system, and harnessing them to meet the needs of a productive economy that works for the many, not the few. • John McDonnell is Labour’s shadow chancellor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jul/21/philippines-lives-land-lost-coffee-empire-militarised-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-21T05:15:01Z","webTitle":"'I tended to the bodies': attacked by the Philippine army","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/21/philippines-lives-land-lost-coffee-empire-militarised-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jul/21/philippines-lives-land-lost-coffee-empire-militarised-politics","fields":{"headline":"'I tended to the bodies': attacked by the Philippine army","bodyText":"When the soldiers opened fire on Datal Bonglangon village, there was first confusion, then terror, then grief. But Marivic Danyan – one of the younger, quieter members of the community – decided to be strong. Reluctantly, heartbreakingly strong. The young T’boli woman had been preparing lunch when her remote, indigenous community on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao was peppered with gunfire. One bullet ripped into the wooden wall beside her. Another pierced the corrugated tin roof. Ignoring her pleas to take cover, her father – Victor, the village chief – rushed out with a handmade rifle and bow and arrows. He staggered back soon after, shot and bleeding. Danyan held his hand as he breathed his last. For the next 18-20 hours, she and her two young daughters cowered inside the family home along with a handful of survivors, wondering what had happened to other menfolk who had been working in the cornfields. It was not until the next morning that they ventured out and saw the carnage. In total, eight people were killed by the Philippine army’s 27th Infantry Battalion on 3 December 2017. Half of them were Danyan’s close family. Along with her father, she lost her husband, Pato Celardo, and two brothers, Victor Junior and Artemio. “That’s when I decided to be strong so I could tend to the bodies,” she recalls with evident pain. “I had to put part of my husband’s brains back inside his skull so he was fit for burial. I tried to change the clothes of my dead brothers, but their wounds were too bad.” She also inherited the ceremonial dagger of the tribal chief, or datu, from her father, along with the campaign he had fought for almost three decades against a coffee plantation on community land. Danyan believes it was her father’s determination to regain territory from the plantation, Silvicultural Industries, that led to the killings. Short, thin and soft-spoken, Danyan appears far younger than her 28 years, but her eyes radiate intelligence and a fierce determination. Even before the attack, she was respected as the first member of the community to graduate from high school. In its wake, she has become the head of her family, a candidate to become the first female chief of the village and a leader in the community’s efforts to regain its land and protect its environment. The Philippine government says the villagers were caught in a crossfire between the military and the New People’s Army (NPA), one of many rebel groups that have turned Mindanao into one of the deadliest conflict zones in east Asia. A bumpy four-hour drive to the massacre site reveals how a simmering land dispute exploded into violence – an all-too-common occurrence under the shoot-first-ask-questions-later presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. Last year, 41 activists were murdered in the Philippines, making it by far the deadliest country in Asia for environmental defenders. Datal Bonglangon is a cluster of one-storey wooden homes, cornfields and a small dirt square where local children play basketball next to a water buffalo pen. It would be bucolic if not for its neighbour. Plantation security guards look down from a watchtower amid hillsides of stubby, dark-green arabica coffee bushes. Danyan was a year old when an earlier leaseholder – a logging company – arrived with bulldozers and chainsaws in 1991. Older villagers say they were ordered to evacuate by armed thugs. Some of their homes were burned, destroying the resting places of their ancestors. (In those days T’bolis interred the bodies of their loved ones inside tree trunks that they would use as benches.) Most of the nearby forest – on which the community depended for fruit and medicine – was cut down. The birds, wild boar and monkeys disappeared along with the trees. Since then, the young are no longer taught how to use bows and arrows, because there is nothing left to hunt. After the land was cleared, 11,862 hectares were acquired for 25 years by Silvicultural Industries. Little is known about this company, but villagers and environmentalists believe it is part of the vast agribusiness, mining and construction conglomerate built by David M Consunji, a former minister during the Marcos dictatorship. Villagers say the plantation – also known as Dawang Coffee – left them struggling for survival. “We have very little land left. Not enough to grow the food we need. People go hungry,” says Dande Dinyan, the regional chieftain of Tamasco, the umbrella group campaigning for T’boli, Ubo and Manobo rights. These indigenous peoples once inhabited the fertile plains. Centuries of colonisation pushed them into the hills near Lake Sebu. In recent decades they have been squeezed further with the arrival of extractive industries. “This is their last frontier. If they lose this land, where else do they have to go?” says Sister Susan Bolanio, executive director of Oblates of Notre Dame-run Hesed Foundation, who has worked with the community for decades. Danyan’s father dedicated his life to recovering the territory. For 25 years he waited for the expiry of the plantation’s lease, which was up in December 2016. Shortly before then, however, the government declared an extension of this lease and a bundle of others linked to Consunji. This was the final straw for the chief, who hacked down a 150-hectare area of coffee trees and replanted the land with corn. With her husband and brothers, he then marched into the camp of the plantation guards and ordered them to leave. Arrest warrants were issued for Victor and several other members of the community. They say they received death threats from fellow T’boli tribesmen who were employed by the company? Then the army became involved. NPA insurgents praised the villagers’ resistance against what they called the “environmentally destructive enterprise” of Consunji. With tensions rising, mediators linked to the Catholic church arranged talks between Victor and the government on 4 December. Hours before they were due to go ahead, soldiers opened fire. Army commanders may genuinely have believed they were attacking a guerrilla base. The government claims two soldiers were killed along with an NPA leader, and that four guns were later found at the site. But human rights groups, indigenous campaigners, independent forensic experts and legal activists say the chief was a respected and peaceful campaigner who was deliberately silenced to end his protests. Danyan is convinced her father was killed because he stood up against a powerful company, and tried to grow corn for a hungry local community instead of coffee for export. “I want his protest to be remembered,” she said. “I urge people not to buy coffee from this region. It has caused us so much suffering.” Her supporters have called for an independent investigation into both the killings and the dubious extension of the plantation’s lease. The campaign goes on. “I don’t have a choice,” Danyan says. “Blood has been spilled and we are ready to give our lives. I won’t use violence. I will use the law, but I will continue to fight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/15022","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-29T23:00:54Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 15,022","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/15022","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/15022","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 15,022","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/24/christo-london-mastaba-floating-installation-tomma-abts-serpentine-galleries-reviews","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"Christo: London Mastaba; Tomma Abts – reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/24/christo-london-mastaba-floating-installation-tomma-abts-serpentine-galleries-reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/24/christo-london-mastaba-floating-installation-tomma-abts-serpentine-galleries-reviews","fields":{"headline":"Christo: London Mastaba; Tomma Abts – reviews","bodyText":"“All interpretations accepted”: so said Christo at the launch of his floating sculpture on the waters of the Serpentine lake last week. Given its shattering size – about three times the height of a three-storey house – it’s amazing that this multicoloured object appears to float so lightly. A trapezoid with two vertical and two sloping sides, soaring up to a flat top, it is constructed out of 7,506 barrels painted red, blue and mauve and attached to an invisible structure. You are meant to gasp. Any additional response is frankly a plus. Artist of the Wrapped Reichstag and the Colorado Curtain, in which 400 metres of orange cloth was strung among the Rocky Mountains, Christo is addicted to scale. The Serpentine Gallery show that accompanies this muckle polyhedron is stuffed with drawings and models for unrealised projects that would dwarf the Colossus of Rhodes. A further version of the London Mastaba, as it’s called, designed for the deserts outside Abu Dhabi, would be almost six times larger – the biggest sculpture in the history of the world. It hasn’t happened yet, any more than the silver curtains that Christo, along with his late partner Jeanne-Claude, aimed to float down the Arkansas River; or their scheme for wrapping the Museum of Modern Art in New York. At 83, the artist still lives in hope, along with his legions of fans. Like Deadheads, these followers travel the world to take in Christo’s wonders: the mysterious “bridge” between two Italian islands that allowed visitors to walk on water, as it seemed; the wrapping of the Pont Neuf in golden fabric; the flame-coloured banners that blazed through New York’s Central Park in 2005. This is art as public event: a shared experience for every citizen. Christo is nothing if not democratic. Born in Bulgaria in 1935, he escaped the Soviet Bloc for Paris at the age of 20, eventually reaching New York. His is a utopian philosophy in which art is to bring joy (and thought) to each and all. He pays for every project himself, so there is no state or private involvement; and no project ever lingers. This one will be gone by September. Which may be good news for the Serpentine swimmers forced to navigate the incredible hulk each morning, the dog walkers who cannot stand its vivid colours, the pleasure-seekers who find their boats overshadowed by its monumental presence. And it may be bad news for those who love the cognitive dissonance of an aggressively contemporary sculpture, in all its high-chrome abstraction, in the midst of cultivated nature. The very least that can be said of it is that it is designed to divide. This is a function of scale and colour, first to last. If the Mastaba was small, it would be trivial but pretty. If differently coloured – in silver, say – it might carry the ever-changing effects of light in far more compelling ways. With a pointed tip, it would resemble a pyramid. With a golden elephant on top it would mean something totemic, ancient, mysterious (a mastaba is a kind of Egyptian burial tomb). But instead it is a purely abstract form got up in modern colours and taken to super-sized limits. This is an environmental piece, like all of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s work. So of course it performs according to the atmosphere. Two sides are an abrasive scarlet, each barrel painted with nautical white stripes; they don’t alter much. But the other sides swarm with coloured discs like a vast pointillist painting, reflecting blurred and shifting hues on the water. Alas, this pleasure is short-lived. Some people say the barrels invoke current oil politics, but this seems doubtful. Almost every object in the Serpentine show is composed of barrels, stretching back 50 years and including early pastiches of modernist sculpture. And here is a central aspect of the London Mastaba: it is only one of many. Nothing unique, nothing relating to London, politics, culture, the landscape or the times – just another edition, gigantic, deflective and inert. Interpretation is not just a stretch; in this case, it feels entirely unnecessary. Go instead, if you can, to Tomma Abts’s marvellous show of paintings up the road at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, each one a perfect enigma. The German-born Abts won the 2006 Turner prize for her abstract canvases; small, exquisitely painted and utterly singular. Not one is like any of the others. A ribbon of changing colour flutters around a bright rectangle, threading its way in and out of space so that the eye cannot see its beginning or end, or even pick out its exact journey. A sunray form, something like a paper fan, casts an impossible light as well as vivid shadows. The brilliant stripes running down one surface suddenly seem to sheer away on their own, as if trying to detach themselves and exit the picture altogether. The eye is captivated by what the mind can hardly fathom. Metallic paintings reflect but somehow deny the world around them too. Surfaces are scraped, polished, divided and embossed, sometimes all in one picture, so that one has the strongest sense of its cumulative making. Arrays of sharp lines, discs and angular shapes appear on the verge of locking into a gorgeous pattern, but always dance lightly away. There is an extraordinary animation that isn’t just the legacy of op art, hi-fi illusion or trompe l’oeil. Some paintings look as if they might be susceptible to opening out like a window or unfolding like complex origami. Each has a title that sounds like somebody’s name (Fimme, Zebe, Sierk). And certainly all have a distinctive character – brisk or evasive, unstable, witty, reticent or vivacious – that seems to suggest a living personality. In this show, there are paintings evocative of flags, searchlights, shuffled playing cards and even (it seems to me) figures dancing the charleston. And with metaphor comes a kind of lyrical philosophy, to the effect that no painting seen or made by human beings can ever be wholly abstract.

The chancellor made it clear in tense eleventh-hour negotiations that Simon Stevens had to publicly welcome the funding deal or he would not give NHS England as much money as Theresa May announced. Unless Stevens did so, Hammond would have handed the NHS a smaller percentage rise in each of the next five years than the 3.4% announced. Stevens, a former adviser to Tony Blair in Downing Street, has taken issue publicly several times with the prime minister over exactly how much money the Conservative government has promised the NHS. In January 2017, Stevens’s “stretching it” judgment in evidence to MPs that May’s claim her government was giving the service an extra £10bn generated extensive media coverage. Last November he also dismissed a £2.6bn cash injection in Hammond’s budget as too little, prompting anger in the chancellor. “The deal was explicitly done on the basis that Stevens was required to support it. The chancellor said that if he was going to be pushed up [to a 3.4% increase] there would need to be a warm and effusive welcome for it. Stevens was in the room at the time Hammond said that”, one well-placed source disclosed. “Hammond basically insisted that if he went as high as 3.4%, unless Stevens came out and publicly welcomed the deal he wasn’t going to budge on the number.” Stevens did not disagree with what was in effect the chancellor’s ultimatum, the source added. When news of the £20bn package emerged last Sunday, Stevens welcomed it, saying: “As the NHS turns 70, we can now face the next five years with renewed certainty. This multi-year settlement provides the funding we need to shape a long-term plan for key improvements in cancer, mental health and other critical services.” On Monday Stevens also welcomed the deal, but in different terms, when he answered questions from the Commons public accounts committee. “It represents a clear gear change in the amount of funding that will be available for the next five years, compared to what we have had over the last five years.” He used roughly the same form of words when talking about the settlement at an event hosted by the IPPR thinktank on Tuesday. The NHS England chief’s public endorsement of the 3.4% deal is in stark contrast to his previous insistence, which he repeated to a gathering of health service bosses last week, that the NHS needed increases of at least 4% a year for the next few years. Last week Stevens made clear that the government had received a lot of evidence on the service’s funding needs from independent bodies and should base the size of the increase on that. That evidence – from the Office for Budget Responsibility, Institute for Fiscal Studies and health thinktanks – all said the NHS needed rises of at least 4% in order to improve its performance against key waiting time targets and also expand services. His approval of the £20bn as enough to finance “key improvements” in priority areas of care is also at odds with the views of chief executives who run hospital trusts in England. One, who did not want to be named, said: “The money we have got is more than a drop in the ocean, or a trickle, but it is hardly a torrent.” The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said the 3.4% deal will mean that taxes will have to go up. The deal has also led to May being criticised for talking “tosh” by a senior backbencher over her claim it will be partly financed by a “Brexit dividend”. The five-year deal will see NHS England’s budget rise from £115bn this year to £135bn by 2023-24. Other chief executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that patients’ waiting times for A&amp;E care and planned operations in hospital would continue to lengthen despite the extra money, a lack of beds and staff would see the service continue to struggle to cope with fast-rising demand and operations were highly likely to be cancelled again next winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/19/europe-progressive-far-right-eu-liberal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T18:01:46Z","webTitle":"Europe’s democrats must unite to prevent a far-right takeover | Natalie Nougayrède","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/europe-progressive-far-right-eu-liberal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/europe-progressive-far-right-eu-liberal","fields":{"headline":"Europe’s democrats must unite to prevent a far-right takeover","bodyText":"The battle lines are now drawn for Europe’s ultimate test: the May 2019 elections for the European parliament. That’s when far-right and populist parties will attempt to complete their power grab in the EU. In the elections of 2014, they made gains. Next year, they’ll seek to dominate. The dramatic events we’ve witnessed over the past fortnight, in Germany and Italy have been a mere foretaste of the showdown that lies ahead. It’s often said that anti-establishment and nationalist parties want to dismantle the European project altogether. But what’s at stake is more likely to be a full-on effort to redraw it to their liking. The migration issue is the starting point of a continental power struggle pitching two very different versions of the principles that should bind Europe together. One is liberal democratic, and attuned to the notion of an open society; the other is fortress-minded, illiberal and intolerant. This has global implications: anti-EU leaders in Washington and Moscow want to reap their own rewards from the mayhem – which they are playing their own part in fomenting.

First, there was a far-right show of strength in Italy (the first EU founding state to be run by a far-right dominated government), as the Aquarius migrant rescue ship was turned away. Next, the 31-year-old Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who governs alongside the Freedom party, an institution created in the 1950s by former Nazis, heralded the creation of a new “axis of the willing” in Europe, comprising like-minded populists in Italy and Hungary. Then came an assault on the power of Angela Merkel in Berlin. The chancellor has now been given a two-week ultimatum by her own federal minister of the interior, Horst Seehofer, leader of the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union, a party that has absorbed just about all of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland rhetoric on migrants. The EU summit scheduled for the end of this month, and destined to dominated by the subject of immigration, is likely to be an acrimonious shambles. To top it all off, from across the Atlantic Donald Trump decided the occasion warranted one of the most provocative tweets of his presidency. In an intervention unprecedented for a US leader, Trump appeared to relish the possibility of Merkel’s downfall, writing: “The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.” Trump had earlier given the nod to irredentism in Europe, in claiming: “Crimea is Russia because people there speak Russian.” Who else will have heard that message loud and clear: far-right Hungarian irredentists perhaps, who still dream of a Greater Hungary stretching beyond current borders? One could be forgiven for quoting Yeats: “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.” “Axis”, with its second world war connotations, is perhaps an innocent choice of words by Kurz – or perhaps not. An ideological nexus does connect him to Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Seehofer in Bavaria and Matteo Salvini in Italy. Look at the map, and what emerges is the shaping of a core transalpine and Danubian Europe of the far-right and nationalist conservatism. With elections due in October in Seehofer’s powerful southern regional German state, and the Austrian presidency of the EU Council starting on 1 July, Catholic-dominated, German-speaking regions of Europe look set to define much of the debate about Europe’s future. Trump may well be oblivious to the minutiae and dark symbolism. But be sure that Vladimir Putin isn’t. Some of these political forces have a track record of closeness to Russia’s strongman. The far-right Freedom party, to take one example, has a formal partnership with the Kremlin-sponsored United Russia party, and regularly calls for the lifting of EU sanctions – just as Seehofer does. Meanwhile, in the midst of his World Cup extravaganza, Putin is reportedly awaiting a call from Washington soon to set up a meeting with Trump – a summit Kurz would like to host in Vienna. What Seehofer, Orbán and others are gearing up for is an overthrow of the values of the liberal order within the EU. They want to mould it according to their conservative Christian, nation-centered beliefs, and they see the west as being under assault from non-white and Muslim threats and migration. This was a vision also laid out by Trump, remember, in his 2017 Warsaw speech. They don’t want to break up Europe, they want to take control of it. The “axis” will grow branches in Poland’s populist-led government and in parts of the Balkans. These people may not agree on everything, (for example, Salvini wants compulsory EU relocation plans for refugees, which Orbán rejects) but their interests are sufficiently aligned to make this the perfect moment to launch a common assault on EU institutions. The “axis” aims to get rid of Merkel and seize control of the European People’s party (EPP), which has dominated the EU parliament for years and encompasses all the mainstream rightwing forces. The EPP has been a vehicle for Merkel’s hegemony over the EU all these years, which is one of the reasons she has always refrained from chucking out Orbán and his Fidesz party. These leaders are now uniting to attempt a national-populist takeover of the EU as we’ve known it. Merkel is only the first target in a wider endeavour. And don’t be fooled by talk of an utterly powerless EU parliament: it does matter if the populists gain control, because the parliament has co-decision powers on legislation, alongside the council of ministers. Orbán, who’s arguably the most outspoken about this, made the strategy abundantly clear in a speech last week. He suggested the EPP would need to change if it wanted to survive, and threatened to set up a new, “pan-European anti-immigration formation” if the EPP isn’t ready to be renewed on his terms. What’s to be done? The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Merkel (if she survives the coming weeks in power) will try to peel away some parts of the “axis”. Macron has already courted Kurz in the Elysée palace, despite his association with the far right. On Tuesday Macron met Merkel at a castle north of Berlin to try to showcase a plan for eurozone consolidation. The news coming out of Europe isn’t all bad. Spain has a new, centre-left government. The EU’s economy is also doing better, and polls show growing support for it among citizens. But for the democratic-minded across Europe, now is the time to make a clear choice. There’s no need to be obsessed with history to know that, when the “rough beast” slouches, “its hour come round at last” (Yeats again), surely anti-far-right forces must unite. Given the context, hard-left clashes with centrists become something of a distraction. And criticism of the EU’s institutional “democratic deficit” is currently a sideshow. Let’s protect what we have. On 14 June, in the European parliament, the far left and the far right voted together against a resolution calling for the release of political prisoners in Russia. Would they likewise have voted together against a call for the release of migrant children held in cages by Trump’s America? Some people need to get their priorities right, before it’s too late. • Natalie Nougayrède is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/19/europe-north-america-nato-storm-political-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T09:06:30Z","webTitle":"Europe and North America need to stay united – now more than ever | Jens Stoltenberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/europe-north-america-nato-storm-political-risk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/19/europe-north-america-nato-storm-political-risk","fields":{"headline":"Europe and North America need to stay united – now more than ever","bodyText":"“I believe that in the North Atlantic treaty lies the best, if not the only hope of peace.” Not my words, but the words of Lord Hastings Ismay, former military assistant to Winston Churchill and the very first secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). In the same 1952 broadcast, Ismay predicted “that there will be persistent efforts to drive a wedge between us” and “that we shall have our little quarrels”. Right now, those words seem remarkably prescient. Since the alliance was created almost 70 years ago, the people of Europe and North America have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. But, at the political level, the ties that bind us are under strain. There are real differences between the US and other allies over issues such as trade, climate change and the Iran nuclear agreement. These disagreements are real and they won’t disappear overnight. Nowhere is it written in stone that the transatlantic bond will always thrive. That doesn’t, however, mean that its breakdown is inevitable. We can maintain it, and all the mutual benefits we derive from it. It will take political will, imagination and hard work. But I believe we can succeed, for three simple reasons. Firstly, differences of opinion are nothing new. We had them during the Suez crisis in 1956. We had them when France withdrew from Nato’s command structure in 1966, and the alliance had to move its headquarters from Paris to Brussels. And we had them during the Iraq war in 2003. We are 29 democracies with different histories, geographies and cultures, so of course we sometimes disagree. But the historical record shows that, despite our differences, we have always been able to unite around our common goal: standing together and protecting each other. The second reason we can preserve the transatlantic bond is what is happening in Nato today. After the cold war, when the threat from the Soviet Union receded, the US and Canada gradually reduced their presence in Europe, and European allies cut defence spending. This was the so-called “peace dividend” enjoyed by allies on both sides of the Atlantic. But both those trends are now firmly in reverse. The US and Canada are stepping up their commitment to Europe’s security. In fact, since coming to office, the Trump administration has increased funding for the US presence in Europe by 40%. The last US battle tank left Europe in 2013, but now they are back in the form of a whole new US armoured brigade. This isn’t a one-way street. European allies, with the UK in the vanguard, are stepping up, too – spending billions more on defence and taking responsibility for Euro-Atlantic security alongside their North American allies. The third and final reason I am hopeful the political storm clouds will pass is that it is in our profound interest to stay united. Two world wars and a cold war have taught us this: together, Europe and North America are stronger, safer and more prosperous. That is why young American and Canadian soldiers fought on the western front in the first world war, and why their sons fought their way across the beaches of Normandy almost 30 years later. It is also why allies invoked article 5 of the Nato Treaty – our collective defence clause – just hours after the 9/11 attacks, the first and only time in our history. And why hundreds of thousands of European and Canadian troops have served shoulder to shoulder with Americans in Afghanistan to defeat international terrorism, with more than a thousand paying the ultimate price. It is – and has always been – in our fundamental interest to stand together on defence. And that is as true now as ever. Because we face the most unpredictable security environment in a generation: international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cyberattacks – and, of course, a Russia that has used force against its neighbours, that tries to meddle in our domestic affairs, and that seems to have no qualms about using military-grade nerve agents on our streets. I believe that we, as the west, must be confident. We must continue to work hard to settle our differences – and where differences persist, we must limit any negative impact on our security cooperation. We must continue to protect multilateral institutions like Nato, and continue to stand up for the international rules that have served us so well for so many decades. In that broadcast, more than 65 years ago, Ismay also warned that “we must never be complacent” and that “the road may be rough”. North America and Europe represent half the world’s economic might and half the world’s military might. Our achievements side by side are unprecedented. So as long as we stand together, even if the road does indeed get rough, it will always lead in the right direction: peace and security for our nations and our nearly one billion citizens. • Jens Stoltenberg is the secretary general of Nato"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/19/bulldoze-or-rebuild-architects-at-odds-over-future-of-glasgow-school-of-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T09:59:04Z","webTitle":"Bulldoze or rebuild?

Architects at odds over future of Glasgow School of Art","bodyText":"The smoke has barely cleared over the blackened carcass of the Glasgow School of Art, which was gutted by a fire on Friday night, but the architecture world is already alight with debate about what should come next. To many, Glasgow without Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s finest work is unthinkable: his masterpiece must be reconstructed stone by stone, no matter the cost. But the extent of the destruction from the fire, which appears to have left only the stone facades standing, have led others to call for a new building to take its place. “From what I’ve seen, restoration is not an option,” argues Alan Dunlop, a Glasgow-based architect and alumnus of the Mack. “We’d be talking about replication, which is totally against what Mackintosh stood for. He was an innovator, working at the cutting edge. He would want to see a new school of art fit for the 21st century.” Dunlop fears that replicating the building would risk “turning it into a museum piece”, with the needs of tourists put ahead of students. “Before the first fire in 2014, the famous library had already become a museum,” he says. “The school used it for fundraising dinners, and students had to make an appointment if they wanted to go in. I argued then that we should make a new library fit for students’ needs, and I believe the same is true now for the whole building.” He has called for an international design competition, with the stipulation that the shortlist should include a Scottish architect “as a serious entry, not just a token gesture to make up the numbers”. Mackintosh was in his 20s when he designed the first phase of the school, he adds, and there are young architects capable of creating something just as powerful now. To many Mackintosh experts and conservation architects alike, Dunlop’s talk is anathema. “I see no argument for why you wouldn’t rebuild the school of art as it was,” says Roger Billcliffe, author of a number of definitive books about Mackintosh. “It has been voted Britain’s most important building several times over, and we have all of the information needed to recreate every detail, following extensive laser surveys after the first fire. People are saying, ‘Let’s get a good modern architect instead,’ but we’ve already had one in theory, and we got that Steven Holl monstrosity across the road.” Holl’s green-tinged glass extension of 2013 has been widely criticised, looming opposite the Mackintosh building with all the elegance of a discarded fridge. It won Private Eye’s Sir Hugh Casson award in 2014 for the worst new building of the year, and was damned as a “crude and insufferably arrogant essay in minimalist neo-modernism”. Despite Mackintosh’s meticulous details and sophisticated spatial sequences, Billcliffe argues that the school of art would not be difficult to rebuild. He says that most of the conservation analysis has already been done, and that much of the replacement woodwork for the library had yet to be installed, and is safely stored in the carpenters’ workshops in Edinburgh. The Glasgow School of Art declined to comment. “Compared to some of Mackintosh’s other buildings, there’s not a lot of fancy footwork in the art school,” he adds. “There were one or two set pieces, made of stone or metal – and who knows, they might have survived. After all, they managed to salvage most of the metal light fittings after the first fire.” Careful excavation is crucial. Julian Harrap, the conservation architect behind the critically acclaimed rebirth of the Neues Museum in Berlin, who has years of experience dealing with fire-ravaged buildings, says the most important next step is sifting through whatever remains inside the charred shell. “There will be piles of material lying at the bottom of the building that can be easily repaired and reused,” he says. “Think of Mackintosh’s metal work: every door had hinges, locks, push plates, the most fantastic material, which could still be there. There will be very big timber beams, too, which is a resource that can still be used, even in a different way.” Harrap is emphatic that building an exact replica is not the right way forward. “It would be a disgrace to our profession,” he says. “The idea of knocking it down and building something entirely new is equally unacceptable. We have to tread this fragile middle ground. I believe the shell of the building can be retained, with a very simple interior, with memories of Mackintosh where they’re available. The position of the windows all related to internal volumes, so you already get a framework of the spaces that were once there.” He thinks the school should acquire the adjoining sites, which were also damaged by the fire, where additional facilities could be constructed “to satisfy the needs of a modern art school, rather than trying to shoehorn everything into the reconstructed shell”. This is the approach Harrap took, with architect David Chipperfield, at the Neues Museum, combining immaculate restoration with visible scars of bomb damage and striking new additions – to widespread praise. If done well, it could be brilliant. If bodged, it could be another act of reckless “facadism”, an insult to Mackintosh by keeping his hollow stone mask as a redundant husk of history. “The building is simply too special to do anything other than rebuild it,” says Tony Barton, chairman of Donald Insall Associates, the practice that led the restoration of Windsor Castle following a severe fire in 1992. “There is not one single technical reason why it cannot be fully restored. There are very few buildings in the world for which you can argue for total reconstruction, but this is one of them. It’s not just about the facade: Mackintosh designed every corner of the thing down to every last detail. Even the back stairs were beautiful.” Some fragments may yet emerge from the ashes, if enough time is taken to sift through the site with forensic care. A pair of distinctive wrought iron finials still rise triumphantly above the burnt-out wreck, two floral orbs each crowned with a bird, standing as a defiant symbol on the horizon. “It’s as if Mackintosh is saying, ‘I haven’t brought to my knees yet,’” says Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society. “‘I’m still here, and I won’t be bulldozed that easily.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/jun/19/brexit-grieve-says-defeat-for-may-on-meaningful-vote-will-not-bring-down-government-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T15:51:14Z","webTitle":"Chris Grayling survives no confidence vote in House of Commons - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jun/19/brexit-grieve-says-defeat-for-may-on-meaningful-vote-will-not-bring-down-government-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jun/19/brexit-grieve-says-defeat-for-may-on-meaningful-vote-will-not-bring-down-government-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Chris Grayling survives no confidence vote in House of Commons - Politics live","bodyText":"Labour has said that Chris Grayling’s credibility as transport secretary will “never recover” in the light of the recent rail timetable chaos. Opening a debate on an opposition day motion of no confidence in Grayling, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: I am afraid the breach of faith and trust is so great that the secretary of state’s credibility will never recover. There comes a point where the publicly accountable politician in charge of the railways should step up and shoulder the blame. It seems to me, and I suspect to many rail users, that we have more than reached that. But Grayling hit back saying Labour’s policy was “confused”. He said: For years the opposition have demanded that the railways are re-nationalised and run by the Government and they’ve claimed they’d be run much better if they were. Now it appears they think the railways are already run by the Government and if something goes wrong it’s down to us. The Labour motion was defeated by a majority of 20. But Conservative MPs did not turn out to support Grayling in large numbers, and Labour has obtained some useful local newspaper ammunition to use against Tory MPs in areas affected by the rail chaos who will now have explain why they voted against a motion saying Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway should have their franchises terminated. Grayling has said he will seriously consider taking new powers to intervene to protect commuters affected by travel disruption. In the debate Sir Michael Fallon, the Conservative former defence secretary, asked him: Given that, whatever the ownership, these are essential public services getting our constituents to work and getting their children to school. Would [Grayling] consider taking stronger powers for himself in times of disruption that would allow him to direct the rail operators to work more closely together or to put additional stops in to help those who simply can’t get to work in the morning? Grayling replied: “This is something we will have to look at very seriously indeed.” A leak of the draft conclusions from next week’s EU summit says that “no substantial progress” has been made on the Irish backstop plan and that EU states should intensify preparations for a no deal Brexit, the Financial Times’ George Parker has reported. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. There was a mistake in the original post at 4.12pm about the Ashcroft polling. It suggests a majority of leave voters would rather choose Brexit than keeping the UK together, not a majority of all voters. I’ve corrected that now. Sorry. MPs are voting now on the Labour motion of no confidence in Chris Grayling, the transport secretary. Appropriately enough, there has been a delay. Eleanor Laing, the deputy speaker, is in the chair and she says there has been a hold-up because of a lift that was full in one of the buildings on the parliament estate, delaying an MP in a wheelchair trying to get to the chamber to vote. After (in her own words) filibustering from the chair for a bit, to give extra time for the MP to arrive, she announces that it’s time to shut the doors to the division lobbies. Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chairman turned polling guru, has published a lengthy report, based on polls and focus groups, looking at public attitudes to Brexit and the union. There is a summary here and the full 50-page report is here (pdf). There is a lot of interesting material in it. Here are four of the key findings. 1 - British voters are more likely to favour leaving the customs union than avoiding a hard border in Ireland, the poll suggests. This is particularly true of Conservative voters. Here is the historian Robert Saunders on this finding. 2 - A majority of voters in Northern Ireland think Brexit has made Irish unification more likely, the poll suggests. Presumably these 59% are in a better position to judge than the 27% of GB voters who think Irish unification has become more likely. 3 - A majority of leave voters (63%) would, if forced to choose, prefer to go ahead with Brexit than to keep England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland together in the United Kingdom, the poll suggests. That figure is even higher amongst Conservative leave voters (73%), even though the Conservatives pride themselves on being the Conservative and Unionist party. 4 - More than a third of voters would support continuing the transition up to 2023 if that was needed to ensure the right post-Brexit arrangements are in place, the poll suggests. Here are two Brexit-related blogs that are well worth reading. Patrick Maguire at the New Statesman says the government is likely to win the vote on the EU withdrawal bill tomorrow. Accounting for the nine or so Labour MPs who will likely either vote with the government or abstain tomorrow, Grieve will need around 14 Conservative MPs to defy the whip if his amendment is to pass. Here is where it gets tricky: beyond himself, Anna Soubry, Ken Clarke, Sarah Wollaston and a couple of others, such as the recently resigned Philip Lee, Grieve cannot count on anywhere near that many of his colleagues as a matter of course. Nor can the bill be amended by the usual suspects alone. The best illustration of this is the Daily Telegraph front page which coined the “mutineers” descriptor for Tory rebels last November. Most of the MPs pictured did not then have a reputation as rebels or dyed-in-the-wool Europhiles but had been convinced that aspects of the bill needed improving for the sake of the national interest. The problem for Grieve now is selling the meaningful vote as one such necessary improvement. I understand it is proving difficult. “They won’t have the numbers,” one of those MPs pictured on the Telegraph front page told me yesterday. “Most of us think the government’s amendment is fine. Dominic is a great legal mind, but politically, he’s got this all wrong.” Gary Gibbon on his Channel 4 News blog says Sajid Javid is delaying the immigration white paper. The bill itself outlining the shape of post-Brexit immigration policy is seen by some as a card the UK needs to play in the negotiations on a future relationship. To the annoyance of David Davis and others, those discussions look to some like they could take part during the transition period and not much will necessarily be tidied up by the end of this year as the withdrawal agreement is ratified. For some that opens up the alarming possibility that the government could be thinking of conceding ground on immigration policy as part of the negotiation on a future relationship. One senior Vote Leave figure believes that the government’s chief negotiator is working towards a plan that ties Britain into something that looks an awful lot like freedom of movement beside a plan to stay in something a lot like the customs union and the single market for goods. Theresa May has, of course, ruled that out but some Vote Leave veterans aren’t her biggest admirers. Petrochemical giant Ineos has lost its legal challenge to the Scottish government’s effective “ban” on fracking, the Press Association reports. Ineos and Aberdeen firm ReachCSG took Scottish ministers to court seeking a judicial review of their decision to convert a moratorium on the controversial gas extraction technique into an indefinite, effective ban. They had asked the court of session to declare that Scottish ministers acted unlawfully in doing so, arguing they exceeded their powers and lacked the legal competence to impose such a ban. However during the hearing in May, the Scottish Government lawyer suggested ministers had simply announced a preferred stance on the matter and the policy-making process on the issue should be allowed to continue. As the Press Association reports, in his ruling, published today, Lord Pentland found that, as a matter of law, there is no prohibition against fracking in Scotland. He said the Ineos stance was based on a “series of fundamental misunderstandings of the Scottish government’s position” and refused the challenge. Prospect magazine has published some interesting polling on how the Conservative party is perceived. It is not very flattering. Here are some of the key figures. Anna Soubry, one of the Conservative pro-Europeans who have rebelled over the EU withdrawal bill, thinks MailOnline are out to undermine her ahead of tomorrow’s Commons showdown on the “meaningful vote”. Here is Hannah Deacon responding with emotion as she hears the news live on ITV that Sajid Javid is granting a licence for her son, Alfie Dingley, for cannabis oil. (See 1.05pm.) Sajid Javid has shown fresh evidence of his willingness to overturn Theresa May’s legacy at the Home Office by announcing a review of the medicinal use of cannabis. In a statement to the Commons, he said that the current rules were “not satisfactory” and that he supported the parents of children like Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell who, in trying to obtain cannabis oil for their epileptic children, were “following a gut parental instinct to do whatever is in their power to try and alleviate their child’s suffering”. Announcing the review, he said: The government review will take place in 2 parts. Part one of the commission will consider the evidence available for the medicinal and therapeutic benefits of cannabis-based medicines. Professor Sally Davies, who also serves as the chief medical officer, will take this part forward. This would then inform exactly which forms of cannabis or cannabis-based medicines should be taken forward in Part 2. Part 2 will be led by the advisory council on the misuse of drugs (ACMD). The ACMD will not reassess the evidence issued by Professor Sally Davies, but will provide an assessment, based on the balance of harms and public health needs, of what, if anything, should be rescheduled. If the review identified that there are significant medical benefits then we do intend to reschedule. We have seen in recent months that there is a pressing need to allow those who might benefit from cannabis-based products to access them. Javid’s announcement was welcomed by MPs from all sides in the Commons, with the Tory Sir Desmond Swayne telling him: “Clinical leadership may have its place but for years the crying need has been for political leadership, so can I thank [Javid] ... for providing it.” Javid announced the review only 24 hours after May, his predecessor but one as home secretary, played down the need for a review, saying there was a “very good reason” for the current rules being in place. In his short period in office Javid has already abandoned May’s policy on visa rules for doctors coming to work in the UK from outside the EU and distanced himself from her “hostile environment” rhetoric on illegal immigration, and today’s move will be seen as further evidence that he is asserting his independence and authority in a way that will boost his chances in a future Conservative leadership contest. But the government has rejected a call from William Hague, the former Conservative party leader, to legalise cannabis. Michel Barnier has told Theresa May that “trust does not fall from the sky”, in response to Britain’s attempt to maintain access to the European Union’s security databases while leaving the institutions that provide checks and balances to prevent their misuse. The government “cannot accept” a Lords amendment giving parliament a “meaningful vote” on a Brexit deal, and will re-table its rejected version, Downing Street has said, setting up a final showdown with Tory rebels on the issue this week. Conservative rebels are not trying to “collapse the government” but a “meaningful vote” before leaving the EU may help to avoid a crisis moment, the leading pro-European backbencher Dominic Grieve has said. The Office for National Statistics has published figures showing that non-UK EU nationals make up more than a quarter of the construction workforce in London. As the Press Association reports, the ONS found 28% of those employed in the industry in the capital are from one of the 27 other EU member states. Nationally, around one in 14 construction workers are non-UK EU citizens - referred to as EU27 nationals. According to Sky’s Lewis Goodall, government sources are saying Theresa May was not resistant to Sajid Javid’s decision to review the law on the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes - even though yesterday May sounded distinctly unenthusiastic about the whole idea. Javid’s announcement is winning support from MPs from all sides in the Commons. Here are tweets from MPs who are backing his decision. From Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary From the Conservative MP Bob Seely From the Conservative MP George Freeman From the Labour MP Stephen Doughty From the SNP’s Tommy Sheppard This is from Tim Colbourne, policy director at Open Reason, Nick Clegg’s thinktank, on the announcement. Javid says that he wants “action now” on this matter, not at some point far ahead in the future. Here is ITV’s Robert Peston on Sajid Javid’s announcement. Here is the start of the Press Association story about Javid’s statement. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has announced a review of the medicinal use of cannabis which could lead to patients in the UK being prescribed drugs derived from the banned plant. Javid announced the move in a statement to the House of Commons in the wake of a series of appeals from parents who want their children to be able to access medications which can alleviate epilepsy and other illnesses. The home secretary announced that he had authorised a licence to be issued on Tuesday for six-year-old Alfie Dingley, after his mother said she had been waiting three months for prime minister Theresa May to fulfil a personal assurance that he would be allowed to receive cannabis oil. Speaking to the House of Commons, Javid stressed that the class B drug would remain banned for recreational use. Javid says Sally Davies has said she can complete her work “in days”. Javid says it is estimated that there are around 10,000 children in the UK who have a drug-resistant form of epilepsy. On the Today programme this morning Hannah Deacon, the mother of Alfie Dingley, the six-year-old with epilepsy, said that Theresa May had told her three months ago that her request for her son to be allowed to be treated with cannabis oil would be resolved quickly and on “a compassionate basis”. But Deacon said that the family had faced “hurdles after hurdles after hurdles” in seeking to get a permit for him to be treated with cannabis oil legally in the UK. Deacon told the programme: I met the prime minister on March 20 in Number 10. I appealed to her directly. She looked at me. She met my son and she told me that they would find a way in which our clinicians could be issued with a Schedule 1 licence to give my son the medicine that he had in Holland. I believed her. She also answered questions at PMQs and she said to MPs that our application would be allowed on compassionate basis and it would be dealt with speedily. That was three months ago. All that we have been put through is bureaucracy, hurdles - hurdles after hurdles after hurdles - changes in what they want, saying to us ‘This isn’t good enough but we can’t tell you what we want because if we did it would be doing it for you’. This has never been done in this country. No physician in this country has applied for a schedule 1 licence. We don’t know how to do it we need you to tell us but they wouldn’t. We have done this wrangling for three months of how to do it. The application is now in. They need to give us a decision. The prime minister said to me she would help us provide this medication for my son. That is what needs to happen. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, welcomes Javid’s announcement. In response to her, Javid says the law in this area cannot be changed overnight. But once the review has concluded, the government will be able to act quickly. He says he is sorry that Alfie Dingley’s mother has had to wait so long to get her cannabis oil. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, says over the weekend he issued an emergency licence to allow Billy Caldwell to have cannabis oil for medical purposes. He says the government now needs to look more closely at the use of cannabis-based medicines in the healthcare situation. The current situation is not satisfactory, he says. Javid says he will review how cannabis is scheduled as a drug. But this is not the first step towards legalising it, he says. The review is just about looking at its medical benefits. Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, will review how cannabis can be used for medical purposes, he says. On the basis of her findings, a second stage of the review will consider the case for rescheduling cannabis-based products. Javid says the review will start within a week. He says a licence to allow Alfie Dingley to access cannabis oil will be released today. Damian Green, the former first secretary of state and Theresa May ally, told the Daily Politics that he would not use the phrase “Brexit dividend” (which May used yesterday to explain where the extra money for the NHS would come from). He said he did not know whether or not there would be such a dividend. The Labour MP Chuka Umunna has put out this statement about the Michel Barnier speech (see 11.09am) on behalf of the People’s Vote campaign, which is demanding a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Umunna said: It is now plain that Theresa May’s Red Lines – which were never discussed in the referendum campaign – now threaten the safety and security of Britain. Refusing to participate in a cross-European court is going to mean our police and security services are going to be weakened. Sir Christopher Chope, the Conservative MP who blocked the private member’s bill banning upskirting, is on Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show. Chope says that this has been a difficult period for him. But that is a reasonable price to pay for standing up for principle, he says. He says he was standing up for the principle that bills should be debated. This one was government-supported, but the government was trying to sneak it through without a debate. He says he is glad the government is now bringing forward its own bill. Q: You try stop all private members’ bills, don’t you? Chope says that is not fair. Q: Why did you object to a bill that would have protected police dogs being stabbed? Chope says on Friday there were 26 bills that could not be debated through lack of time. He objected to the way the government was using bills to bring forward measures without discussion. Q: It is undemocratic for you to block something most people want, isn’t it? Chope says on Friday there were only a small number of MPs in the Commons. And the government often blocks bills itself, he says. He says the government wanted to leapfrog other private members’ bill in the list. Q: What do you say to people who claim you think upskirting is acceptable? Chope says we all find upskirting offensive and disgusting. As a result of what he did, the government will legislate. He says he has done a good turn to Gina Martin and others campaigning for this measure. Chope says blocking upskirting bill ended up helping the campaigners who wanted it. The Labour peer Andrew Adonis posted this on Twitter this morning. At the Number 10 lobby briefing, asked if Theresa May was confident about voting down the Lords “meaningful vote” amendment to the EU withdrawal bill in the Commons tomorrow afternoon, her spokesman said the Lords had agreed with the Commons on the majority of issues. He went on: But we cannot accept the amendment on meaningful vote agreed in the Lords. Agreeing to amendable motions would allow parliament to direct government on its approach to exiting the EU, binding the prime minister’s hands and making it harder to secure a good deal for the UK. It also does not meet the reasonable tests set out last week by the prime minister and the secretary of state of exiting the European Union that any new amendment must respect the referendum result, cannot undermine the negotiations or change the constitutional role of parliament and government. Our original amendment struck the right balance between respecting the tests set out by the government as well as delivering on the aims of Dominic Grieve’s own amendment. That’s why we will be re-tabling our original amendment today and will look to overturn the Lords decision tomorrow. The Brexit department has not formally responded to the Michel Barnier speech yet, but a source there suggests taking a look at this Twitter thread from Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at Essex University. Peers is commenting on the European commission’s paper on policing and criminal law cooperation published yesterday, which was the basis of Barnier’s speech. Peers thinks some of the EU’s assertions are highly dubious. Here is the start of the thread. And this is how it concludes. Marcus Fysh, a Conservative MP who voted leave in the EU referendum, has described the proposals in the Michel Barnier speech as “reasonable”. At the morning lobby briefing Downing Street confirmed that the government will not accept the amendment on a “meaningful vote” passed by the Lords yesterday, my colleague Peter Walker reports. William Hague, the former Conservative leader and former foreign secretary, has urged the government to legalise cannabis. He has made the argument in his Daily Telegraph column (paywall) and we have written it up here. This morning the Home Office has rejected Hague’s proposal. A spokesperson said the government had “no intention” of reviewing the classification of cannabis, which would remain a class B drug, adding: Any debate within government about the medicinal and therapeutic benefits of cannabis-based medicines does not extend to any review regarding the classification of cannabis and the penalties for the illicit possession, cultivation and trafficking of cannabis will remain the same. Here are the main points from Michel Barnier’s speech. Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said the UK would not be able to access EU-only or Schengen-only databases after Brexit. We are open to exchanging information on passengers contained in passenger name records with the UK authorities. But let’s be clear: based on the UK’s positions, our cooperation will need to be organised differently. It will rely on effective and reciprocal exchanges, but not on access to EU-only or Schengen-only databases. Barnier also said there would have to be “effective exchange of information” between the UK and EU countries after Brexit, including with Europol, the EU police agency, and Eurojust, the EU judicial cooperation unit. He said the UK would be invited to send a liaison prosecutor and liason officers to these agencies. He said the British government was wrong to think it could preserve all the benefits of current security cooperation with the EU after Brexit. He called for “more realism” from London. To negotiate an ambitious new relationship with the UK, which we all want, we need more realism on what is possible and what is not when a country is outside of the EU’s area of justice, freedom and security and outside of Schengen ... This is our offer. While we are constrained by the UK’s red lines, it is a fair offer. It reflects our strong commitment to address our common challenges. Some in the UK would like to go further. They want to maintain all the benefits of the current relationship, while leaving the EU regulatory, supervision, and application framework. And they try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It would mean wasting time we don’t have. In this field of internal security, it is particularly hard to speak about what will no longer be possible. But we have, I have, to speak the truth. He said the UK would not be able to take part in the European arrest warrant scheme after Brexit. We know that the UK is not ready to accept the free movement of people, the jurisdiction of the court and the charter of fundamental rights – for the charter, this was confirmed last week by the House of Commons. This means that the UK cannot take part in the European arrest warrant. But the EU and the UK would still want to cooperate on extradition after Brexit, he said. We are ready to build on the existing council of Europe convention, to which all member states have signed up. For instance we could envisage streamlining the procedure, facilitating processes, introducing time-limits. This is very much needed. He said the UK would be able to cooperate with Europol and Eurojust after Brexit. For example, it would be able to participate in “Europol analysis projects dealing with live investigations”. But it would not be able to shape the strategic direction of these agencies, or take part in management board meetings. He said the EU would expect the UK to remain party to the European convention on human rights after Brexit. He said the EU wanted the UK’s data protection standards to remain in line with its own after Brexit. He said the European parliament would “have the last word” on Brexit. That seemed a subtle attempt to embarrass Theresa May ahead of tomorrow’s “meaningful vote” debate. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, is making a Commons statement on drug licensing at 12.30pm. Labour whips think a U-turn may be in the offing. This is from Bloomberg’s Ian Wishart. Here is one of the key extracts from the speech, where Michel Barnier explains why the UK will not be able to cooperate with EU countries on security after Brexit in much the same as it does now. This is very problematic for the UK government, because most of what it is proposing on security cooperation after Brexit involves, as far as possible, the continuation of the status quo. Barnier said: The UK has decided to leave the EU’s institutions, structures and safeguards. It will be a third country outside Schengen and outside the EU’s legal order. This is a fact. And facts have consequences. The UK’s recent paper on security expresses a desire to keep the benefits of EU membership. This is understandable when you look at what we have achieved together as a union in internal security together ... Is there another region in the world where sovereign states built together a common area without internal border controls? Where citizens enjoy free movement and security and can avail of shared institutions to make sure their fundamental rights are protected? This cooperation is both, in fact, unique and unprecedented. And it is made possible by the trust between member states. This trust does not fall from the sky. There is no magic wand. As I said in Lisbon, in front of the Federation for European Law [in this speech], this trust is founded on an ecosystem based on common rules and safeguards, shared decisions, joint supervision and implementation, and a common court of justice. If you leave this ecosystem, you lose the benefits of this cooperation. You are a third country because you have decided to be so. And you need to build a new relationship. The full text of the Barnier speech is here. I will post a detailed summary shortly. Here is some more comment on the Barnier speech. From Sky’s Lewis Goodall And this is from Camino Mortera from the Centre for European Reform thinktank. Here is Laurence Norman from the Wall Street Journal on the Barnier speech. Daniel Ferrie, Michel Barnier’s press officer, has tweeted out some quotes from the Barnier speech. He says the EU will propose a strong partnership with the EU after Brexit. He says he has to leave the conference now. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, will be speaking at the conference later, he confirms. Barnier says the European parliament will “have the last word” on the matter. (That sounded like a subtle dig at the British, in the light of Theresa May’s opposition to the “meaningful vote” amendment.) And that’s it. I’ll post a summary soon. Barnier says he and his team are still working with the British on finalising the withdrawal agreement. About 75% of it is finalised, he says. But there is “much work to do” before the EU summit in June, or the summit in October, which will be “the last stage” for an agreement, he says. Barnier says European countries are far stronger as members of a united EU. Barnier says the UK will be expected to continue to be bound by the European convention on human rights after Brexit if it expects to collaborate with the EU. As my colleague Daniel Boffey reports, this was a theme of the slides issued yesterday. Barnier says the EU is constrained by the UK’s red lines. Taking that into account, the EU’s offer is a fair offer. He says some in Britain want all the current benefits of cooperation. That is not possible. But some in Britain blame the EU for the consequences of the decision they have taken. The UK decided to leave the EU, he says. He regrets the decision, but accepts it. He says if they want to build a new relationship, they need goodwill. But they also need “more realism about what is possible”, he says. Barnier says the UK will not be part of the European arrest warrant after Brexit. But there will be cooperation, he says. Barnier says he wants to see cooperation between EU and British law enforcement agencies after Brexit. But the UK will not be able to shape the strategic direction of relevant bodies, he says. He says it will not be allowed to attend meetings of the Eurojust or Europol management boards. Barnier says he wants there to be effective exchange of information between the UK and the EU after Brexit in relation to police and judicial cooperation. But that will not be allowed on the same basis as now, he says. He says the UK will not be allowed access to EU-only or Schengen-only databases. UK will not be allowed access to EU-only or Schengen-only police databases after Brexit, says Barnier. Barnier says there is a need for “more realism” on what is possible in the field of police and judicial cooperation after Brexit when the UK becomes a third country. He means “more realism” from the British, obviously. Barnier calls for “more realism” from UK on what degree of police and judicial cooperation will be possible after Brexit. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, is giving a speech now on police and judicial cooperation after Brexit. He is speaking at a conference in Vienna and there is a live stream here. Yesterday the European commission publishes slides (pdf) setting out its stance on this issue. Tomorrow Theresa May faces a difficult vote in the Commons as the EU withdrawal bill nears the end of its passage through parliament and MPs are asked to resolve the one outstanding area of dispute - whether the bill should include the robust “meaningful vote” amendment which would allow MPs to vote on what should happen next if they have not approved a Brexit withdrawal agreement by January. On the Today programme this morning Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general who has leading the Tory rebels pushing for a proper meaningful vote, insisted that if May loses, that will not bring down the government. When it was put to him that if he were to win tomorrow, that might collapse the government, he replied: Of course not. It’s complete nonsense. This is the end stage of the consideration of the details of a piece of legislation. Whichever way the vote ultimately goes, the idea that the government is going to be endangered by this difference of view within the House of Commons, which might lead to its defeat, is complete nonsense. Grieve said that, when he used the phrase “we could collapse the government” in an interview at the weekend, he was talking about what might happen if the final Brexit withdrawal agreement were rejected. He said the whole point of his “meaningful vote” amendment was to stop that happening. He explained: One of the reasons I’ve supported [the amendment] is precisely to avoid the sort of crisis a government would immediately collapse [if MPs rejected the Brexit withdrawal agreement] ... By having a mechanism by which the House of Commons can express a view, without for example moving to a motion of no confidence which could collapse the government, that way we can give ourselves time both to influence the government and to think of what best to do next. All of us must hope that this does not happen. But there is a risk it will happen, and if we have no deal at the very end, it is a very serious crisis. Some Tory MPs have argued that there is no need for the “meaningful vote” amendment because, if the Commons were to vote down the withdrawal agreement, the government would fall. But Grieve said that that would not be desirable. His plan was better, he said. Because if we get to a position where we are three weeks from crashing out without a deal, and people can’t fly to other countries in Europe, the idea that it’s a good moment to get rid of the prime minister, have a general election, or go through the process of forming a new government as an emergency, doesn’t seem to me a very good one if it can be avoided. Doubtless there will be more on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, gives a speech in Vienna. 11.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 12.45pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion saying the Commons has no confidence in Chris Grayling, the transport secretary. 2.30pm: Nick Hurd, the policing minister, and Sir Thomas Winsor, the chief inspector of constabulary, give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee on the future of policing. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day.

Members of the RMT union are staging a 24-hour walkout, with further stoppages planned for Thursday and Saturday. Northern said it would run as many services as possible between 7am and 7pm but warned that it would run fewer services during the strikes. Northern’s regional director for its western region, Sharon Keith, said: “On each day of the strike action we will be running fewer services and expect those services we do operate to be extremely busy. “It is, therefore, vital that anyone thinking of travelling with Northern on Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday plans their journey carefully.” The walkout is expected to bring further travel misery for passengers who have faced weeks of disruption, including hundreds of cancelled services, after the introduction of a new timetable caused chaos across the network. As the strike began on Tuesday morning, passengers complained of overcrowded trains and insufficient rail replacement buses for rush hour services across the north of England. Meanwhile, Northern workers mounted picket lines outside stations as RMT said they continued to receive the backing of the public. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “It’s another day and another rail scandal under [the transport secretary] Chris Grayling. “Instead of propping up a foreign-owned company in its fight against British workers, Chris Grayling should be allowing meaningful discussions to take place which would allow passengers to keep a second member of staff on every train.” A Department for Transport spokesman said: “This dispute is not about jobs or safety. Guards have been guaranteed their jobs and the independent rail regulator has ruled that driver-controlled trains, which have been used in this country for 30 years, are safe. “We urge the union to abandon these strikes, work with the train operator and make passengers’ services their number one priority.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/22/gang-gang-dance-kazuashita-review-shoegazey-panglobal-dreampop","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T07:30:22Z","webTitle":"Gang Gang Dance: Kazuashita review – shoegazey panglobal dreampop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/22/gang-gang-dance-kazuashita-review-shoegazey-panglobal-dreampop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/22/gang-gang-dance-kazuashita-review-shoegazey-panglobal-dreampop","fields":{"headline":"Gang Gang Dance: Kazuashita review – shoegazey panglobal dreampop","bodyText":"In 2008, Gang Gang Dance’s breakthrough fourth album, Saint Dymphna, crystallised a manic moment, a time when blogs were abuzz with motley, abrasively joyous collisions of world and dance. Ten years on, and seven since their moody, complex fifth, Eye Contact, the New York trio have shifted to meet a very different global atmosphere, tuning in, as did Björk’s Utopia, to the soothing sounds of a new age revival and filtering them through shoegazey dreampop textures. Single Lotus would fit neatly on one of those 90s Pure Moods compilations, all loose guitar and soft synths, Lizzi Bougatsos’s voice – as beautiful, infuriating and varied as ever – conjuring a panglobal sacred pop. J-Tree builds its bliss slowly, reverbed guitar rolling and crashing, ending in a sample of Standing Rock pipeline protesters jubilantly greeting the arrival of a herd of buffalo. The title track lifts rattling percussion into light, bubbling beats reminiscent of In Sides-era Orbital, as artist Oliver Payne intones colour names in a mesmerising meditation, dispelled by a big breakbeat breakdown. There’s always, of course, been a hippie undertow to Gang Gang Dance’s mission to forge communion between disparate sounds. “There’s nothing to be scared of,” a child’s voice assures at the end of J-Tree, but though we’re supposed to be past the stage of guilty pleasures in music, pleasurable or otherwise, these sounds (the scent of Enigma and Enya, the glimmer of fire poi in the corner of your eye) still carry a taint of dippy, fantasist indulgence. The band, however, see the album less as an escape, more of an attempt to sire a better world: it’s named after live member Taka Imamura’s new baby, whose name is a play on words roughly translating as “peace tomorrow”. Whether its dreamy palette is progressive or pacifying, Kazuashita undoubtedly brings moments of beautiful respite, not least on closer Salve on the Sorrow, whose floaty fantasy vistas – crashes of drums and trills of harp, Bougatsos’s cooing and whooping like a tropical bird – end hopefully, with the sound of a match flaring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/25/quiz-world-cup-hat-tricks","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T09:36:36Z","webTitle":"Quiz: World Cup hat-tricks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/25/quiz-world-cup-hat-tricks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/25/quiz-world-cup-hat-tricks","fields":{"headline":"Quiz: World Cup hat-tricks","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/19/arsenal-bayer-leverkusen-bernd-leno","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T19:08:00Z","webTitle":"Arsenal confirm deal to sign goalkeeper Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/19/arsenal-bayer-leverkusen-bernd-leno","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/19/arsenal-bayer-leverkusen-bernd-leno","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal confirm deal to sign goalkeeper Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen","bodyText":"Arsenal have confirmed a deal to sign the goalkeeper Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen, believed to be for an initial €22m (£19.2m). The 26-year-old, who was part of the Germany squad that won the Confederations Cup last year but was not selected for this summer’s World Cup, is believed to have agreed a five-year deal at the Emirates after he was identified as the long-term successor to Petr Cech. Leno was an integral part of the Leverkusen side which finished fifth in the Bundesliga last season, having begun his career at Stuttgart, and it is understood that Arsenal could pay up to another £3m in bonuses as part of the deal. Both clubs confirmed the deal on Tuesday night. “We are very pleased that Bernd Leno will be joining us,” said Arsenal’s head coach, Unai Emery. “Bernd is a goalkeeper of high quality and experience. We are all excited that Bernd has chosen Arsenal and look forward to start working with him in pre-season.” The arrival casts doubt over the future of Cech, who has only one year remaining on the contract he signed when he moved from Chelsea in 2015. Arsenal are also closing in on the signing of the Uruguay midfielder Lucas Torreira of Sampdoria for £25m and the Greece defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Borussia Dortmund for around £16m as Emery continues his rebuilding job.

All patriotically soundtracked to America the Beautiful. The Purge, released the year before, was a low-budget, high-concept home invasion horror, but since then – with a fourth film opening today and a television series on the way – the franchise has become increasingly political and provocative, with box-office takings growing in kind. What began as a genre exercise has morphed into a war cry, the metaphors making way for primal screams. The underlying conceit is solid: for a 12-hour period, one day a year, the US government sanctions all crimes, up to and including murder. Emergency services are unavailable for the duration of “the purge”, while those who wish to do so can take personal grudges to grisly conclusions without criminal consequence. As a result, crime overall is at an all-time low, fewer people live below the poverty line and unemployment is at 1%. But as the series has developed, the emerging theme has been that those behind the purge are doing it for their financial betterment: to have the poor killed off, thus diminishing the need for welfare, healthcare and housing. Ethan Hawke’s character in the first film was the face of American apathy, a homeowner selling security systems to the rich while those who can’t afford such protection are slaughtered. The film was a comment on class, but still very much in it for the thrills and spills. Subsequent outings were too, but as the films have explored different American demographics, the critical viewpoints of the film-makers – writer-director James DeMonaco and producer Jason Blum – have become more prominent. The first three films were all made under Barack Obama, but from the start were a reaction to gun culture, and to those enabling it. “The films are about the insane relationship that we have in our country to guns, and about the fact that there are more guns than people in the United States,” says Blum, who also produced Jordan Peele’s Get Out and Spike Lee’s forthcoming BlackkKlansman. “Congress blocked gun control that Obama put up. James DeMonaco and I are pretty outspoken in our political views, and those views are very much in the movies. They’re about the power of the NRA and the absurdity of our gun laws here. It’s a cautionary tale about how dangerous and nonsensical those laws are.” The ultra-religious, democratically elected governing party that introduced the purge is called the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA), and each instalment of the franchise concentrates more keenly on opposing voices. There have been loose attempts to give both sides a voice, and not always hysterically. The second film featured a middle-class dinner-table conversation, in which family members squabbled in a thinly veiled version of the gun-control debate, The old patriarch proudly calls it an “anti-purge” household; his middle-aged daughter disagrees. “Just don’t piss me off, bitch,” she explains when questioned, and personal quarrels are soon resolved in a hail of bullets. Settling arguments with guns, it seems, is not such a good idea. The third film, Election Year, was conceived in 2014, and the NFFA’s far-right presidential candidate Minister Edwidge Owens was inspired, DeMonaco has said, by Ted Cruz, who was gearing up to run for the top job at the time. Rewrites preceding the film’s 2016 release, though, doubled-down on the NFFA’s white supremacy, as equivalent voices in the real world grew more confident and more brazenly public. DeMonaco made the NFFA’s attitude, he has said, more “Trump-like”. By this film, the metaphor almost falls away completely, with the anti-purge, Hillary Clinton-inspired presidential candidate Senator Roan namechecking not the NFFA but its real-world inspiration: “Money generated from the purge lines the pockets of the NRA and insurance companies,” she says. Art and life bleed into one here. Election Year was shot in September 2015, before the Trump-Clinton campaign got ugly, and seemed eerily prescient when it was released in July 2016. Meanwhile the film’s tagline, the purge-happy “Keep America Great”, was announced by Trump, earlier this year, as his 2020 campaign slogan. It is unlikely to be an homage. “As the franchise has grown, it’s gotten less parable and more political, but that’s because the situation’s gotten more dire,” says Blum. The series has stopped wearing its mask. It has, in fact, swapped it for some iconic headgear: the teaser poster for new prequel The First Purge, the first in the franchise to be written and filmed under Trump, simply featured the president’s red Make America Great Again cap, with the slogan swapped for the film’s title. In the past, Blum, who makes his own views clear on his Twitter feed, had said the politics in his films should be secondary to the entertainment, but clearly that has changed. “As an American, I feel completely trapped,” he says. “So does over 50% of the country. And one of the ways to get out of that trap is to make movies about it. So certainly the messages have come more to the surface. Every time there’s a shooting in the Unites States, there’s a loud voice that says the way to avoid a shooting is to pile more guns into the world. The president thinks teachers should carry guns in schools, which is just preposterous. The notion of The Purge, when we started, was this fantastical idea. But because we have a wacko for a President, it seems a lot less outlandish now.” There is no arguing that, for all the politics, the primary purpose of The Purge films is to entertain and to appeal to audiences’ revenge fantasies, however misplaced they might be. There is, obviously, bloodlust at play. While the films pretend to show us how awful all the carnage is, they also end with cathartic assaults on the evildoers. We are meant to cheer the bloodshed. Even DeMonaco, writer-director of the first three films and the writer of the latest, has said he fears the films could tip into exploitation, and he wants to stay involved with the franchise to safeguard them. He has already had to cut out scenes that tipped the wrong way, including a mass rape set-up that both his wife and the film’s distributor, Universal, objected to. Staunchly anti-guns, the films nevertheless wallow in gun violence. The point may well be that this isn’t so healthy, that the oft-cited solution to the gun problem being more guns is wrongheaded. But the films’ violence is satisfying, the message getting, momentarily at least, lost in the mix. Blum says he is troubled by “a small percentage of the audience” in the US who seem to think the purge is a good idea, judging by reactions he has gauged at screenings. “I think about it all the time, what you’re saying,” says Blum. “But I stand behind the movies, I’m proud of them and I’m making more of them. I have come to the place, ultimately, that the good outweighs the bad. I don’t think the movies are perfect. But you can’t make a movie about gun control and guns, and assault weapons in particular, in the US, and have it be about birds.” It’s a delicate dance. “We love guns. We love violence. And then we hate it when it happens,” said Ethan Hawke while promoting the first film. “We have a weird dance with violence, as a country. And I think the movie puts its finger right on that.” Which is a fair assessment: these films speak to legitimate fears, both macro and micro, while also giving us an opportunity to enjoy escapist violence from a safe distance. Hawke’s “as a country” addendum is also pertinent. From the start, the series has announced itself as a response to a specifically American syndrome. The purge is an outlet, we are told in the first instalment, for “American rage”. These films are presented as a cautionary tale for other countries, and in France, the franchise is called American Nightmare. And with profits growing each time, the message is getting stronger. This is a major film franchise taking shots at government, and pulling no punches as it states its case.

According to the policy, whoever came to Australia by boat would be exiled to Manus Island and Nauru. Together with 60 other people travelling on a leaky boat headed for Australia, I was lost on the ocean when the return to offshore processing was announced. This policy was seen as political propaganda to win votes; it occurred just two months before the 2013 federal election in September. We were taken to Manus Island as part of this policy which has been criticised for being inhumane and unjust. This was the first chapter of a program that used 2,000 innocent asylum seekers as part of a political game. Kevin Rudd and the Labor party lost the election. Tony Abbott from the Liberal party took office as the prime minister of Australia. Rudd, who forced us into this ruthless political game, quit Australian politics forever and moved to New York. It has now been five years: three prime ministers and three immigration ministers. We are still living in exile. During this period, no events or shifts in Australian politics has affected our destiny; there have been no changes in our situation caused by Australia’s political climate. Keeping us in this condition is clearly a rugged political contest within the Australian political arena. Whoever hurts us the most, whoever humiliates us the most, will please the public and keep them on side. Another election is ahead and, predictably, the closer we come to the election, the more the topic of refugees will be politicised, in particular those incarcerated on Manus Island and Nauru. The policy of exile was created based on two concepts: national security and national interest. Putting emphasis on these concepts has been a successful strategy by the government for convincing and manipulating the public regarding the suffering of refugees. As the policy of exile continues, it becomes more obvious that it is fundamentally in line with the political goals and interests of parties, not national interest and security. Peter Dutton is becoming more and more powerful every day. He has been promoted within Australia’s political structure and he no longer conceals his ambition to become prime minister. According to political analysts, he has become the most powerful minister in Turnbull’s cabinet. The scope of his power is now much greater than immigration related matters; he now has power over other aspects of Australian politics. His decisions not only impact the destiny of refugees, but moreover, his footprint can be seen in the everyday life of Australians, in the private sphere, and even throughout airports. Undoubtedly, the increase in Dutton’s powers owes a lot to the policy of exile. This policy has been significantly successful for him and led to many achievements for his colleagues in the Liberal party. Thus, Dutton insists on sticking to his current course of action; the release of refugees and closure of offshore camps are against his own personal and political interests and, subsequently, he maintains this policy at all costs. International credibility and reputation are important factors when it comes to exercising power in the region and globally. But regardless of the consequences, the policy of exile has continued and has considerably damaged the reputation of Australia in respect to human rights. Even countries ruled by dictatorships with rigid political structures do their best to create a positive image in front of the international community, while the image of Australia as a supporter human rights has shifted to a country that violates human rights. There is no doubt that this shift is entirely against national interest. $9bn dollars has been spent during these years in order to maintain this policy – it is a significant amount of money and could have been spent on social needs. Yet the Coalition and Labor keep insisting that keeping refugees on Manus Island and Nauru is in the national interest. It is clear that this policy is in line with personal interests and for the sake of political parties, not the national interest. What has been neglected throughout this period is “human rights” and respect for international conventions. It is bizarre that in contemporary Australia many people accept that the following statement: “we are aware that keeping refugees in limbo is immoral and against human rights, but we have a right to continue violating human rights in order to stop the boats”. The reality is overlooked by many Australians – what has stopped the boats is the turn back policy and not the policy of exile, and these policies are two separate topics. Australia needs to reach a collective and national understanding that under no circumstances can one ever justify the violation of human rights – no excuses are acceptable. We must never forget the reality that at the moment hundreds of people are kept as hostages by the Australian government, hundreds have been stuck for five years in camps on Manus Island and Nauru. These people do not have any idea regarding the political landscape in Australia, they have no idea regarding the political contest between parties and political elites. Essentially, they are people who simply dream of living in a safe place. Behrouz Boochani is a journalist and an Iranian refugee held on Manus Island.

It has also found the steady decline in corporate tax rates globally since the 1980s has not been driven by countries competing harder for productive capital and pushing corporate tax rates down, despite what politicians say. • Sign up to receive the top stories every morning Instead, it says corporate tax rates have been driven lower by multinational corporations shifting profits into tax havens, and governments’ failure to curb the practice. The finding undermines the argument that countries such as Australia are being forced to cut their tax rates because economic integration has made capital location more sensitive to differences in taxes. The Turnbull government has relied on such an argument when calling on the senate to support a cut in Australia’s corporate tax rate from 30% to 25%. It has said lower company taxes will encourage companies to invest in Australia which will boost productive capital and make workers more productive, helping to lift wages. But the new study shows that textbook model of tax competition doesn’t capture the behaviour of today’s largest multinational corporations. The study says countries with higher corporate tax rates give multinationals more incentive to shift profits overseas, and countries experience smaller revenue losses if they lower their tax rates. “Machines don’t move to low-tax places: paper profits do,” the paper says. “For wages to rise, productive capital needs to increase, which can happen fast if capital flows from abroad, much less so if paper profits – not productive capital – is what moves across countries. “By our estimates, close to 40% of multinational profits [were] artificially shifted to tax havens in 2015. This tax avoidance and the failure to curb it are the main reason why corporate tax rates are falling globally, not tax competition for productive capital.” Overall, the study estimates more than $600bn in profits were shifted to low tax jurisdictions in 2015, with US multinationals being the main “shifters.” It found about half of all shifted profits accrue to US parent companies, while about 30% accrue to European parent companies. It has used new data to produce the first comprehensive map of where corporate profits are booked globally, showing the volume of profits being shifted out of OECD countries. “By our estimate, corporate tax avoidance by multinationals reduces the corporate tax revenue of the European Union by around 20%. For the world as a whole, that tax revenue loss is around 10%,” the paper says. It estimates in 2015, corporate tax avoidance by multinationals reduced the corporate tax revenue of Germany by 28%, France and Hungary by 21%, Spain and the United States by 14%, and Norway and Poland by 8%. Australia’s corporate tax revenue was reduced by about 7%, which equates to roughly $5.4bn in forgone revenue in 2017. The study, called The Missing Profits of Nations, was written by economists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Copenhagen, and published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. It says governments have been unable to stop profit-shifting in recent decades because they have lacked the incentive to do so. It says higher-tax countries, like Australia, have been more willing to focus their enforcement efforts on relocating profits booked by multinationals in other high-tax countries because the tax information has been easier to find, and cheaper and quicker to pursue. It says enforcement on tax havens has been neglected because it is has been harder (since little data exists), costlier (because multinationals spend large resources defending their shifting to low-tax locales), and lengthier (due to lack of cooperation between haven and non-haven countries). “Our analysis shows, consistent with theory, that the vast majority of high-tax countries’ enforcement efforts are directed at other high-tax countries,” the paper says. “In effect, non-haven countries steal revenue from each other while letting tax havens flourish.” The paper highlights how the rise of multinational corporations such as Google, Apple, and Facebook have changed the global tax system. “These firms don’t seem to move much tangible capital to low-tax places – they don’t even have much tangible capital to start with. Instead, they avoid taxes by shifting accounting profits,” the paper says. “In 2016 for instance, Google Alphabet made $19.2bn in revenue in Bermuda, a small island in the Atlantic where it barely employs any workers nor owns any tangible assets, and where the corporate tax rate is 0%. The Coalition government has gone some way to cracking down on corporate tax avoidance in recent years. It introduced the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) in late 2015, increasing penalties for significant global entities that enter into tax avoidance and profit shifting schemes It also introduced the Diverted Profits Tax, which came into effect in mid-2017, in a bid to prevent the diversion of profits offshore through arrangements involving related parties."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27545","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T23:00:16Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,545","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27545","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27545","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,545","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/20/pushing-for-civil-war-fears-riots-could-turn-into-widespread-conflict-in-png","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T18:00:19Z","webTitle":"'Pushing for civil war': fears riots could turn into widespread conflict in PNG","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/pushing-for-civil-war-fears-riots-could-turn-into-widespread-conflict-in-png","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/20/pushing-for-civil-war-fears-riots-could-turn-into-widespread-conflict-in-png","fields":{"headline":"'Pushing for civil war': fears riots could turn into widespread conflict in PNG","bodyText":"Riots that erupted last week in Papua New Guinea could turn into a full-scale conflict, locals have said, as anger and chaos grip the Southern Highlands province. In the last week, protesters incensed by the failure of a court challenge relating to an election result have set fire to a commercial plane, government buildings and the home of the local governor, as well as ambushing two police cars. The protests escalated over the weekend as a group of 300 to 400 people, armed with machetes, machine guns and high-powered rifles, marched on Mendi, the capital of the Southern Highlands province, calling for the resignation of prime minister Peter O’Neill. So far there have been no deaths during the protests, but locals fear that the violence could escalate. “It’s very very tense. They are all armed, they’re even armed with military-issued weapons,” said Lucielle Paru, a local activist who was in Mendi last week. She said the protesters were so angry they seem to be “pushing for a civil war”. PNG is due to host the Apec summit in November of this year and O’Neill has been keen to reassure other world leaders of the security of the country ahead of the meeting. Justin Tkatchenko, the country’s minister for Apec, told local media last week’s unrest would not affect plans for the summit, which is due to be attended by Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull. The violence began on Thursday over the failure of a court challenge made by candidate Joseph Kobol over an election for governor held last year. Protesters supporting Kobol set fire to an aeroplane on the tarmac and were joined by between 100 and 200 men armed with sticks and guns who arrived from surrounding villages. They set fire to the national and district court buildings, the commerce and industry building and governor William Powi’s residence. O’Neill, who hails from the Southern Highlands, announced a state of emergency the same day and brought in a curfew between 6pm and 6am. More than 100 soldiers have since have arrived in the province, but O’Neill is yet to visit. “It could blow up,” said Paru. “Those who are in Mendi are even suggesting to come down to the capital city, since the prime minister won’t come up to his own province.” “They’re not showing that they want to stand down. You even feel it here in the capital of Port Moresby, there are group factions now gathering to discuss this issue.” Martyn Namorong, a writer based in Port Moresby, who was in Mendi last year during the dispute over the election result, said the people in Mendi he had spoken to described the mood as “calm but tense”, though he added “there is a risk of civil war in which rival parties fight each other and against the security forces.” The United Nations evacuated their staff in the Southern Highlands to Mt Hagen on Thursday because of the violence and the International Committee of the Red Cross have suspended their operations in the area. “It’s difficult to predict how this is going to evolve,” said Ahmad Hallak, the ICRC’s deputy head of mission for Papua New Guinea. “But what we usually see is that the situation escalates dramatically and then usually quietens down pretty quickly.” Though he warned that things could escalate if “things blow up again in the coming days and weeks ... the Highlands is quite unpredictable and it’s really impossible to know for sure.” On Tuesday morning, an armed group attacked an LNG pipeline construction site run by ExxonMobil in the neighbouring province of Hela, damaging earthmoving equipment and blocking the roads to the site. The attack on the Angore site - which is part of the country’s biggest resources project - is thought to be unrelated to the violence in Mendi, and instead to be related to land ownership complaints. In a press conference on Sunday, prime minister Peter O’Neill apologised to the country for the “distress” caused by the protests and pledged to work for “normalcy in the province”. However, Paru said this apology was “a show for the international community”, rather than a substantial action, given that many people in Mendi do not have access to television and so would not have seen it. Paru was angered that O’Neill was going ahead with a visit to Beijing this week to sign a trade deal. “He needs to go back home, he needs to get all the members of the Southern Highlands and get them to go back to their people,” she said. This article was amended on 20 June 2018. A previous version said prime minister Peter O’Neill had already flown to China. He is due to fly to Beijing later this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jun/19/xxxtentacion-hyperfast-life-of-trauma-inflicted-endured","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T07:55:28Z","webTitle":"XXXTentacion: a hyperfast life of trauma, endured and inflicted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jun/19/xxxtentacion-hyperfast-life-of-trauma-inflicted-endured","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jun/19/xxxtentacion-hyperfast-life-of-trauma-inflicted-endured","fields":{"headline":"XXXTentacion: a hyperfast life of trauma, endured and inflicted","bodyText":"XXXTentacion lived a life of hyperfast, nihilistic violence where nothing could ever be put on pause. In the past year alone, he had a number one Billboard album, was banned from Spotify, dropped by his record label and charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant victim and witness tampering. His ex-girlfriend detailed the most horrendous abuse in court documents and press interviews. He will be remembered mostly for the unusually cruel violence he committed on vulnerable people, particularly his ex-girlfriend, crimes for which he never expressed remorse. His music, a combination of hip-hop and emo that was depressive, and at times devastating, reflected a life lived with disregard for humanity, both other people’s and his own. On Monday afternoon, he was shot and killed in Miami, during an armed robbery. He was 20 years old. His life had many of the trappings of gangsta rappers who were shot at a young age in the 1990s: drugs, violence and persistent trouble with the law. But XXXTentacion, real name Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, was not exactly a hard man. He was insecure and drug-addled, still living through his own traumatic childhood while he viciously abused others. His victims were not from rival gangs: they were women and strangers. His music rarely tried to demonstrate bravado or material gains, it mostly traced round mental illness, suicide, extreme misogyny and a prevailing feeling of numbness. Onfroy was born in Florida in 1998. His mother was financially unable, and at times just uninterested, in raising him, and he spent much of his childhood moving from home to home. The bond he had with her, he has repeatedly claimed, was incredibly strong. When she was in the picture he said she would shower him with gifts and affection. When she was away, a darkness and depression ate away at him, one that would define his short life. Onfroy was constantly in trouble for violent behaviour, and was at one point expelled from school for beating up another student. By the time he was 17, he had already been charged with possession of a firearm, armed robbery, resisting arrest and Xanax possession. He had done two spells in juvenile detention and during the second one, violently beat a cellmate who he believed to be gay. According to an interview he gave in the Miami New Times, when his mother asked him what had happened he said: “This nigga did some gay shit, so I had to crack his head open.” After he left juvenile prison, he began making music, mostly underground mixtapes with minor mainstream appeal. But in 2016 Onfroy’s profile started to rise thanks to the online success of his song Look At Me!, a track with violent lyrics that set the tone for that part of his career. Onfroy was part of a new wave of artists, sometimes referred to as “soundcloud rap”, whose music embodied a disconnect with societal norms, and embraced internet culture and heavy Xanax use. The role of Xanax, an addictive and potent pharmaceutical used to treat anxiety, was important – it helped to soothe internal pain, and created a floating disconnection from reality. The other shining light of Soundcloud Rap, Lil Peep, who Onfroy mostly loathed, died in November of a Xanax overdose. At the same time as his career was beginning to flourish, Onfroy entered into a relationship with a woman who he violently abused. According to court documents he variously stomped on her head, held her head, strangled, kicked and punched her. He would also make repeated threats of suicide, often coming close to killing himself in front of her. Later, the woman became pregnant and Onfroy continued to brutally beat her and briefly kidnapped her. Onfroy was arrested for these crimes, as well as other charges and placed initially under house arrest and then in prison. While in prison Onfroy became troublingly famous. A$AP Rocky tweeted that he couldn’t wait for his release and some accused Drake of copying one of his verses. When Onfroy returned to house arrest while awaiting trial, he began recording. He worked with Diplo, among other big names and eventually released two albums, the second of which “?” went to number one. It is a powerful record, performed in large parts on acoustic guitar, by a man desperately grasping to get something out of a life which he rightly senses might already be coming to an end. He was lauded by giants of the genre including Kendrick Lamar. After his death Kayne West tweeted: “Never told you how much you inspired me when you were here thank you for existing.” Some lump Onfroy in with the #MeToo movement, and his music is discussed in thinkpieces about whether you can ever separate the art from the artist. But the truth is that Onfroy’s crimes are so unspeakably violent, his hatred for women so unchecked, that they form their own category. Unlike other artists, whose violence against women became known once they were already stars, it was Onfroy’s incarceration for domestic violence that helped create his celebrity. In his final months, Onfroy was charged with witness tampering, and was accused of pressuring his ex-girlfriend to drop the charges against him. He made some attempts to rehabilitate his image, at one point claiming to donate $100,000 to a domestic violence charity – although it’s disputed whether he actually did. But the seriousness of the crimes he was accused of never seemed to register with him, and he would often return to violent language in the same breath as trying to clear his name.The day after the Charleston shooting, when Dylan Roof murdered nine African Americans while they were attending church, Onfroy tweeted support for the shooter, calling him LIL DYLAN ROOF and adorning his name in heart emojis. He later deleted the tweet. Onfroy idolised Kurt Cobain, saying he was “the only person who inspires me”. Cobain is often said to be part of the “27 club” a group of people who lived hard and fast, only for their demons to catch up with them at a young age. For Onfroy 27 would have been old age, his life contained so much trauma, inflicted and endured, that he barely made it out his teens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/19/jordan-henderson-adaptability-england-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T16:08:33Z","webTitle":"Jordan Henderson’s adaptability makes him more than just a handyman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/19/jordan-henderson-adaptability-england-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/19/jordan-henderson-adaptability-england-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"The adaptable Jordan Henderson is more than just a handyman","bodyText":"There was a moment of double-take midway through the second half at the Volgograd Arena on Monday, as England’s players fretted and fumbled, falling into the old stodgy patterns, that feeling of playing football through a warm summer fog. At which point a vast Mexican wave broke out around the stadium. Seconds later there was a starburst of lighted mobile phones followed by gleeful chants of “Ross-iy-ya, Ross-iy-ya” from locals immune to the slow agony of watching England’s moment starting to pass in front of your nose, the Reasonably Hopeful Age of Gareth starting to flap and fray like a sweat-soaked blue nylon FA waistcoat gnawed apart at the seams by a thousand marshland mosquitoes. Through all this one England player seemed to be moving to a different rhythm. From high up in the stands there was something jarring about the patterns carved out by Jordan Henderson’s No 8 shirt as it broke ranks, bustled into other players’ spaces and ran a few dead-ends. As Henderson popped up on the right and punted a deep cross out of play there were groans, a muscle memory of the familiar old high-speed imprecision. Henderson is unlikely to get much credit for the manner of England’s 2-1 victory. The key quality, universally identified, was the way England kept calm and became less, not more, frantic as the last knockings played out. Whereas in the depths of that second half Henderson had played like the antithesis of this. No doubt some will see an image of the classic English chief midfield-donkey, a flushed and barking ghost of tournament failures past. Henderson is still seen in these circles as a low-grade hustler, a sub-thoroughbred who has so often been present, the hotdog seller in the background of history, when England have experienced one of their recent moments of epic disarray. This was different. England needed a little anger on Monday. This was a tactical response to a shift within the game rather than running for running’s sake. In England’s best period early on Henderson had played a different way, striding around in more stately fashion as a free presence behind the attacking four and able to thread some precise forward passes. After half-time Tunisia shifted their own midfield, getting close to him and stretching that supply line thin. It was a smart disruptive move. The 3-1-2-2-1-1 shape demands that the lone central pivot provides a complete midfield janitorial service, working constantly with the balance and rhythm of the game to keep all the cogs and wheels whizzing round. Henderson suits the role. He acts as a kind of hyperactive guilty conscience in any team. In Volgograd he had more touches and made more passes than any other midfielder. But he also managed elements that go beyond the bare numbers. At one point in the second half he even seemed to start a pointless fight with Tunisia’s players at a free-kick. It was boorish stuff perhaps but England did need to disrupt Tunisia in return, to throw a couple of kidney punches. Nobody else in this team of mannered technicians was likely to shift the emotional gears. Despite his reputation as a scuffler Henderson has always been an adaptive footballer. Appearances can be deceptive, just as the reputation for fixed roles and closed thinking among English footballers is notoriously overstated. You want growth and evolution? England’s midfield conduit started as a right-winger at Sunderland. In the past year Jürgen Klopp has worked hard at fashioning him into a midfielder who runs both ways in the central European style. It is no secret there will be objections to any satisfaction with England’s winning start. Lads: it’s Tunisia. Lads, it’s Tunisia without their best player, who got here by finishing one point ahead of DR Congo in qualifying. But Tunisia were good enough to spook England a little, to raise the 2016 ghosts of Saint-Étienne in the second half, when the only response to Slovakia’s resistance was pained, static possession. If England really are keen to bury the ghosts of the recent past, then their midfield handyman is key to this. Nobody else in the team is so closely marked by those traumas. Before Monday Henderson’s tournament record read: played five, won zero. He was there for Italy in Kiev in 2012, the day Andre Pirlo looked like the only grown-up on the pitch. He was there for the defeat by Uruguay in São Paulo in 2014. He was there on the bench for the brain-freeze against Iceland in Nice in 2016. He carries the gene. With this in mind Sunday in Nizhny Novgorov will come round quite quickly now. Gareth Southgate is too clear-sighted not to think about changing the balance of his team after an imperfect performance. England lacked width on the left. Danny Rose might be a better option against Panama’s deep defence. Raheem Sterling should stay in the team, although Dele Alli’s likely absence with injury takes away the possibility England might finally play their best midfield finisher close to Harry Kane. If Alli does miss out, the likely presence of Ruben Loftus-Cheek could be good for Henderson too. What England lack is passing craft. Loftus-Cheek could add this, a playmaker-ish type against opponents likely to give up possession at times. For now they should be allowed to enjoy a rare tournament win, perhaps even the lifting of a cloud or two. No doubt Henderson will play poorly again in the future or find more talented players can simply take him out of the game. But sport is also about redemption and recovery and perhaps now he is entitled to be judged a little more on his strengths rather than on only his flaws."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/19/t-levels-reinforce-class-hierarchy","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T16:53:42Z","webTitle":"T-levels reinforce class hierarchy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/19/t-levels-reinforce-class-hierarchy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/19/t-levels-reinforce-class-hierarchy","fields":{"headline":"T-levels reinforce class hierarchy","bodyText":"Chiding Fiona Millar for her pessimism about the new T-levels, Anne Milton MP, minister of state for skills and apprenticeships, assures us that “these exciting new qualifications ... are here to stay” (Letters, 16 June). She bases her optimism upon two factors: the care taken with the design of T-levels and the fact that they will be part of a “holistic” approach to technical education which will include the establishment of institutes of technology “that will offer ... technical training to degree standard”. Leaving aside that some of this looks remarkably like a case of “back to the future”, the minister completely ignores the underlying reason for the failure of every single government attempt since 1945 to provide high-quality technical and vocational education: namely, the historical role of academic qualifications in reinforcing social class hierarchy. This became quite explicit in 2004, when the government rejected wholesale the excellent Tomlinson report, because its recommendations would have given equal status in the sixth form to both academic and vocational studies by incorporating both into the same school-leaver’s diploma. As Fiona Millar points out, vocational education in the UK has always been seen as essentially for “other people’s children”. T-levels, however well designed, won’t change this. Michael Pyke Lichfield, Staffordshire • Nigel Todd (Letters, 11 June) rightly draws attention to next year’s centenary of the 1919 adult education report by the Ministry of Reconstruction. Next year also marks the 75th anniversary of the Butler Act, which set a legal framework for adult education in the period after the second world war. It might be argued that this legislation has had a greater impact on living generations than the earlier report. This association was established directly after publication of the 1919 report. It brought together a number of organisations that had worked to take learning opportunities directly into the heart of some of the most deprived industrial areas in the country. We have evidence of lobbying, which took place from early in 1944, that persuaded Butler and convinced parliament to place a duty on local authorities in England and Wales to “secure adequate provision for the education of adults”. Over the years, our members have maintained that ethos of reaching out to communities and addressing disadvantage. We have also collaborated with a wide range of other bodies supporting adult education, most notable the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE) Having led this association for the past 20 years, I applaud the initiative of the Cooperative College and the WEA in starting a new campaign to secure political and financial support to meet the educational needs arising from our complex modern society and the present educational and social disadvantages to which the Guardian consistently draws attention.

I had the sinking feeling that we were in the wrong place. There should have been a collection of high-design chalets around here somewhere, all floor-to-ceiling glass and exposed concrete, according to the website images. But all I could see were a handful of dilapidated wooden farm sheds. I bundled the toddlers out of the car and walked closer, worrying that we had accidentally booked somewhere very basic and inappropriate for them and their grandparents. A discreet sign reading “Anako Lodge” reassured me; we were where we were meant to be. At the back of the first hut, we spied a couple in a wooden hot-tub, wine on a table beside them. Then our own little hut, the Mayen à Madeleine, where a peek inside revealed modern interiors – like the pictures I’d seen. We sunk into its colourful chairs to admire this isolated corner of the Val d’Hérens: the icy Dents de Veisivi, Dent Blanche (4,357 metres) and Mont Collon (3,637) towering above, the tongue of the Ferpècle glacier poking down, then shelves of flower-flecked fields cascading to the wider valley floor. For centuries, Alpine farmers used such mazots, mayens, greniers, raccards and granges, as the different types of buildingsare variously known, to store valuables and crops, or for shelter on high pastures. Distraught at how many of these pieces of Alpine history were being left to rot, local architect Olivier Cheseaux has set about rescuing some since 2008, dismantling them and rebuilding them, plank by plank, near the tiny hamlet of La Forclaz, to create Anako Lodge. From the outside, his seven mayens look as they have for 200 to 300 years – pretty larch huts, raised on stilts, weathered by snow and wind. But inside, he has built modern rooms in plywood, pine and concrete, with sleek kitchens and wet-rooms. Racing through ours, my three-year-old daughter screamed in delight on discovering a double-height landing with a playhouse and a proper climbing wall with ropes. By the end of the week, she could climb it easily. It was while out paragliding that Cheseaux clocked the potential of this area, at the top of the Val d’Hérens, for a low-key tourism project. Much less developed than other Rhône tributary valleys, where glitzy ski resorts like Verbier and Zermatt boast designer shopping and champagne bars, the Val d’Hérens remains a peaceful, traditional idyll, famous for cow-fighting and cheese. “The only services here are the shop and bar in the village,” Cheseaux told me later. “I want people to be independent and discover everything for themselves.” We might never have done so but for a new website launched by the Swiss tourist board last year, as a kind of Airbnb for mountain huts. Its 260-strong list includes more remote hikers’ huts, ski chalets and farms. An accompanying online tool lets visitors book hundreds of rural experiences. We chose a day with cheese-maker and farmer Marius Pannatier, a twinkly charmer in a funky straw hat, who rears the region’s black Hérens cattle above Evolène. He led us onto a rickety chairlift and up to the communal dairy shared by farmers across the valley. Marius insisted on driving us in his dog-hairy car, unsure of my daughter’s stamina for the hike to the higher pastures. She was terrified at first, but then he taught her to build a fire, letting her put kindling in the flames. When he brought fresh pear juice from his knapsack, her eyes were full of love. “When I was young,” he said, “we spent the whole summer up in the mountains. Now you are fighting against iPads, computers …” From his bag came dried beef from his own cows, a wheel of raclette cheese which he melted over the fire, a couple of bottles of Petite Arvine white wine, and a bottle of juicy red Dôle. By the time the crescendo of cowbells marked the herd’s arrival, I was rather merry. After some tentative patting of the docile beasts, we pottered down the mountain in the fading light. As well as spectacular hiking, the Grande-Dixence dam is unmissable. Its 285-metre wall makes it the world’s tallest gravity dam and, from its base, a dead-ringer for the wall in Game of Thrones. I skipped the tour and ran round it instead, disturbing butterflies and marmots, who scampered off, shaking their big bottoms. That night a fellow guest stopped by to give us a huge puffball mushroom she’d found while walking, which I fried with garlic for a delicately earthy dinner. Once the kids were asleep, I slunk out to the hot-tub to float beneath the full moon, listening to the crackle of burning logs, while the jagged lightning forks of a storm flickered over the mountains. In the dark, all modern touches were invisible. Fire, wine and the sky, simple pleasures to experience, just as folk have been doing for centuries.

For pre-teens and under, stick with one or two guests. Three or four for teens, who are (sometimes) more susceptible to reason. Be wary of hosting very young guests, even if the parents claim they’re independent and will be fine. Agree lights-out time upfront. Accept that staying up later than normal is part of the territory (but don’t let on to the children), as is a day or two of tired crankiness afterwards, so arrange sleepovers only for weekends or school holidays. Decide when you’d (ideally) like them to sleep, then work backwards to allow 30-45 minutes for the inevitable giggling/gossip/ghost stories in the dark. Give a couple of firm but friendly “quiet now” warnings 10 and 20 minutes before “target sleep time”. Agree contingency plans in case of homesickness. Will parents come and rescue their offspring, or expect you to take them home because they’ve been on the prosecco all evening? Employ rewards… and threats. For younger children, perhaps promise a morning treat left by the “sleepover fairy” if they settle down when expected. For older ones, how about a special breakfast? If there is space, set them up as far away as possible so that any incidental excitement doesn’t disturb you and get blown out of proportion by your weariness. Tire them out, but give them ample time to calm down. Exhaust the gang with physical activities. Then elicit calm with a film/ storytelling session.

They include Renaissance bronzes, a pendant with a pearl the size of a walnut, a bell once owned by an Irish saint from which childless women drank to ensure safe pregnancies and a hunting horn claimed to have belonged to Saint Hubert. Two of only four in the world golden wine cups made for a Chinese emperor and a unique Asante gold head – which may be a portrait of a leader killed in battle whose real head was taken as a trophy – also form part of the collection. “In variety, in value and in quality this was unquestionably the greatest gift ever made to the nation,” said Xavier Bray, director of the museum who laid a rose last week on Wallace’s grave in Paris. “It far outweighs others by his contemporaries such as the Waddesdon Bequest to the British Museum.” Bray said the exhibition, in the new £1.2m gallery which the museum has tunnelled out from its basement and former coal cellars, had exposed gaping holes in what was actually known about Wallace. His philanthropy, his collecting (he bought the Asante gold from Garrard, the crown jewellers), the number of times he outbid his even wealthier rival Ferdinand de Rothschild and the palatial museum in a former private mansion, were all famous in his lifetime. Before the museum was complete, he exhibited the collection free in one of the poorest parts of London’s East End, attracting 2.3 million people – contemporary images show labourers in rough work clothes mingling with society ladies. However almost nothing is known about his real parentage, or the background of his remarkable French wife, whom he married after they already had a son. His birth was registered in 1818 as Richard Jackson, understood to be the surname of his mother Agnes. When he was only six she brought him to Paris and left him – “dumped him” was Bray’s phrase – with the third Marchioness of Hertford, mother of Richard Seymour-Conway, the future fourth Marquess. The researchers assume he must have been Agnes and Richard’s son, but though the wealthy family raised and educated him, and he became secretary and agent to the Marquess, his parentage was never acknowledged. When the Seymour-Conway died, he left a legendary collection of spectacular furniture and works of art to his presumed son, together with property and money, but the title went to a cousin who tried but failed to overturn the will. Wallace then bought back one of the family mansions as a suitable home for the collection, and when he died his widow left the palatial house, crammed with works of art, tapestry, ornate furniture, ceramics and armour, as a collection which could not be sold or loaned, housed in a new national museum. Bray said the bequest was a blow to the National Gallery, which had held back on buying French 18th century art assuming it would eventually get the Hertford collection. All the pieces in the new gallery have been on display in the museum, but in such ornate treasure stuffed rooms that they were almost invisible. Bray said the purpose was not just to mark the 200th anniversary of its founder’s birth, but also to display his very distinctive taste in collecting. “The fourth Marquess liked very showy elaborate decorative mainly 18th century art, in immaculate condition. Richard’s taste was far broader and more eclectic – and I think more interesting.

On the contrary, the hat-trick against Spain was only the beginning. For His next feat, on the seventh day of the Ethics World Cup, He must destroy Morocco. It will be a duty more than a pleasure because He has admiration for Hervé Renard, very much His kind of manager. But Portugal need a win, idols can have no peers and, what’s more, there’s another Frenchman who’s been annoying Him for a long time who needs sorting: Just Fontaine scored a hat-trick in his first match in 1958 and another two in his second game en route to a World Cup goal tally of 13, which remains a record, which is intolerable to Him. Saudi Arabia are also in action on Wednesday but, sadly for Him, not against Portugal. Instead the Saudis will aspire to winning a tackle against Uruguay before losing their latest Group A fixture by a single-digit score. But no bookie in Riyadh is taking bets on that. Or on anything else, for that matter. Meanwhile, in Wednesday’s other match in Portugal and Morocco’s group (B), Spain are wary of being thwarted by a Portuguese for the second time in the tournament, as they prepare to do battle with Carlos Queiroz’s Iran. Germany’s defeat by Mexico has reminded them that underdogs must be put down not fed. “What happened to Germany can happen to anyone,” warned Spain’s new gaffer Fernando Hierro. Iran’s manager had a warning of his own. “We do not have supermen like Spain but we can do super things,” bugled Queiroz, who revealed he will deploy a different plan to the one that yielded victory against Morocco, presumably because fluking a win through an own goal after being totally outplayed is not a plan at all. “Against Spain everybody from their goalkeeper to their striker can create things so we need a different strategy,” spoofed Queiroz.

With the issue of safe standing set to be debated in parliament next week, the League’s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, believes that a consensus between football stakeholders and supporters means it is now “illogical and outdated” not to give clubs the choice to reintroduce standing to their grounds. “It will be disappointing if, by this time next year, there is no significant movement one way or the other,” Harvey said. “Whether standing is available to fans by then might be a stretch. But clubs would be able to begin the process of putting it in place. Standing in all divisions of English football by start of the 2020-21 season is a realistic aim.” The Football League has long approved of standing but has become increasingly voluble in its support this summer. In May it commissioned a survey of League supporters which found 94% were in favour of allowing clubs the choice. Now the League appears increasingly confident that the reservations of government – which this year rejected a request by West Bromwich Albion to trial a standing section – can be overturned. “This is a local issue,” said Harvey, “and we believe legislation should be amended to provide individual clubs, and their local Safety Authority Groups to make the decision as to whether standing can be reintroduced to any given stadium and in what form. In our view it is illogical and outdated to continue with the ‘one-size fits all’ approach that has been in operation for the past 30 years. “We are pleased that the government has recently taken steps to review this and we will continue to work with all the relevant stakeholders, and provide insight and guidance as appropriate, in order to see legislation amended in a way that benefits all parties for the good of the game.” Next week’s debate will take place in Westminster Hall after a government petition calling for safe standing raised over 100,000 signatures. This month the Labour party threw their weight behind the idea, calling for an immediate change in the law. And last week the Premier League, which had previously been non-commital on the issue, joined the Football League in calling for choice. The EFL prefers not to use the term “safe standing”, arguing that standing in grounds is already safe and indeed is currently licensed in Leagues One and Two. “This is not a safety issue,” said Harvey. “Standing is safe and we currently have 22 EFL clubs offering full-licensed standing accommodation to supporters across all three divisions. The matter being debated here is whether all clubs, regardless of the division they play in, should have the ability to offer fans the choice they want in terms of whether to sit or stand while they watch their football team play.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/19/british-fruit-growers-short-of-pickers-farming","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T16:36:46Z","webTitle":"British fruit-growers say they are short of pickers this summer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/19/british-fruit-growers-short-of-pickers-farming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/19/british-fruit-growers-short-of-pickers-farming","fields":{"headline":"British fruit-growers say they are short of pickers this summer","bodyText":"Strawberry and other soft fruit farmers are warning of potential shortages because they are struggling to find enough workers to pick fruit. The British Summer Fruits (BSF) trade body said its members were 10% to 15% short of labour and expect to be more than 30% short by the autumn as the government drags its feet on a seasonal agricultural workers scheme. Nick Marston, the BSF chairman, said: “The industry is now threatened by lack of government action with regard to seasonal labour.” He said more than three-quarters of British berry-growers were already scaling back production and trimming investment plans amid fears that fruit would be left rotting in the fields. “Any fall in home-grown production not only increases our dependence on imported fruit but will inevitably lead to significant price rises,” Marston said. Farmers have already raised the pay of pickers to more than £10 an hour to try to attract EU workers after the fall of the pound against the euro reduced the value of their take-home pay. But they are also suffering labour shortages caused by a fall in the number of Romanian and Bulgarian workers looking for work abroad because they now have better job prospects at home. Other EU countries, such as Germany, have tackled the problem with visa schemes that enable Ukrainians, Moldovans and other non-EU nationals to do seasonal work. But Marston said the British government had not fulfilled its promise to do the same in the short term and there was still no clarity on a visa system for EU workers after Brexit. “While this is not an issue caused directly by Brexit, solutions are being hamstrung by Brexit and the government’s inability to make firm decisions,” he said. Marston said he believed progress was being blocked by No 10. “We urge the prime minister to do what she knows is the right thing,” he said. A spokesman for Defra said: “We are working hard to ensure the labour needs of the agriculture sector are met once we leave the EU. “We have been clear that up until December 2020, employers in the agricultural and food processing sectors will be free to recruit EU citizens to fill vacancies and those arriving to work will be able to stay in the UK afterwards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jun/21/from-stonehenge-to-icelands-arctic-henge-by-motorbike-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T04:00:00Z","webTitle":"From Stonehenge to Iceland's Arctic Henge, by motorbike – photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jun/21/from-stonehenge-to-icelands-arctic-henge-by-motorbike-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jun/21/from-stonehenge-to-icelands-arctic-henge-by-motorbike-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"From Stonehenge to Iceland's Arctic Henge, by motorbike – photo essay","bodyText":"Like Stonehenge in southern England, Arctic Henge acts as a kind of huge sundial, capturing sunlight and casting shadows. It has four aligned six-metre-high gates with a 10-metre central column. When completed it will be 52 metres in diameter. It is still being built from locally quarried basalt rock on an outcrop of land in north-east Iceland, overlooking the remote village of Raufarhöfn – the corner of the mainland closest to the Arctic Circle. Once one of the most important ports for fish processing and the export of herring products, Raufarhöfn fell into decline after the collapse of the industry in the 1960s. The late Erlingur Thoroddsen, a resident hotelier, conceived and began construction of the Arctic Henge in 1996, partly to help revive the town. When I relocated to Iceland from London in 2015 to write a book, I sold both my motorcycles. I had been riding since I was 16 and withdrawal soon set in. Then last summer, I heard that a friend from the UK was selling a 250cc Kawasaki TR250. In September I flew to London and bought the bike. I mapped a route to ride it back to Iceland, from Stonehenge to Heimskautsgerðið (Arctic Henge). To avoid the motorways I decided to take the scenic route on what would be the longest solo journey on a motorcycle I had ever made, 3,500km from southern England through France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, the Faroe Islands and across Iceland. Arriving in Amesbury, Wiltshire, traffic was bumper to bumper on the A303, but on the bike, I was able to make good progress. At Stonehenge, instead of getting the bus to the actual site, I doubled back and found a turning onto a potholed lane where a few motorhomes were parked up. I had a picnic, and from across the field of sheep, peacefully observed the ancient stones and their swarm of visitors. After crossing the channel on Eurotunnel, I drove around 350km nearly every day as I made my way through Europe to the ferry in Hirtshals, in the north of Denmark. I stopped off at the homes of friends, or hotels when needed. As I drove further north the land transitioned from the green end of summer, to the burgundy of autumn. Germany is full of surprisingly green fields, wind turbines, and the occasional telecom tower All 250km of tree-lined winding roads from Osnabrück to Hamburg were bathed in beautiful sunshine. National elections were coming up in a few weeks and posters were festooned everywhere. The occasional wrong turn had me driving past farmhouses and cornfields. In Hamburg I sailed around the city’s waterways on the no. 72 harbour commuter ferry, taking in the sights and the soothing sensation of being on a boat in calm water. The smokestacks of factories puffed swirling clouds into the blue sky as we floated past cranes and modern buildings. From Hamburg (above) I drove to Puttgarden for the ferry to Rødby in Denmark. Arriving in Copenhagen, I headed straight to Wrenchmonkees, a custom motorcycle garage. Here Jonathan, who races professionally, invited me for a ride at Malmö Motorstadion the next day. Driving from Denmark to Sweden across the towering, 8km-long Øresund bridge had my heart pounding and a huge smile plastered on my face. Wrenchmonkees in Copenhagen is famous in the motorbiking world The chance to ride at Malmö Motorstadion made me realise that while my bike was built for dirt track racing, I was not. The voyage from Hirtshals on the northern tip of Jutland to Tórshavn, capital of the Faroe Islands, takes 36 hours on the MS Norröna (Denmark to Iceland with a stop in Tórshavn from about €320 one-way low season with motorbike and some meals, single cabin, smyrilline.com). It was low season so the ship was not very crowded. Other passengers included senior tourist groups, young European travellers, and commuters. We sat on the top deck under heaters enjoying the view and draught beer. With restaurants, bars, a pool, sauna, movie theatre, a gym, and outdoor hot tubs, it feels more like a cruise than a North Sea crossing A day and a half after leaving Jutland we docked in Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands at 5am. I rolled off the ship in darkness. The ground was steady but my stomach still swayed. I slowly made my way up the harbour to the nearby Hotel Hafnia. The Faroes are an archipelago made up of 18 islands connected by sea tunnels, bridges and ferries. The next morning I drove to the island of Vágar in near zero visibility and strong winds. The winding mountain roads along rocky cliffs (without railings) were breathtaking but terrifying on the motorbike. I was grateful for the windless 5km sea tunnel that joins the main island of Streymoy (where Tórshavn is) to the island of Vágar. Locals in the Faroes spoke about the growing number of visitors and hoped the influx wouldn’t overwhelm their lives and infrastructure On Vágar I took a walk from my hotel. I could see roads snaking like a distant continuation of the path I was on, just beyond the ocean’s bay. Sheep and traditional black houses dotted the fjord which felt more sombre than the images I’d seen on Instagram. The Faroe Islands have an otherworldly feel to them. This image, taken on the island of Vágar, is photographed in infrared The 19-hour voyage to Iceland was forecast to be more turbulent than the one from Denmark. As soon as I checked in, I took motion sickness pills. With medication on my side, I spent the evening enjoying a meal of fish tempura and roasted vegetables despite the boat taking on six-metre swells. I was told that sitting in water could help with motion sickness so I hired one of the outdoor hot tubs for a soak A calm sunrise arrival into Seyðisfjörður was overshadowed by news that a storm was due to hit the area that evening. I was booked into Grásteinn (doubles from about £150 B&amp;B) on Holt sheep farm in Þórshöfn, 225km to the north (five hours drive away) on a working sheep farm in Þórshöfn. If I left immediately, I would make it. The promise of friendly faces and roast lamb was enough to galvanise me. On just a couple of hours’ sleep, I began the ascent from Seyðisfjörður. Taking the ring road out of Egilsstaðir, the wind picked up and the chill began to penetrate. There was snow on the peaks ahead. After 83km I turned off onto Route 85 and climbed to Vöpnafjörður. This road traverses gorges and rivers. I felt like I was driving into endless sky. Riding is a meditation. So much of modern life is constructed to keep us out of our environments, disconnected from them, or each other. “Safe”. This is an antidote to that I was greeted at Grásteinn guesthouse by the dogs first, then the farmers Hildur and Siggi, their children and their German “workaway” Romi who showed me to my cabin. Unplugged from world media for weeks, I learned that the Iceland football team was due to play a key World Cup qualification match against Kosovo. Needless to say, the country was dizzy over it. The ram auction that Saturday in Raufarhöfn meant we would all go together. The farmers loaded their rams into a truck and I readied my bike for the one-hour drive to the Arctic Henge. After winding my way through the green and burnt-orange moss-covered lava fields, I turned into the stark area around Raufarhöfn. Not many tourists make it this far off the ring road, but the Arctic Henge is changing that. Leaving the city limits of Akureyri, northern Iceland As the triangular peaks of the four gates emerged on the horizon, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. A handful of tourists were walking among the stone columns and marvelling at their size with outstretched arms. I parked the bike and Romi drove up behind me. Grinning, I asked her to take a photo of me in full gear. It was October 7 and I had covered more than 3,500km. After one more night’s rest, I completed the journey to Reykajvík via the northern ring road stopping overnight in Akureyri. I then drove the familiar majestic winding blacktop roads towards Borgarnes on the west coast, across the bridge spanning the Borgarfjörður fjord, and was home. Iceland qualified for the World Cup two hours later.

Next to the story was a photo of young children holding guns, implying that the children separated from their parents are gun-toting criminals. The children in the photo were not traumatised minors who crossed the US-Mexico border with their parents. They weren’t even from Central America – they were Syrians. The photo had been taken in Syria in 2012 by photojournalist Christiaan Triebert, and was a blatantly misleading attempt to try to find some way to make the border policy seem legitimate. Drudge’s story ran as public figures, religious leaders and politicians on both sides of the aisle condemned the administration’s policy as unusually cruel. In the face of a growing outrage over Donald Trump’s policy on the forced separation of children and their asylum-seeking parents at the southern border, the administration presented a united, defiant front on Monday. “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” the president said at a speech in the morning, before calling for the establishment of a “space force”. Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, dug in her heels: “We will not apologize for the job we do or for the job law enforcement does, for doing the job that the American people expect us to do.”Despite that, staunchest Trump partisans have remained steadfast in support of the separation policy, or dismissive of what they’re calling alarmist rhetoric from the left. Some, such as Ann Coulter, who claimed on Fox News that the children crying in camps are actors, have taken to deception. Others, such as Breitbart News Tonight host Joel Pollak, who tweeted about his visit to a detention center Friday, are trying to just put a brave face on the situation: Another common practice among Trump supporters has been conflating the separation of children of parents lawfully seeking asylum with the news of Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign head, being sent to prison over the weekend. It was an argument pushed forth by Rush Limbaugh, who said on his radio show that Manafort had been “officially been separated from his family”. Fox News host Jesse Watters compared the adult children of white collar criminals with minors on the border. “They want to lock up Eric. They want to lock up Don Jr and they want to lock up Ivanka, and they’ve done nothing wrong. And now they’re upset because illegal alien families are being broken up?” he said on his show. Katie Pavlich, Townhall.com editor and Fox contributor, used a similar argument: Conservative radio host Steve Deace, author of the book We Won’t Get Fooled Again about the Christian right, wondered what differed here from when parents go to war. Bill Mitchell, the ubiquitous Trump supporter, continued his string of consecutive days on Twitter by throwing out all manner of convoluted justifications in the apparent hope one might stick. He later followed up with a clarification: “You know who REALLY hates illegal immigration? Black voters.” He did not indicate where he found this purported fact. Like Mitchell, Tomi Lahren attempted to shift the onus for the separations back onto the true villains, the desperate asylum seekers. “[P]arents could stop schlepping their kids over the border illegally,” she offered as a solution in response to a Bill Clinton quote about the cruelty of the practice. Laura Ingraham similarly attempted to shift our attention to a different set of crimes being committed, in this case much like the president himself has often done, highlighting questionable statistics about how lawless and violent immigrants are once they arrive in the country. She was another commentator who compared child detention centres to “summer camps”. On r/The_Donald, the Reddit gathering place for Trump supporters, much of that sort of rhetoric has dominated the front page, including a story from Breitbart about an “illegal alien animal” from Mexico who is alleged to have murdered a young boy. A conversation on that thread revolved around the most effective term for referring to undocumented people in the country. “I prefer ‘criminal alien’ over ‘illegal alien’,” one commenter wrote. “It sounds more scary.” Perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that Laura Bush criticized the administration, but others on the right have been more surprising dissenters. Bill O’Reilly said: “The government should know how bad this looks and how innocent children are actually suffering. That kind of scenario is unacceptable to most Americans, as exemplified by former first lady Laura Bush’s withering criticism.” Whether it was his sincere conviction or cynical political calculation it’s hard to say. Alan Dershowitz, recently seen on television as a Trump surrogate, tried to appeal to the president’s better nature. “You have to end this policy,” he said, referring to the trauma the children were suffering. “You’re better than this,” he added. That strident plea came on Fox &amp; Friends, whose hosts spent the morning arguing over the semantics of what does and does not constitute a cage. Florida governor Rick Scott said that he is not in favor of the separation policy, but maintained support for stricter immigration policies. Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker announced a surprise reversal in his decision to send his state’s national guard to the border, calling the separation of children “inhumane”. “Family separation is wicked,” Nebraska senator Ben Sasse wrote on Facebook, adding his dismay. “It is harmful to kids and absolutely should NOT be the default US policy. Americans are better than this.” A Quinnipiac poll found that while 66% of Americans opposed the policy of enforced separation on the whole, among Republicans 55% support it and only 35% are against it. “When does public opinion become a demand that politicians just can’t ignore?” Quinnipiac’s assistant director, Tim Malloy, said in a statement about the polling. That question remains unclear, but it seems likely that as the debate over the Trump administration policy continues, we’re going to soon find out. If the recent past has shown us anything, it’s that Trump has a way of getting the Republican party to fall in line with any number of policies they previously opposed. Just ask Kirstjen Nielsen. She was against the separations before she was for it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/20/medical-cannabis-billy-caldwell-seizures","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"Don’t deny my daughter the cannabis that could save her | Memuna Forna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/20/medical-cannabis-billy-caldwell-seizures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/20/medical-cannabis-billy-caldwell-seizures","fields":{"headline":"Don’t deny my daughter the cannabis that could save her","bodyText":"Billy Caldwell is a 12-year-old boy with severe epilepsy. Last week, British airport officials confiscated the cannabis oil his mother was using to treat his condition, because the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) it contains is illegal in the UK. He ended up in hospital after his seizures intensified. After the intervention of Billy’s doctors, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, has allowed the return of the drug on the grounds that this situation was a “medical emergency”. Today William Hague, who advocated a “zero-tolerance” approach to cannabis when he was Tory leader, says he has changed his mind, and that Billy’s case “provides one of those illuminating moments when a longstanding policy is revealed to be inappropriate”. And, in a statement to the Commons, Javid proposed a government review of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. I’m pleased about this – and feel particular sympathy for the Caldwell family. My daughter Sia is 17 years old and, like Billy, experiences severe seizures. Sia had her first when she was a little over two years old. Initially we were told it was a febrile seizure resulting from a high temperature; then that she’d probably grow out of it, or that the right medication would provide seizure control. In the beginning, her seizures came occasionally, out of the blue. Then they were monthly. Now they happen daily. They knock her over, throw her off her chair, make her unable to sleep, and keep her permanently exhausted. Over the course of her illness, I have logged every single visible seizure she has had. She has hundreds more, which we don’t see. Last week I spent seven days with her in bed. She had eight seizures, one after the other. She lay curled up like a foetus and couldn’t eat or drink. I syringed water and Calogen, a food supplement, into her mouth during her lucid moments. By the end of the week she had lost another three kilos. We have been through pretty much the entire spectrum of seizure medication. As we ran out of traditional treatments, we became more experimental – homeopathy, osteopathy. Then we were enrolled on a trial with Great Ormond Street hospital for the ketogenic diet: a high-fat, low-carb diet that can sometimes have a dramatic effect on children with drug-resistant epilepsy. It was helpful for Sia, but she had to come off it when her cholesterol levels rose dangerously high. Recently she had a vagal nerve stimulator implanted. This sends small electric currents up the vagus nerve to the brain, and is one of the few treatments available to patients when all else has failed. It helps a little. Naturally, we want to be able to access anything that has a chance of reducing the number and severity of her seizures. Were cannabis oil available on prescription, there’s no question we would want to trial it. It’s our duty as a family to explore every available avenue when it comes to our daughter’s treatment. Because ever since that first seizure, we’ve lost her, bit by bit. Our tiny, bubbly two-year-old, who engaged everyone in conversation, rode her tricycle round the park, and was developmentally ahead of her peer group, is now nonverbal, almost completely wheelchair-bound, and needs 24-hour one-to-one care. In the past year, she has begun to lose her ability to eat and drink orally. She is now on the waiting list for a feeding tube so food and water can be carried directly into her stomach. In the UK, our attitude to marijuana is at best inconsistent and at worst – as Billy Caldwell’s case shows – highly damaging. Its recreational popularity means politicians treat it as a social problem rather than a possible source of treatment for desperately ill people. Concerns about its function as a gateway drug, and evidence that it can cause mental illness in heavy users, have traditionally been at forefront of public debate. Unfortunately, this has meant that its potential as a medicine has been neglected. As well as seizures, cannabis or substances derived from it have been shown to be helpful in alleviating pain and muscle spasms, and studies suggest it may also be a useful component of cancer therapy. The Royal College of Nursing has voted in favour of legalising marijuana for medical purposes. Many MPs are of the same opinion – a 2016 report by the all-party parliamentary group on drug reform called the UK’s refusal to recognise the medical value of cannabis “irrational”. Many US states now allow the drug’s medical use, as does Canada. Germany legalised cannabis for medical purposes last year. Two cannabis-derived prescription drugs – Sativex, licensed for multiple sclerosis, and Nabilone, for nausea associated with cancer treatment – are available in the UK. More may follow. But the process of developing a new drug and getting it approved is a lengthy and expensive one. Each one of Sia’s seizures damages her that little bit more. What we would like to see is a more compassionate approach to the medical use of cannabis – one that accepts it is going to be some time before it is legally available in the UK, but acknowledges that there are patients for whom it is a lifeline. For these people, it should be easily accessible, on prescription, and should not require a stressful and highly complex application for a special licence. No mother should have to go to the lengths that Charlotte Caldwell did just to keep her son well. No one should be forced to break the law to access a medicine that could alleviate their suffering or save their life. Currently anyone found possessing cannabis in Britain can be sentenced to up to five years in prison. A review is welcome, and I sincerely hope it leads to a rethink. A longstanding policy has indeed been revealed to be inappropriate, and it must change. • Memuna Forna is a writer, campaigner and parent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/19/child-separation-camps-trump-border-policy-backlash-republicans","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T18:23:44Z","webTitle":"Child separations: Trump faces extreme backlash from public and his own party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/19/child-separation-camps-trump-border-policy-backlash-republicans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/19/child-separation-camps-trump-border-policy-backlash-republicans","fields":{"headline":"Child separations: Trump faces extreme backlash from public and his own party","bodyText":"Donald Trump heads to Capitol Hill on Tuesday afternoon facing an extraordinary backlash from his own party – and the American public – over his policy of separating children from their parents at the southern US border. The separations occur when, under a “zero tolerance” immigration policy, adults are arrested for crossing the border illegally. As children cannot be held in an adult jail, they are held separately. According to a Quinnipiac University national poll, two in three voters oppose the separations. Outcry from Democratic and Republican politicians, former first ladies, churches, commentators and business leaders is gathering momentum. The president, however, seems determined only to up the ante. On Tuesday morning he tweeted that Democrats want undocumented migrants “to pour into and infest our country”. In a lunchtime speech to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), he said the US had two options: “Totally open borders or criminal prosecution for lawbreaking.” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, asked: “When does public opinion become a demand that politicians just can’t ignore? Two-thirds of American voters oppose the family separation policy at our borders. Neither quotes from the Bible nor get-tough talk can soften the images of crying children nor reverse the pain so many Americans feel.” Trump’s campaign was built around a tough stance on immigration, with “build the wall” a frequent chant at his rallies. He is now losing the battle for public opinion, though support among his base is resilient. For example, Republicans support the zero tolerance policy at the border by 55% to 35%, the Quinnipiac survey found. And while national voters oppose building a wall on the border with Mexico by 58% to 39%, three in four Republicans back it. One issue does cross the divide. Four in five voters support allowing undocumented migrants brought to the US as children, so-called “Dreamers”, to remain and apply for citizenship. According to the Quinnipiac poll, which questioned 905 voters nationwide from 14 to 17 June, support ranges from 61% to 28% among Republicans to 94% to 5% among Democrats. Public reaction to the border policy – according to the Department of Homeland Security, from 5 May to 9 June 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 adults – is disquieting many Republicans facing midterm elections in November. An editorial in the Wall Street Journal warned the party’s feuding over immigration is fast becoming “an election-year nightmare”. The conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt was quoted by the Axios website as saying this could be “Trump’s Katrina” – a reference to the 2005 hurricane that devastated both New Orleans and the reputation of George W Bush. Trump, who could end the crisis with a phone call, was scheduled to meet House Republicans on Tuesday afternoon in what could turn into a heated confrontation in an already sweltering Washington. His homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, has insisted: “Congress alone can fix it.” The president is offering no concessions. “Democrats are the problem,” he wrote on Twitter. “They don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13. They can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!” But where Republicans have previously followed Trump’s lead, prompting comparisons to a cult, the emotive images and sounds of children in fenced cages are prompting a growing number to speak out. Fred Upton, a congressman from Michigan, urged an immediate end to the “ugly and inhumane practice”, adding: “It’s never acceptable to use kids as bargaining chips in political process.” John McCain of Arizona, a frequent Trump critic, tweeted: “The administration’s current family separation policy is an affront to the decency of the American people, and contrary to principles and values upon which our nation was founded. The administration has the power to rescind this policy. It should do so now.” Despite previously asserting that it would oppose any fix aimed solely at addressing the plight of children separated from their parents, the White House acknowledged on Tuesday that it is reviewing emergency legislation introduced by Ted Cruz, the hardline senator who faces a re-election fight in Texas, to keep families together. Asked if the White House supports the Cruz measure, Mercedes Schlapp, the director of strategic communications, told reporters: “We’re looking into the legislative text on the Cruz bill.” In his NFIB speech, however, Trump took a stand against Cruz’s proposal, which would attempt to speed up the review of immigration cases by doubling the number of judges. “I don’t want judges,” the president said. “I want border security. I don’t want to try people. I don’t want people coming in.” Other legislation is in the works in both the House and Senate, aiming to spare Republicans from a PR disaster. Democrats have been paying personal visits to detention centres in Texas and demanding the resignation of Nielsen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, told reporters on Tuesday that “all of the Senators of the Republican conference” support a plan that would allow children to stay with their parents in family detention centers, ending the current practice of separating families. “We need to fix the problem and it requires a legislative solution,” McConnell told reporters during a weekly press conference. The issue animated their weekly lunch and a consensus emerged that Congress must act, possibly as early as this week, leaders said. But Democratic leaders disagree, arguing that the president can halt this process with this “flick of a pen”. “You alone can fix this,” the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said to Trump, holding out his pen to emphasize how quickly the practice could be stopped. Pressed on why Democrats were reluctant to work with Republicans on legislation that addressed family separations, Schumer pointed to the Congress’ long history of inaction on immigration. “How many times has immigration legislation passed in this Congress? How many times? Zero,” he said, adding that the measure is an “excuse by our Republican colleagues who feel the heat”. There has been condemnation from religious leaders and from business. In Dublin, Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, told the Irish Times: “It’s heartbreaking to see the images and hear the sounds of the kids. Kids are the most vulnerable people in any society. I think that what’s happening is inhumane, it needs to stop.” In Mexico, less than a fortnight away from a presidential election, politicians lined up to denounce the separations. Candidate Ricardo Anaya said the treatment of children recalled “terrifying images” of Nazis separating mothers from their children. His rival, José Antonio Meade, denounced an unacceptable “horror”. In Mexico City, the foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, expressed his government’s “most categorical and energetic condemnation” of the policy. The majority of the children affected were from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, he said, while only about 1% were Mexican. Even so, he said, Mexico had “both a moral and a constitutional responsibility” to push back against “a cruel policy, an inhuman policy”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jul/06/being-sexually-abused-as-a-child-left-me-unable-to-trust-partners","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-06T14:00:04Z","webTitle":"Being sexually abused as a child has left me unable to trust partners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/06/being-sexually-abused-as-a-child-left-me-unable-to-trust-partners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/06/being-sexually-abused-as-a-child-left-me-unable-to-trust-partners","fields":{"headline":"Being sexually abused as a child has left me unable to trust partners","bodyText":"I’m 29 and in many ways successful: I’ve got top degrees, am reliable, have caring friends, a good job and own my own home. But I was sexually abused for many years as a small child. In my mid-20s, I had therapy, but stopped when I was able to have sex without having panic attacks. Most of the time, I’m fine. I disconnect from the child that was hurt and don’t feel like a victim. I’m proud of how hard I’ve worked to achieve stability. I am still capable of seeing the best in people, and know that other people have far heavier burdens. My problem is with intimate relationships. I’ve had several boyfriends, but I have never been able to let myself trust or rely on them. Six months ago, I met someone, but when he learned about my history he didn’t feel he had the capacity to deal with it. I acted as if this was fine, but inside it felt like a tsunami of pain had broken loose. Being rejected on the basis of my past has once again made me feel small, damaged and unlovable. I don’t really understand how what happened 20 years ago still has so much power, or why none of my positive experiences, love or analytical ability can counteract it. I can only assume that because he started abusing me when I was so young and for so long, he corrupted something really central in me. I don’t want to go back to therapy (it was like torture, and put my family under stress). And I don’t want to give up on meeting someone. You’ve certainly done everything you can to distance yourself from your abuser, but this powerful edifice you’ve built – your life – has vulnerable foundations and we need to look at these. I consulted two people: Peter Saunders, the founder of Napac (National Association for People Abused in Childhood, napac.org.uk), himself an abuse survivor, and Lee Smith, a psychoanalyst (bpc.org.uk). Smith felt that, although “you have built this phenomenally successful life, your abuser is still behind it and you seem to fear risking the stability you have. Continuing to open yourself up [to hurt in relationships] feels high-risk.” And the higher you’re climbing, the greater the fear of falling. I know you said therapy was super-painful, but as Smith points out: “It’s not the therapy that’s making it torture, but what happened to you.” You may not want to hear this, but I think more therapeutic talk is the key here. I’m sorry your family was put under stress, but this is about you and getting the help you need now. Presumably it was someone within your family, or close to it, who abused you, and that can be difficult for survivors to acknowledge. You may feel you want to protect your family; I sense you spend a lot of time thinking of others. “You can’t protect everybody,” Saunders advised. Smith and Saunders said trust is a huge hurdle for abuse survivors, so it’s no surprise you find it hard to open up to someone. I think you’ve also minimised the effect your most recent boyfriend had on you by not being able to “handle” your history (in your mind, your history = you). But not all men will be like this, I promise; you shouldn’t give up on relationships. Without wanting to minimise what you’re going through, lots of people struggle with intimacy in relationships, even without abuse in their past. Your past is yours: you don’t have to discuss it with a new partner if you don’t want to, and when you do so is up to you. You’re in control. I asked Saunders what helped him in his recovery and he said that even now he has regular therapy. I put your core question to him: “Why does this still affect me?” He said, “The simplest way I can describe it is like this: when a child is abused, it’s like someone pulling the wires out of an electrical circuit. You can put the wires back, but there will always be damage underneath. You’ll always get some short-circuiting until the damage is repaired with therapy.” Perhaps you need to look at getting more help, to reinforce what you’ve worked so hard to build up. • Napac helpline: 0808 801 0331; there is also some beneficial reading material online.

Actually, we all do","bodyText":"‘Crritic!” This is the final, victorious insult in a war of words between Vladimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, voicing the disdain for reviewers felt by the playwright and artists the world over, then and since. Some of that contempt for the critic has surfaced once more this week, giving rise to a debate about the role of reviewers in the new film landscape. Last Wednesday, speaking at the Crystal + Lucy Awards, Brie Larson took aim at the lack of diversity in film criticism. “I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn’t work for him about A Wrinkle in Time,” she said. “It wasn’t made for him.” In the wake of these comments, the cast of the poorly reviewed Ocean’s 8 were asked for a response, with Mindy Kaling (who also starred in A Wrinkle in Time) calling the gender balance of film reviewing “unfair”. Cate Blanchett said: “The conversation has to change.” More recently, the makers of the critically reviled Gotti put out a marketing campaign that hinged on undermining critics, after reviewers called the film “a perfectly nonsensical disaster story for our times” and “Drabfellas”. There are several distinct and important questions to unpick here. The first of these, which is the most easily answered, is about the primacy – and inaccuracy – of the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes in determining the critical consensus. Larson’s beef was mainly with that website, which labels a film “fresh” if a majority of reviews are deemed to be broadly positive and “rotten” if a majority of those are seen to be negative overall. Aside from the distinctly ropey statistics, which trample the ambivalence and mitigation in most film reviews, the site also has a bias in its constituent reviewers, in favour of the more Roger Ebert-y looking sort of person. Larson is right that we need to hear a number of critical voices offering a different perspective. The result of a greater increase in female critics being heard could signal a shift in the sort of films we see lauded: only last week, Jessica Ellis pointedly asked: “Why is Stand By Me considered a classic and Now and Then considered a movie for little girls?” I agree that we badly need to change the film landscape. Recent studies have shown that of the top 250 highest-grossing films of 2017, 8% were directed by women, while in the top 100 films, women made up only 24% of the protagonists. But the answer to this is complicated and lies in studios giving female film-makers greater responsibility, rather than in assuming female critics will give female-focused films an easy ride. As for the idea that we should only be hearing from children about A Wrinkle in Time – no. It’s important to recognise the cultural specificity of films, but we should do so without pandering to demographics and ghettoising commentary. Perhaps some of this disconnect has to do with the dominance of the film franchise, as outlined in an excellent article by Stephen Metcalf in the New Yorker. The success of superhero blockbusters, which hauls in viewers by carefully catering to audience demands, may have obviated some need for the reviewer and led to a distrust of the critical class. A secondary question brought up by this debate centres on the role of the film critic nowadays. What do people actually want from the critic? It seems to be a more relevant question now than ever, partly due to the changing landscape of filmgoing, partly because of everybody’s ability to be a critic if they so choose. The reviewer is no longer always first to the film, and there have been a number of notable discrepancies between critical consensus and public opinion, from La La Land to Three Billboards, the latter of which prompted Ashley Clark to tweet: “The majority of the consensus-building bloc in film criticism is white and male, and it’s not massively surprising that some of what makes this film objectionable to many didn’t resonate.” Twitter often fulfils the function, now, of a rejoinder or corrective to what is seen as the critical viewpoint. When I review a film I am mindful of the punter I was and am, who expends £15, a whole evening and all their hope on a movie that turns out to be a dud. But it is not the reviewer’s job to provide an advisory service, a shopping guide, to the filmgoer. We need a full understanding of criticism, one that grants it more credit than a tweet or a user review. Film critics are film lovers who have chosen this path because we believe in cinema as an art form. Perhaps the best option for film lovers, who now have so many options at their disposal in order to form an impression of a film’s quality – from unbelievably long and plot-revealing trailers to tweets and vlogs – would be simply to accept that the best film criticism is an art that can help to unfold beauty. Like the best teacher, a great review can reveal new facets of a film to you and cause your thinking to depart on a new tack; it can lead the writer to reach new heights. Too often our thinking can be thin.

When the owner suggested that she bought the tower and his 18th-century house behind it, she jettisoned caution and said yes. “I’d been looking for somewhere to buy: this place is unique.” Since she set up her first gallery at home in south London, Wiseman has always been an advocate of living with the art that she sells. But the Aldeburgh Beach Lookout is no conventional gallery, “It’s a place where artists can come for a week’s residency. We ask them to respond to the setting in innovative ways, with dance, film, sculpture or poetry,” she says. She also invites artists to stay in the pastel-hued house which she shares with her partner, Francis Carnwath, a former deputy director of the Tate. Built in the mid-19th century, the tower served as a lookout for locals to spot ships in trouble. Later, the tower and adjoining boathouse were used for storage by fishermen. When Wiseman first saw the lookout it was “wind-bashed” but beguiling. “For 30 years the author Laurens van der Post used the second-floor room for writing. It was untouched,” says Wiseman, who preserved the original feel of the interior, with its vertiginous metal staircase. She made few changes to the house, apart from knocking through to the nextdoor cottage, bought from the same owner. “We took a section of wall out of the first floor to link the sitting room with my office,” she explains. On the ground floor a door leads from the dining room to the living room in the cottage. On a midsummer’s day, the interior is uncluttered, welcoming. The walls and floors are painted white and sunshine floods through the new French windows, which open from the cottage on to the shingle beach. Throughout the house you find heirlooms and antiques, including folkish pieces found in upstate New York, where Wiseman used to live, mixed with contemporary art, ceramics and sculpture and 20th-century work by artists such as Terry Frost, some for sale by appointment. “Art isn’t a commodity: it’s about stories, the ideas behind pieces and creating an emotional connection with them,” says Wiseman. “I’ve always believed it’s easier to convey that in a domestic setting.” One of her favourite spots is the sheltered terrace, dominated by a face sculpture by Henry Piper made from bicycle parts with car lights for eyes, their glint visible from afar. “This is my spot for reading, thinking, what I call zezzing,” says Wiseman. She was drawn to Aldeburgh by its cultural atmosphere and her exhibitions never shy away from mind-stretching themes. The latest, Einstein and Picasso, draws parallels between the ways in which the artist and scientist viewed space and time: Picasso through Cubism, Einstein relativity. The indefatigable Wiseman has even written a play about power in the art world (key characters include Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin) which made its debut at the Edinburgh Festival. The graphic black-and-white painting in the dining room is a prop from the play. “I’d sold a piece and needed something punchy to fill the gap,” says Wiseman. From here, glass doors lead to the kitchen where Wiseman stripped paint off the walls for a rustic farmhouse effect. A wide cabinet came from Wiseman’s previous home in south London, along with the Aga, which was dismantled and painstakingly reassembled. “We are always entertaining so it’s ideal for slow cooking fish we’ve bought on the beach,” she says. In summer, guests spill out into the boathouse. Many former residents, including Clara Drummond, who won the BP Portrait Prize, have gone on to find success. Drummond’s striking drawing of a horse hangs in the sitting room, where windows look on to the tower. “We encourage our artists to experiment,” says Wiseman. It is a remit that has lured even established artists. Tai Shan Schierenberg (another BP prize winner), the Turner Prize nominee Alison Wilding and Royal Academicians Eileen Cooper, Sir Peter Blake and sculptor Nigel Hall have found inspiration in the tower where van der Post’s room is furnished evocatively with a Suffolk chair, table and candlestick. Every residency culminates in a show. In summer, bellinis flow and visitors are asked to write something “about the meaning of existence” on the pebbles piled on a wooden table outside. “We took a gamble when we moved here but it’s paid off,” reflects Wiseman. “It can be bleak in winter but it’s always beautiful… It’s a place that inspires you to be creative, and ambitious.” Einstein and Picasso: Revolutionaries in Space and Time is on from 7 to 27 July, (aldeburghbeachlookout.com).

James Purnell said the BBC was facing an existential threat because young people spent more time watching Netflix than BBC terrestrial TV or iPlayer, and preferred to listen to music using services such as Spotify than on the corporation’s stable of radio stations. The BBC is increasingly aware that it needs to prove the value of the £150.50 annual licence fee to younger Britons who are used to streaming commercial content on their laptops and smartphones. In a speech to the European Broadcasting Union, Purnell said the BBC was for everyone. “Everyone benefits because everyone pays. And everyone pays so everyone must benefit.” He said he no longer cared about Rajars - the industry measure of radio audience numbers - and said BBC Radio’s objective was to retain its existing listeners while reaching new audiences in different ways. Purnell warned that tough competition from commercial radio groups, such as Global, which owns Classic FM and Heart, or Bauer, which controls the Absolute and Magic brands, could result in stations scoring short-term victories “while we all lost the war”. “Rather than focus on how big our slice of the pie is, we should grow its overall size, we should get more people listening to radio and podcasts,” he said. Purnell – who was a Labour minister in Gordon Brown’s government – urged the media regulator, Ofcom, to drop rules on the number of hours allocated to different genres on BBC radio networks. Instead, he wants the corporation to be judged by the number of people it reaches. Overall listenership to speech radio has remained steady in the UK while the market for podcasts has expanded rapidly, especially among younger listeners who are less likely to listen to the radio in cars. The BBC dominates the British podcast market, with a third of listeners finding their favourite downloads on the corporation’s website, according to the most recent report by Ofcom. This has raised concerns among some independent producers that the corporation’s success is blocking the development of a commercial UK podcast industry. Purnell said the shift away from traditional television to streaming services was “beyond the tipping point” and the BBC was attempting to catch-up by modernising its iPlayer service."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/24/forty-years-since-fat-is-a-feminist-issue","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T11:00:24Z","webTitle":"Forty years since Fat Is A Feminist Issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/24/forty-years-since-fat-is-a-feminist-issue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/24/forty-years-since-fat-is-a-feminist-issue","fields":{"headline":"Forty years since Fat Is A Feminist Issue","bodyText":"When I sat down to write Fat Is A Feminist Issue 40 years ago I never dreamed, or feared, it would still be in print today. I naively hoped my book would change the world. By analysing and suggesting solutions to body and eating problems, I imagined they would disappear. But in truth, of course, when I was writing about girls’ and women’s body and eating problems, I was writing about inequality, too. And inequality is stubborn. It didn’t look it in 1978, at the height of what we now call second wave feminism. Everything was up for being rethought – families, bodies, education, science, medicine, class, racism, money, sex. When feminism first appeared, I hadn’t much understood it. At school, we were encouraged to compete with boys for Oxbridge places while soaking in knowledge which would, when the time came for marriage, delight and please our husbands. It seemed ever so dull. Then, suddenly the Sixties spoke to women about their own experience. There was a spectacular protest at the Miss America beauty contest in New Jersey in 1968. There, a woman’s body was marked up as a cow ready for butchering, while a “freedom” trash can was ready for women to dump in bras and hair rollers, and pots and pans. It was the first hint that the way we personally felt about (and suffered) beauty, bodies and caring was a social issue. It looked like the world was changing. And when I published Fat Is A Feminist Issue, the message was taken to a wide audience through women’s magazines such as Woman’s Own, aimed mainly at working-class mothers. Fat Is A Feminist Issue talked about our lived experience: how preoccupied we could become with eating, not eating and avoiding fat. Emotionally schooled to see our value as both sexual beings for others and midwives to their desires, we found ourselves often depleted and empty, and caught up in a kind of compulsive giving. Eating became our source of soothing. We stopped our mouths with food, and I proposed we could learn to exchange food – when we weren’t hungry – for words. So far so good. Many of us started challenging the homogeneity of what constituted beauty. We stopped worrying and dared to live from our bodies. But we never saw the backlash coming, or the ingenious forms it would take, from the now rather innocent (“Because you’re worth it”) to the downright nefarious practices of industries that were growing rich on the making of body insecurity. And that was way before social media and the beauty bloggers with their, yes, millions of followers, would begin to reap money as daily beauty labour got instituted in a way that before then perhaps only a Hollywood makeup artist would recognise. Beauty work became relentless and, with it, the ubiquity of judgment and failure. Judgments and failures which, once internalised, destabilised girls’ relationship to their bodies and – as if that wasn’t enough – created an insecurity that hurt their minds. The story of the past 40 years is grim. It’s a story of malice, of greed and of mendacity. Not content with destabilising the eating of many western women and exporting body hatred all over the world as a sign of modernity, the combined forces of what investigative health reporter Alicia Mundy so aptly termed “Obesity Inc” set about to create new so-called disease entities; these would medicalise and pathologise people’s relationship to food and bodies so successfully that vast industries would grow up to treat problems that these industries had themselves instigated. In January we learned that one in three women in the UK won’t go for their smear tests. Why? Is it because they don’t know about them? No, they are invited by their doctors by text, email and letter. Why then? Because they feel so bad about their bodies. This should alarm us. And yet sadly it doesn’t, because we know how ubiquitous bad body feeling is. It is constantly stoked by visual images which invade us, by pronouncements disguised as health directives, by blandishments to do, be, brand, mark ourselves in ways that reward not the human body as a place we dwell in but as an object to enhance the profits of the beauty, fashion, diet, cosmetic surgery, food and exercise industries, no matter one’s age. So what has changed? Go back 20 years. The porn industry is being mainstreamed. Fashion magazines are normalising pornographic images of girls. Pre-teen girls with legs spread wide apart are looking to camera with a combination of allure, innocence and nonchalance. The girls who read them start going for Brazilian waxes. They don’t learn about labias and clitorises in school, they learn about how to put on a condom. Their genitals are not to be in view for themselves. And when they are in view, they are presented as inadequate and available for labiaplasty. If we go back four years, we see the development of cosmetic surgery apps, games marketed to little girls in which they prepare for the surgery they will have when they are old enough. Already at six they will have been targeted with make-up and fashion and bras. Hourly vigilance is yet to come but the notion of a body ready and available for reconstruction is firmly planted. Indeed, many a girl will already have seen baby pictures of herself that have been digitally altered, so that the idea of “perfecting” and “fixing” becomes part of just what is. It is as normalised as the troubled eating she can expect in her journey through life. By the time they become preteens, girls have been living on their smartphones. That is where life happens and the saturation of the screen with images and likes, with its constant entreaty to be approved of, should give us pause. Beauty labour has become part of girls’ and women’s lives and now that feminism is back on the agenda we can say, once again, part of our oppression. But, of course, it isn’t experienced like that. It is felt as the expression of personal agency, with the promise that looking good is doing good. But I know from the young women I work with that the search for likes is rather more troubling than that. It is an often desperate search for approval, for safety, for body acceptance – a frequently elusive quest. If that young woman comes to parenting, frantic body preoccupation may have so invaded and insinuated itself into her that she will have schemes for managing food and managing appearance. Midwives and health professionals tell me they have noticed a dramatic change. Today pre- and postpartum mums can show considerable anxiety about their body self, so much so that the rhythm of early bonding is interrupted by rules and regulations, rather than the getting to know of one’s own body’s capacities and the wishes of the baby. For many, the parenting websites with their contradictory and commercially led “advice”, from recommendations for tummy tucks after your C-section to making a bespoke spreadsheet to track your feeding schedule, have turned postpartum into a straitjacket in which getting into pre-pregnancy jeans is the goal. And the anxiety the mothering person might well feel will be inadvertently transmitted to their baby, who will journey through life frightened of food and confused about their body self. A further tragedy. This is then exacerbated by a rapacious food industry – from the diet promoters to the so-called clean eating movement to the manufacturers of non-food foods. The sole aim of the latter is to produce replicas masquerading as potato chips or cheese for children’s lunchboxes but whose chemical composition strives to stimulate their bliss point: the umami, sweet, crispy feel that means taste buds are stimulated rather than hunger addressed. Appetite, desire, is being undermined by the smells and tastes which beckon all day and yet often don’t deliver the nourishment we crave. When you grow up absorbing the idea that food is quasi-dangerous, it is hard to know how to handle it. There are no end of experts selling their wares whose books and products end up generating enormous profits, and Weight Watchers’ newest push into the teen market has been criticised for potentially leading to teenagers becoming fixated on dieting. So, too, with other food and diet fads. The desperation that exists to be at peace and dwell in our bodies clashes with the knowledge that such schemas promote or reinforce confusion about appetite and desire. They don’t deliver peace. They deliver confusion. They deliver hurt. Another huge industry is the world fashion market, worth $2.4tn. The UK market alone is worth £26bn a year, with a £1,000 spend per inhabitant. I love clothes but how have we been persuaded to buy that much? The penetration of visual culture says how we look is so essential to our existence that we must spend, spend, spend. And that spend doesn’t include the cost of the clean-up from the fashion industry, the toxins in the water and the sweatshop conditions here and in China and Bangladesh. If the industry continues at its current rate, it will be using a staggering 26% of the carbon budget in 2050. I mention these statistics because it is sometimes possible to feel that when we are talking of bodies we aren’t engaging in serious economic and social issues, but we are. We are talking of large industries and excessive hours spent in persuading us to labour over transforming while attempting to live from our bodies. It’s hard to get the figures that big pharma makes from products aimed at our bodily transformations. They guard them. But we do know that when they launch a diet drug, they spend a fortune marketing and defending it even when it doesn’t work or causes medical damage. I could go on. There is the cosmetic industry, the cosmetic surgery industry, the doll market, the role of internet beauty bloggers who have followers in their millions and of course the horror for youngsters of living online and being continually scrutinised. But I want us to think for a moment about #MeToo and Time’s Up, where we can see a line, not such a wiggly line, from pervasive bad body feeling to the compromising positions women have been put into in all the spaces where they work and love. If we weren’t continually assaulted by the merchants of body hatred, we would not be as vulnerable to the assaults. I’m not saying they wouldn’t happen; misogyny ensures that. But the shame, the hiding, the confusions that beset us would diminish and we would be stronger in our fightback and our fight to control our own bodies. The body has become a political project. From rape as a weapon of war to the internal belief that we must be constantly wary about our appetites, to limiting ourselves individually and collectively because so much of our energy is misemployed, we have to act together to find ways through these minefields. The energy from #MeToo, with its reinvigoration of feminism, can help us say enough is enough. There’s just too much anguish, too much sorrow. We need more rage, more refusal and more love."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/how-i-learned-to-love-the-three-generation-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"How I learned to love the three-generation holiday | Eva Wiseman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/how-i-learned-to-love-the-three-generation-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/how-i-learned-to-love-the-three-generation-holiday","fields":{"headline":"How I learned to love the three-generation holiday","bodyText":"“How was the trip to Center Parcs with three generations of your partner’s family?” friends are asking politely. And to them I reply: “I’m still processing.” Here is what I learned: The trick to spending time with children is to give up all pretence of adult life and descend willingly into a world where those over eight are simply used as security and for collecting snacks. And you must go willingly, you must make the choice, first to enter the compound, with its fattened ducks and eerie silence after 9pm, and then to submit fully to a week without saying no. There is a playground round every corner, there’s an entertainer at breakfast time – all meals come with crayons and some taste of them, too. In every restaurant there is a soft-play area, an idea that I urge all businesses to roll out, immediately – it means the children are not tied to their adults through the means of iPads and threats, instead popping over for their chips, then back again to their cousins to continue the construction of an elaborate structure made out of shoes. Which gives the grown-ups time to continue their new favourite game: “Here’s what I’m going to say in an email to the management about how to improve Center Parcs.” Who knew we were such geniuses of town planning and tourism? By the end of each day, we had designed our own far superior versions (my particular irritation was with the add-on prices for each activity, though we did enjoy holding a very large owl) and could rest in the knowledge that, like Westworld or Westfield, we could fix this heaven experiment over the course of an afternoon. There are a handful of places in the UK where I am acutely aware that I’m Jewish, and this is one of them. This despite a colleague, having asked which Parc we were going to, smiling knowingly: “Ah, of course, the one for the liberal metropolitan elite.” Although the first time I visited Center Parcs, with my family and grandma when I was 10, we were perhaps the first chalet to host a full seder night, today we wear it lightly, I think, our Ashkenazi heritage, the only signs being the quantity of food my mother-in-law brought to barbecue and our bafflement at the boating lake. And yet I walked through this English land of burnt skin and badminton with a certain unplaceable anxiety. Perhaps everybody feels different here, a little apart from all the other guests with their artful manipulation of inflatables. It wasn’t until we were driving out into Bedfordshire, the barrier closing behind us, that it occurred to me we could have left at any time. Walking through a high street that’s been plonked in an ancient forest makes you feel dirty, these proud old trees dwarfed by a bustling Café Rouge. The idea was that these parks would be “an effective way for city folk to experience the countryside”. But we experience it with such sad apology that it makes you consider, not the beauty and grandeur of nature, but our too-human impulse to knock it down. I was awed by the 3G (three-generation) holiday, by the complete selflessness of my father-in-law choosing to spend his 70th birthday not at, say, a small Michelin-starred restaurant somewhere near the river, or in a comfortable living room surrounded by his many friends and a number of smoked salmon canapés, but instead with his kids and his kids’ kids, and those kids’ mothers, wiping ice cream off white T-shirts with a slightly dampened napkin. He made sandcastles in blazing heat, he detoured on foot to a supermarket to buy plasters with cartoon characters on them, he brought his own Nespresso machine, just in case. You can call anything a swimming pool if you put water in it. I learned this fairly quickly, as soon as we entered the subtropical swimming paradise and jostled our way into the tepid bubbles. It is a disconcerting feeling when both air and water are the temperature of urine, especially when surrounded by young children. They quickly divide into the too-scared and the too-fearless, the latter leaping off plastic rocks and bombing down slides as if on a stag night, the former clinging to their mothers so hard they bruise their tattoos. Every half hour, a Tarzan call echoes through the dome, signalling the start of the wave machine, and everyone comes scuttering from their games to pile into the pool, where babies float with enthusiastic yet slightly detached expressions, like the Queen seeing cows. Standing in these waves feels like being on a plane going down, with all the screaming and spillage that entails. The subtropical swimming paradise has a Starbucks and its own weather system and a queue for the flumes, and it was while waiting for my family to navigate all this that I read a Mumsnet thread about someone’s Darling Husband returning home from the Longleat park a little bit miffed because he was sure she’d told him that “going to Center Parcs” was a euphemism for anal sex. One more thing… Some people hung knicker-bunting outside the Conservative MP Christopher Chope’s office after he blocked the recent bill to ban ‘upskirting’. It was the perfect (and perfectly British) response, and should be taken on in the future for all shows of contemptuous protest. Hay fever is plaguing every one of us who is foolish enough to try to enjoy the weather. A ‘pollenution’ survey carried out by Boots found that 89% of people (me included) don’t realise that their hay fever symptoms can be worse in the city than in the countryside. Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine’s podcast, Dear Joan and Jericha, makes me absolutely hoot. Their advice to listeners with sexual problems is unsurpassable, and I particularly enjoyed the sensitive discussion about how Joan plans to explode her mother.

The Nazis bombed Heston airfield [near Heathrow] at the bottom of our road every night. I’m lucky I’m here at all. Mum never lived long enough to see my success. That’s a sadness. She wouldn’t have believed it. She hero-worshipped the kind of stars I’ve photographed and would take me to the stage doors after Saturday matinées to get autographs from the likes of Laurence Olivier. One of my teachers singled me out to become a priest, along with another boy. After two years I was told I wouldn’t make it because I had too many questions and not enough belief. The other guy became a monsignor. My reputation was bigger than the Beatles’ when I was sent to shoot them on my first newspaper. I was only 20, and the youngest photographer on Fleet Street. It was obvious that John was the one with the personality, so I put him in the front. The cultural watershed of the 1960s gave working-class boys like me opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise. I wouldn’t have had a prayer of being successful in any other era. There’s nobody around now I’d want to photograph. Amy Winehouse was the last person – real talent. All the proper stars have gone. Frank Sinatra’s ex-wife Ava Gardner gave me a letter of introduction. And when Frank read it, he told everyone, “He’s with me.” And I was for the next 30 years. The first three weeks we barely spoke but he let me go everywhere with him. It taught me that a top photographer should “be there” but never get caught up in the lifestyle. I turned down Marilyn Monroe. My girlfriend at the time was her publicist and she told me Marilyn took all her photographers to bed, so she wouldn’t let me work with her. Getting romantically involved with people you shoot is a huge mistake. I did it once with my ex-wife, Faye Dunaway. I hated the whole circus after we married. I was becoming Mr Faye Dunaway. Peter Sellers treated me like his psychiatrist. He’d ring me up at 2am and ask, “Why do all the women fall in love with you, Tel?” He could never understand why women wouldn’t fall in love with him. But I had no trick; I just bluffed it. Being a Catholic boy I lost my nerve after taking those pictures of Raquel Welch on a giant crucifix, so I didn’t publish them for 30 years. The idea came to me after Raquel told me she thought she would have been crucified for wearing that revealing costume in One Million Years BC. I turn 80 in July and I’ve no plans to mark it. For my 50th I went to dinner with Eric Clapton, Mickey Rourke and Bernie Ecclestone. Then I descended into a three-day depression. It was a proper midlife crisis. Now I’m at the stage of seeing all my mates die off. Michael Caine always says, “Tel, they’ve started bowling in our alley.” Fab way of putting it. The Queen is the only person I’ve ever been nervous of photographing. I researched some horse-racing jokes to break the ice and thank God she laughed. The perfectionist in me always left me thinking I could have taken a better shot. But now when I look at photos of all the icons I’ve shot – like Mandela, Sir Winston Churchill and Sinatra – the memories come flooding back and I think, “Yeah, I did all right.” My Generation, featuring Terry O’Neill, is available now on DVD, Blu-Ray and digital download The headline to this article was ammended on 20 November 2019 to reflect the fact that Terry O’Neill had in fact photographed Amy Winehouse"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/18/lake-district-line-northern-rail-windermere-oxenholme","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T16:56:31Z","webTitle":"Vintage train company steps in to reopen Lake District line","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/lake-district-line-northern-rail-windermere-oxenholme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/lake-district-line-northern-rail-windermere-oxenholme","fields":{"headline":"Vintage train company steps in to reopen Lake District line","bodyText":"A vintage train operator that normally runs journeys for enthusiasts has stepped in to provide rail services to the Lake District after the operator Northern cancelled all of its trains following a timetabling fiasco. West Coast Railways, which runs charter trains along some of the UK’s most scenic routes, formally launched its first service on the Lakes line on Monday, two weeks after Northern suspended all journeys and introduced a replacement bus service. A 40-year-old diesel engine and carriages will carry passengers free of charge along the 10-mile route from Oxenholme to Windermere six times a day, from 9.25am to 7pm. It is understood that the Department for Transport will meet the £5,500 daily cost of running the service. Passengers across the north of England have faced thousands of cancellations and delays on services run by Northern, a subsidiary of Arriva UK trains, since a new timetable was introduced in May. The train firm has blamed delayed engineering works and a shortage of trained drivers for the disruption. The suspension of Northern services on the Lakes line – which first opened in 1847 – is expected to last until 2 July. The operator will then introduce a shuttle rail service, with 12 trains a day between 6.30am and around 8pm. Rail replacement buses will still cover the remaining gaps in the timetable. Tim Farron, the MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, worked with a local passenger group to arrange for West Coast Railways to run services on the line. “We’re nine hours into the service and we’ve been on time throughout the day,” he said. “It’s a victory for the can-do over the can’t-do.

Northern rail run Pacers, which are a bit less elderly but without the charm.” Farron said the service provided by West Coast Railways – which runs a steam train along the line from Mallaig to Fort William made famous by the Harry Potter films – would still not meet the needs of locals. “We need a comprehensive and reliable service so that people can start building their lives around it.” A DfT spokesperson said: “As an open-access operator, West Coast Railways have agreed access with Network Rail and hold a valid safety certificate with the Office of Rail and Road, permitting them to run services. “We have been clear that there must be a full resumption of services on this line as soon as possible to give passengers a reliable service and we will continue to work with Northern to achieve this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/18/puto-chants-mexico-football-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T16:34:50Z","webTitle":"'Homophobic and not very clever': why puto chants haunt Mexican football","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/18/puto-chants-mexico-football-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/18/puto-chants-mexico-football-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"'Homophobic and not very clever': why puto chants haunt Mexican football","bodyText":"You can say this for Mexican soccer fans: they’ve managed to turn one of football’s least dramatic moments into one of its more controversial and offensive. The pattern is familiar. The opponent’s goalkeeper lines up a goalkick and the chant begins: “Ehhhh…” Then Mexican fans’ voices rise in unison until the kick prompts a cry of “puto!” The term is homophobic slang for a male sex worker. And its use by fans at matches from Mexico City to California and now Russia continues to give Fifa and the Mexican federation headaches. On Monday, Fifa announced it has opened a disciplinary procedure against Mexico after the chants were heard during El Tri’s victory over Germany. Homophobia and homophobic chants are not exclusive to Mexico fans. Fifa issued 51 disciplinary actions over homophobia during 2018 World Cup qualifiers. Of these, 11 were handed to the Mexican federation, with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Peru also receiving multiple fines. Fifa additionally cited Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay, Greece, Hungary and Serbia once each for homophobic chants. But there is no doubt the chant is most prominent among Mexico fans. “To call your opponent homosexual is definitely along a spectrum of machismo, whereby your opponent is weaker – less masculine,” says Joshua Nadel, author of Fútbol!: Why Soccer Matters in Latin America. During the World Cup, Fifa will have observers at all 64 matches and will work with security to remove fans engaging in discriminatory behavior, a spokesperson for the world governing body told the Guardian. “I think that a lot of the hand-wringing is for show,” says Nadel, an assistant professor of Latin American and Caribbean history at North Carolina Central University. “If Fifa and/or the [Mexican federation] can plausibly say, ‘Look, we’re trying to stop it,’ then they can quiet critics without imposing some form of sanction that has real teeth. I’m not saying that they don’t care, but it isn’t among the top priorities of any federation or confederation.” On Sunday, the chant made its first appearance in the 25th minute when Manuel Neuer lined up a kick. Quickly taken German goalkicks later in the game seemed to soften its presence. The origins of the chant in Mexico are hazy, but it started at club level before going international. Two well-known Mexico keepers – Oswaldo Sánchez and Óscar Perez – are said to have been among the first targets of the chant at club level in the mid-00s. The chant occurred sporadically at the 2010 World Cup, but the 2014 tournament in Brazil brought it to a new level. ESPN and Univision offered disclaimers when it was picked up on their broadcasts, and columnists and writers called for its end. Lamenting Fifa’s perceived inaction on the issue in 2014, Slate’s Juliana Jiménez Jaramillo wrote: “They can abstractly consider what the word means, but they don’t understand the visceral gut punch you feel when you hear a slur in your native language. The Mexican team’s officials, on the other hand, know exactly what puto means. At the very least, they could give a symbolic statement denouncing it, even if it still takes decades for the fans to catch up.” In recent years, the federation and players have made their case. Campaigns including public-service announcements from Mexico players have encouraged fans to put a stop to the chants. The Mexican federation this month tweeted – along with a link to rules of civility for the tournament – a direct plea that fans refrain from the chant. But the response suggests fans have no intention of complying. Many roundly mocked the request with gifs and defiant one-liners, some repurposing the team’s slogan and hashtag for the tournament: “Yo si voy a gritar, porque #NadaNosDetiene.” (“I will be shouting, because #NothingStopsUs”) Added attention has arguably only served to increase its use in MLS and USL stadiums, where Latino support is strong. In recent weeks, “Pride Night” matches at LA Galaxy and New York City FC were tarnished by the chants. Meanwhile, the new USL club Fresno FC, just months into it existence, has already been forced to denounce the fans’ chants and launch its own anti-discrimination and anti-homophobia campaign. “It always seemed like a very abstract thing, something we were saying to the opponent in this euphoric, collective way. It was part of the game that was completely unquestioned,” says Romeo Guzman, a first-generation Mexican-American who acknowledged participating in the chant as a teenager and is now an assistant professor of history focusing on Mexican migration at Fresno State University. “As an adult, things have changed. I look at it and I obviously don’t do it, and I wish that we could find ways to change it. It’s homophobic, and it’s not very clever.” Many fans shrug off accusations of homophobia and insist the chant is just a joke. “We do not scream at the goalkeeper because of his sexual preference, we don’t even care about it,” a YouTube commenter on a 2016 public-service video denouncing the chant wrote. “We shout to create chaos, because it is part of the atmosphere of a stadium in Mexico.” For some, the chant merely illustrates wider homophobia in society. “Mexico is not alone in this. It is the most visible because the chant accompanies the national team,” Nadel said. “The problem of homophobia in fútbol, both men’s and women’s – among fans, teams, and federations – is global. It is very hard to root out. Until societies cease seeing homosexuality through the lens of deviance and transgression, we will see homophobia in fútbol.” Jennifer Doyle, a professor of English at University of California, Riverside, who has written about the “puto” chant, thinks the chant is most likely to stop if fans believe it to be a hex on the national team. “I really want people to imagine that ‘puto’ is the own goal of curses,” Doyle said. “That when fans of El Tri shout this word at their team’s opponent, every gay Mexican ghost – and that’s a lot of ghosts – commits themselves to extending the team’s curse.” Maybe she has a point. Something tripped Holland’s Arjen Robben in the box in added time at the 2014 World Cup, and most Mexican fans are convinced it was not defender Rafael Márquez. The resulting penalty kept Mexico out of the quarter-finals – marking El Tri’s sixth consecutive elimination in the last 16. “Convince fans that it brings bad luck to their own team,” Doyle said, “and this nonsense will stop.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/19/watchdog-raises-concern-over-jails-20-suicides-in-seven-years","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T23:01:09Z","webTitle":"Watchdog raises concern over jail's 20 suicides in seven years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/19/watchdog-raises-concern-over-jails-20-suicides-in-seven-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/19/watchdog-raises-concern-over-jails-20-suicides-in-seven-years","fields":{"headline":"Watchdog raises concern over jail's 20 suicides in seven years","bodyText":"Twenty men have taken their own lives at the same jail in the space of seven years, the chief inspector of prisons has said. Peter Clarke said the number of self-inflicted deaths at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes was a “huge concern” as a report described “chronic and substantial” staff shortages. This month a Woodhill inmate, Taras Nykolyn, 49, died after a fight at the jail. Three men were arrested on suspicion of murder. Publishing the findings of an inspection carried out in February, Clarke said: “At the time we inspected, eight prisoners had taken their own lives since our previous inspection in 2015 and, staggeringly, 19 prisoners had taken their own lives at the establishment since 2011. Tragically, a few months after this inspection another prisoner was reported to have taken his own life.” The report says levels of self-harm and violence at the prison had gone up since the previous inspection. In the six months before the latest visit, the jail recorded 314 self-harm incidents, 65 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, 57 assaults on staff and 47 fights. Clarke said: “Underpinning nearly all the concerns raised in this report, including issues of safety and wellbeing, were chronic staff shortages and inexperience. This led to poor time out of cell, unpredictable daily routines and limited access to activity.” Out of a full staffing complement of 320 officers, there were 55 vacancies at the time of the inspection and 20% of officers had been in post had less than 12 months’ experience. Inspectors found almost half of the prison’s population were locked in their cells during the working day. The prisons minister, Rory Stewart, said there were now 55 more officers in post at Woodhill than in October 2016 and an additional 32 were due by the end of November. He said: “We have taken specific and urgent action to improve recruitment at Woodhill, including giving the governor a greater role in the process and introducing additional pay allowances.” Michael Spurr, the chief executive of HM Prison and Probation Service, said: “Woodhill manages a complex and vulnerable population and the governor and her staff have worked tirelessly to improve support and care for prisoners, and there were no self-inflicted deaths in 2017. Tragically there has been one self-inflicted death this year, but the prison remains focused on safety and supporting vulnerable men. “Staffing vacancies have had an impact but we have a strong pipeline of new recruits which will significantly increase staffing in the coming months. This will improve the regime and mean more rehabilitative activity for prisoners.” HMP Woodhill mainly houses inmates on remand or serving short sentences, but also a small number of category A prisoners. The jail had a population of 626 at the time of the latest inspection. • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

I find this demand as ridiculous and unwieldy as she does. She could just send a Snapchat or something, whereas I wonder if anyone actually needs to know the course of my life, which is the rough translation of curriculum vitae. In this world of portfolio careers and zero-hour contracts, what does a CV really achieve? At her age, she has to exaggerate her experience: at mine, I have to gloss over certain years. Does anyone need to know about my short-lived career selling encyclopaedias in Louisiana? I think not. My time as a trainee audiology technician is as relevant as the O-levels I got in another era. The shorter the better anyway, apparently, as the average boss looks at a CV for three minutes. This seems unnecessarily long to me. What with the personal statements everyone is now required to write, applying for jobs is a job in itself. If you are old, if your name doesn’t sound “English”, if you have had time out having kids, all these things make you less appealing. There is instead a dreadful homogenised jumble of jargon; so many CVs read like the worst Apprentice applicants on glue. Young men and women are selling themselves as “disrupters” and Steve Jobs mark II, when they only do what they are told. If you don’t come from the right background (eg a middle-class one) you are unlikely to realise what these things should even look like. The same with Ucas forms. So, you don’t play the cello, do am-dram and spend every waking moment doing voluntary work? How well-rounded are you? Just don’t put as your interests as “cooking dogs and interesting people”, as one poor sap did. Punctuation matters. And spelling, all that kind of thing, although I am always stumped at the hobbies bit as, to me, all hobbies are a sign of the capacity to be a serial killer. Still, I lived at time when many of us wanted to be considered unemployable, so we could get the dole and do our own thing. We would be sent to interviews even when we had written “satanism and sulphate” for our interests. My mate, who really did not want a job, was doing worryingly well in an interview, so when they got to the “What makes you want to be part of this team?” question, he had to think fast. “Because the voices told me to.” Phew! He was able to carry on being unemployed until he became a pop star. Nowadays, the lines between boasting, appalling management-speak and honesty are fine ones. Dealing weed may indeed teach you something about enterprise, but putting “marijuana dealer and nefarious dude” is not good. Nor is writing skills as skillz; nor, as I have had to explain, is “YouTube” a qualification. No one cares about everything you ever did. Some employers are now asking potential employees to make videos of themselves. What fresh hell is this? The more we are forced to commodify ourselves for the most basic jobs, when actually so much will become automated, the more this cycle of illusion continues. A robot CV is the goal, surely? You may be excellent at your job, but very bad at selling yourself. I read that I must use “action” words and no emojis. I must not resort to cliches. Good listener, team player, etc. There is no point, I suppose, in saying, “please, let’s not play this stupid game”. A CV is as trustworthy as a dating profile. Turning oneself into an acceptable product may be the course of some lives.

It’s not something many would have seen coming. Yet here we are. Five days in to the biggest sporting competition in the world and Eni Aluko’s punditry is one of the most talked-about aspects of the games. The former Chelsea striker, who joined Serie A side Juventus this summer, has proved a breath of fresh air as a part of the ITV punditry team. Yet this isn’t her first outing: Aluko made history as the first female pundit on Match of the Day in 2014 and she was mic’d up at both the 2016 European Championships and the 2017 Women’s Euros in the Netherlands. So why such an impact this time round? There has been a stark contrast between Aluko on ITV and former Arsenal captain Alex Scott on the BBC – with 242 England caps between them – and their male colleagues, and it’s not their gender. They have, quite simply, done their homework – so much so that Patrice Evra patronisingly, but also sort of with an innocent shock about him, applauded Aluko following a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of the Costa Ricans ahead of their match against Serbia. Both highly educated – Aluko as a lawyer, Scott as a journalist – they have worked hard to build their careers, on and off the pitch, and the opportunity to strut their stuff on the biggest stage is not one they have taken for granted. This is no paid-for jolly. Like Jacqui Oatley, Clare Balding and the other women who have led the way in sports journalism that, they feel a responsibility to research and represent. Frankly, it shouldn’t be out of the ordinary to do your job well as a World Cup pundit. The onus is now on broadcasters to look beyond the name and start expecting more from their stars. This is the biggest show on earth and being an ex-professional footballer does not automatically mean you are qualified or mean fans want to listen to you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/18/parkinsons-and-ms-spared-benefit-retesting-u-turn-pip-assessment","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T19:40:42Z","webTitle":"Parkinson’s and MS patients spared benefit retesting in U-turn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/18/parkinsons-and-ms-spared-benefit-retesting-u-turn-pip-assessment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/18/parkinsons-and-ms-spared-benefit-retesting-u-turn-pip-assessment","fields":{"headline":"Parkinson’s and MS patients spared benefit retesting in U-turn","bodyText":"People with severe, degenerative medical conditions such as Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis will no longer have to undergo regular tests to prove they remain eligible for disability benefits, ministers have confirmed. The change means that people awarded the highest level of personal independence payment (Pip) for conditions that are not expected to improve will be subjected to “light touch” reassessment just once a decade. Charities and campaigners welcomed the decision as a significant change for people with chronic conditions who are forced to go through the notoriously stressful Pip reassessment process as often as every two years. But they warned that the change – which mirrors those made last year to employment and support allowance “fit for work” tests – was piecemeal and more fundamental reforms were needed to the inherently flawed Pip assessment process. “This announcement will be welcome news for people with Parkinson’s currently receiving the highest level of Pip, as they will now avoid needless and stressful annual reassessments,” said Laura Cockram, the head of policy and campaigns at Parkinson’s UK. “However, it will only affect half of people with the condition currently receiving Pip and is a piecemeal solution for a broken system that needs a complete overhaul. The assessment process is simply not fit for purpose, and does not recognise the reality of living with long-term, progressive conditions.” The minister for disabled people, health and work, Sarah Newton, said: “We’ve listened to feedback from organisations and the public, and this common-sense change will ensure that the right protections are in place while minimising any unnecessary stress or bureaucracy.” Pip, which was previously known as disability living allowance, is a benefit awarded to help people with the extra costs of living with a disability, worth between £22.65 and £145.35 a week, depending on the severity of the condition. James Taylor, the head of policy and public affairs at the disability charity Scope, said: “Today’s announcement is a victory for common sense, but it still doesn’t address the root of the problem with Pip.” Pip has been dogged by controversy since its rollout started in 2014. In February, an all-party group of MPs criticised the error-strewn and insensitive Pip assessment process, run by private firms Atos and Capita. More than two-thirds of Pip decisions which go to appeal are overturned. In January, the government said it would review 1.6m Pip claims as part of major U-turn under which an estimated 220,000 claimants eventually receive backdated awards after the high court found it had been blatantly discriminatory against people with mental health conditions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/19/ministers-welfare-cuts-disabled-people","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"Why won’t ministers come clean about the impact of cuts on disabled people? | Frances Ryan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/19/ministers-welfare-cuts-disabled-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/19/ministers-welfare-cuts-disabled-people","fields":{"headline":"Why won’t ministers come clean about the impact of cuts on disabled people?","bodyText":"Back in 2014, armed with only a laptop and phone, disabled campaigners started a hunt for the truth. As policies including the bedroom tax, the abolition of disability living allowance, and the rollout of controversial out-of-work sickness benefits hit, War on Welfare (Wow) called on the coalition government to carry out a cumulative impact assessment of the wave of disability cuts to measure the effect on disabled people. It resulted in a debate in parliament – the first time disabled people had secured a debate in the main chamber of the House of Commons – but no action. Now, four years on, Wow has gained the backing of a cross-party coalition that wants Theresa May’s government to calculate the overall impact of the so-called welfare reforms on disabled people. Every party except the Conservatives is in favour of a Commons debate on conducting this assessment, including the DUP. In light of the pressure over Northern Irish abortion reform, their support for detailed analysis of the impact of Tory disability cuts is another awkward clash between May and the DUP’s 10 MPs propping up her administration. But more than that, it’s a sign of hope that ministers may have to finally investigate just what damage their disability cuts are causing – from the social care crisis to cuts to multiple parts of the NHS, to the disastrous rollout of universal credit; now delayed for an extra year until 2023. Last week’s damning report by the National Audit Office (NAO) on universal credit castigated the system’s inability to protect and support “vulnerable claimants”. It follows the revelation this month that the government was forced to say it would repay thousands of severely disabled people made worse off under the UC system ahead of the high court ruling last week that it was “discriminatory” to have docked two disabled men’s benefits after transferring to UC. Following pressure from disability groups, this week ministers made another U-turn, this time to stop repeatedly testing some disabled people for personal independence payments. The government’s austerity programme has resulted in multiple reductions in income since 2010 that have hit disabled people all at once and disproportionately. Being hit by the bedroom tax is tough – but losing your sickness benefits as well after being found “fit for work” is even harder. If you need an insight into the damage these policies have done, just go to Wow Voices, a website set up by campaigners that features disabled people explaining the impact of cuts on them. One woman with terminal breast cancer writes of how, for the last 18 months, she’s been told she needs to be reassessed for her benefits every six months, and she’s frantic about the thought of losing her support. “I’ve cried more about this than my terminal diagnosis,” she says. The UN’s damning report in 2016 into the UK’s “violations” of disabled people’s rights has put further pressure on the government over its treatment of disabled citizens. Meanwhile, the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s own cumulative impact assessment shows that families with a disabled adult and a disabled child will lose £5,500 a year by 2022 as a result of tax and benefit changes – contradicting the government’s claim that such analysis would be “too complex” to do. This month, research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found around 650,000 people with mental and physical health problems were officially destitute in the UK last year – that means being so poor, they can’t afford deodorant, the electric, or regular meals – with social security changes found to be a key cause. It’s bad enough for ministers to take away state support from disabled people en masse, but to refuse to analyse its effects is the definition of irresponsible. The Conservatives must finally shine a light on the impact that disability cuts have had.

The UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, has been in the country seeking a deal whereby the port, currently under Houthi control, is handed over to the UN and its relief agencies. The port is the distribution point for up to 80% of the food, water and commercial fuel vital to the lives of more than 8 million Yemenis in severe need. The UN and aid agencies fear a prolonged fight will endanger the aid supplies. But the United Arab Emirates, the key military supporters of the UN-backed government, has insisted it will not accept anything but an unconditional withdrawal. The Houthis are extremely unlikely to agree to this, since it would amount to surrender of the area with no guarantees on the future status of Yemen. “There can be no conditions in any offers to withdraw,” the UAE’s foreign minister, Anwar Gargash, told a press briefing in Dubai. “If the rebels wanted to set conditions, they should have thought of that a year ago … Now is not the time to negotiate.” Gargash’s remarks reflect his military planners’ confidence that the estimated 3,000 Houthi troops in the area can be defeated without damage to the port infrastructure. He said: “Our approach is one of gradual, calibrated and methodical pressure designed for unconditional withdrawal of Houthis. Our earlier efforts to ensure Hodeidah as a humanitarian and commercial port failed. It became quickly clear that the Houthis were buying time. Their financial and strategic interest was to prolong the war. We will not allow this war to last for another two to three years.” He added: “It is time for a political process. The Houthis need to be part of that process – but you can’t be 3% of the population, yet claim through the barrel of a gun to own 50% of the country.” UAE sources may also fear that a ceasefire would give the Houthis a chance to regroup and acquire extra arms, or to try to rebuild international diplomatic support against the attack. Fighting around the Hodeidah airport continueds, but the massive air superiority of the Saudi coalition appears to be helping Yemeni government ground forces to make progress. The UAE sources said the coalition had captured the southern part of the airport, but has not yet secured the perimeter due to an unwillingness to fire on Houthi forces hiding among civilians in a village to the west of the airport. On Sunday the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Lise Grande, said talks on a transfer of the port to UN control were at an advanced stage. Griffiths is expected to brief the security council on his talks later on Monday, and will set out the continuing points of difference between the two sides. Gargash said the Saudi and UAE-led offensive aimed “to help the UN envoy in his last chance to convince the Houthis to withdraw unconditionally from the city and avoid any confrontation”. He pointed out the road for Houthis to leave Hodeidah and head for the capital Sana’a had been kept open. The head of the Houthis’ unofficial government, Abdulaziz bin Habtoor, accused Saudi-led forces of “escalating their attacks on the western coast when they felt there were serious moves towards a solution”. The Saudi alliance imposed a near-total blockade on Hodeidah port earlier this year, alleging Iran was using it as a major conduit for illicit arms deliveries to the Houthis. Gargash said on Monday that his country and its allies aimed to “avoid civilian casualties”, adding that the operation was “going very well”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/18/aviation-industry-eu-blocks-talks-to-avert-no-deal-brexit-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T16:20:49Z","webTitle":"Aviation industry: EU blocks talks to avert 'no-deal' Brexit crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/18/aviation-industry-eu-blocks-talks-to-avert-no-deal-brexit-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/18/aviation-industry-eu-blocks-talks-to-avert-no-deal-brexit-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Aviation industry: EU blocks talks to avert 'no-deal' Brexit crisis","bodyText":"The European commission is refusing to agree to any back-channel discussions between UK and EU aviation agencies to avert a crisis in the event of a “no-deal” outcome to Brexit. Attempts by the aerospace industry to persuade Brussels to start contingency talks to ensure Europe’s planes keep flying and the aerospace industry can function effectively have apparently been rebuffed by the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, according to industry sources. At the strike of midnight in Brussels on 29 March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU, UK-made parts for planes will no longer be legally valid and its pilot licences will be defunct in the eyes of international regulators acting under agreements with the bloc. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association and the UK aerospace group ADS wrote to Barnier earlier this month to warn that the current approach would impact not only Britain but could damage the whole of the £193bn EU aerospace and defence industry. They have called for the European Aviation and Safety Agency (EASA) and the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to immediately open discussions on a way forward in the event of the breakdown of wider talks in Brussels. Their letter to the commission warns: “Our risk analysis concludes that EASA and the CAA need to urgently begin technical and contingency planning discussions by the June European council, and separate to the political negotiations.” It added: “Without an agreed solution ... supply chain disruption across Europe will occur, parts will be unable to be delivered, pilots and maintenance technicians will be unable to work, aerospace companies in the UK will lose foreign validations for their business, and aircraft will be grounded globally.” An industry source told the Times that the commission was putting politics above the interests of the people it is supposed to represent. “This is purely about a negotiating strategy,” the source was reported to have said. The UK is currently a member of an aviation agreement based on 35 shared pieces of EU legislation, a common regulator in EASA, and a court acting as a referee on the shared rules, the European court of justice. British ministers have insisted they want the UK to remain in EASA, but despite confident assurances in April, there has been no EU agreement, further alarming the aviation sector. An ADS spokesman said that even should a transition agreement be achieved, months of technical discussions could still be needed to avoid potential issues for the industry in March 2019. A UK government spokesperson said: “We want to explore with the EU the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies such as those that are critical to the aerospace industries. Doing so would be in the best interests of the UK and EU.” Beyond the impact on manufacturers, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, UK carriers would also lose all their flying rights under agreements with member states and third countries as they would no longer be considered EU airlines. While Brussels is open to a new aviation agreement, it is not willing to negotiate a deal with the UK that could emulate the status quo. UK carriers, such as easyJet, have been told they will have to be 50% owned and controlled by EU nationals to enjoy the continued right to fly between destinations within the bloc. They will also need to be headquartered in a EU member state. EasyJet has established a new company, easyJet Europe, in Austria, to maintain flying rights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/18/why-are-families-being-separated-at-the-us-border-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T15:26:19Z","webTitle":"Why are families being separated at the US border?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/why-are-families-being-separated-at-the-us-border-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/why-are-families-being-separated-at-the-us-border-explainer","fields":{"headline":"Why are families being separated at the US border?","bodyText":"Why are children being separated from their families? In April, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero-tolerance” policy, stating “our goal is to prosecute every case that is brought to us”. Under the Trump administration’s new enforcement policy, every migrant who crosses the border illegally – even those seeking asylum in the US – is subject to criminal prosecution. Since children are not allowed to be held in a federal jail, they are taken from their parents and placed in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). Almost 2,000 children have been separated from their families at the US southern border over a six-week period during a crackdown on illegal entries, according to the Department of Homeland Security. A DHS spokesman told reporters last week that 1,995 minors were separated from 1,940 adults between 19 April and 31 May 2018. Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds more have been separated since at least July 2017. What happens to the children? After being separated from their parents, the children – some as young as 18 months – are then treated as “unaccompanied alien children”, a category which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in the custody of ORR within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait, in government-run facilities, for weeks or months while agency officials search for relatives or sponsors to care for the child while their immigration case is pending. Reporters who have toured the facilities where families are separated by border patrol officers describe hundreds of children waiting in cages with concrete floors, kept away from their families. One immigration advocate told the Associated Press that a teenager helped care for a young child she didn’t know because the child’s aunt was somewhere else in the facility. The teen said she had to show others in her cell how to change the girl’s diaper. In the shelters, children are offered toys and books. But Colleen Kraft, the president, American Academy of Pediatrics, who toured a shelter in a border town in Texas, described children in distress. “Separating children from their parents contradicts everything we stand for as pediatricians – protecting and promoting children’s health,” she wrote after her visit. “In fact, highly stressful experiences, like family separation, can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child’s brain architecture and affecting his or her short and long-term health.” The system is already overburdened, dating back to 2014 when tens of thousands of Central American “unaccompanied minors” fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries arrived at the Texas border. Can these children be reunited with their parents? Immigration advocacy groups and attorneys have warned that there is not a clear system in place to reunite families. In one case, attorneys in Texas said they had been given a phone number to help parents locate their children, but it was actually the number for an immigration enforcement tip line. Advocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them. What happened to families before? When an influx of families and unaccompanied children from Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families. This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program. Will the Trump administration change its policy? Donald Trump has repeatedly and falsely blamed the widely condemned practice on Democrats – even though officials in his administration have publicly advocated for it. Sessions, the attorney general, has argued that family separation is necessary to deter migrants from trying to cross the border illegally. John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff, defended the practice in an interview, arguing that the “name of the game is deterrence”. In a rare statement on policy, Melania Trump said she “hates to see children separated from their families”. But she also blamed “both sides” for the current situation, echoing her husband’s inaccurate claim that Democrats are responsible for her husband’s policy. The administration is facing increasing pressure from prominent lawmakers in both parties as well as human rights groups, religions leaders and immigration advocates to halt the practice of separating families. In a scathing op-ed in the Washington Post, Laura Bush, the wife of former president George W Bush, wrote that the zero-tolerance policy was “cruel” and “immoral”. “These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history,” she wrote. Republican lawmakers say they want to address the practice of family separation in a wider immigration bill but its prospects of passing are unlikely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/18/damien-hirsts-former-business-manager-puts-art-collection-up-for-sale","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T15:05:33Z","webTitle":"Damien Hirst's former business manager puts art collection up for sale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/18/damien-hirsts-former-business-manager-puts-art-collection-up-for-sale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/18/damien-hirsts-former-business-manager-puts-art-collection-up-for-sale","fields":{"headline":"Damien Hirst's former business manager puts art collection up for sale","bodyText":"The fruits of a lucrative friendship between the artist Damien Hirst and his formidable former business manager Frank Dunphy, forged in the smoky small hours at the Groucho club in Soho, will be displayed before an auction at Sotheby’s in September of Dunphy’s personal art collection, which includes many gifts from Hirst. Dunphy’s business acumen lay behind two auctions in the same premises that became art world legends. In 2004, the sale of the contents of the Pharmacy restaurant, for which Hirst had designed everything down to the matchbooks, and which Dunphy then scooped up as the restaurant was dismantled, made £11m. Four years later, Dunphy masterminded Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, an auction of works directly from Hirst’s studio, bypassing the gallery system. The timing was extraordinary: the sale was held over two packed days in September, just as the world’s banking system went into meltdown. The final auction total was £111.5m, a world record for a single artist sale, including £10.3m for The Golden Calf, one of Hirst’s trademark creatures in a tank of formaldehyde, but with 18-carat gold horns and hooves. Oliver Barker, the chairman of Sotheby’s Europe, said: “Behind every great creative genius is a Svengali-type character who helps unleash and channel their brilliance. For Damien Hirst this was Frank Dunphy, whose Midas touch is now legendary.” Dunphy was also involved in the private sale of the towering Hymn in 1999, the first Hirst work to break the £1m barrier, and in buying back scores of early works as Charles Saatchi held one of his periodic garage sales of his collection. Dunphy and his wife, Lorna, a stockbroker, said the art scene had been their life for 30 years and the works were like friends, but it was time to downsize. “Much of it is steeped in happy memories and much of it we bought ourselves simply because we loved it. But time waits for no man and the time has come to say goodbye to some of the art, though not the memories nor the friendships.” The sale of 200 pieces will include spot, spin and butterfly pieces by Hirst, one of his pill cabinets given when Dunphy was ill, and a painting with a typically verbose title: “Beautiful, all round, lovely day, big toys for big kids, Frank and Lorna, when we are no longer children we are already dead painting.” The sale will also include works by Andy Warhol and Richard Prince, and by many of the Young British Artists generation whom Dunphy met through Hirst, including Tracey Emin, Rachel Whiteread and Angus Fairhurst. A gorilla sculpture by the latter occasionally joined Dunphy’s dinner guests to avoid an unlucky 13 at the table. Hirst and Dunphy consciously uncoupled in 2010 when Dunphy retired, but they remain on good terms. The sale will include a bust made as a 70th birthday present in 2008, sketches on restaurant menus and a butterfly cigarette lighter. Dunphy first met the artist in the Groucho at the request of Hirst’s mother, who had heard Dunphy was clever with the precarious finances of arty types – though his early decision to turn down the unknown group who later became Led Zeppelin was not his best call. The sale is titled Yellow Ball, and includes a Hirst gift to mark Dunphy’s retirement, a circular painting of butterflies on a brilliant yellow ground, titled Smashing Yellow Ball at Peace. Dunphy first saw the woman who would become his wife when he looked up from playing a yellow ball at snooker, and the company they founded was named Yellow Ball Management. Highlights will be on display at Sotheby’s from 22-26 June, and the full collection from 15 September, before the sale on 20 September, which is expected to make up to £8.4m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/21/little-vera-review-vasili-pichul-natalya-negoda","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T08:07:28Z","webTitle":"Little Vera review – nudity and sex behind the iron curtain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/21/little-vera-review-vasili-pichul-natalya-negoda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/21/little-vera-review-vasili-pichul-natalya-negoda","fields":{"headline":"Little Vera review – nudity and sex behind the iron curtain","bodyText":"‘I see a big beautiful Soviet feeling being born here …” This is what a teenage poet called Lenka gleefully announces when she realises that her friend Vera is in love. She is the little Vera of the title, which can ambiguously mean “a little faith” or “little faith”. The feeling that’s being born isn’t particularly big or or even very Soviet. But it might be beautiful. The 1988 film Little Vera – to be revived in London – was a commercial hit, helped by its startling amount of nudity and sex. It was a triumph for its director Vasili Pichul and screenwriter Mariya Khmelik, who was Pichul’s wife, quickly renowned as the key perestroika movie, whose openness to westernised thrills of sex and rock’n’roll (no drugs, though) made it a key text of the times. Vera, played by Natalya Negoda, is a liberated teenager, who has trendy makeup and hairstyle in the style of Debbie Harry, and takes a frank and uncomplicated pleasure in sex. She is rebelling against her parents, and against the stultifying non-expectations they have of her life beyond high school. And she is most importantly rebelling against the men in her life: against her grumpy, alcoholic dad (Yuri Nazarov), who flies into ugly, anti-Semitic rages when he has had a few, against her clingy, dull boyfriend Andrei (Andrei Fomin) about to do his military service and self-pityingly preoccupied with the fact that they haven’t had sex, and also against her pompous and self-satisfied brother Viktor (Alexander Alexeyev-Negreba), who left to be a doctor in Moscow and has now been summoned back to the family home to talk some sense into his little sister because her parents feel she has gone off the rails. She is even in a kind of rebellion against the man she falls in love with: Viktor’s friend, the swaggeringly handsome and sexy Sergei (Andrei Sokolov) who starts to take her for granted. What sort of film is Little Vera? Thirty years on from its original release, it’s possible to see how it is not so much a harbinger of the future but a revival of a certain type of European film from 20 years in the past, perhaps the last great social realist movie of the classic kind, something to be compared with Ken Loach’s Poor Cow, or Tony Richardson’s A Taste of Honey, or even Ingmar Bergman’s Summer With Monika. It’s a film in which the passion and vividness of the female lead is in contrast – and even at war – with the poverty and frustration that is all about. We see Vera hanging out with her various dodgy friends at a kind of illegal open-air disco, which degenerates into violence. She has already become vaguely involved with a friend’s scheme for illegal currency conversion involving a stolen US $20 bill. It is here that she meets Sergei, feels the instant spark and has sex with him. This is happening in an era when Russia was as concerned with sexual health as the west, though with a more candidly homophobic attitude. Vera thoughtfully reads from a leaflet pinned up in Sergei’s tatty student room: “What you should know about Aids … Avoid casual sexual relations and contacts with homosexuals.” In the pre-pill era, female sexual pleasure would be punished with the dreadful spectre of pregnancy. Pichul and Khmelik create a new twist on this classic social-realist disaster. Vera merely pretends that she is pregnant – to panic her parents into accepting her relationship with Sergei. That lie is a kind of aphrodisiac for them. They talk about it while they are having sex, and it is a kind of comforting risk-free illusion that cements their sensual intimacy. But Sergei is far from happy and is catastrophically rude to her parents, which is an intimately painful insult to her dad, poor drunk Kolia. Vera was once the apple of his eye. Wheedlingly, pathetically, Kolia will ask bored Vera: “Remember how you used to put me to bed when you were little?” He means of course when he was too drunk to make it there on his own. It’s a sentimental, cloying memory that falls just short of abuse. There are some extraordinary black-comic scenes in Little Vera. An extended sequence has Vera quarrelling with her friend Lenka (Alexandra Tabakova), who like Kolia is hurt that all Vera’s emotions are now engaged with Sergei. Finally, Christyakova gets up and demonstrates the “ha” posture that she has learned in yoga, stretching her arms in the air and throwing herself down to the ground. “Like this, we cleanse ourselves of psychic poison!” Little Vera is a time capsule of the Soviet 80s and also of the European 60s, and, for all its bleakness and disillusion, there is a poignant innocence in it. • Little Vera screens on 27 June at Regent Street Cinema, London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/26/carolines-bikini-kirsty-gunn-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T06:00:28Z","webTitle":"Caroline’s Bikini by Kirsty Gunn – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/26/carolines-bikini-kirsty-gunn-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/26/carolines-bikini-kirsty-gunn-review","fields":{"headline":"Caroline’s Bikini by Kirsty Gunn – review","bodyText":"Some novelists seek to immerse the reader in the drama of flesh-and-blood characters to the extent that you forget you’re reading a made-up story. For others, that’s the last thing they want and so, instead, draw attention to their own artifice. You get a sense of which kind the Scottish writer Kirsty Gunn might be from her new book’s flyleaf subtitle: An Arrangement of a Novel With an Introduction and Some Further Material. A metafictional romance full of footnotes and false starts, Caroline’s Bikini is narrated by Emily, a freelance copywriter, single and middle-aged, who makes a living from writing about pet food. With her childhood friend Evan, a banker, she’s trying to write – at his request – a novel about his infatuation with his landlady, Caroline, a glamorous, faintly desperate housewife in suburban west London. Emily’s task – documenting how Evan falls in love at first sight with a woman he barely gets to know – isn’t easy. Essentially, there’s no story. A moment in which Caroline visits Evan’s attic room after one too many cocktails and sits on his bed, feels pivotal, or at least preliminary, but to no end, as his inability to muster the courage to confide in Caroline begins to affect his work life (after bungling an important deal, he sends his CEO an email “headed ‘No Biggie’ with a smiley face as a full stop”). “Is it possible for something NOT to happen in a novel, I was asking myself in the notes I was making in my flat, late at night,” Emily writes, giving up on her book’s “chance of a general readership” as she accuses Evan of self-indulgence. “Here we were still, slap bang in the middle of ‘nothing’”, she tells us, more than halfway through the book, wondering if Caroline “coming up to his room and his failure to act were the only things that would ever take place in this story”. A cameo from Emily’s Tory-voting boss, who urges her to concentrate on “proper” work, is among various hints that we might view the book’s interrogation of meaning-making as an act of resistance against capitalist diktat. All the same, like Emily, you can’t help waiting for something to happen. Despite hints that all is not well between pill-popping Caroline and her largely absent husband, you sense that what is most at stake is the sputtering electricity between Emily and Evan, whose mutual affection is never addressed, save for some arch references in the course of 60 pages of endnotes from Gunn, analysing her own narrative. This curiously spotlit variety of understatement comes to seem typical of the book’s experimental tomfoolery, pitched somewhere between Nicola Barker and BS Johnson. The appended paratextual material invites us to read it as an attempt to recast Petrarch’s lovestruck sonnets to Laura. This seems over the top but directs you to the way in which the narrative’s frustrating reluctance to get going is also a sincere attempt to stay true to the nature of unrequited love as perhaps the most eventful of nonevents, an emotion “as apt to change lives as the other sort”, Emily says, “though rarely acknowledged”. And besides, things do happen here, not least to the bikini of the title, which makes a teasingly late entrance, its fate unpredictably funny, both peculiar and ha-ha. Yet by the end of Gunn’s bold and brainy enterprise, it’s hard to escape a sense that the book’s ratio of charm to exasperation depends chiefly on your level of animus towards avant garde fiction’s squarer cousin, the “contemporary realist novel” that Emily reckons can “go hang”. • Caroline’s Bikini by Kirsty Gunn is published by Faber (£14.99).

When Julian sees three women dressed as mermaids, he wants to be one too; but how will his Nana react? In this bravura feat of understated storytelling, the richness of Julian’s day-to-day reality and free-floating imagination is caught in images layered with colour, movement, muscle and life, celebrating black and Latin experience. Julian invents a tail and flowing hair, and Nana’s acceptance, as she accompanies him on a wild parade of mermaids, will leave the reader filled with joy. Nadia Shireen’s Billy and the Beast (Penguin) also celebrates the experience of those often left out of picture books, with its brave brown heroine and the outrageous array of props she stores in her huge cloud of hair. Lively, energetic, full of well-timed humour (and a sidekick called Fatcat), it’s a great story for everyone, especially those not used to seeing themselves centre stage. Jan Fearnley, meanwhile, deliciously subverts the “sharing-is-caring” trope in the mouth-watering Oh Me, Oh My, A PIE! (Nosy Crow). When Grandma bakes a pie, it passes swiftly to a succession of thieves. With its piecrust-crisp scansion and a tinge of Hilaire Belloc, this is a delight to read aloud. There’s another roguish gran in Sophy Henn’s intoxicating Bad Nana: Older Not Wiser (HarperCollins), dressed to kill in black, white and fluorescent pink. Assuredly inhabiting its seven-year-old protagonist’s perspective, the book chronicles the naughty deeds of an unconventional nana, who challenges despotic park-keepers, shares true-crime library books with the very young, and dishes out lemon sherbets for medicinal purposes – a fizzily sweet sensation. In a wholly different register, The Day War Came (Walker) combines Nicola Davies’s simple, hard-hitting text and Rebecca Cobb’s pencil drawings to evoke the dismaying destruction of accustomed reality for the youngest victims of conflict. Thought-provoking and poignant, it’s an excellent answer to the question of how to talk to children about war. For history buffs of about seven upwards – assuming they’re unfazed by plentiful text – David Roberts’s Suffragette: The Battle for Equality (Two Hoots) stands out amid a plethora of Rebel Girls-type titles for its passion and elegance, and the way it situates the suffragettes’ work within a wider context. Lesser-known figures, especially working-class ones, are here given their due, while Roberts’s strong illustrations work beautifully to convey their experience in this satisfyingly meaty history. For eight to twelve-ish readers, there is a delightful border-crossing adventure in Sylvia Bishop’s The Secret of the Night Train (Scholastic), illustrated by Marco Guadalupi, which features meditative, migratory Max, desperate to break free of her rule-bound family. But her train journey from Paris to visit Great-Aunt Elodie in Istanbul is swiftly derailed by the discovery of a jewel theft en route. Assured, pacey and instantly seductive, it has the intricately inlaid feel of a classic children’s mystery. Anarchic black humour is rampant in Will Mabbitt’s Embassy of the Dead (Orion), the story of curious Jake, a severed finger in a box, and a Reaper whose task it is to drag Jake screaming into the Eternal Void. Encompassing a vivid, well-drawn supporting cast, from unearthly civil servants to ghosts who haunt school trophies, and beautifully balancing gore and gentleness, creepiness and cackle-out-loud gags, it’s a splendid start to a ghoulish new series, featuring artwork by the talented Chris Mould. Pack tissues aplenty before opening Adam Baron’s Boy Underwater (HarperCollins), starring Cymbeline Igloo, a Year 4 boy who has never been swimming. When his mum has a breakdown after Cymbeline gets pushed into the pool, he goes looking for some answers about his past … Involving and wryly funny, full of tenderness, eccentricity and intriguing meditations on the function of art, this story of grief, depression and the different facets of identity is well-served by Benji Davies’s thoughtful illustrations. For teenagers, an unusual verse novel stands out amid a steadily growing YA genre. Clémentine Beauvais’s In Paris With You (Faber) revisits Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin to imagine what might have happened to Eugene and Tatiana if they had met on the Métro, years after Eugene’s fateful rejection. Clever and sophisticated, layered with deep fondness and resonant emotional truth, this runaway French bestseller, in Sam Taylor’s elegant translation, is a poetic and literary tour de force; via its warm, involved narrator, it explores ideas of young and more grown up love with playfulness and erotic zest. In Marisha Pessl’s Neverworld Wake (Scholastic), Bea and her former friends come to after a fatal car crash, again and again, stuck in a time loop until they can reach consensus as to which one of them should be allowed to return to life. Before they can make the decision, however, they must solve a past mystery – how and why did Bea’s beloved boyfriend die? Instantly fascinating, defying easy categorisation, it’s a book of heady and delectable strangeness. Finally, Karen Gregory’s powerful second novel Skylarks (Bloomsbury) features strong, thoughtful Joni, whose family, as her father becomes too ill to work, have little but their love for one another. When Joni meets Annabel, she recoils from her aura of privilege – yet both sense the spark between them. What will happen when Annabel’s father threatens Joni’s family with eviction? This moving romance, with its well-drawn working-class heroine, its examination of power, politics and protest, and its clarion call to make courageous choices, represents all that’s best in British YA."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/18/testing-children-gives-a-poor-measure-of-ability","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T16:50:56Z","webTitle":"Testing children gives a poor measure of ability | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/18/testing-children-gives-a-poor-measure-of-ability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/18/testing-children-gives-a-poor-measure-of-ability","fields":{"headline":"Testing children gives a poor measure of ability","bodyText":"“Simon Jenkins (The cult of tests is ruining our schools, 15 June) doesn’t mention the most recent proposals from the Department for Education, to introduce “baseline tests” when children enter primary school reception classes. The stated purpose of these tests is to provide measures of “progress” between reception and year 6 when children take the key stage 2 tests. Yet the overwhelming evidence is that quick and simple tests at around four years of age are very unreliable. This makes them particularly unsuitable for use as instruments for “accountability”, which, as Jenkins points out, means league tables of schools. There is already ample evidence that the use of tests at secondary school level to create similar “value added” measures does not lead to scientifically meaningful distinctions between schools and is of very little use for parental choice of schools. In the case of primary schools, the fundamental measurement problem will be even more problematic because of the longer seven-year time lag between reception baseline and key stage 2 outcomes; and because of the much smaller number of children in each primary school in comparison to secondary schools. We urge the government to think again about this policy before it becomes a pointless and wasteful exercise.

Members of the British Educational Research Association expert panel on assessment • To whom is accountability accountable? Simon Jenkins describes collateral damage from well-intentioned attempts to hold professionals to account – in this case teachers and schools – but it happens with doctors and social workers. Does anyone do a cost-benefit analysis of these evaluations? In education the situation is worse than Simon describes. Recognising “what you test is what you get” in most classrooms, my team and others have developed the design of “tests worth teaching to”: mathematics examinations that encourage and reward teachers whose teaching is balanced across the largely agreed learning goals. There is a proud history of such high-validity examinations in this country, reflected in the recommendations for the National Curriculum Task Group on Assessment and Testing, the government’s expert group. But then as now, the system chosen corrupted the intentions. Politicians want simple tests that produce grades that the public will accept as an accurate measure of students’ ability – though, in fact, an equivalent examination is about as likely to give a different grade, above or below. Simple tests encourage simplistic teaching. There is no substitute for a rich collection of evidence, whether it be on mathematics or, indeed, creativity. Art examinations recognise this and use portfolios of the student’s work; other subjects need that too. In practice, few important things in human affairs can be measured simply and accurately. There is evidence that “rich dirty data”, like detailed school reports, is a better predictor of future success than “simple clean data” like exam results. What data do we use in choosing our partners, or whom to vote for? Professor Hugh Burkhardt University of Nottingham • I could describe myself as a fan of Simon Jenkins in most things but must question his views on mathematics. Advanced maths, with complex numbers and on to the formulae of quantum physics, is surely as inspirationally wonderful as poetry and music. The word beautiful is not inappropriately applied to certain mathematical solutions and equations. I write as one who has spent most of his time in the arts, and with Shakespeare in particular, but, thanks to the Open University (among others), was enabled to explore maths. I learned to love the abstractions, the creativity, and the bonuses to human understanding – well beyond the constraints of our five senses. Ian Flintoff Oxford • Simon Jenkins says: “All the maths a normal grown-up needs can be read in John Allen Paulos’s admirable 135-page booklet, Innumeracy.” What about the engineers who designed the cars, planes, ships and trains he no doubt travels on, his mobile phone, the satellite GPS system he no doubt uses, or the complex machines that keep his lights on and his gas supply running? What about the architects who design the buildings he occupies? Are they not “normal grown-ups”? Does he despise their skills, so much more important to the modern world than his own? Or is he simply unaware of their existence? Either way, he reveals his ignorance and lack of imagination. Mark Jarvis Bath • I wholeheartedly agree with Simon Jenkins that testing is ruining schools, but as a mathematics teacher I cannot agree with his sentiment that “Maths has been turned into a state religion, and for one reason: because proficiency in maths is easy to measure”. Proficiency in mathematics is actually difficult to measure when problems can’t be solved with standard algorithms and require initiative, creativity and logical thinking. School mathematics has been ruined because it can be mastered to a certain extent by learning algorithms. If maths has become a state religion then it is merely rituals.

Now why would he do that? I think a random New Yorker probably expressed it best.” In footage of Cohen walking around in Manhattan, a passerby yelled: “Hey! It’s that guy that’s going to jail. Awesome. Way to go, bud.” Oliver continued: “Trump’s week actually began with the eyes of the world upon him as he met with this cutie-patootie for a historic summit, and if you listen to Trump it was a huge success.” In a tweet sent after the summit in Singapore, Trump said “everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office” and declared “there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” “Donald Trump telling me I can sleep well tonight is like the Grim Reaper telling me to have a happy birthday,” Oliver quipped. “His presence is the reason I will not.” “Unfortunately, the deal Trump made with Kim Jong-un was pretty underwhelming,” the host went on. “They agreed to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which isn’t just ambiguous compared to the multiple previous agreements involving North Korea, it’s also close to meaningless.” What America got out of the deal was akin to what Oliver called an “ice cream blowjob … something that sounds great but, when you really think about it, isn’t actually anything”. Oliver continued: “The genuinely remarkable thing about the summit was the deference that Trump happily showed to his counterpart. Diplomacy always involves a certain amount of sucking up to horrible people, but Trump went above and beyond.” In an interview with Greta Van Susteren after the summit, Trump extolled the North Korean leader, saying he has a “great personality”, is a “great negotiator”, is “funny”, “smart” and “loves his people”. “Quickly, on that,” Oliver replied. “No he doesn’t, no he isn’t, no he’s not, no he isn’t, no he doesn’t, and that’s not why he’s doing it. “I’m not going to say that part of Trump’s admiration for Kim is that he wishes he could be a dictator as well,” Oliver added. “I’m going to let him say that.” The host then showed footage from an interview Trump gave to Fox &amp; Friends on the White House lawn, in which he called Kim a “strong head” of state and said: “He speaks and his people sit up at attention, I want my people to do the same.” Oliver said: “That is the president of the United States expressing a wish that people would model themselves after the malnourished population of North Korea.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/18/rebel-women-the-great-art-fightback-review-bbc-feminist-art-70s","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T22:30:07Z","webTitle":"Rebel Women: The Great Art Fightback review – feminist art versus the patriarchy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/18/rebel-women-the-great-art-fightback-review-bbc-feminist-art-70s","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/18/rebel-women-the-great-art-fightback-review-bbc-feminist-art-70s","fields":{"headline":"Rebel Women: The Great Art Fightback review – feminist art versus the patriarchy","bodyText":"It isn’t often that an art documentary feels like a riot, but Rebel Women: The Great Art Fightback (BBC Four) manages to convey a real sense of anarchic joy. It offers an education in the explosion of feminist art in the 1970s, at a time when female artists produced boundary-busting work that still feels radical, and certainly revolutionary. Commissioned as part of the BBC’s Hear Her season, marking 100 years of women’s suffrage, this tells the story of women who decided not to play along with the established order. Screeching in on a soundtrack of Janis Joplin, it acknowledges that change was in the air throughout the 1960s, but takes the infamous events of Miss World 1970 as its starting point and catalyst. I wasn’t completely convinced by the idea that this particular protest was responsible for the art made by women throughout the following decade but it is as good a place to start as any and a lovely bit of archival research. To see Miss World host Bob Hope leering over the “cattle market” while feminists waved football klaxons and threw flour bombs from the crowd, to hear their brilliant chant of “we’re not beautiful, we’re not ugly, we’re angry”, is a treat for the senses. We see one woman who was there, Margaret Harrison, setting up for the first major retrospective of her work, in Bilbao, five decades after her early material was considered so explicit that police demanded it be removed from the walls of the gallery where it was being shown. Harrison is a magnetic character with a dry wit. She recalls the fun and playfulness of the Miss World protest, how a woman next to her had lightbulbs on her breasts and would flick them on and off with a switch held in her hand. When Harrison’s drawings of famous men in female garments – Captain America trying to save the world in high heels and a basque, penis out – were removed for running the risk of obscenity, her exasperation is still apparent. “Oh for God’s sake, I can’t win, whatever way I do it,” she recalls. The work wasn’t shown again for 25 years. It is a common thread running through this story. Judy Chicago packed in the crowds to see The Dinner Party in 1979, her infamous triangular installation that paid tribute to women’s achievements throughout western civilisation, but it was slated by (mostly male) critics and was unable to find a permanent home until 2007. Chicago is a brilliant force and an essential voice; her stories of the feminist art course she ran in California are fantastically entertaining, from the cheerleaders who spelled out C-U-N-T at Fresno airport, to her explanation of how she taught women to introduce themselves, to make themselves louder, bigger, more of a presence. “My God, it was like I had taken the lid off a boiling pot,” she says. It’s not all uproarious and gleeful disruption, though. One of Chicago’s students was Suzanne Lacy, whose work Three Weeks In May documented rape cases in Los Angeles. Lacy applied red stamps on a map to mark every location where an attack was reported, adding fainter marks to suggest the ones that had not been. There is also a fascinating interview with Carolee Schneemann, whose performance piece Interior Scroll saw her pulling a long piece of paper out of her vagina and reading from it. “It caused so much trouble in my life and probably prevented me from having lots of nice teaching jobs,” she says, drolly. Having been rejected by the male art establishment, some female critics turned against her, too, for being “unnatural, obscene and confusing”. It seems to haunt her still, though it is a real pleasure to see that much of this documentary focuses on women supporting each other, and working together for change that was much bigger than their own personal stories. Other artists include Rose English, discussing Quadrille, in which she sent women in tails and hooves to trot around a horse show, and Lubaina Himid, who eventually won the Turner prize in 2017. It seems both a shame that Rebel Women is tucked away neatly on BBC4, given that it’s a story that hasn’t been told enough or to enough people, and also inevitable, given the explicit nature of some of the work. But perhaps it’s a triumph of sorts that many of the artworks it shows have the capacity to provoke today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/18/sheila-sowter-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T13:36:27Z","webTitle":"Sheila Sowter obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/sheila-sowter-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/18/sheila-sowter-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Sheila Sowter obituary","bodyText":"Polymaths are sometimes not easy people, especially when they are always right. I can imagine my cousin, Sheila Sowter, who has died aged 81, excelling as Frank Sinatra’s penance while teaching him the opera-trained version of My Way. She was played in to her humanist woodland funeral to the sound of The Mikado’s Willow, Tit Willow and out to Ride of the Valkyries, the ceremony attended by friends from all walks of her life – Mensa members, Wagnerians, Open University teachers and students, locomotive and railway buffs, fancy ratters, edible dormouse population assessors and multilinguists. Sheila was born in Duffield, Derbyshire, to Percy, an industrial chemist and morris dancer, and Connie, a teacher. Her state scholarship and exhibition to Newnham College, Cambridge, to study the natural sciences tripos, ended with a gentleman’s degree, rather than the expected first, perhaps due to the time she devoted to cricket (she was awarded a half blue), the Magic Circle and other distractions. She chose to be a single parent at a time when it was both unusual and a brave move, and in due course, her daughter, Connie, asked for a pet mouse. Instead Sheila brought home a female rat, for which she borrowed a buck, and started a family. She became fascinated by rat genetics and joined the National Fancy Rat Society, which she served as a national and international show judge. Her quest for the perfect hooded rat, with an even stripe down the back, in any and every colour combination, led her to establish the Flaxholme stud at her home in Brentwood, Essex. Sheila liked to say: “She who can does, she who can’t teaches, and she who can’t teach teaches teachers,” which she did, having obtained an MA in the psychology of education from the University of London. From 1967 she taught initially basic science and latterly earth science at Avery Hill College, which became part of the University of Greenwich, retiring in 1992, and part-time for the Open University, retiring in 1998. She also took an MA in Mathematics from the OU in 1998. She travelled widely over the years – she was visiting Czechoslovakia in 1968 when the Russians invaded, and got out by stopping a train. It turned out she spoke Czech, Russian and German. She is survived by Connie and her grandchildren, Laura and Ben."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/piet-oudolf-gardens-hampton-court-palace-flower-show","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-30T09:59:07Z","webTitle":"How Piet Oudolf’s gardens tame the wild","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/piet-oudolf-gardens-hampton-court-palace-flower-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/piet-oudolf-gardens-hampton-court-palace-flower-show","fields":{"headline":"How Piet Oudolf’s gardens tame the wild","bodyText":"Piet Oudolf’s landscapes are as peopled as they are planted. Folks flock to them, whether it’s the High Line in New York, the meadows at Hauser &amp; Wirth’s art gallery in Somerset, or the Olympic Park in Stratford, to name a few. Many of his gardens may be in hip locations or attached to big-name architects, but the reason people return again and again is his planting. His designs offer up something wild and alive. The plant combinations are dynamic and playful: you are as likely to go and admire decaying seed heads in winter as you are spring blossom. They rip up the flowerbed rule book and roll out, often over vast spaces. “I like to escape some of the rules around gardening – to provide thought and spontaneity, and pleasure.” In many ways, he needs little introduction: there are Oudolf meadows up and down the country, from Scampston Hall and RHS Wisley to Trentham Gardens, all showcasing his complex, highly naturalistic schemes. Some of his earliest work can be found in public parks in Sweden and the Lurie Garden in Chicago. Next month, Oudolf will be exhibiting at the Royal Horticultural Society’s Hampton Court flower show, where he is creating a walk-through feature – complete with favourites astilbe, schizachyrium and monarda – and receiving the inaugural RHS Horticultural Heroes accolade. “England was the first country to appreciate my work and my approach to gardening,” he says. His naturalistic, perennial meadow style exerts such an influence that you now see it in local pocket parks, on roundabouts and in amenity schemes all over the place. Not long ago, the dominant amenity planting style was seasonal bedding, petunias, pelargoniums and pansies – brightly coloured, but sterile, devoid of wildlife and lacking spontaneity. The New Perennial Movement, of which Oudolf is often seen as the figurehead, changed all that, with herbaceous plantings and meadows made up of robust perennials and grasses. “Every time I do a private job, I think, ‘This is beautiful and great, but who is going to see it? Two people and their guests.’ My only interest is sharing my work with lots of people,” he says. He uses a sophisticated palette of plants that are chosen for the rhythm they create over the seasons; they have to look as good in decay as they do in the first unfurling of spring. If eupatoriums and sanguisorba feel mainstream, it’s because Oudolf introduced them to a wider audience. He has even bred his own strains including Gaura lindheimeri ‘Whirling Butterflies’ and Salvia verticillata ‘Purple Rain’. This makes for a landscape that you need to return to again and again to see how this gyrating descent and retreat of shades, textures and hues shifts over the seasons. If his gardens look breathtaking at the height of summer, by autumn and winter they are often heart-rending, as the yellows, purples and reds fade touchingly to subtler shades of brown, tan, blond and eventually black. There’s something emotional about these landscapes. In the 1980s, Oudolf, along with his wife, Anja, started a nursery to support Piet’s design studio at their home in Hummelo, a tiny village in the eastern part of the Netherlands. Here they experimented with a wide range of perennials, looking for robustness, but also beauty in decay, how a plant looks before and after flowering, whether their seed heads withstood winter, what sort of management they would need, and how they would compete with their bedfellows. Garden enthusiasts and designers from around the world flocked to buy plants and see his naturalistic plant combinations at work. “In our first catalogue, there were plants that people had always thought of as wild – and we were selling them,” he says. “They may have been wild, but they were also attractive and well-behaved.” Now in his 70s, Oudolf shows no sign of slowing down. He’s even tackling food-growing, creating an edible meadow around Noma’s new restaurant in Denmark. “It’s an adventure,” he says. “We’ve sown a crop of barley and put some edibles in between. We’re just finding our way – next year it’s going to be much more bold.” When I think of Oudolf’s work, I think about the parallels it has with those medieval Dutch flowering paintings that reminded the viewer of the fragility of life – including the odd worm, moth, torn or fallen petal. Even the most beautiful of flowers is to be pollinated, and will eventually rot. Oudolf’s love of seed heads and wind-dried winter stems is a similar reminder, often of the transience of such earthly pleasure. • The RHS Hampton Court Palace flower show runs 3-8 July (rhs.org.uk) How to get the Oudolf look Sanguisorba canadensis A robust plant with white cylindrical flower heads that appear in late summer.

The playing from these fine Amsterdam instrumentalists had me gripped right from the start of Mendelssohn’s febrile Quartet in F minor, Op 80, his desperate farewell to his beloved sister and fellow composer Fanny, who died in 1847. Much of Mendelssohn’s chamber music burns bright, driven by a brilliant, vital energy that here is turned into scurrying despair. The writing, beautifully crafted as ever, is nevertheless lost and dazed and shot through with an infinite sadness. Within a few months, Mendelssohn himself was dead, aged just 38. The Dudok Quartet get right to the heart of this piece, unsparing in the frantic opening allegro and sweetly tender in the adagio, before plunging into the abyss of the finale. It’s a very fine performance. They pair the Mendelssohn with Weinberg’s uncompromising Quartet No 3, Op 14, from 1944. Weinberg lost most of his family in the Holocaust and was imprisoned by the Soviets. Every movement of this piece speaks of his bleak existence, none more so than in the andante sostenuto, a miniature concerto for the first violin, exquisitely played by Judith van Driel. • Tragedy also struck the Czech composer Josef Suk, when his wife Otilie died prematurely in 1905, hardly a year after her father, Dvořák, his teacher. British pianist Jonathan Plowright has won praise for his recordings of composers as diverse as Paderewski, Melcer, Brahms and Handel and now, in an album entitled simply Suk (Hyperion), he turns his attention to four groups of sun-filled miniatures written before that dark year. The music is quite lavishly overheated and histrionic, but there is no denying Plowright’s formidable technique and total command of this repertoire. • If you missed Radio 3’s broadcast of Scottish Opera’s Eugene Onegin, catch up on iPlayer.

Kaczyński returned to work last week after spending 37 days in a Warsaw military hospital. His aides had long maintained that his absence had been due to arthritis in his knee, but on Friday the health minister, Łukasz Szumowski, told Polish radio that “Jarosław Kaczyński’s state of health was such that not accepting him to the hospital would have threatened his life, and therefore he was admitted in an acute manner”. No further details have been released. Kaczyński, who turns 69 on Monday, is the leader and driving force behind the Law and Justice party, which assumed office after victory in parliamentary elections in 2015. Though the former prime minister does not hold any public office other than that of a backbench member of parliament, he is Poland’s undisputed de facto leader, handpicking ministers and making strategic decisions on the future of the country from his party office in a ramshackle building in central Warsaw. In recent weeks, senior officials have moved to quash the speculation regarding Kaczyński’s health, in comments that appeared to be directed at members of their own party. “All those dreaming about replacing Kaczyński, must get armed with a very long patience,” said the interior minister, Joachim Brudziński, earlier this month. “The chairman is in full control of what is going on in the party and is not planning a political retirement.” “Please be calm, [Kaczyński] is keeping his eye on things,” Marek Suski, chief of staff to the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, also a Law and Justice member, told a pro-government weekly last week. Having co-founded Law and Justice with his late twin brother, Lech, in 2001, Kaczyński has no obvious successor as leader of the party, with some commentators suggesting that his departure could trigger a substantive realignment on the right of Polish politics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/20/football-world-cup-team-sports-mental-illness","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"‘If it wasn’t for football, I’d be dead, or in a gutter’ | Sarah Johnson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/football-world-cup-team-sports-mental-illness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/20/football-world-cup-team-sports-mental-illness","fields":{"headline":"‘If it wasn’t for football, I’d be dead, or in a gutter’","bodyText":"The Brazilian striker has been threatening to score all game. He’s narrowly missed a few shots at goal already. Other attempts have been blocked by the Argentinian defender who has been putting his body on the line in a desperate attempt to keep his country in the game. The relentless Brazilian attack continues as a midfielder passes to the striker again who pivots, smashes it with his right foot and watches as it screams into the back of the net. This may sound like a scene from the 2018 World Cup in Russia, but it’s not. This is the annual European Association for Sport Integration (Easi) football tournament held in the north of England last week where teams from the UK, Holland and Norway competed. This year it took a World Cup theme with each of the teams allocated a World Cup country to represent. The overwhelming majority of players in this tournament have received treatment for mental health problems and use football as a means for managing ongoing issues. “I’ve been coming to this tournament for 10 years,” says Saskia Van de Hoeff, 41, from Holland. Van de Hoeff has depression, borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. She is one of a handful of women in the tournament. Since she started playing football 10 years ago, the sport has had a significant impact on her life. “When I was a kid, I was always picked last and bullied,” she recalls. “I felt like a nobody. When we came to the tournament, Hans, our carer, said I was captain. Now I feel important and needed. It doesn’t always feel like that. Sometimes you feel: ‘What am I doing? What am I here for? This planet doesn’t need me.’ With [football], I think, ‘OK, I can do something and it makes me feel good’.” More than 20 teams travelled to Barnsley Football Club in South Yorkshire for the tournament, which was organised by South West Yorkshire partnership NHS foundation trust. The home team from Barnsley represented Brazil. A team of asylum seekers and refugees from Eritrea and South Sudan living in England – called Afro Boys – were crowned champions, despite playing as Australia in the tournament. Sport can help in people’s recovery, help to manage symptoms and can improve the quality of people’s lives, research has shown. Football delivers social inclusion, helps physical health and improves people’s mental health. The Mental Health Foundation promotes physical exercise to improve people’s wellbeing. The organisation points to studies which show that exercise can be as effective as medication or psychotherapy when treating depression. “Football saves lives,” says Colin Dolan, who set up the Mental Health Football Association to connect community groups across the UK. “It saved mine without a shadow of a doubt. If it wasn’t for football, I’d be dead, or in a gutter.” Hannah Burton, physical activity lead in mental health services for the South West Yorkshire partnership NHS trust, has seen the impact football can have. “Football builds a sense of team spirit and the teams become a network. It gives men a platform to talk about mental health problems.” She talks about one man, Ian Henry, who was really unwell with paranoid schizophrenia, struggled with eye contact and saying hello when she first met him eight years ago. Now, he holds down two jobs – one at the trust – and is an advocate for other people coming through services. Henry says he can see the progress he has made since he was sectioned for the second time in 2008. “I haven’t relapsed in 10 years and that’s thanks to sports – being happy, meeting new people, getting out and about, and going to new places. I don’t notice my schizophrenia now. I’m a person again. Today my mind’s on stuff – that’s how it helps people.” Dolan, meanwhile, almost didn’t make it to Barnsley for the tournament. He is a manager of a team from Everton (Portugal in the competition) but is going through a bout of depression associated with his bipolar disorder. “I’ve been in bed more days than I care to remember over the last nine weeks,” he says. “Because of this tournament, I was encouraged by the lads phoning and texting me. I had to come for them. It’s given me a great boost. I don’t know what I’m going to be like in three days’ time but I’m feeling positive today for the first time in nine weeks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jun/19/poland-v-senegal-world-cup-2018-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T17:25:36Z","webTitle":"Poland 1-2 Senegal: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jun/19/poland-v-senegal-world-cup-2018-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jun/19/poland-v-senegal-world-cup-2018-live","fields":{"headline":"Poland 1-2 Senegal: World Cup 2018 – as it happened","bodyText":"David Hytner was at the Spartak Stadium to see Senegal beat Poland in a match that was not without its controversies. Angry with Gregor Krychowiak for costing his side a stupid goal? Think Robert Lewandowski could have done more? Exact a brutal revenge here. Here’s our first take on events at the Spartak Stadium, which will keep you going until the Guardian’s man in Moscow, dishy David Hytner, files his report. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over at the Spartak Stadium, where Senegal have taken the points at Poland’s expense. They’re the first African team out of five to, not only avoid defeat, but win at this summer’s World Cup. A Thiago Cionek own-goal gave them a first-half lead, which was doubled when M’Baye Niang capitalised on a hideously undercooked backpass from Gregorz Krychowiak to score. Krychowiak pulled a goal back for Poland with a few minutes to go, but it wasn’t enough. Senegal go back to their training base as thoroughly deserving winners. 90+4 min: Senegal go on the attack, with Sadio Mane on the ball. He dawdles in possession a few yards outside the Poland penalty area and is robbed. 90+2 min: There are two minutes of added time remaining. In the meantime, here’s achingly cool Senegal manager Aliou Cisse, the youngest manager at this World Cup. 90+1 min: Poland win a corner. The ball’s swung into the mixer but N’Diaye claims with supreme confidence. 88 min: Krychowiak’s goal came from a free-kick (not a corner) sent into the Senegal penalty area by Grosicki. Completely unmarked, the villain of the piece for Senegal’s second went some way towards redeeming himself with a free header past Khadim N’Diaye. 86 min: Krychowiak’s goal comes moments after Sarr had taken a dive in the Poland penalty area when Rybus slid in to tackle him. It was a scurrilous piece of play-acting from the cheeky Senegalese. Krychowiak scores with a header from a free-kick, but his effort is being referred to the VAR officials. It stands! 81 min: Sarr goes down “injured” and the referee tells him to get up. Seconds later, he’s managed to shake whatever was ailing him and picks up a pass and sprints into the Poland penalty area from the right flank. Rybus dives in to ... oh, hold on. 80 min: Poland’s reaction to going two down has been ... to do nothing. They’re plugging away with the same tactics that have served them so poorly for 80 minutes. “When things aren’t working you have to try to do something to change them,” says Ally McCoist. “Just go long for a few minutes, play it forward to Lewandowski. Just do something different.” 79 min: Senegal substitution: Moussa Konate on for Niang. Poland substitution: Dawid Kownacki on for Milik. 74 min: Looking at a replay of Senegal’s second goal ... crikey, what a meltdown. From inside the Senegal half, on the edge of the centre-circle, Krychowiak hoisted a huge back-pass towards Wojciech Szczesney. Having just been waved back on to the pitch, Niang saw what was happening and sprinted towards the Poland penalty area. With Bednarek just sort of standing a couple of yards outside it waiting for Szczesny to claim the ball after haring out of his area, Niang darted between both Poles, flicked the ball goalwards and had the relatively straight forward task of advancing a few yards and scoring into an empty net while Szczesny and Bednarek stood glaring at each other and Krychowiak. 72 min: Gueye is booked for a foul on Robert Lewandowski. Senegal substitution from just after they scored their second goal: Mama Biram Diouf off, Birmingham City’s Cheick Ndoye on. 69 min: Piszczek drills a low cross to the near post, where Milik had found a pocket of space courtesy of a good run. He’s first to the ball but shoots the wrong side of the upright from four or five yards. 65 min: Poland’s players were complaining in the wake of that goal and I think it’s because Niang had left the field after suffering an injury and they believe he had either returned without the referee’s permission or come on in an advantageous position to make the most of Krychowiak’s tomfoolery. It seems the ref had waved him back on and after that it was just tough luck on Poland, who only have themselves to blame for that defensive calamity. 62 min: Awful stuff from Poland. From the centre of the pitch and for reasons best known to himself, Krychowiak tries to loft a 50 yard pass back to his own goalkeeper. His pass drops woefully short and with Niang and Szczesny both charging at the ball from opposite directions, the Senegal wins it and has the straightforward task of shooting into an empty net. Bednarek could have done better too, but looked powerless to stop Niang as he raced Szczesny to the ball. A hideous mistake by Krychowiack gifts Senegal a second goal. 58 min: “Everything looks a struggle! Everything looks a struggle!” says Ally McCoist to Jon Champion on the UK coverage of this game, upon asked for his thoughts on how Poland are doing. The pair make for a very entertaining duo and have just been laughing at their discovery that former Senegal, Liverpool, Bolton and Rangers player El-Hadji Diouf now works in Dakar as a government goodwill ambassador. “There’s hope for us all,” chuckles Ally. 56 min: Poland are playing with a bit more urgency in this second half, but have yet to create a chance of note from open play. They do so as I type - with Rybus sending an inviting cross to the back post, where it drops invitingly for Lukasz Piszczek. He sidefoots an atrocious volley well wide of the upright. 54 min: Lewandowski is penalised for a foul on Ismaila Sarr as the pair tussle for the ball down by the byline to the right of the Senegal goal. 50 min: SAVED!!! Lewandowski takes the free-kick and it’s a good one – on target, but lacking that bit of zip which might have taken it past Khadim N’Diaye in the Senegal goal. 49 min: Lewandowski wins the ball on the halfway line and gallops forward. He’s brought down illegally by Salif Sane on the edge of the Senegal penalty area and the Senegal centre-back gets a yellow card. Free-kick for Poland, a yard or two from the D on the Senegal penalty area. 46 min: Jan Bednarek, who plays for Southampton, looks badly hurt after his collision with Youssouf-Sabaly but is up and looking alert after receiving treatment. He’s on for Kuba Blaszczykowski, which is good news for those of us who type minute-by-minute reports for a living. 46 min: This match seems to be getting a bad press on Twitter, which is obviously the most accurate barometer of informed public opinion we have, but I’ve found it quite entertaining so far. Sadio Mane has been fairly quiet, as has Poland’s most creative player, Piotr Zielinski. Robert Lewandowski had little or no service in that first half. Play resumes, with Bednarek on for Poland. He’s immediately clattered in an accidental collision. Peeep! The players troop off for their half-time cuppa, with Senegal leading by the only goal of the game. It’s been entertaining enough, but far from a classic. Thiago Cionek’s own-goal separates the sides; the Polish central defender was helpless to do much about it after Idrissa Gueye’s low drive went in off his shin after 37 minutes. 45 min: We’re into added time at the end of the first half. There’s a touch of England-against-Tunisia about Poland’s performance - they’re looking toothless up front and lacking that little bit of creative flair in midfield that might cause Senegal problems. 44 min: The clock ticks towards half-time with Senegal continuing to dominate. Krychowiak is penalised for a foul ion Idrissa Gueye about 10 yards inside the Poland half. He’s already on a yellow card and can count himself extremely lucky not to have got a second one for that late tackle. 41 min: Senegal corner. The ball’s floated into the mixer and burley Senegal centre-back defender Salif Sane leaps highest. He doesn’t make decent contact with the ball and admonishes himself in the strongest possible terms after heading the ball straight into the ground. He should have scored there. 40 min: Fifa’s boffins have decreed that Gueye’s shot was going narrowly wide before it was deflected, so Senegal’s opener will officially go down as a Thiago Cionek own-goal. 38 min: Dearie me, how’s your luck? Senegal take the lead through a deflected goal. Mane squared the ball for Idrissa Gueye several yards outside the penalty area and the Everton man took a shot. His low drive took a deflection off Cionek and went into the bottom right-hand corner with goalkeeper Szczesny hopelessly wrong-footed. Senegal lead through a flukey deflected own goal off Thiago Cionek. 36 min: Theres a break in play as both Sarr and Kuba receive treatment from their respective medical teams. 33 min: Now Niang gets down the right flank and squares the ball for Diouf. He leaps to head goalwards, but is flagged for offside. 32 min: Ismaila Sarr gets down the inside right for Senegal again and squares the ball, but it’s cleared. 28 min: Not so much end to end as box to box for the past few minutes, in a game that is very open ... up to a point. Both sides look fairly evenly matched, but good chances have been conspicuous by their absence. On the UK Coverage, Allly McCoist is on co-comms duty and is currently bemoaning the lack of movement from the attacking players of both sides. “Maybe they’re showing each other a bit too much respect,” he muses, as he points to the reluctance of the full-backs of both sides to get forward. 25 min: Senegal go on the attack again, a series of slick passes coming to an end when Mama Biram Diouf is unable to control a clever Niang pass into the penalty area. 23 min: Kuba takes a poor first touch on the edge of the Senegal penalty area and goes down looking for a free-kick. The ball breaks to Lewandowski, with his back to goal. He swivels and shoots, but doesn’t get hold of the ball properly. Wide. 20 min: Poland attack and Krychowiak tries a shot from distance. It’s deflected towards Piotr Zielinski, who is on the stretch and unable to control his header on goal properly. 19 min: M’Baye Niang is looking a real handful here and is sent galloping in behind the Polish defence by a wonderful, weighted defence-splitting pass by Youssouf Sabaly. He veers towards goal, but his shot-cum-cross towards Mane goes horribly wide of the far post. 16 min: Senegal right-winger Ismaila Sarr goes on a marauding run down the inside right and is tackled by Rybus outside the penalty area. He manages to stumble some distance before going to ground inside the penalty area, but no free-kick or penalty is forthcoming. “Ismaila, no!” as Freddie Mercury once said. 14 min: Kalidou Koulibaly concedes a corner as Poland get out of their own half for the first time in several minutes. Nothing comes of it. 12 min: Gregorz Krychowiak, who spent last season on loan at West Brom from Paris Saint-Germain, gets booked for a foul on Niang and Senegal have a free-kick about 35 yards from goal. Sadio Mane’s free-kick goes horribly wide; he was too far out. 10 min: Senegal are dominating proceedings at the moment and are attacking down the left repeatedly, sending in crosses. They’re looking quite impressive so far. 9 min: Niang does well to keep the ball in play down by the byline and lofts in a cross. Sarr looks ready to volley past Szczesny from seven or eight yards, but Maciej Rybus is alert to the danger and makes an important clearance. Good defending from the Lokomotiv Moscow man. 8 min: Senegal attack down the left flank with Niang on the ball. He drills a low cross into the penalty area, but Szczesny intercepts. 7 min: M’Baye Niang takes the corner for Senegal, but fails to clear the first man at the near post. 6 min: Thiago Cionek concedes a needless corner after a breakdown in communication with his goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. 5 min: Poland attack down the left flank with Piotr Zielinsky on the ball. He picks out Kamil Grosicki, who attempts to dink the ball towards Robert Lewandowski in the penalty area. Senegal clear. 3 min: A slow start as both teams attempt to suss each other out and settle into something resembling a rhythm. 2 min: That’s Jakub Blaszczykowski, who goes by the nickname “Kuba” and in the interests of preserving my sanity, will be referred to accordingly for the remainder of this match. 1 min: Jakub Blaszczykowski gets on the ball early doors playing on the right wing for Poland. He’s makiong his 100th appearance for Poland today, so hats off to him. 1 min: Senegal get the ball rolling playing all in green. Poland’s players wear white shirts, red shorts and white socks. The teams are in the tunnel preparing to walk out on to the pitch. Robert Lewandowski leads out Poland, while Sadio Mane skippers Senegal. It’s time for the National anthems. Liverpool forward Sadio Mane is Senegal’s star player, but is just one of several players in the squad to earn their corn in England. Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye also starts, while Stoke striker Mama Biram Diouf will play up front for the Lions of Ternaga. Alfred N’Diaye, who also starts, spent last season on loan at Wolves. Substitute Cheikou Kouyate plays for West Ham. Kamil Glik sits this one out, as expected. while Wojiech Szczesny gets the nod in goal ahead of Lucasz Fabianski. Poland: Szczesny, Piszczek, Pazdan, Cionek, Rybus, Krychowiak, Zielinski, Blaszczykowski, Milik, Grosicki, Lewandowski. Subs: Fabianski, Jedrzejczyk, Bednarek, Goralski, Linetty, Teodorczyk, Glik, Peszko, Bereszynski, Kurzawa, Kownacki, Bialkowski. Senegal: Khadim N’Diaye, Wague, Sane, Koulibaly, Sabaly, Sarr, Alfred N’Diaye, Gueye, Niang, Mane, Diouf. Subs: Diallo, Mbengue, Mbodji, Sow, Kouyate, N’Doye, Konate, Sakho, Ndiaye, Balde, Gassama, Gomis. Referee: Nawaf Shukralla (Bahrain) Poland: Szczesny, Pazdan, Cionek, Milik, Krychowiak, Grosicki, Rybus, Blaszczykowski, Zielinski, Piszczek, Lewandowski Senegal: N’Diaye, Wague, Sane, Koulibaly, Sabaly, Gueye, N’Diaye, Sarr, Mane, Niang, Diouf Weather report: The heavens have just opened in Moscow, writes minute-by-minute reporter from London bunker. Some journalists in Russia have been suggesting the pitches aren’t being watered enough and are too dry - this should help today. Poland will almost certainly be without veteran central defender Kamil Glik, who injured his shoulder while attempting a bicycle-kick in a training session a couple of weeks ago. If he is absent, it may force Poland to revert to a back three, despite experimenting with a four-man defence in the build-up to this tournament. For Senegal, Anderlecht central defender Kara Mbodj is an injury concern, having played just two games since December, when he suffered a knee injury. His match fitness is obviously a concern. We’re recording our Guardian World Cup Football Daily podcast after the last match of each day’s action during this tournament. Last night, Max Rushden and I were joined by the Racing Post’s Mark Langdon to discuss England’s win over Tunisia and the rest of yesterday’s action. If you’re not already a subscriber, you can download it for free in all the usual places. We’re currently second only in the charts to Love Island: The Morning After - a bitter pill to swallow. Poland and Senegal are the last two of the 24 teams at World Cup 2018 to make their bows, in one of the more open, interesting and intriguing groups of this summer’s finals. Moscow’s Spartak Stadium is the venue, where Senegal are hoping to avoid joining their four fellow African sides – Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria and Tunisia – in losing their opening match. In their first World Cup finals since 2006, Poland are warm favourites to beat them. Kick-off is at 4pm (BST), but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jun/19/from-gucci-to-beyonce-how-the-pink-suit-took-over-fashion","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T14:14:04Z","webTitle":"From Gucci to Beyoncé – how the pink suit took over​ fashion​","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/19/from-gucci-to-beyonce-how-the-pink-suit-took-over-fashion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jun/19/from-gucci-to-beyonce-how-the-pink-suit-took-over-fashion","fields":{"headline":"From Gucci to Beyoncé – how the pink suit took over​ fashion​","bodyText":"Usually one to set trends rather than follow them, Beyoncé this weekend did as the likes of her sister Solange, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik and Salma Hayek have done before her: she wore a pink suit, pushing it to the forefront of 2018’s fashion canon by opting to wear it in the video for the first single from her long-awaited joint album with Jay-Z, Everything Is Love. Of course, being Beyoncé, she did it with more of a sense of pomp than most: standing in front of the Mona Lisa in a Louvre emptied of tourists, leaving space for Queen Bey and Jay-Z to chart their own course through art history as they launched an album that has been described as “celebrating their marriage and black identity”. The pink of the suit pops against the more muted tones of the art. Its clashing red tassel belt could be read as a visual nod to the velvet rope that would usually accompany a visit to the Louvre, just not for Queen Bey. The look that takes centre stage is from the autumn/winter 2018 collection of relatively unknown London-based label Peter Pilotto. Launched in 2007, it’s a label best known for its prints and sexiness – and it’s something of a sartorial curveball from Beyoncé, even as someone who is unafraid to throw them; on her recent tour, for instance, she teamed pieces from fashion gods Gucci with lesser-known designers such as LaQuan Smith. So while Beyoncé can start trends with her little finger, she is very much jumping on an already rumbling bandwagon here. The current penchant for the pink suit was arguably sparked, as with so many other trends, by Gucci. That catalyst was part of Alessandro Michele’s spring/summer 2018 collection. Worn by a red-haired model who walked down the catwalk in a matching pink shirt and pink tie, Vogue called the look “Lady-Penelope-meets-Bianca-Jagger” and it has proven, according to Candice Fragis, buying and merchandising director at luxury stockist Farfetch, to be “really popular”, “in line with the colourful tailoring trend”. On the high street, Topshop’s bright suiting has been a bestseller this summer too, according to the brand’s design director, Anthony Cuthbertson, with pink and pistachio (Jay-Z’s on the money too, then) bestsellers. Pink suits have been popping up from Monki to Zara to Asos, where design director Vanessa Spence says they “have grown in popularity” as customers have become “more accustomed to wearing head-to-toe pops of colour”. And, on the fashion platform Lyst, searches for pink suits have gone up by 69% over the past three months. The pink suit has a long (and sometimes tragic) backstory. Look to US political history and essays have been written about the pink wool suit worn by Jackie Kennedy on the day her husband was assassinated, still stained with his blood. Much has been made of the power of Hillary Clinton’s many-hued “pantsuits”, and pink ones – from rose to hot – have made up a solid part of her repertoire over the years. Beyoncé, then, is one in a long and illustrious line of pink suit wearers, but she might just be the first to wear one to an audience of two with the Mona Lisa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/18/port-talbot-trump-steel-tariffs-uk-us-china","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T12:35:34Z","webTitle":"Port Talbot workers on Trump steel tariffs: 'This could be serious'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/18/port-talbot-trump-steel-tariffs-uk-us-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/18/port-talbot-trump-steel-tariffs-uk-us-china","fields":{"headline":"Port Talbot workers on Trump steel tariffs: 'This could be serious'","bodyText":"The escalating trade war started by Donald Trump could mean fresh financial woes for Britain’s biggest steel plant, less than 18 months after workers agreed to pension benefit cuts to save the Port Talbot works. From 1 June, the US president imposed a 25% tax on steel and a 10% tax on aluminium from the EU, Mexico and Canada. On Friday Trump upped the ante, announcing a 25% tariff on $50bn (£38bn) of Chinese goods. All countries targeted by US tariffs have vowed to take retaliatory measures. The Port Talbot site has 4,200 employees and sells about 10%-12% of its output to the US. Alan Coombs, a Community union shop steward at the site, said the workforce had become even more concerned about the grim prognosis for the future of steelmaking in this country. He added: “It’s hard to lift your head and look towards the future sometimes. There was a lot of uncertainty anyway, and this just adds more. It puts a doubt in everyone’s mind about the future. “It’s pretty simplistic to say things like ‘we’ll just add 25% to the price’ because there’s a lot of cheap competition out there. It’s ironic because we started looking into the US market a lot more when the Chinese were dumping their steel here.” The Port Talbot plant has been battered by job cuts and was threatened with closure in the 2016 steel crisis, prompted by weak demand and a glut of cheap Chinese output. Its future was only secured after workers agreed to cuts to their pension benefits in February 2017, part of a package of proposals to help turn the business around. Even with these measures, Port Talbot’s Indian owner, Tata, decided the only long term option was to seek out a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp, a German rival, to pool European assets. That deal is on course to be concluded imminently. However, Britain’s steel sector has barely had time to haul itself off the canvas before being hit with another dizzying blow. The UK exports 350,000 tonnes of steel to the US a year, about 7% of the country’s annual production. Most of this is high value and speciality steel, with an average price of €1,400 (£1,200) a tonne. The average price for hot-rolled coil steel, one of the benchmark types of steel, is about €600 a tonne. The US tariffs apply to a wide range of steel and aluminium products such as sheets, plates, bars, pipes and “semi-finished” products. Trump wants to protect US steelmakers by making it more expensive for the county’s manufacturers to buy foreign steel. UK Steel has warned that Trump’s tariffs would leave about 20m tonnes of Chinese steel needing to “find a new home to go to”. Coombs said: “The big concern is that it will encourage China to start dumping steel on our doorstep again. The last time we saw stuff like that we went down to one blast furnace. So, it’s a worry, of course.” The Welsh steelworker said it was too soon for the trade charges to have made an impact, but added: “The fear among the guys is that it’s just around the corner. Everyone in Port Talbot is very aware of how serious this could be.” The GMB union this month said the parliamentary constituency of Aberavon, home to the Port Talbot site, was “most at risk” from Trump’s tariffs. The union outlined the importance of the industry to Britain, saying it supports more than 34,000 jobs, with annual wages of more than £1bn, and £230m paid in tax and national insurance contributions. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, said the Port Talbot works was the “beating heart of the community”. He added: “The tariffs are potentially a hammer blow. But the community and the workforce is resilient. “It’s been met with a big shrug as if to say ‘people continue to let us down and not stand up for steel’. The people of Port Talbot just put their heads down and keep going. “The works is in a better position than it was a few years ago, but it is still very fragile and very precarious. Even though the economic outlook is improving, people are just about keeping their heads above water.” As well as the threat of trade barriers and cutthroat competition, British steelmakers must also deal with the burden of higher production costs than many of their competitors around the world and Europe. Steel-making is an energy-intensive process and the UK has some of the highest power bills in Europe. They also face higher labour costs and tougher environmental restrictions than global competitors. The George W Bush administration introduced steel tariffs in 2002, which lasted for 20 months. It prompted threats of retaliation from the European Union on US products before the policy was abandoned. The EU, like China, will challenge the US steel tariffs at the World Trade Organization and the policy is likely to result in tit-for-tat charges on American-made goods flowing into Europe. For Port Talbot, Trump’s tariffs are just another hurdle for long-suffering bosses and workforce to overcome. “It’s frustrating - something like this, which is out of your control,” said Coombs. “You start to think what else may be around the corner?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/20/world-weatherwatch-mexico-and-michigan-suffer-deluges-as-fires-scorch-colorado","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-20T20:30:02Z","webTitle":"World weatherwatch: Mexico and Michigan suffer deluges as fires scorch Colorado","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/20/world-weatherwatch-mexico-and-michigan-suffer-deluges-as-fires-scorch-colorado","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/20/world-weatherwatch-mexico-and-michigan-suffer-deluges-as-fires-scorch-colorado","fields":{"headline":"World weatherwatch: Mexico and Michigan suffer deluges as fires scorch Colorado","bodyText":"A flood emergency was issued for parts of the US mid-west last Sunday. Severe thunderstorms deluged Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, northern Wisconsin, and northern Minnesota.

The third named storm in the Pacific, Carlotta, lacked potency to achieve hurricane status but still packed a punch. Carlotta tracked along the south-west coast of Mexico on Sunday and Monday.

That’s all I did’\r\n","bodyText":"Maggie O’Farrell is the author of seven bestselling novels, including This Must Be the Place and the Costa prize-winning The Hand That First Held Mine. Her new book, I Am, I Am, I Am, is a memoir about her brushes with death, among them a severe childhood illness, an armed ambush, a near-drowning, and her daughter’s life-threatening allergies. You once told your husband you were more likely to become a mathematician than to write a personal memoir. What made you change your mind? You don’t necessarily choose the books you write; they choose you, in a way. Sometimes one arrives when you are least expecting it, a bit like an unplanned pregnancy. This book was very much like that. It just sort of appeared in the backs of my diaries. But I had huge trepidations about publishing it. I only let my publisher give me a £1 advance in case I changed my mind. Why? I knew because it was so personal that I needed to get it completely right, not just so that I was happy with it but so that my husband and family and anyone else who was in it was happy with it. I love reading memoirs, especially writers’ memoirs, but sometimes I feel viscerally shocked at how exposing they are to people who don’t have a right of reply. So, it was very important to me to write a memoir that didn’t fleece people I love. Do you think it is unusual to have as many near-death experiences? Perhaps I have had more brushes with death than most people, although a lot of them can be traced back to the illness I had as a child and the related medical conditions. But I do think people have more close encounters with death than they acknowledge. They put them away in their minds. It’s a natural human reaction not to want to think about them. The reactions I have had to the book have been very interesting from this perspective. People are usually amazed and say: “Seventeen brushes with death! How come?” I can see the wheels turning in their mind and they start to say: “Oh, yes, there was that time… and that time.…” The other person in the book who has regular brushes with death is your daughter, your middle child, who from birth has suffered chronic eczema and extreme allergic reactions up to 15 times a year. Daily life, just keeping her safe, sounds like a military exercise… It is a bit. I am not naturally a very organised person but I’ve had to become so out of necessity. You have to be very practical, make sure you have all her medication with you and that everyone she’s with knows exactly what to do in case she has an episode. She can go into anaphylactic shock just by sitting next to someone who opens a bag of peanuts. But the other part of parenting is the emotional work. It’s very challenging to have to explain to a three- or four-year-old why they’re in pain, why they look different to everyone else, why they’re in an ambulance, why they’re in an ICU. I have learned a huge amount. What’s the most important thing that being your daughter’s mum has taught you? The human need for narrative. It had never occurred to me before that it is a requirement that we have, a bit like oxygen and water and food. I found the thing I reached for again and again when she was having a crisis was making up a story for her about what was happening: why we were in the hospital unit; why her eczema was so sore; why she needed to put cream on every day. It was the only thing that helped, making up a story about her – and also about what happened to me. In saying to her, I was different at school as well, I was ill, I spent time in hospital, I was able to help her. I suppose in a sense that is what I was trying to do with the book. I was trying to normalise it for her and for other people when she’s older. To say, we all go through this. You’re not alone. You had viral encephalitis at her age, which confined you to bed for two years and is the subject of a very affecting chapter in the book. To what extent did the illness determine who you are? I think it must have done to a significant extent but it is impossible for me to disentangle who I might have been and who I actually am. Someone asked me, if you could turn back the clock and not have the illness, would you? I found that impossible to answer. I was really floored. I thought, well, actually I don’t know, maybe I wouldn’t. It is part of who I am and continues to feature in my daily life. How? I have huge balance issues and I can’t walk around in the dark – I need to be able to see where I am going. I drop cutlery and knock over glasses. Sometimes I see things that aren’t there: lights, flashes or spots in the fabric of my vision. When I’m very tired I see things upside-down. I also have a problem with sequencing – I wouldn’t be able to read out a phone number. You describe how you read a huge amount while you were ill. Is that what turned you into a writer? I would say it guided me on the path I eventually took. I pretty much read for two years. That’s all I did. I listened to audiobooks over and over again. And I would read from one end of my bookcase to the other and start again. Also, when you’re a child and you’re ill in hospital nobody tells you what’s going on and it is only by watching and interpreting the behaviour of the adults around you that you find out your destiny. So, I developed that writer’s skill of being an observer at an early age. How do you manage to find the time and the space to write? To do my tax return or to do the washing-up or the laundry I have to be very self-disciplined but never with writing. It’s what I want to do. Our domestic life is perhaps more demanding than others’ but for me writing is a coping mechanism. Sitting at my desk I can live an alternative life. In any case, being hungry for time at your desk is good for you. Children in that sense are very good editors. I cut a lot less from my books than I did before I had children.

Marina Litvinenko and Goldfarb have demanded retractions from RT and the state-run Channel One after they made a series of “reckless and defamatory allegations” in March and April, in the aftermath of the poisonings of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, they say. The British government blamed Moscow for the attack on the Russian former double agent and his daughter in Salisbury. The Kremlin responded with a media counter-offensive, featuring press conferences by Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, and a domestic campaign aimed at persuading Russians the claim was a smear. Litvinenko’s father, Walter, played a starring role in this campaign. Litvinenko was murdered in 2006 with a radioactive cup of tea and his father initially blamed Vladimir Putin. But after an unhappy period of exile in Italy, he returned to Russia in 2012 and begged the president for “forgiveness”. In April, RT screened a 30-minute interview with Walter Litvinenko, in which he claimed Goldfarb was a CIA agent. He said Goldfarb murdered Litvinenko in his hospital bed, citing a “confession” by Goldfarb’s late wife. Goldfarb then murdered his wife to cover up the crime, he alleged. RT translated the interview into English and aired it on the Worlds Apartshow, hosted by Oksana Boyko. RT this week acknowledged the legal complaint but has so far not commented. Walter Litvinenko’s claims have no basis in fact. In 2016 a public inquiry into Litvinenko’s death ruled that his polonium killers were Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun and that they were sent by Russia’s FSB spy agency. Putin and the FSB’s then boss, Nikolai Patrushev, “probably approved” the killing on British soil, the inquiry found. Speaking to the Guardian, Goldfarb said he initially took the RT claims “impersonally”, seeing them “as just another shot in the propaganda war”. “But then when everybody started teasing me as ‘Alex the murderer’ and I imagined millions had watched these programmes I realised that somehow it sticks. A creepy feeling,” he said. Goldfarb’s wife, Svetlana, died of cancer in 2010, four years after Litvinenko’s murder. Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko have written to RT’s editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan, and the Channel One chief, Konstantin Ernst, demanding retractions. They have also launched a crowdfunding page to help pay the legal costs, estimated at more than $300,000 (£225,000). The case will be lodged before a federal court in Manhattan. Marina Litvinenko said she had put up with “huge pressure and propaganda” from Moscow for more than a decade, and she had done her best to protect her husband’s reputation from “lies and fake stories”. Her father-in-law’s recent public support for Putin saddened her, she said. The Kremlin’s TV campaign was politically motivated, and an attempt to deflect blame from her husband’s real murderers, she said. Russia’s modern spy agencies were using “old-school KGB methods” and cynically exploiting Litvinenko’s family members. She added: “I believe in justice”. Channel One screened libellous material in four separate broadcasts, including the popular primetime show Person and Law, she alleges. During one broadcast Walter Litvinenko shared a sofa with an uncomfortable-looking Lugovoi, whom British authorities have charged with Litvinenko’s murder. Lugovoi is a deputy in Russia’s parliament and the recipient of an honour from Putin. The state-run network also claimed Marina Litvinenko lied to the public inquiry, which heard evidence of how the two killers left a polonium trail across London. Walter Litvinenko told RT, in contrast, that Russia’s president was a “decent person”, and incapable of doing “nasty things”. On Tuesday, the New York-based lawyer Bertrand Sellier wrote to Simonyan: “Your actions constitute intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress on our clients, particularly Mrs Litvinenko. She struggled for 10 years to have her husband’s murderers named in a court of law. “Undermining the court’s finding with a fake narrative before tens of millions of viewers adds insult to injury. We hereby demand that you issue a full and immediate retraction and apology with equal reach and prominence as the broadcast itself.” Channel One did not respond to a request for comment. RT faces multiple investigations by the UK broadcast regulator, including in connection with the Skripals’ novichok poisoning. Ofcom said it was examining a number of instances in which the channel potentially breached laws on impartiality. “Since the events in Salisbury, we have observed a significant increase in the number of programmes broadcast that we consider warrant investigation as potential breaches of the broadcasting code,” the regulator said. “Ultimately, we may decide that the licence should be revoked because the licensee is not fit and proper, on broadcasting compliance grounds.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/18/christopher-chope-upskirting-bill-underwear-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T11:43:52Z","webTitle":"Protester hangs knickers outside office of MP who blocked upskirting bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/18/christopher-chope-upskirting-bill-underwear-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/18/christopher-chope-upskirting-bill-underwear-protest","fields":{"headline":"Protester hangs knickers outside office of MP who blocked upskirting bill","bodyText":"Protests against the Conservative MP Christopher Chope, who blocked a bill to make upskirting a specific criminal offence, have extended to parliament, where a mystery dissenter draped a string of women’s pants across his office door. Four pairs of lacy knickers were pinned together and taped to the door like bunting on Monday; a suspender belt and another pair of pants were attached, but later fell off or were pulled down. No one has yet claimed responsibility for the prank. The protest follows widespread criticism of the MP for Christchurch after he used parliamentary procedure on Friday to delay the voyeurism (offences) bill on upskirting – the surreptitious taking of sexually intrusive images. Chope has been criticised by a series of fellow Tory MPs, among others, and Theresa May has promised the government will now adopt the private member’s bill, tabled by the Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse. Adding to the pressure on Chope, the Speaker, John Bercow, granted an urgent question in the Commons from Hobhouse, to which a minister will have to respond. On Saturday, Chope was subject to a similar protest at his Dorset constituency office. A local artist, Lorna Rees, made some “knicker bunting” and draped it across the office door. Writing on the underwear said: “No one should be able to photo my pants unless I want them to.” The bill followed a campaign by Gina Martin. Police declined to prosecute a man Martin accused of taking underskirt pictures of her on his phone at a music festival in London last summer. The new law would create a new criminal offence punishable by up to two years in prison. Chope delayed the bill by shouting “object” during its second reading in the Commons, meaning it could not be put through to the next stage without debate and a vote, which will not happen for some weeks. In his first response to the affair on Sunday, Chope told his local newspaper that he backed the intent of the bill, but objected to it because he does not support the principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading. He told the Bournemouth Echo: “The government has been hijacking time that is rightfully that of backbenchers. This is about who controls the House of Commons on Fridays and that’s where I am coming from.” The MP said he was “a bit sore about being scapegoated over this”, and had talked to the Tory chief whip about the criticism he had received from colleagues. Chope said: “The suggestion that I am some kind of pervert is a complete travesty of the truth. It’s defamatory of my character, and it’s very depressing some of my colleagues have been perpetuating that in the past 48 hours.” On Sunday, May declined to condemn Chope, but promised the bill would be put through parliament in government time. Asked on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show why Chope had recently been knighted, the prime minister said: “Christopher Chope has been a longstanding member of parliament.” She added: “What we’re going to do on this upskirting issue is put in government time and make sure that legislation is there on the statute book. This is an invasive, offensive act and we need to take action against it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/19/tuesday-best-tv-conviction-murder-in-suburbia-the-super-squirrels","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T05:20:03Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV – Conviction: Murder in Suburbia; The Super Squirrels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/19/tuesday-best-tv-conviction-murder-in-suburbia-the-super-squirrels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/19/tuesday-best-tv-conviction-murder-in-suburbia-the-super-squirrels","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV – Conviction: Murder in Suburbia; The Super Squirrels","bodyText":"Conviction: Murder in Suburbia 9pm, BBC Two In 2003, Glyn Razzell, a former investment manager from Swindon, was convicted of murdering his wife, Linda, from whom he was estranged.

He walked into Number 10, his regular NHS pin badge missing from his lapel, as rumours swirled that he was facing demotion to the business department. Two hours later, he emerged from his meeting with Theresa May not only still in post, but with a beefed-up brief to cover social care. Now Hunt has secured a funding boost for the NHS well beyond expectations, and has become the longest serving health secretary in history. His longevity is so remarkable that even May has taken to teasing him about it. At a journalists’ dinner earlier this year, she joked that if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister she would be “breaking rocks in John McDonnell’s re-education camp … But of course, Jeremy Hunt would still be health secretary.” Hunt’s renaissance has been a triumph in its own right. But it has also led many observers to ask if the MP for South West Surrey has an even bigger job in his sights. With the funding battle behind him, few Conservatives would be surprised if Hunt’s ambitions turned from the health service’s future to his own – in No 10. “He’s on manoeuvres, there’s no doubt,” one senior backbench MP said. “The question is how far he is really prepared to push it.” Even those outside of his party acknowledge his ascendancy. “Jeremy Hunt is in a very powerful position now, the only question is how much he chooses to deploy that power,” his former Lib Dem junior minister Norman Lamb said. “He is the great survivor. He has a skill for seeing off political disasters.” Lamb said Hunt now felt far more confident to make spending demands public. “We all know it’s pretty much impossible to get sacked these days so he can choose to be much more vocal about it,” he said. “Ultimately, it doesn’t go far enough, there’s no certainty about where the money is coming from and it does all feel quite fragile, but it is a significant shift.” NHS bosses who until recently viewed Hunt with disdain are now full of praise for his dogged, and ultimately successful, campaign to be the first public service to be taken out of the austerity straitjacket. David Nicholson, the former NHS chief executive in England, tweeted some personal praise – “Longevity has its benefits.” “I’m not usually Hunt’s biggest fan but he’s played a bit of a blinder, you have to say,” a senior NHS official said. “When May came into No10 in 2016, she was very hostile to the NHS, so for Hunt to win her round was remarkable.” His friends say Hunt, whose NHS lapel pin is firmly back on, is “genuinely passionate” about getting the right resources for the NHS. An ally of Hunt, who saw the negotiations with Hammond up close, said: “For Hunt, this was not about helping the NHS but also about his moment in history. If it had been only 1.5%, he would have walked. Now he’s going to be the health secretary at the NHS’s birthday and is the one who has taken the NHS out of austerity.” One of the health policy experts Hunt used to help him build his case was struck by how some of those around him saw him winning £20bn more for the NHS as, in part at least, also his pitch as a potential future Tory leader. “Brexit’s paralysis of most normal government business means few ministers are actually able to get anything major achieved in their areas. In a future leadership contest, Hunt will be able to say ‘I saved the NHS’, which is no small thing,” he said. Hunt seriously considered a bid for the leadership in 2016 after David Cameron stood down but did not have the support to mount a realistic bid, having taken a daily battering for his handling of the junior doctors strikes. He was a vocal supporter of remain during the referendum but two years of EU negotiations later, Hunt told LBC he was now a Brexit convert, because of the “arrogance” of the EU Commission’s approach. A number of Conservative backbenchers said they had begun to see him as a more plausible “unity candidate” than many of his main cabinet rivals. Tory MPs said they understood Hunt would be highly unlikely to challenge May and would only consider a run should a vacancy arise. One source said Hunt was effusively supportive of May in front of colleagues at cabinet. “He spends a lot of his time saying how great the PM is,” one cabinet minister said. Several MPs have floated the theory that Hunt is now one of the two most plausible “born-again Brexiter” candidates, alongside new home secretary Sajid Javid. “Jeremy’s stock is undervalued and Sajid’s is overvalued,” another Tory MP said. “Sometimes colleagues look confused when you mention his name, but that could be because they’ve never really thought about it, not that they are against it. “You need to have someone who can expand their appeal. Jeremy has a lot of people you could potentially add to his tally, you can’t really say that about Sajid and you definitely can’t say that about Michael Gove.” Embracing Brexit at this late stage is not a universally popular tactic, however. “To be honest, that actually makes me think less of him, not more,” one minister said. Another move that has piqued colleagues’ interest is his emerging role as “minister for the Today programme”, a role once held by Michael Fallon, as the government’s most trusted attack dog. With Fallon gone, Hunt was the man sent out on the airwaves after the messy departure of Damian Green. His main obstacle to Number 10, at least at an election, is his public image which he will hope the funding boost can repair. As culture secretary, he only narrowly survived a Leveson inquiry examination into his relationship with James Murdoch. He is a multi-millionaire, made from the sale of the website he co-founded, Hotcourses, before making the leap into politics, and his finances have come under fire, most recently for failing to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats. His tenure in the health department saw the first strikes by NHS doctors in 40 years. . There are tough battles to come for Hunt, especially on social care reform which may prove even more difficult given the Tories’ toxic “dementia tax” policy from the election. One Whitehall source said Hunt probably felt less personally attached to social care reform than NHS funding, but knew he needed to confront it. Lamb said Hunt needed to prove he could be just as bullish on social care reform and funding. “He absolutely has to turn his attention to social care now. He has said it will need more money. But now they need to deliver.” “He is a very, very ambitious man, but he does really care too about a properly funded NHS and he doesn’t mind if he has to carry quite a lot of shit to see it through,” the Whitehall source said. “He has fought really hard for this victory and he now has that stable relationship with the health service. When you have that, it gives you space to start thinking longer-term.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/18/praise-organisers-friendly-russians-volgograd-world-cup-england-fans","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T23:42:35Z","webTitle":"England fans enjoy stay in Volgograd with no repeat of Marseille violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/18/praise-organisers-friendly-russians-volgograd-world-cup-england-fans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/18/praise-organisers-friendly-russians-volgograd-world-cup-england-fans","fields":{"headline":"England fans enjoy stay in Volgograd with no repeat of Marseille violence","bodyText":"England supporters spent the early hours of Tuesday morning drinking in the bars of Volgograd, as the team’s first game at the tournament went off without trouble, despite fears before the tournament. England were cheered on to a 2-1 win against Tunisia by a much smaller contingent of supporters than usual for a major tournament, with poisonous bilateral relations and the fears of a repeat of the violence in Marseille two years ago putting many fans off making the trip. But those who came were almost uniformly positive about the experience so far. At a central Volgograd bar in the early hours of Tuesday, Craig and Tommy, two Sunderland fans, were practising Russian phrases with obliging locals and said they had spent three days in “fantastic” Volgograd, bonding with the locals and taking military history tours. “We’re sick of people talking about trouble. If you’re respectful there won’t be any problems,” said Tommy. The tournament is taking place amid unprecedented tension between London and Moscow, and the Foreign Office has been strongly critical of Russian authorities in the wake of the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury and British officials are boycotting the tournament. In March, foreign secretary Boris Johnson compared Russia hosting the World Cup to the 1936 Olympics, held in Nazi Germany. The week before the tournament, a group of MPs warned that anyone wearing the St George’s cross could be subjected to attacks from Russians. But yesterday, British diplomats and football officials struck a very different tone, lavishing praise on the organisation of the World Cup and speaking positively of the hosts. “The warmth of the welcome here has been absolutely outstanding. All the fans have commented on that and Volgograd seems delighted to welcome everybody,” said Lindsay Skoll, the deputy British ambassador to Russia. Skoll spoke at a wreath-laying ceremony at a memorial here, the scene of one of the most brutal battles of the second world war when it was known as Stalingrad, spoke warmly about the city and played up the common history between Britain and Russia. Despite concerns about the safety of LGBT fans travelling to the finals, England’s match against Tunisia featured England flags supporting gay rights in the stadium. The LGBT campaigner Di Cunningham, who works with England’s football authorities, unfurled an England banner which combined the cross of St George and the rainbow colours of the LGBT rights movement. “The idea of coming to Russia or going to Qatar and supporting England is difficult for an LGBT-plus fan,” Cunningham said, but having made friends during her trip to Volgograd, she added: “I cannot believe that those people wouldn’t be able to take messages of solidarity and togetherness back to their countries, so all power to the World Cup wherever it’s held. It does have the power to change things.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/tim-dowling-car-death-trap","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: my wife is delighted – the car is officially a death trap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/tim-dowling-car-death-trap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/23/tim-dowling-car-death-trap","fields":{"headline":"Tim Dowling: my wife is delighted – the car is officially a death trap","bodyText":"My wife has pleasing news. Not good news, just the sort of bad news she enjoys being the bearer of. When I arrive home from a meeting early one evening, she cannot hold it in. “Our car’s been recalled,” she says. “What?” I say. “You know when they mention some death car on one of those boring consumer things you’re sort of half-watching?” she says. “Death car?” I say. “And it never turns out to be yours,” she says. “But I checked – same model, same version, same year, same everything.” The car, which we bought secondhand from Farouk the mechanic just after Christmas, has already had its fair share of issues. The engine warning light was permanently on, although Farouk assured us that the problem lay with the light itself and not the engine. A few days later, the oil light came on, sounding a warning tone every 30 seconds. No amount of oil would make it stop. After two weeks, Farouk took the car back to make the necessary repairs. For a long time we heard nothing. Farouk, when contacted, was apologetic, but mysterious: complications had arisen, he said, but it was clear he would rather not discuss them. I began to suspect that he’d accidentally sold our car to someone else. He offered to lend us his car. We accepted. Weeks went by, then months. Finally, in mid-April, our car was restored to us, fully repaired and fit to drive. Until now. “What’s wrong with it?” I ask my wife. “Either it goes completely dead when you’re speeding along on the M4,” she says, “or it bursts into flames while you’re parked.” “Does it have to be the M4?” I say. “It’s not funny,” she says. “But it’s 10 years old,” I say. “Shouldn’t it have blown up by now?” “Apparently not,” she says. “What do we do?” I say. “We’re supposed to be getting a letter,” she says. Weeks go by. No letter arrives. The car does not lose power. I begin to suspect my wife may have got the model wrong, after all, and is refusing to acknowledge her error because she likes telling the story. “I’m afraid we can’t come this weekend,” my wife says to someone on the phone. “Our car is a flaming death trap.” “No, it isn’t,” I say. “Who are you taking to?” “It was on TV!” my wife says. “I’m absolutely terrified of driving it.” “You drove it this morning,” I say. She gives me a stern look over the tops of her glasses. “I suppose we could take the train,” she says. “But I think we need to be here in case the car suddenly bursts into flame for no reason.” A week later, I am hovering near the letterbox, hoping to intercept some lamp wicks I ordered. I do not wish to explain to my wife why I have bought lamp wicks, because it might lead to a discussion about the lamp I also ordered. I hear the post hitting the mat, and run to the hall. There are no lamp wicks in the pile: just a magazine, a phone bill and a letter addressed to me informing me that my car has been recalled. “It’s real,” I say, reading the letter a second time. “Of course it’s real,” my wife says. “What does it say we should do?” “It says at this stage we should do nothing,” I says. “Is there a number?” she says. “They will send us another letter,” I say. “Then they will fix it, and it will be free.” “Does it say we should drive it?” she says. “Just do nothing,” I say. “It’s the do nothing letter.” The next day, my wife returns from the supermarket in a state of high excitement. “So, on the way there,” she says, “the engine warning light started flickering.” “That’s actually sort of an improvement,” I say. “And the seatbelt thing suddenly started bonging,” she says, “even though my seatbelt was on.” “Is this because of the letter?” I say. “Are you being paranoid?” “Then the indicator click stopped working,” she says. “It begins,” I say. “Next come the flames,” she says. “Did you get bread?” I ask."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/18/should-female-doctors-hide-their-title-why-immodestwomen-say-no","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-18T17:06:00Z","webTitle":"Should female doctors hide their title?

Why #immodestwomen say no","bodyText":"I always assumed it was titles that define a woman by her marital status that are one of our biggest indicators of sexism. But look to social media and it is “Dr” that is making waves. Defending using her academic title for her Twitter account, historian Dr Fern Riddell tweeted: “My title is Dr Fern Riddell, not Ms or Miss Riddell. I have it because I am an expert … I worked hard to earn my authority, and I will not give it up to anyone.” Her replies were promptly filled with men objecting, from checking if she wasn’t imagining her doctorate (“Are you self-certified or do you have accredited qualifications?” asked one) to telling her she was coming across as rude. In solidarity, women with doctorates are now adding Dr to their usernames with the hashtag #immodestwomen. Mansplaining is firmly rooted in the modern sexism lexicon. But as the #immodestwomen trend shows, the world of gender and qualifications goes beyond this: it is not simply that some men who have no knowledge of a subject assume they do, it is that women who actually do have the expertise are told they must act as if they do not. This starts early and persists. How many of us were taught not to “show off” as children? Research shows girls as young as six years old believe that brilliance is a male trait, while boys are more likely to speak up in class even if they do not know as much about the topic as others – a trait that continues into the workplace. I have a PhD in politics and I never use the title for work except when giving lectures at university. My bankcards say “Ms”. I put “Dr” in my Twitter username because I joined the site too late to get any other combination of my name – and felt awkward about it for months afterwards. I always thought this was because I am against hierarchal titles – why do we need titles anyway? – but I know it is as much a case of embarrassed self-deprecation. It is easy to dismiss women using Dr as an insignificant issue, but it speaks to a bid to undermine and belittle female expertise and power, and to keep gendered social roles (strangely, women who put “wife” or “mum” in their Twitter bio rarely report strangers chastising them for that). Tellingly, there is now even a parody account created to mock Dr Riddell, as if to warn other women to “know your place”. Be it a PhD or any skill, there’s something quite satisfying about stopping this downplaying of our talents and hard work – to refuse to conform to the inoffensive and subordinate box some men would still put us in. #Immodestwomen are breaking out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/24/architectural-association-eva-franch-i-gilabert-spanish-tornado","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T07:00:21Z","webTitle":"Architectural Association awaits its ‘Spanish tornado’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/24/architectural-association-eva-franch-i-gilabert-spanish-tornado","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/24/architectural-association-eva-franch-i-gilabert-spanish-tornado","fields":{"headline":"Architectural Association awaits its ‘Spanish tornado’","bodyText":"The Architectural Association is an architecture school like no other. It is a hothouse, beneath its sober Georgian facade in London, a laboratory, finishing school, club and catwalk wherein genius and absurdity are nurtured, a never-ending carnival of creativity, pretension, inspiration, ambition and debate out of which, over the decades, individuals that change the world of architecture keep on emerging: Richard Rogers, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Amanda Levete, the recently departed Will Alsop. It is English in its way, like a gentleman wearing exotic lingerie beneath his Savile Row suit, but international in its input of people and output of ideas. Yet it has never had a leader like Eva Franch i Gilabert, a woman described as “a tornado… truly a force of nature” by those who have worked with her, and who will officially start as its new director on 1 July. She is someone for whom, as she puts it, “every single act in life is a creative action”, but without a single agenda or view of the world. She is, I put it to a former colleague, an incredible cloud of energy, intelligence and sociability without it always being clear where it all goes. “Exactly,” is the reply. Stories about her abound: for example, that a potential career as a figure skater was cut short by injury at the age of 17. Or that, among the clothes she makes for herself is a dress made out of the mattress cover on which she and her siblings were conceived. She had youthful passions for triathlons, other forms of athletics and handball. Also for mathematics – “Especially,” she says. “I fell in love with second derivatives, problems of optimisation, and intersection of equations into space.” Having grown up in a rice-growing region of Catalonia, goes another story, she can tell at a glance what kind of rice is growing in a given field. “I can also recognise trees,” she adds, “and herbs, and clouds, and weather, and plants, and oranges.” Born in 1978, she is the youngest holder of her post in the AA’s 171-year history. She is also the first woman to hold it permanently (her immediate predecessor, Samantha Hardingham, was a temporary appointment). Not that she wants to dwell on youth or gender. “People discriminate by the questions they ask,” she says. “People see me as this crazy young figure. My question is: why? There are presidents of countries who are younger.” She also resists being measured by those stories of her past: “I do believe that one can make oneself anew, with every place, and at any given time.” She has been working in the US since she won a fellowship at Princeton University in 2006 (“I dream in English, I curse in Catalan”). Since 2010 she has been head of the Storefront for Art and Architecture in New York, a small but influential gallery-cum-thinktank. The architect Charles Renfro, president of the Storefront, says that she gave it “global reach… the entire world was her oyster”. The Storefront project that she and others talk about most is called Letters to the Mayor, in which groups of local and global architects write to the leader of a given city – Nashville, Buenos Aires, Taipei – and propose ways of improving it. The mayors respond with various degrees of commitment and the project has led to such experiences as discussing, on Ukrainian TV, whether to preserve Soviet-era monuments. For Franch, however, the best thing about it was having the conversations that led to the letter, “with people who do not usually hang out – young, old, established, avant garde”. Having the conversation is generally a big thing for Franch. She has talked of her fondness for cooking paella for colleagues, and then asking challenging questions, as a parent might, when they are most at ease. It is something she likes about the AA (which offers foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate courses)– when she was scouting the premises before her interview, students started talking to her without knowing whether she was a teacher or another student. “The real power of that school,” she says, “is you can have a conversation with anyone at any time about anything: architecture, politics, life.” “The power of architecture,” she says, “is in bringing us together. I am highly optimistic that in spite of big tragedies architecture is still one of the most beautiful practices because you have to accept you are building for everyone.” At Storefront she edited a survey of the office manuals of American architectural practices called OfficeUS Manual, a lethally dull subject, you would have thought, but one she and her colleagues somehow made witty and surprising. Its purpose was to show that the production of buildings is collaborative and structured. “Independence isn’t an option” and “catastrophe can be avoided” are among its insights. Procedural though it sometimes is, she says that architecture can also give you goosebumps, a phenomenon on which she started to write a paper at Princeton. “Indian culture has 16 senses,” she tells me, “and one is goosebumps.” She felt them, for example, when she visited Mies van der Rohe’s crystalline Farnsworth House in Illinois, in the snow, and found that its stone floor was unexpectedly warm. She felt them again when she chanced upon Gaudi’s alterations to the cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, having previously seen drawings of this work in his archive. Her understanding of architecture, in other words, is broad, from the effects of acknowledged geniuses to the business models and organisational charts of practices. She also has a knack of making other activities sound architectural, such as the way her father “designed” the planting of orange trees so that they ripened at weekly intervals, “so that we could have orange juice in its prime taste throughout the winter”. “I loved the speed,” she says of handball, “the feeling of the group behaving almost like a swarm, the strategies developed and the creative process that the game became in every single match”. Her willingness to embrace the technical and the procedural will come in handy at the AA, which has been suffering multiple crises to do with both budgets and the official processes of accreditation, without which its foreign students might have lost their right to stay in the UK. There was a case for choosing another candidate, more familiar with the arcana of British academic administration. Franch, however, says that “the first thing I asked for” were the accounts, budgets and strategic plans. “You learn a lot from loans, mortgages and interest rates,” she says. “Bureaucracy is just time. And knowing.” Franch is someone for whom almost everything is fascinating and who is fascinating about almost everything, but some things remain elusive. She talks about the importance she gives to ideas and issues, but it’s hard to say what those ideas and issues are. After two hours of lunch-assisted interview, it dawns that to try to pin these down is not really the point. Renfro, who is also stumped when I ask for specifics, then finds a good formulation: “The way she approaches dealing with ideas is one of her ideas.” Her energy has the potential to revitalise the AA. There’s also a non-zero chance that she and it will rapidly find out that her personality and singularity will be too much for their structures. Either way, thanks to the influence of the association, the effects could be felt in the world of architecture for decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/19/how-about-someone-politicians-are-scared-of-readers-on-the-new-question-time-host","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T12:28:23Z","webTitle":"'How about someone politicians are scared of?': readers on the new Question Time host","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/19/how-about-someone-politicians-are-scared-of-readers-on-the-new-question-time-host","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/19/how-about-someone-politicians-are-scared-of-readers-on-the-new-question-time-host","fields":{"headline":"'How about someone politicians are scared of?': readers on the new Question Time host","bodyText":"With David Dimbleby announcing that he will step down from chairing Question Time, the BBC’s political TV show is looking for a replacement. Guardian writers have listed the runners and riders and readers have been commenting with their own suggestions. Some contenders included Alan Partridge, Jeremy Kyle and Nigel Farage, with others recommending that the show should be scrapped. Here are some of your notable favourites and the reasons for choosing them. Eddie Mair: ‘He ticks no establishment boxes’ “One of the few interviewers who has ever called Boris Johnson to account. He’s done it at least twice now. I know Mair is white and middle-aged – something identitarians and quota-maniacs won’t like at all – but he is by far the best interviewer the Beeb has. I think he would be fantastic chairing QT.” TheKevster “His father was a lorry driver and his mother was a nurse. Mair’s professional career began after he rejected a university place in order to present on Radio Tay, a local Dundee station. This man ticks no establishment boxes and would be perfect for the job.” 3lement Kirsty Wark: ‘An intelligent breath of fresh air’ “She’s very sharp and authoritative but combines it with delicious warmth and humour.” judyse “She would be an intelligent breath of fresh air. She doesn’t suffer fools, nor does she humiliate – or patronise. It would be such a difference.” ethelbrose “A good combination of gravitas, even handedness and charisma.” Grouch46 Andrew Neil: ‘How about someone useless politicians are scared of?’ “Instead of political correctness, how about someone useless politicians are scared of – Andrew ‘Brillo’ Neil?” Giroud “He has got to be worth an outside bet. He has impeccable Tory credentials; he is male and white; he’ll be guaranteed the Daily Mail imprimatur. He’s also old. He’ll be unstinting in his bias as the corporation goes into anti-Corbyn overdrive in the run up to the next election, and if Labour wins and the bosses feel a softer approach to their new paymasters is required, he’ll be easy to retire without too much controversy. You heard it here first.” scaredstiff Victoria Derbyshire: ‘She’s in a class of her own’ “Her radio interview with London grime artist Stormzy told me all I need to know. She can handle the really challenging stuff evenhandedly and lets the viewer/listener decide. For that reason, ahead of the rest by a long chalk.” RodneyBooze “She is in a class of her own. She doesn’t ‘do’ political agendas either which also sets her apart from the rest. Derbyshire is the only BBC Presenter that can justify a six-figure salary. And that is from someone who loathes the BBC with a vengeance.” hawk007 Samira Ahmed: ‘She is intelligent, calm and dispassionate’ “The serious contender is Samira Ahmed. She is intelligent, calm, dispassionate and evenhanded in style; the complete opposite of the incumbent stepping down. She has demonstrated her credentials when stepping in on Sunday morning’s debate show on BBC. She is not one of the Newsnight cabal, nor white British, so that may count against her being chosen.” mikedearing “Samira Ahmed, please. Nice to mix things up a bit, and she always seems to know her stuff.” BabylonianSheDevil03 Mishal Husain: ‘She is skilled, authoritative and impartial’ “A year or so ago, I was interpreting at a round table discussion in the UN. It was moderated by Mishal Husain. She was skilled, authoritative and impartial, and kept the discussion (which often ends up as a series of monologues) moving and lively. And she stopped the worst windbags in their tracks with such charm and efficiency that she left several of them bewildered as to quite how they’d lost the floor. Brilliant job. She gets my vote.” Genevastar “She is the best interviewer in the media at the moment and quite likely the best chair of QT in my view.” AlanGTC James O’Brien: ‘Clever, can think on his feet and control the crowd’ “Clever, can think on his feet, can control the ‘crowd’, will not stand for blatant lies, not a comedian, not Richard Madeley. The only real answer. Anyone else, well, no.” Red1729 “Just get James O’Brien in from LBC. Then you get proper questions and detailed answers rather than the usual staged nonsense. We might even get a panel of guests who actually represent the population of the UK.” BulldogofBrexit ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/19/sir-richard-wallace-the-collector-review-sumptuous-survey-of-art-and-opulence","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T14:41:07Z","webTitle":"Sir Richard Wallace: The Collector review – glories from the age of global plunder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/19/sir-richard-wallace-the-collector-review-sumptuous-survey-of-art-and-opulence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/19/sir-richard-wallace-the-collector-review-sumptuous-survey-of-art-and-opulence","fields":{"headline":"Sir Richard Wallace: The Collector review – glories from the age of global plunder","bodyText":"A gold face glitters under a spotlight in the cave of curiosities that is the Wallace Collection’s new exhibition space. Is it a French rococo whatnot? A Renaissance objet d’art? These are the kinds of European treasures this museum is famous for. But no. The beaten gold mask that holds you enthralled in this gorgeous exhibition was made in the Ashanti empire in west Africa in the 18th or 19th century. It is a masterpiece of African art that has lain tucked away in the abundance of the Wallace Collection since Victorian times. When the British empire was at war with the gold-rich Ashanti empire in 1873-74, this astonishing object was looted from the royal palace in Kumasi. It ended up in the hands of the royal jeweller Garrard and Co, which sold it to the wealthy and omnivorous collector Richard Wallace. This exhibition about Wallace – who was born 200 years ago, in 1818 – makes it clear what an atypical Victorian he was. Born illegitimate in London, he was taken to Paris to be educated by the family of his mother’s lover, the expatriate fourth Marquess of Hertford. He became the marquess’s private secretary and, in 1870, inherited his vast fortune. He was, almost certainly, Hertford’s son. The Wallace Collection, as it is called today, was started in Paris by the Marquess of Hertford, but it was Wallace who brought it to London and built the house that still holds it. He indulged his passions as a collector in the auction rooms of Victorian London, bidding against his rivals, the Rothschilds, for treasures from all over the world. This exhibition picks out some of his most precious finds to create a sumptuous survey of art and opulence, a portrait of the art collector as dreamer. This a great way to inaugurate the Wallace’s new underground exhibition space, an atmospheric lair that includes the Victorian coal vaults. Their arches now hold Wallace’s treasured Renaissance daggers and jewels. The dagger of Henri IV of France, made in about 1599, is lavishly inlaid with mother of pearl, yet Wallace bought it for sentimental reasons: Henry IV was a champion of religious tolerance who ended the wars of religion in France and was assassinated for his courage. In Paris, you can still find the Wallace fountains, free water points for the poor in a neo-Renaissance style that he put up and paid for after living in Paris during its siege and the commune in 1870-71. Wallace was a good European with a great eye for treasures. His boxwood statuette of Hercules, carved by Francesco Pomarano in about 1520, is a throbbingly homoerotic masterpiece of club-wielding muscle. A maiolica plate with a crowd of naked female bathers painted on it in 1525 is equally lusty. There was nothing puritanical about this Victorian collector who gleefully amassed things that once belonged to European rulers. The Horn of Saint Hubert, a coveted medieval relic with rich carvings done in the 15th century, was once the property of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Yet, that’s nothing. In researching this show, the curators established that two ornate Chinese cups in the collection were used by the Qianlong emperor in the 18th century in a ritual ceremony to ensure the stability of China. It didn’t work. Wallace bought the cups at a Paris auction in 1872. They had been looted from the Summer Palace when it was destroyed by Britain in 1860 in the second opium war. Wallace was a buccaneer collector in an age of global plunder and capitalist rapacity. The result is one of the world’s finest public art collections, a treasury we all share. In picking out some of its lesser-known wonders in a sharp, seductive light, this lovely exhibition sends you into the rest of the gallery to explore its strangeness and beauty with new eyes. • Sir Richard Wallace: The Collector is at the Wallace Collection, London, from 20 June until 6 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/23/generation-making-now-thats-what-i-call-music","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"'You can't judge a generation's taste': making Now That’s What I Call Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/23/generation-making-now-thats-what-i-call-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/23/generation-making-now-thats-what-i-call-music","fields":{"headline":"'You can't judge a generation's taste': making Now That’s What I Call Music","bodyText":"Peter Duckworth, one of the directors of the Now That’s What I Call Music brand, is a bespectacled man in his 50s who has helped put together the famed pop compilations for about half his life. That’s since 1990, if you measure things by the regular calendar, or “since 18”, if you go by what Duckworth and his collaborators Steve Pritchard and Jenny Fisher call “Now-time”, in which recent history is marked out entirely by the release of the numbered, three-a-year disc sets. The trio, who work out of the Sony Music offices in London, are about to celebrate the release of Now That’s What I Call Music 100, and in the buildup to this landmark, I shadowed them in their work. I wanted to learn how Nows are made and try to understand why the anthologies, on the shelves since 1983 and still selling well, have had such staying power. It is February when we first meet. Months to go until the July release of their 100th edition, and in fact the team still have the Easter-time Now 99 to compile and master. In a corner of the Sony office that’s busy with coffee cups, branded mouse mats and a Guinness World Record naming Now the longest-running music album series, they set to work. Any new Now starts with Fisher – the hoodied, soft-spoken fortysomething director of the brand – and her clutchbag full of loose, clacking memory sticks. For weeks, Fisher has been collecting songs for possible inclusion, which are sent to her by email. It all used to be more glamorous, she admits, back in the analogue era, when labels sent over individual songs on massive DAT tapes by courier. But what can you do? Across the office from Fisher, Pritchard, a 58-year-old motorcyclist who occasionally shows up for work in leathers, crunches commercial data, scowling at his iPad as it notes chart positions and streaming counts. At a facing desk, Duckworth, who is the savant to Pritchard’s metrics guy, immerses himself in pop culture in a more general way, trying to work out what tracks will be popular by the time their next Now comes out. Duckworth has a party trick that he demonstrates to me. “What was the first Now you owned?” he asks. “Now 23,” I say. (A Christmas present in 1992, double-tape edition. Even the name of this record still gives me a little tickle of pleasure.) “So you’re... 35 years old.” I blink. “How did you do that?” Duckworth shrugs. “Everyone gets their first Now between nine and 10. I only hesitated because I couldn’t remember if that one came out in ’92 or ’93.” Meanwhile, Pritchard has found the old tracklist for Now 23 and asks if I can name the first song. But it’s a silly question. Can’t we all? Nows tend to land at a particular moment in your young listening life. Some time after the realisation that the pop playing on the radio and out of Chinese restaurant speakers isn’t all indistinguishable mulch, but some time before you learn what albums really are and turn obsessive about track arrangement and liner notes, bearing choices of favourites like a coat of arms and self-defining by your dislikes as much as your likes. The Nows scooped up whatever was charting at the time – so that Now 23 could run deliriously from Erasure to Abba to Billy Ray Cyrus to the song from the video game Tetris. I must have played it a thousand times. Of course I can remember track one, I tell Pritchard. “Tasmin Archer, Sleeping Satellite.” He nods. Oh, they had high hopes for Archer, he recalls, but she was never included on another Now. So many acts have come and gone in this way that the trio admit blocks of Now-time are a bit of a blur. To refresh their memories, they refer to a book, published a couple of years ago, that lists all the tracks on all the compilations from the early 1980s onwards. Flicking through, they purr with delight at the memory of a recent high point, Now 85, which began with what they see as an unbeatable two-track punch, Get Lucky by Daft Punk, then Blurred Lines by Robin Thicke. Then Justin Timberlake! Taylor Swift! Jason Derulo! The gang sigh. It was one of their biggest sellers. * * * I ask how they come up with the running order and they invite me to the mixing day for Now 99. By 35-year tradition, the mixing takes place in a small upstairs room at Abbey Road Studios. Fisher brings her bag of memory sticks and printouts of a spreadsheet that lists about 65 songs for possible inclusion. There’s room on a double-disc comp for about 45. The cull starts at 10am, after the trio are joined in the studio by an engineer, Alex Wharton, who has “been doing this since the late 70s or early 80s, in Now-time”. Wharton uploads a couple of gigabytes of songs to a PC attached to a mixing board. He has to crawl in behind the computer tower and thunk in each memory stick. Beside Fisher on a sofa, Pritchard has an iPad, waiting for the midweek chart numbers to come in. Duckworth, on an office chair, twirls a Biro. It’s 10.17am when they start to compile Now 99 and by 10.19am Fisher’s pitch for the first track on disc one – These Days by Rudimental – has been agreed to. Easy. The song’s ubiquitous. Its sales and streams are unarguable. “We try to get that opening section to be familiar with as wide a section of the population as possible,” Duckworth says. Tracks two and three don’t take long either. Dua Lipa? Portugal. The Man? They do a lot of “top-and-tailing”, as Duckworth calls it, repeatedly listening to the first and last 15 seconds of each song to see how they segue into each other. The process will be familiar to anyone who’s obsessed over the momentum of a homemade mixtape. Soon, decisions about track ordering get harder, paths leading from paths. The trio confer nonstop. “Can Justin go next to Marshmallow? There’s something attractive about the two of them together... Taylor next? Where’s Bruno in today’s chart? Taylor to Bruno! They’re made for each other... Sigrid’s sales have dropped a lot since Sunday. Craig David instead? The Craig David features Bastille. Two names for the price of one! Jax Jones? Try Derulo after Bruno… We haven’t done Kylie yet.” I ask the gang if, in the work they do, they’re essentially wedding DJs, fiddling around with the order of bankable hits. Or is there more to it? “Being a good wedding DJ is important,” Duckworth says. “You don’t want to put a heavy metal track next to a Celine Dion ballad. But, yeah, there’s more to it.” Often, they’re trying to freeze a pop moment a little earlier than it wants to be frozen. They might be working against their own tastes, or prejudices. “You have to leave your own feelings at the studio door,” Pritchard says. “You can’t judge a generation’s tastes.” * * * Phil Collins! Duran Duran! UB40! The guy from Kajagoogoo! And so it began – disc one, side one, Now 1. It was 1983. A poster of a kitschy old ad for Danish bacon hung on the walls of the Virgin Records office in Notting Hill. It showed a singing chicken next to a frowning pig, with the pig thinking, “Now. That’s what I call music.” Virgin founder Richard Branson had brought in the poster on a whim, and when a team of his A&amp;R chiefs, working with executives from EMI, were trying to drum up a name for a compilation of the two labels’ biggest pop acts, they decided to pinch the poster’s slogan. Out on vinyl and tape a month before Christmas 1983, Now That’s What I Call Music was a hit, at the top of the album chart until the new year. Three more Nows were released through 1984 and a release pattern established – new Nows before Christmas, Easter and the summer. Polygram and Universal were contributing tracks to Now, while other labels, including Sony, set up a rival compilation brand called Hits. Because Hits tended to get the exclusives on big American acts such as Michael Jackson and Madonna, Now’s flavour was more domestic. Cosier. A bit twee. Probably this helped create affection. Though the Nows featured European and American acts, what threaded through these anthologies was a relentless, grinning, slightly frayed Britishness. Now 2 and Now 6 began with a one-two of Queen and Nik Kershaw. Now 7 had a divine run of Bananarama-Bucks Fizz-A-ha-Simply Red back to Queen. After a decade, Now 1 veterans UB40 kicked off Now 26, only the Birmingham band were among eurodance and cheeky California rap, as well as mid-career Take That, early Jamiroquai, late Belinda Carlisle and... Radiohead? Pritchard smiles when I ask how Radiohead wound up on a Now. “People will do things, early on, that you don’t remember later.” Duckworth adds: “And I know there are Now buyers for whom this became their lead-in to Radiohead. So, having these more interesting songs on there, even if they are tucked away, they sometimes lead people to musical discovery.” This pair used to handle the marketing of the Nows and theirs was the dynamite decision in the early 20s – I remember this – to give the records a 3D-rendered logo. As the Nows progressed (flush with Britpop through the 30s, lots of Robbie in the 40s and Black Eyed Peas in the 50s and 60s), Duckworth and Pritchard took on more responsibility for the brand. Tape and vinyl went. A foray into MiniDisc-formatted compilations did not last. The Now brand moved into the hands of Sony, in partnership with Universal. By the mid-70s, Pritchard and Duckworth, with Fisher, had pretty much full control. There have been strange decisions, this trio will admit. “Does anybody remember Mattafix?” Duckworth asks. “I do!” Fisher says. “I think!” But it is the ephemeral stuff that makes old Nows so special – these bizarre time capsules of a cultural moment, for instance the spring of 2003, when t.A.T.u. could sit next to Timberlake, next to Nelly, next to Liberty X on Now 54. * * * There are said to be about 2,000 Now superfans around the world, who have made themselves known as owners of all the editions released to date. “These are smörgåsbords of popular music!” says Patrick Kelly, a 61-year-old Canadian bank employee. “These treasure troves! I was in from the beginning, as soon as I found Now 2 in an import shop. Later, I found Now 1 on tape in a remainder bin, and I nearly cried.” Claudia Lucatelli-Cutter, who works in a school in the north-east of England, is chasing the full set: “The early ones are so difficult.” Apparently there’s a thriving underground market in the single-digit Nows. And Pritchard tells me about a strange week when Now 48 shot up in resale value from 50p to £50, after its appearance in the Peter Kay sitcom Car Share. In terms of tangible purchases, I bowed out of the Now scene in the mid-30s. It was Now 30 that put me on to Oasis, and after that it was only a matter of time before I was too much of a snob to buy a compilation. When I find out that in this modern era of boundless, costless music to stream the Now CDs are selling well, I admit my amazement to the trio. Nows were the biggest-selling CDs every year from 2010 through to 2017, beaten only by Adele in 2015. How come? Duckworth gives his honest take. “It’s the car – the last bastion of the CD. People like to listen in their car. Plus, the CDs are gift-y. At Easter, when people don’t want to give more chocolate, they give a Now.” Pritchard says that, for customers in their 30s and above, the Nows are a relatively unstressful way of keeping up with the churn of global pop. Need to catch up on how it sounds when Iggy Azalea features on an Ariana Grande song, and when Charli XCX features on an Iggy? Get thee to disc one of Now 88. Curious about the difference between a track credited to “Mabel &amp; Not3s”, and another to “Not3s x Mabel”? That’ll be Now 99. In the mastering suite, they’re on to disc two, traditionally a place for the more niche hits of the day. In the Now 20s, this meant leather-clad Europeans who made frisky techno, and in the mid-40s it meant the trance crossing over out of Ibiza. In the latter Nows, disc two has tended to mean rap. A track by Stormzy goes first on disc two, followed by the American rapper Post Malone and then 10 more tracks that would categorise roughly as grime or hip-hop. I wonder if the compilers aren’t ring-fencing a genre that might be ready to grow even larger if it weren’t kept in check by industry decision-makers in this way. But the Now compilers insist it’s all about “flow” – what sounds good with what, that wedding-DJ instinct not to create a sound-collision between tracks – and I take them at their word. From my observation of them in the studio, there’s more pernickety fanboy care put into ordering and reordering the rappers on disc two than into arranging the cheesy boy balladeers at the end of disc one. There are minor crises to be overcome, Fisher fretting about missing .wav files (“I’ll call and see if Radio 1 can help us”), and Duckworth about swearing. “We imagine kids in the back of a car, singing along…” The biggest dramas are over whether songs have been cleared for inclusion with their owners. A song by Hailee Steinfeld goes close to the wire. Ed Sheeran’s people have said no this time. “There have always been the non-clearers,” Pritchard says in the voice of somebody recalling old, lost loves. Rihanna’s people never say yes, which Duckworth puts down to the mindset of the US music industry. “They think that if people buy the Now albums, they might not buy their artist’s album, too.” In fact, the trio point out, inclusion on these compilations patently favours the artists, who get royalties and a big bump to their overall streaming numbers via Now’s popular Spotify page. And so to the last track of disc two, which according to Now custom will attempt to pack a little emotional punch. Charity singles go here, or a major artist who has died since the last instalment. “We’ll try to pay tribute,” Pritchard says. (That’s why Freddie Mercury was last on my old Now 23, I learn: Christmas 1992 was the first anniversary of his death.) To acknowledge the anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing, Oasis conclude Now 99. One last play of the package, tracks one through 45, and the trio are done. “Nice, isn’t it?” Duckworth says. They finish their coffees and head back to the office. The next morning, Fisher writes the liner notes and finalises the album artwork: psychedelic multicolour bubbles swirling around the famous 3D logo. (Now 1 pictured individual artists, including a flat-capped Phil Collins, but due to the spectre of last-minute “non-clearers”, the compilers don’t dare do that any more.) A day’s more fiddling and then Now 99 is gone, away for pressing and printing. They won’t see it again for about 10 days, until it’s a shrink-wrapped product. One day in May, I sit with the trio in the office, surrounded by the plastic glitter of Now 99s. We catch up on their progress on the 100th instalment. Because production happens so close to release, by the time you read this they won’t have mastered it; when we meet, they’re in the clacking-memory-stick phase. It’s looking like Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa for the opening track, they say. Meanwhile, they’ve decided to break their own conventions and make a special disc two that is ring-fenced for nostalgia. It’ll be a greatest hits, a meta-Now, with one artist plucked from every decade in Now time. I ask, hopefully, if Tasmin Archer has made the cut. Pritchard checks his list and says, sadly no. “It’s Wet Wet Wet. I’m sorry.” They’ll master Now 100 in early July, they say, before a late-July release. And then what, I ask. “101,” Fisher says. “101,” Duckworth says. How long do they think the brand can survive? Surely even car drivers will leave CDs behind eventually? “Even in an age of streams,” Duckworth says, “people need a curator. It’s a vast forest of songs out there.” “And we’ve got an app,” Pritchard says (this is like a Now-only Spotify). “And we’ve got an app,” Duckworth agrees. “But I take your point. Reaching 100, it’s a good moment for reflection.” He says they see themselves only as “custodians of Now”. Maybe there’s value in keeping it as unchanged as they can for as long as they can. And I see what he means. All these curiosities that bob by on pop’s current, the good and the mediocre and the deeply regrettable. We need somewhere to put this stuff and keep it pristine, if only to remember how brilliantly ridiculous we were, those few months around Now 23, when we could like Enya and East 17, Roy Orbison and the plinky song from Tetris, all at once. Now that’s what I call nostalgia - fans look back Clara Amfo, Radio 1 DJ and presenter Whoever had the Now in my class would be the most popular person of the day. My stand-out one is album 54. It had Jay-Z and Beyonce’s 03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde on disc one, and Camron’s Hey Ma on disc two: two of my favourite music videos at the time. It reminds me of the corny hip-hop and R&amp;B club nights I used to go to, as well as fun times staying in with my girlfriends, whose parents kept up with the collection. The albums made you think you were getting the very best of the chart at the time, even though now, looking back, they all missed out key songs (I’m sure due to pesky record label politics). I can empathise: making mixtapes was basically my job at school. I made a really good girlband one that I wish I still had. Alexis Petridis, music critic I never bought a Now compilation when I was a kid. I’ve no idea why – I was 12 in 1983, the ideal age. Then, a few years ago, I was researching a feature about compilations, and ended up listening to Now 5. Somewhere between Simple Minds’ Don’t You Forget About Me and The Commentators’ N-n-nineteen Not Out, I found myself fully transported back to 1985. It happened because the albums were, and are, compiled without discrimination: if it’s a hit, it’s in, regardless of whether it’s good or bad, built to last for ever or destined to be forgotten in a flash. It offered pop’s past not seen through the distorting lens of nostalgia, but as it really was: a perfect time capsule. Dan Smith, lead singer, Bastille The CDs are these markers of time. Often a quite mad and eclectic jumble of songs – whose only common link was that they were massive (until you reached the later end of each disc) – that would live on and be replayed in car CD players for what felt like way too long. From novelty songs about being horny or literally being the colour blue, to world music trends that would temporarily invade chart pop music, they’re a collection of tunes that don’t belong together on an actual album elsewhere. Stumbling upon an old issue can be the most surreal time warp back to school rides and family trips. • Commenting on this piece?

The ground-breaking machines which the siblings produce are definitely models you’d want to pinch. Their bikes have an unusual and eye-catching geometry. The top tube appears to be far too long for the frame and protrudes at both the back and the front. It’s a look that is not to everyone’s taste, but once you realise how clever these bikes are in every other respect, you’ll quickly begin to fall into line. The brothers have taken a radical approach to the design of their bikes, so it stands to reason that when they applied their minds to security the results would be unexpected. Peace of mind comes in three phases. First is rider recognition. Bluetooth technology allows the bike to respond to you when you approach. It automatically unlocks the bike and disarms the theft-defence system. If this fails and someone tries to grab your bike from you, there is then also a “stealth” lock. It’s a tiny integrated system that immobilises the bike’s electric motor when you press a hidden button on the frame. If this also fails, there is then a tamper-detection setting. Anyone meddling with the bike will set off an earsplitting alarm after which it disables its own motor and flashes SOS with its lights. The message to thieves is pretty clear: this bike is way too much hassle to steal. I am sure there must be art masterpieces protected by far flimsier arrangements. Anyway, that’s not the end of it. If some enterprisingly light-fingered thief does outsmart all these measures, the app on your phone will follow an electrified tracking signal which VanMoof’s “Bike Hunters” will respond to. They will spring into action to recover the stolen bike and if they fail to find it within two weeks, VanMoof will replace it. So, I think we can presume no one is going to steal your precious VanMoof. Various models are on offer, but this month sees the launch of a new range of electric bikes, the S2 and X2. They feature an intelligent motor that generates more power with greater efficiency and an increased range of 93 miles. They also have a smile-inducing turbo boost. Press the button on the handlebar and you’ll get an extra blip of acceleration to get you up steep hills or away from crowds at the traffic lights. There are so many likeable details on the VanMoof: from the tiny matrix read-out in the frame which displays speed, battery level and power-assist level to the integrated super-bright lights. VanMoof has also launched a subscription service, so that rather than buying the bike outright you can opt to pay a monthly fee of £17, which includes full maintenance. To ride, the S2 is whisper quiet and very comfortable. And you can stop lugging that heavy lock around, too.

Some of the German firm’s customers had already been struck in April with a stealth increase of up to £50. The new price rise adds a further £55 a year for a typical dual fuel customer from 16 August. However, the second rise is thought by industry sources to be limited to E.ON and unlikely to mark the start of a new round of price hikes by other suppliers. E.ON blamed higher wholesale energy costs, which it said had increased by more than a fifth since its last big price rise in 2017. Michael Lewis, the E.ON UK chief executive, said: “A number of costs have risen quite sharply and in particular we’ve experienced a hike in the price we have to pay for the energy our customers need, partly driven by the beast from the east and extreme weather conditions experienced earlier this year.” A customer with typical energy consumption will now face an annual bill of £1,208 after the rise. Victoria Arrington, a spokesperson for comparison site Energyhelpine, said: “This new rise is a bitter and expensive pill to swallow.” The timing of the rise risks creating a political backlash, as the energy regulator Ofgem is bringing in the government’s cap on standard variable tariffs by the end of the year. Labour accused E.ON of wringing a profit from consumers ahead of the cap. “Worryingly E.ON seems to be attempting to squeeze in as much profit as they can before the Tories’ half-baked price cap is finally introduced later this year after over 12 months of procrastination,” said shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey. E.ON said it was contacting customers to suggest they switch to cheaper fixed tariffs, and offering them measures to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Wholesale power prices usually fall in summer as demand is lower. But this year they have stayed relatively high because gas stocks are being replenished after they were heavily depleted during the cold snap at the end of winter. The costs facing suppliers rose by 5.3% between 1 February and 1 May, according to Ofgem’s index."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/19/tributes-graffiti-artists-killed-loughborough-junction-train-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T13:17:41Z","webTitle":"Tributes paid to three graffiti artists killed by train in south London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/19/tributes-graffiti-artists-killed-loughborough-junction-train-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/19/tributes-graffiti-artists-killed-loughborough-junction-train-london","fields":{"headline":"Tributes paid to three graffiti artists killed by train in south London","bodyText":"Tributes have been paid to three graffiti artists killed by a train in south London. The family of one of the three who died said he had an “exceptional” talent for art from an early age. Jack Gilbert, 23, from Bush Hill Park, Enfield, “died doing something he loved”, a family statement said. “There are no words to describe the devastation we feel. He was a wonderful son, brother, uncle and boyfriend. His generosity was endless and he would help anyone who needed it. “He lit up everyone’s world just by being in it and never failed to put a smile on people’s faces. The hole he has left in our hearts will never be filled. His talent for art even from an early age was exceptional. Everyone loved Jack and the only solace we have is he died doing something he loved.” Harrison Scott-Hood, 23, and Alberto Fresneda Carrasco, 19, also died in the incident. Spray cans were found close to the bodies on an elevated section of track between Brixton and Denmark Hill, south London. Police believe the men were hit by an out-of-service passenger train near Loughborough Junction station at about 1am on Monday. Scott-Hood, from Muswell Hill, north London, was “loved by everyone, he was an intelligent and wonderful boy who had so many close friends”, his parents, Susie and Perry, said. “He was an intelligent and wonderful boy who had so many close friends.” Their son was a “beautiful artist”, they said. The family said in a statement: “We are completely heartbroken by the loss of our only son, Harrison. He was the love of our life, a kind and beautiful young man and we were beyond broken by this news. “Many people will know Harrison loved to travel. He was a beautiful artist and spent time recently travelling around Vietnam and Cambodia. Harrison completed us. He is irreplaceable and we will hold the memories of him dearly.” Carrasco, a Spanish-American who lived in Hampstead, north London, was interested in fashion and due to study graphic design at the London College of Communication in September. His family said: “With great pain we have received the news of the death of our son ... We believe the three were hit by a train when they were painting graffiti late at night in a particularly dangerous place. His absence has left a deep hole in the family.” Messages were left to the three men under their graffiti “tags” of Kbag, Lover and Trip on social media. “RIP so young man too soon”, wrote one, while many messages read “Rest In Paint”, alongside images of the men’s painted tags on trains and walls. Another read: “Stay safe people, it’s not a game.” Flowers and three spray cans lay next to shutters at the station, which had been spray-painted with “RIP” and three love hearts, on Tuesday morning. British Transport Police were called to the scene at 7.30am on Monday. The train believed to have hit the men has been found and forensically examined, according to the force. Det Supt Gary Richardson said: “We have a dedicated team working to establish how these young men came to be on the tracks in the early hours of yesterday morning. The initial evidence we have been able to gather indicates that the men may have been on the track for the purposes of spraying graffiti.” . Tributes were also paid by the street art community online. The ukfrontline Instagram page, an online forum for graffiti artists, has set up a tribute page. It included what purported to be a photograph of Trip as he mounted a fence. The forum also rounded on Brian Cooke, a former board member of Transport for London, who took issue with the BBC for describing the men as graffiti artists. Cooke described the men on his Twitter account as “common scum and criminals who cost the railways millions and keep fares high”. Cooke was suspended last month as chairman of Beckenham Conservative Association for using obscene language against the former mayor of Bromley Ian Payne, and calling him a “shameful excuse for a Christian human being” during a row on Twitter. Angela Wilkins, the Labour group leader on Bromley council, said Cooke should be expelled from the Conservative party. “They should take further action. It’s outrageous,” she said. “He should be thrown out of the party, the guy shouldn’t be involved in politics at any level.” Marc Vallée, who spent a year documenting a London graffiti crew, agreed, saying: “His comments are callous and insensitive especially at this very early stage, and especially from a former TfL board member. I would hope that if he is still a member of the Conservative party that the transport secretary and others would say that he has brought his party into disrepute and expel him.” Cooke has been contacted for comment. A Conservative party spokeswoman said Cooke had been suspended pending investigation. The rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, has opened a preliminary investigation into the deaths of the three men."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/22/panic-at-the-disco-pray-for-the-wicked-review-a-parade-of-emo-pop-pizzazz","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T08:30:23Z","webTitle":"Panic! at the Disco: Pray for the Wicked review – a parade of emo-pop pizzazz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/22/panic-at-the-disco-pray-for-the-wicked-review-a-parade-of-emo-pop-pizzazz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/22/panic-at-the-disco-pray-for-the-wicked-review-a-parade-of-emo-pop-pizzazz","fields":{"headline":"Panic! at the Disco: Pray for the Wicked review – a parade of emo-pop pizzazz","bodyText":"In the mid-00s, Las Vegas outfit Panic! at the Disco made their name with a series of infectious if slightly overwrought emo-pop tunes, many of which sported memorably unwieldy titles (their Chuck Palahniuk-referencing debut single was called The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage). Like their similarly huge peers (Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance), PATD retained emo’s interior melodrama but crunched its sound into something more brashly melodic and overtly theatrical. PATD, in particular, put an air of jazz-handed camp front and centre – so much so that when vocalist Brendon Urie took the lead role in the musical Kinky Boots on Broadway last year, it didn’t feel like a career left-turn in the slightest. Urie used to be the group’s frontman – now he’s the only member. Despite having shed five bodies over the past decade, PATD have retained their most distinctive features: namely, Urie’s hammy, vaguely reedy voice and dense lyricism (any trace of their rock roots have been expunged, however – this material is strictly pop). On their sixth album, he puts the latter to the service of a single theme: wildest-dreams success. He toasts his huge achievements on Hey Look Ma, I Made It, explains the logic behind his outlandish ambitions on High Hopes and feels entitled to the very best from life on (Fuck a) Silver Lining. The tone of Pray for the Wicked is hard to gauge. Its wordiness and high-octane maximalism mean it tends to resemble a musical – but whether this is a satirical portrait of an endlessly optimistic egotist or simply self-indulgent autobiography is unclear. Later songs touch on the malaise and self-destructive tendencies that can accompany wealth and fame, but since each track comes with the same onslaught of peppy brass, screwed-up vocal samples and showtune choruses, a narrative arc isn’t wholly obvious. Closing string ballad Dying in LA provides some respite from this parade of pizzazz, but ultimately it feels as glossy and one-dimensional as the rest. Urie undoubtedly knows how to put on an entertaining show, but this is a production that lacks the kind of intelligibility and depth necessary for real emotional engagement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/29/climate-change-has-turned-perus-glacial-lake-into-a-deadly-flood-timebomb","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-29T11:55:49Z","webTitle":"Climate change has turned Peru's glacial lake into a deadly flood timebomb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/29/climate-change-has-turned-perus-glacial-lake-into-a-deadly-flood-timebomb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/29/climate-change-has-turned-perus-glacial-lake-into-a-deadly-flood-timebomb","fields":{"headline":"Climate change has turned Peru's glacial lake into a deadly flood timebomb","bodyText":"Nestled beneath the imposing white peaks of two glaciers in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca, the aquamarine Lake Palcacocha is as calm as a millpond. But despite its placid appearance it has become a deadly threat to tens of thousands people living beneath it as a result of global warming. A handful of residents of Huaraz, the city below the lake, can recall its destructive power. In 1941 a chunk of ice broke away from the glacier in an earthquake, tumbling into the lake. The impact caused a flood wave which sent an avalanche of mud and boulders cascading down the mountain, killing about 1,800 people when it reached the city. Today the lake is even more potentially dangerous, swollen with glacial meltwater like an almost-overflowing bathtub. A temperature rise of 0.5-0.8C between the 1970s and the 2000s has seen a third of Peru’s ice caps vanish in the last four decades. The city’s population has grown too. With more than 150,000 inhabitants, today Huaraz is about 15 times larger than it was during the last deadly landslide. Flood wave modelling by the University of Texas shows how a breakaway chunk of glacier could displace up to 15bn litres of meltwater from the 70-metre deep, mile long (1.7km) lake, propelling a wave of up to 30 metres over a ridge of rocks and down the mountain. “There are around 50,000 people living in the danger zone,” says Noah Walker-Crawford, a social anthropologist from Manchester University. “According to the authorities’ estimates, even if you were able to warn the people, there could still be about 20,000 fatalities,” he adds. The people would have 30 minutes to evacuate, says Cesar Florez, a risk management specialist for the region’s government and the man ultimately responsible for the people’s safety. “It’s more than enough time,” Florez says. “It’s the same time allotted to evacuate coastal areas in the case of tsunami,” he tells the Guardian, adding the escape time could be lengthened by a series of energy dissipators and dykes. So far, however, none of that flood mitigation infrastructure is in place. For now, 10 black tubes pump out water to reduce the lake’s level. Perched on a bluff facing the lake, Calef de la Cruz radios in a status report to the regional government every two hours. Living in a hut for up to a fortnight at a time, it is a lonely and sleepless vigil. But until an early warning system is installed, which authorities say will happen later this year, the watchfulness of De la Cruz and his colleagues is all that stands between the lake and the residents below. But for the poor, largely indigenous farmers in the verdant mountains around the ice caps, the problem is not too much water but too little. The Andean country is home to 70% of the world’s tropical glaciers and as they gradually ebb away, a water crisis looms. Climate change has made the weather unpredictable and the unseasonal melting of the glaciers has thrown the farmers’ existence into jeopardy. Alejandro Rosales is a 62-year-old farmer from Yarush, a tiny hamlet above Huaraz. For him, like many residents of the mountains, the snow-capped peaks are apus – beings of mythic or semi-divine importance. He never thought he would see the white peaks he gazed at as a child turn black, he says. “Sometimes there are years when you get a good harvest; there are also years when the harvest fails. That means the children go to school without their daily bread. It’s really hard,” he adds, showing the Guardian blackened potatoes which crumble in his hands. The potatoes, which were stored months earlier to sow later this year, are riddled with moth caterpillars. The warming has meant new pests are creeping to higher altitudes where the colder weather once held them at bay. Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a farmer and mountain guide whose home in Nueva Florida is in Lake Palcacocha’s flood path, has filed a lawsuit against the German electro-domestic firm RWE for its role in causing global warming, as one of the world’s top emitters of carbon dioxide. “The glacier is a source of water for those in the countryside and for us all in the city, so you can imagine what the future will be like if we don’t have it,” he says. “From the risk problem to the water scarcity problem; all of this is what inspired me to file a lawsuit,” he adds. Lliuya’s 2015 demand for damages from RWE has been admitted on appeal by a higher regional court in the German city of Hamm. Lliuya is seeking compensation of about $20,000 (£15,000) from the energy giant to help install the lake’s safety measures, as well as the reimbursement of €6,384 he has spent on flood protection. It is a tiny amount for the company, he admits but adds: “What we are saying is this is happening and it’s putting us at risk. The damage caused is irreversible; for that no amount of money is enough.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/19/englands-late-world-cup-win-sparks-scenes-of-celebration-across-country","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T12:27:36Z","webTitle":"England's late World Cup win sparks scenes of celebration across country","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/19/englands-late-world-cup-win-sparks-scenes-of-celebration-across-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/19/englands-late-world-cup-win-sparks-scenes-of-celebration-across-country","fields":{"headline":"England's late World Cup win sparks scenes of celebration across country","bodyText":"The drama of England’s last-gasp win in their opening World Cup match against Tunisia on Monday sparked a wave of exuberant celebrations among fans, many of which were captured and widely shared on social media. The O2 Academy in Leeds was one of many venues across the country that was not only showing the match on big screens, but was also primed to capture fan reaction from the key moments of the game. They were rewarded with footage of the absolute scenes that followed captain Harry Kane’s 90th-minute winner. In his post-match interview Kane said he hoped the win had made fans happy “in the pubs”, and multiple videos posted to social media suggested it had. Down the road from Leeds there were also wild celebrations in this bar in Sheffield. A lot of beer went up in the air in Maidstone in Kent when the goal went in. Boxpark in Croydon was the site of widely shared footage of celebrations – which included what seems an ill-judged attempt at crowd-surfing about eight seconds into the clip. Another fan who might be regretting their exuberance this morning is the person who appears to fall through a roof while celebrating – about five seconds into this one. Fans who had gathered to watch the match at the Times Square fanzone in Newcastle got to share the experience with two England veterans from the 1990 World Cup – Paul Gascoigne and Peter Beardsley spoke to the crowd before the match. London’s Tottenham Court Road was also a site of celebration after the game, with happy fans obstructing the traffic and flagging down passing cars to join in the celebrations. The celebrations in Leeds also spilled noisily out on to the street after the final whistle. The fact that the celebrations were so widespread was underlined as viewing figures for the match emerged. Presenter Gary Lineker tweeted that over 21 million people had watched the match - “18.3m peak on your televisions and more than 3m on iPlayer” -making it the most watched TV programme of the year so far, ahead of the Royal Wedding. If England keep progressing in the tournament, we can expect to see further scenes – perhaps a little more vibrant than they appear to have been when England actually won the World Cup in 1966."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/19/world-cup-barbecues-threatened-by-shortage-of-carbon-dioxide","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T18:43:05Z","webTitle":"UK summer barbecues threatened by shortage of carbon dioxide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/19/world-cup-barbecues-threatened-by-shortage-of-carbon-dioxide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/19/world-cup-barbecues-threatened-by-shortage-of-carbon-dioxide","fields":{"headline":"UK summer barbecues threatened by shortage of carbon dioxide","bodyText":"World Cup barbecues may be under threat as beers, fizzy drinks and meat producers warn of potential shortages caused by a lack of CO2. The British Retail Consortium has written to major retailers informing them that drinks and meat supplies could be affected as at least one UK gas supplier has had to ration orders. The shortages come as many prepare to party while they follow England’s progress in the football World Cup in Russia. Sales of alcohol and soft drinks are also expected to be boosted after the World Cup by what is forecast to be a long hot summer running through until August. It is understood that most drinks manufacturers hold at least two weeks stock, while retailers are likely to hold more. But retailers have expressed concerns that stocks of fizzy drinks could run short in a few days during one of their busiest times of the year. Tesco’s website already showed a number of its own-label fizzy drinks were out of stock on Tuesdayand its website warned of “a supply issue”. Morrisons said some Sprite and R Whites products were out of stock due to “limited supply”. One industry source said Britvic, which also produces Pepsi and R Whites in the UK, and Heineken were already being affected. Another said one small brewer, thought to be Brewdog, had also been hit. Britvic said that all of its factories remained online while Heineken and Brewdog declined to comment. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: “We are aware of a situation affecting the availability of CO2 across Europe, which has now started to impact beer producers in the UK. “We will continue to monitor the situation carefully. However, given the time of year and the World Cup, this situation has arisen at an unfortunate time for the brewing industry.” ABInBev, the maker of Stella Artois, Budweiser and Corona, told the Grocer trade journal that it was less exposed to disruptions in supply of CO2 because it kept its own stocks, recovering the gas from its brewing process. “Currently our supply across both our breweries is good and we’re not anticipating any issue in the near future,” it told the Grocer. The British Soft Drinks Association said: “Soft drinks producers in the UK are taking active steps to maintain their service to customers including working with their suppliers to mitigate the impact as well as looking at alternative sources.” Retailers told the Guardian that there were also fears about fresh food supplies as CO2 is used in packing fresh meat and salads, as well as in the slaughtering process for poultry and pigs. “At the moment we are looking at ways to keep the supply chain moving and we have not heard that any of our members have stopped production,” said Fiona Steiger, deputy director of the British Meat Processors Association. The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe.

When you cut through the rotolo, you get a swirl of the pasta, a swirl of the green, bombs of the white cheese and, in the middle, that beautiful mushroom cooked so it’s tender and intense and meaty and creamy. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is unusual, which means people like to look at it. And that’s what I was cooking when Christmas at the River Cafe was filmed 23 years ago. It’s the only reason I got discovered and ended up on TV. It’s how I got to where I am today. I remember the day my boss, the River Cafe’s co-owner, Rose Gray, taught me to make it. I had never tasted anything like it in my life. Pasta as silken as a scarf; greens the very opposite of what most British kids knew, because since the war we had tended to boil the shit out of them, whereas here, braised with garlic and butter and nutmeg, they were intense, dark green, delicious. The ricotta, clean and white; the sage as crispy as pommes frites. Rotolo has been with me ever since. We have it on the menu at Jamie’s Italian. As the seasons change, we go from mushrooms to butternut squash. It’s delicious fresh from being poached, and the leftovers can be baked – al forno – in tomato sauce. I love the ritual of making it. It taught me a lot about Italian food. It also taught me to see food through the eyes of a woman. Rose was incredible. She wasn’t a chef, but a self-taught cook at a time in Britain when there weren’t many women in the kitchen, and certainly no female owners who weren’t trained chefs. Mostly, Rose didn’t give a damn about protocol. She and her business partner, Ruth Rogers, had spent many years living in the mountains of Tuscany, and instead of the almost robotically methodical way most chefs operated at the time, they would buy fresh ingredients and write two new menus – one for lunch and one for dinner – every single day. They taught me about seasonality, and using the whole animal, and they gave context to ingredients. They weren’t academic about food – they taught me to be more responsive and more nurturing. Rose was strong and kind and clever. Quite artistic by nature, she surrounded herself with artistic people but favoured simplicity. Restaurant cooking at the time was about garnishes and dressing things up: making food look prettier than it actually was. Rose, by contrast, was paring things down, and buying the very best ingredients. She would happily spend five times the usual amount on the best dried chickpeas, then spend a day soaking them and a day cooking them. She taught me that it wasn’t necessarily about following a tradition of the only way to cook something, but rather, discovering the best way to cook that thing, on that day, with that weather. If you’ve worked at the River Cafe, you belong to a family – even if you haven’t worked with more recent staff members, you know each other really well because you’ve come from the same school. When Rose passed away in 2010, there were 15 or 20 generations of chefs at her funeral. It was amazing to see the impact she had. She still berates me every day, in my head – in a nice way. I learned from her to focus on what we can do better, rather than pat ourselves on the back about how good we are. She was a great teacher. Squash and spinach pasta rotolo Rotolo is one of the more unusual pasta dishes – many people have never eaten it before. The way I prepare mine means it is closer to a lasagne or cannelloni. It looks really pretty and you get the gnarly, crisp bits of pasta on the top complemented by the softer pasta hiding underneath the sauce. Prep 20 min Cook 2 hr 20 min Serves 4 to 6 1 butternut squash (about 1.2kg) 1 red onion Olive oil 1 tsp dried thyme Salt and black pepper 500g frozen spinach 1 whole nutmeg, for grating 4 garlic cloves 1 x 700ml jar passata 6 large fresh pasta sheets (15cm x 20cm each) 50g feta cheese 20g parmesan cheese A few sprigs of fresh sage (optional) Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Cook the squash whole on a roasting tray for around 1 hour 30 minutes, then take out of the oven. Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the onion, put into a medium pan on a medium-low heat with a glug of oil, the thyme and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the frozen spinach, cover with a lid and leave to cook slowly for another 15 minutes, until the liquid has evaporated, then take it off the heat. Cut the squash in half, discard the seeds and skin, then mash up with a fork. Keeping them separate, season both the squash and spinach to perfection with salt, pepper and a grating of nutmeg. Peel and finely slice the garlic, then put it into a shallow 28cm casserole pan on a medium heat with a splash of oil and fry for a couple of minutes, until light golden. Pour in the passata, add a splash of water to the empty jar, swirl it around and pour it into the pan. Bring to a boil, simmer for just three minutes, then season to taste. On a clean work surface, lay out the pasta sheets facing lengthways away from you. Working quickly so the pasta doesn’t dry out, brush them with water, then evenly divide and spread the squash over the sheets. Sprinkle over the cooked spinach and crumble over the feta. Roll up the sheets and cut each one into four chunks, then place side-by-side in the tomato sauce. Finely grate over the parmesan, then pick the sage leaves (if using), toss in a little oil and scatter over the top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes at the bottom of the oven until golden and crisp. Delicious served with a fresh green salad.

Some relationships lasted years, and produced children, only for the men to mysteriously disappear. The company put posters in windows, along with fake police tape, and the slogans “paid to lie” and “police have crossed the line”. A row immediately erupted, with many people believing the company was attacking the police in general. “Never thought I would see a mainstream British retailer running a public advertising campaign against our hardworking police,” tweeted the home secretary, Sajid Javid. “This is not a responsible way to make a point.” It’s the day after the “spy cops” campaign finished – there were a few days when shops removed the posters after staff received threats and intimidation, but then the campaign was resumed. The company founders seem happy with how it went. Never mind the backlash and the deluge of 30,000 one-star Facebook reviews from people who have never shopped at the store – the issue was talked about endlessly on social media and in newspapers and TV, it drew a response from the home secretary, the film on Lush’s website got more than one million views and many of the victims were happy. “I think we put a stick in a hornets’ nest and all the hornets came out and we got stung,” says Mark Constantine, one of Lush’s seven founders. “If you’ve put the stick in the nest you can hardly complain.” We sit in a bright room above the small Lush shop in Poole – the company’s first, where many of its products are invented. Despite the 932 shops globally (including 105 in the UK and Ireland), the 22,000 employees and the £995m turnover, this still feels a bit like a cottage industry, run from these slightly ramshackle rooms above the shop. Constantine describes this as his lab, where he tries out scents. He and his wife Mo sit next to each other on one side of a large desk. One of the other founders, Helen Ambrosen, is busy with products at the other end of the room. It smells, as anyone who has ever walked past a Lush shop will know, strongly of a heady mix of oils and perfume. A day later, I can still smell it on my clothes. Are they used to the stink yet? “Absolutely,” says Mo. “We’re oblivious. Everyone else is wiping tears from their eyes and we’re ‘how lovely’.” Mark had become increasingly worried about undercover policing following the Guardian reporting on the issue that began in 2011, even thinking that perhaps he and the company had been targeted because of their support for hunt saboteurs and environmental campaigners. The spy cops campaign was done in collaboration with the organisations Police Spies Out of Lives and Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance, which were involved in every stage of the planning and design. With any Lush campaign, says Mo, it’s up to individual store managers to decide whether to run it or not. About 40 stores put the initial posters up and the response was immediate. Shop staff had been followed home, they say, and attacked on Facebook. One uniformed police officer came to a shop and said they were going to organise an anti-Lush campaign. “The one that made me laugh was two policemen on horses who sheltered their horses from the sun outside our Leeds shop in the hope they were going to leave us a present on the doorstep, which at least showed wit and humour,” says Mark, smiling, but the intimidation was serious enough that the company paused the campaign for a few days. There was a feeling that Lush was criticising the police as a whole. Were there things they could have done differently? “We worked with the groups and the victims and that [campaign] is what they wanted. They chose the words, the sentiment,” says Mark. He might have modified the campaign, but he felt it wasn’t up to the company to tell the victims what they could and couldn’t say. “It was a successful campaign. If we had done something that was less striking perhaps this issue wouldn’t have been so highlighted to people.” “I thought it was unfortunate that it looked as if we were anti-police,” says Mo, “which had never been the intention.” The day before they took the initial posters down, sales were up 13% but overall Mark says he expects the effect of the campaign on sales to be “negligible”. Was it a marketing ploy? “If we were making something out of nothing it would be different,” he says, not quite answering the question. “But it’s not something out of nothing.” The police did this, he says, and so far the public inquiry has been lacking – set up in 2015, it is yet to hear evidence. For people who only know the company for its bath bombs and the pungent shops, it might have seemed a strange choice of campaign, but Lush has a history of supporting a variety of causes. Last year, the company donated £13.3m to charities and activist groups (the founders make their own donations, too). As a teenager, with a difficult relationship with his stepfather, who eventually threw him out, Mark was homeless for a while. “I received charitable help,” he says. “It was a small sum, but it made all the difference to me. What I realised was that if you give small sums to people then that works very well. Someone who is very keen can do an awful lot with a small sum. Our giving is based on that.” They have paid the legal fees of activists from the campaign group Plane Stupid who were arrested at a protest in Stansted airport, and donated money to hunt saboteurs and anti-badger cull activists. They have run campaigns against Guantánamo and fracking. In the aftermath of the Grenfell disaster, when the local council failed to provide translations of vital information for the tower’s traumatised and vulnerable survivors, Lush put up the money. With Grenfell, Mark says, “that’s purely being a responsible citizen”. But he won’t acknowledge that there is something troubling when funding comes at the goodwill (or not) of rich individuals. In 2011, Mark was in talks to fund the police’s Wildlife Crime Unit; the Police Federation warned it was “policing for the rich”. “I think it’s part of being a modern society and making a bloody contribution when you can,” he says. “Leaving other people behind because it’s someone else’s job is not right.” But it’s not that it’s someone else’s job, it’s that it shouldn’t be up to the rich to decide what is and isn’t important. He sighs. He had these arguments with one of his employees, who opposed philanthropy. “I think it’s irrelevant. We’re not going to do it when [public money] will. We do it when no one else will do it.” How do they decide who to support? “I have a huge bias towards human rights,” say Mo, “and I have sympathy towards animal welfare and environmental issues.” How do they square human rights campaigning with, for instance, running shops and making a profit in Saudi Arabia? “It’s the same everywhere, it’s not just there,” says Mark. “How do you do it in America … with Black Lives Matter? In Saudi, we try to have shops that have women working in them, then [you think] what are their rights, then this, then that. You just push where you can in a way that doesn’t put anyone in any danger. Does that mean we will always trade there? No.” So why do business there now? “Because we believe we can make a difference, I suppose. We can do a bit of business and we can do a bit of politicising. But why do we do business in Russia? In America? There are so many reasons not to.” The Constantines, who are both in their 60s, have been together since they were teenagers, and have three children who all work for the business and also live in houses nearby. Lush came out of the collapse in 1994 of Cosmetics to Go, the Constantines’ previous mail-order company (Mark had started creating products earlier, becoming the Body Shop’s biggest supplier). They launched Lush that same year, along with five other founders, from this small shop in Poole, using equipment and ingredients the receivers weren’t interested in taking. The no-packaging ethos was a necessity – they couldn’t afford it. They are, he says, capitalists but they’re interested in “creating a situation that could perhaps be a model for other businesses”. Much is made of their ethical credentials – they pay the right tax and carefully source their ingredients, for instance, and are audited each year by Ethical Consumer – but he knows the company is not perfect. One of their current aims is to “innovate out of packaging, and preservatives” that are flushed down the drains, and which can be found in products including some of those made by Lush, and may cause harm in the marine environment. He fantasises about winning a most ethical company award “so I can stand up there and go ‘if we won, how shit are the rest of you?’” Last year, pre-tax profits were up 70% to £73.5m, but the company has warned that 2018 will see profits fall by more than 40%. Lush shouldn’t be another high-street victim – the fall can be explained, says Mark, in large part because the company increased staff wages, and it is cushioned by some highly profitable years. “We’ll see a pretty lacklustre performance in Britain this year and it’s just as well we’re trading in other countries because otherwise we’d be in trouble,” says Mark. He, blames the government for the high-street troubles, from the Brexit referendum, which devalued the pound, to business rates: “Twenty per cent of everything you buy from us goes to the government in tax. That’s enough. You’re taxing the shops to death.” Brexit, he says, “is a bloody nightmare”. More than a quarter of Lush’s factory staff are foreign nationals. “They were in a real stir,” says Mo. “They didn’t know whether to leave or what to do and it has a far-reaching effect on their entire families, so it’s been difficult. We had the foresight to open up a factory in Germany but it has been really hard. There aren’t enough British citizens living and wanting work down here to fill the 800 jobs we need to have throughout the year and the additional 600 at Christmas. Brexit was a huge blow. We’ve had to rally round, work out how we are going to move on.” The Constantines have no immediate plans to step down. Mark, who likes to say the years between 55 and 75 are the most creative, says he wants to be making the products for ever. And the campaigning gives them a sense of purpose. “We’re fortunate,” he says. “The company is fortunate. Why shouldn’t we make a contribution beyond our tax? What else are we going to do with [the money]? Buy a yacht? And it’s not staying in the bank for some future generation to buy a yacht either.” He smiles. “The question I get asked most often is: ‘What do you want to do? Sell bath bombs or save the world?’ I see no reason why I can’t do both.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/26/rachel-roddy-recipe-tomato-potato-aubergine-stew","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for tomato, potato and aubergine stew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/26/rachel-roddy-recipe-tomato-potato-aubergine-stew","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/26/rachel-roddy-recipe-tomato-potato-aubergine-stew","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for tomato, potato and aubergine stew","bodyText":"I first ate ciambotta as part of an otherwise pretty terrible lunch at a trattoria in Reggio Calabria. It was during my early, rose-tinted days in Italy, so my food illusions were mostly undented – until that place, with stickers on the door and an industrious nonna in the kitchen. Thank god for the ciambotta, a stew of aubergines, peppers, tomatoes and potato, which was a dense, velvety pleasure among bizarre pasta and fishy fish. The Italians at the table, including a Calabrian, complained that the ciambotta, although tasty, may have been sitting around rather too long. But this was precisely what I loved about it: it reminded me of the last portion of my mum’s ratatouille, the flavours sweet and soused, the vegetables slumped and surrounded by an oily, orange halo. My ciambotta is inspired by those from the toe of Italy, Calabria, and is to my mind a near-perfect dish, an olive oil-rich, pot-bellied stew of onion, tomato, aubergine and red pepper with – and this the key – potatoes. Apart from being a favourite, this dish encapsulates four steps of Italian home cooking – laughably obvious ones, maybe, but relearning them has changed the way I cook: softening an onion, peeling tomatoes, braising and deep-frying for victory. As cook Rosetta Constantino teaches, frying the aubergine and peppers (two of each cut into chunks) separately is the secret to the rich and full flavours of southern Italian cooking. Remember: with aubergine, depth matters – a little oil is soaked up like a greedy sponge. Paradoxically, if you cover chunks of it in a couple of inches of olive oil in a small frying pan, in batches, it absorbs less of it. Blot properly before mixing the now golden pieces with the onion, tomato and potato in the last minutes of cooking; stir gently so they remain distinct, then leave to rest before serving. Pinpoint accuracy disappears with cooking like this, which is how it should be: your eyes, hands and stomach deciding how much of everything you are going to put in, your head a cooking satnav, recalculating according to how the process is going, how it all tastes, adding tiny pinches of salt as you go along, a pinch of sugar to balance bitterness, a dash of vinegar to sharpen the edges, fresh herbs if you wish. Having usurped ratatouille, this is what I serve with lamb; it also good with rice, hard-boiled or fried eggs. The last portion, a velvety mush after three days in the fridge, alongside the last cold sausage, are the leftovers of my dreams. Ciambotta Calabrese (Calabrian-style tomato, potato and aubergine stew) Serves 4 600g ripe tomatoes 1 large onion 1 large potato 2 red peppers 2 medium aubergines Olive oil Salt Peel the tomatoes by plunging them into boiling water for two minutes, then under cold water, at which point the skins should slip away. Chop the tomatoes roughly (scooping out the seeds, if you wish). Peel and slice the onion into half moons and chop the peeled potato, red pepper and aubergines into chunks the size of a nutmeg. In a large, wide frying pan or casserole, fry the onion in plenty of olive oil and a pinch of salt over a low-medium heat, until soft and translucent. Add the potato, stir and add a small glass of warm water so the potatoes bubble. After five minutes, add the tomato and allow to simmer gently for 30–40 minutes or until soft, rich and saucy (add a little water if it starts to look dry). Now you have two options: you can simply add the aubergine and peppers to the pan about 10 minutes after the potatoes and cook everything together. Alternatively, in a separate pan in a couple of inches of olive oil, fry the chunks of aubergine and pepper in batches until soft and golden, draining on kitchen towel and then stir into the tomato in the last few minutes of cooking. Either way, once cooked, taste and add salt as necessary. Serve at room temperature."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/19/harry-kane-england-world-cup-challenge-ronaldo-messi-golden-boot","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T21:30:22Z","webTitle":"Harry Kane: ‘The challenge is to be up there with Ronaldo and Messi’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/19/harry-kane-england-world-cup-challenge-ronaldo-messi-golden-boot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/19/harry-kane-england-world-cup-challenge-ronaldo-messi-golden-boot","fields":{"headline":"Harry Kane: ‘The challenge is to be up there with Ronaldo and Messi’","bodyText":"Harry Kane has set himself the target of emulating Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi on the biggest stage after kickstarting his World Cup career with the brace that secured England a winning start in Russia. The Tottenham striker now has eight goals from six games as captain of the national side and 10 in eight under Gareth Southgate’s stewardship. His two strikes against Tunisia keep him within reach of Ronaldo, Diego Costa and Romelu Lukaku in pursuit of the tournament’s Golden Boot, a trophy he is intent on claiming, and banished any lingering memories of his toils at his only previous major finals, a scoreless Euro 2016. “I had to prove people wrong throughout my career and I love proving to myself I can do it,” said Kane. “Ronaldo is the best in the world, up there with Messi, but the challenge is there to be with them. To be the best player in the world you have to aim high – you can’t aim low – so just put no limits on yourself. I worked hard to get where I am. I have a lot of determination, I enjoy being here and it is about stepping it up. I said before I was so excited to be at a World Cup and it is about proving a point. The Euros were disappointing for me, for everyone, so it was a challenge to put that right. There is no better way to do it than to win and score a couple of goals. “I want to prove myself at a major tournament, I want to be up there with the best in the world and the only way to do that is to perform on the big stage and in the big moments. It gives me confidence doing that and I want to do that in the games ahead. I have been itching to get out there and showcase my talent. We have been in Russia a long time and were all excited to get started but you are never sure until you get out on the pitch. There are those moments when you need a goal but we did not panic, we looked calm, we did not look like conceding and we are always a threat at set pieces.” Kane left the pitch at the Volgograd Arena on Monday night to discover his Spurs manager, Mauricio Pochettino, had texted him congratulations. The Argentinian has been key to the forward’s development and helped instil the 24-year-old’s unswerving belief in his ability. “Poch texted me and after the game as well – he sent a lot of love hearts and said: ‘Come on England!’” he said. “He is rooting for me. He has a lot of lads here. He is not just my boss, he’s my mate … he’s the manager but he’s a friend as well. He wants me and the whole team to do well.” The striker, who confirmed he had opted against swapping his No 9 shirt with a Tunisian opponent post-match, is now focusing on the game against Panama on Sunday when England can potentially secure qualification for the knockout phase. “The message we have is: we attack the tournament,” added Kane. “We have not done well in recent years, so there is not much else that could go wrong. I would rather come here, attack it and score goals. If we go out, we go out. If not, we go through. “Some big teams have lost already. It is a World Cup and we are fighting for it. Look at Mexico beating Germany and how much it meant to them. Tunisia was a tough game for us but we proved to ourselves we can step up in the big moment. If we are to go far, we have to win games like that and teams who do well need last-minute goals or last-minute saves. As for my shirt, I wanted to keep it, that’s all: a first goal at a tournament, my first World Cup goals, the team’s first win, my first World Cup. One to keep.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/19/we-must-come-together-to-fight-the-resurgent-racist-right","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T17:15:18Z","webTitle":"We must come together to fight the resurgent racist right | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/we-must-come-together-to-fight-the-resurgent-racist-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/19/we-must-come-together-to-fight-the-resurgent-racist-right","fields":{"headline":"We must come together to fight the resurgent racist right","bodyText":"The 15,000-strong violent far-right protest to “free Tommy Robinson” on Saturday 9 June has raised major questions for all those who value our diversity.

Expectations ticks every box on pop’s checklist in admirably perfunctory style: there are the songs about anxiety (I’m a Mess, Sad), the one that sounds like Migos (Mine), the one that features one of Migos (2 Souls on Fire), the Latin one (Shining Star), the tropical house one complete with “dolphin whine” (I Got You) and so on. The only remotely distinctive song is Ferrari, a song about how “living in the fast lane’s getting kinda lonely” that lands somewhere between Maren Morris’s (much better) My Church and Rag’n’Bone Man’s (much worse) Human. As Ferrari proves, Rexha can belt in that strained, bluesy fashion that connotes authenticity – so it’s baffling trying to work out why her vocals are often lagged in Auto-Tune: she sounds like she’s drowning on Self Control and malfunctioning on the horrid Mine. The songwriting – about bad girls and good boys in miserable, moneyed relationships – is precisely as deep as you’d expect. Poptimism finds its hard ceiling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/lessons-my-baby-daughter-has-taught-me-part-1-nikesh-shukla","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T05:00:23Z","webTitle":"Lessons my baby daughter has taught me (part 1) | Nikesh Shukla","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/lessons-my-baby-daughter-has-taught-me-part-1-nikesh-shukla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/24/lessons-my-baby-daughter-has-taught-me-part-1-nikesh-shukla","fields":{"headline":"Lessons my baby daughter has taught me (part 1)","bodyText":"As my youngest daughter turns one, I’ve been reflecting a lot on the past 12 months. Not in a “this is what we’ve learned” way that you might find at the end of a cheesy sitcom. And definitely not in a “here is my advice on being a dad” way, because I don’t really know anything. Here is part one of 12 things that I have learned (part two to follow next week): 1. I don’t really know anything. Mostly because not everything worked the first time, and not everything that worked the first time worked the second time. It’s almost as if children are individuals, and react to things differently. Also, because those first few months are so disorienting and sleep-deprived, I cannot for the life of me remember anything that did or didn’t work. Ergo, I don’t really know anything. 2. Never, ever, ever talk about sleep. Especially when it’s going well. Anytime someone has asked how the sleep is going, and we’ve been in a good period, I’ve been stupid enough to tempt fate and let them know that it is going well. That is a surefire way for things to go badly. Instantly. My sister asked me how the sleeping was going, and we’d just got into a good groove, and it was starting to appear successful. She was pregnant at the time, and I wanted her to know it was going to be OK. So I told her it was going well, really positive. This unleashed two weeks of disruption: unable to fall asleep without being comforted, multiple wake-ups (usually timed for just when I hit deep sleep) and the pre-5am wake-up. I will never talk about it again. 3. I can scoop poo out of the bath quickly. When the baby, relaxing in the warm water, having been a bit constipated that day, lets something go, I’ve got the method to deal with it. 4. If you’re going to have your kids share a room, don’t rush it. There was a disastrous two weeks where we tried to get our two daughters to share. It resulted in them winding each other up, waking each other up, giggling at each other instead of sleeping, crying, more crying and a bit more crying. It ended when a fifth night of sleeplessness made us snap. 5. Thank God for hand-me-downs. As a teenager, I was always a bit miffed that everything I wore was a hand-me-down from my cousins. They were twins, and wore the same outfits, so I had two of everything once they grew out of it. Looking back, having two of that classic LA Lakers jacket would have made me twice the fortune on eBay today. At the time, I just felt uncool wearing clothes I never got to choose. But hand-me-downs through our families have been a godsend. Especially shoes, which seem to have a sweet spot of four weeks when they fit well. Having hand-me-downs from friends and family for our first kid was great, and then we got to reuse most things again. It saved a fortune which, when you need to buy nappies all the time, is very welcome. Because, my lord, we tried with the reusable nappies, but we just couldn’t manage it. Getting through the washing is hard enough without the constant pressure of ensuring nappies were regularly cleaned, washed, dried and ready for use. 6. I remember wondering, when our youngest was born, just how the hell you managed two. Obviously, people have done it for millions of years. But other people aren’t as clueless as I am… And for the first few months, it definitely felt like we were tag-teaming attention. But a few weeks ago, I left them to their own devices while I did some washing up. I heard the keyboard my youngest sister definitely bought to troll us switch on, and I heard squeals of delight, as they both had the most infernal discordant loud jam session ever, smiling at each other, feeding off each other and playing together properly for what felt like the first time. I stopped what I was doing and just watched. It was beautiful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/21/sir-philip-green-in-bid-to-gag-regulators-report-on-pwc","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T18:50:26Z","webTitle":"Sir Philip Green launches legal bid to gag BHS-related report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/21/sir-philip-green-in-bid-to-gag-regulators-report-on-pwc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/21/sir-philip-green-in-bid-to-gag-regulators-report-on-pwc","fields":{"headline":"Sir Philip Green launches legal bid to gag BHS-related report","bodyText":"Sir Philip Green is seeking a gagging order to prevent the full publication of a watchdog’s report that casts fresh light on the BHS scandal. On Thursday, Green launched a high court bid to stop the Financial Reporting Council publishing its damning report on the failures of the auditors responsible for checking BHS’s accounts. The Topshop tycoon wants sections of the FRC analysis to be redacted or changed, arguing that references to him and other members of the former BHS management could cause “serious and potentially irreparable harm” to their reputations. Last week Steve Denison, the senior PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant who audited the BHS accounts ahead of its sale for £1, only a year before the department store chain collapsed, was given a 15-year ban and and record personal fine of £325,000 after he admitted misconduct. PwC was given a record £6.5m fine but the FRC’s report was not published at the same time. Andrew Green QC, the barrister acting for Taveta, the retail billionaire’s holding company, told the high court it was not seeking to block the publication of the report, which is primarily focused on PwC’s failings. “This [goal] can be achieved with a redacted version,” he said. “It is fundamental to bear in mind the gravity of the criticism. The prejudice to those individuals would be severe.” Charles Béar, the barrister acting for the FRC, said it was not in the public interest to make any changes. “Publication of only part of the FRC’s reasons would be either unintelligible or misleading or both,” he said. The Commons work and pensions committee, which carried out an investigation into the demise of the department store in 2016, has already received a copy of the report. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the committee and has regularly locked horns with Green over BHS, has been pushing for its publication. Field, who watched Thursday’s hearing, said outside the court that he would challenge any attempt by Green to modify the report. “This attempt at a gagging order is also gagging parliament,” he said. “At some stage we will have to come and argue there is a wider public interest than Sir Philip Green’s reputation.” Taveta is asking for an interim injunction before a judicial review. Mr Justice Nicklin said the hearing had raised “important issues that need to be properly considered” and he would pass judgment as soon as possible. On Thursday, a leaked email sent to nearly 1,000 PwC partners and written by the firm’s UK chairman, Kevin Ellis, was heavily critical of Denison who, it emerged, had backdated his BHS audit opinion and spent just two hours working on the file. In the email, Ellis described Denison’s supervision of the audit as “inadequate” with too much work delegated to a junior team member. “This situation should not have happened and we need to face up to the failings and learn the lessons,” he wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/23/switch-energy-provider-eon-price-hike-bigger-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Switch energy providers now to escape price rises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/23/switch-energy-provider-eon-price-hike-bigger-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/23/switch-energy-provider-eon-price-hike-bigger-bills","fields":{"headline":"Switch energy providers now to escape price rises","bodyText":"As Britain heads into a heatwave next week, the last thing on your mind might be your gas bills. But experts say the message to millions of standard tariff customers is that now is the time to switch suppliers to beat recent price hikes. This week, E.ON became the last of the big six energy companies to hike its prices, blaming higher wholesale costs for its latest 4.8% increase. It follows a raft of price rises from the other big suppliers this year. From 16 August the 1.8 million customers on E.ON’s standard tariff will see their dual-fuel bills rise by an average of £55 a year. Electricity-only customers will see a 6.2% average increase, or £36 a year. Meanwhile, its gas-only customers will see a typical 3.3% hike, or £19 a year. The changes mean the average E.ON customer will now pay about £1,208 a year. It comes a few months after the company was accused of a backdoor price hike when it scrapped a number of discounts resulting in an increase of £22 a year for its standard tariff customers. Peter Earl, the head of energy at CompareTheMarket, says there are still big savings to be had by changing suppliers. “This move will most likely drive thousands of customers to switch to a cheaper deal. The average saving for someone on a standard variable rate is around £350 – a huge windfall for those who take the time to shop around for a better deal.” A Guardian Money search this week using EnergyHelpline found that a standard E.ON customer could save about £400 by switching to the cheapest firm – Utility Point, which is based in Poole, Dorset. Its “flexi online tracker 18” tariff is a variable deal, meaning prices could go up at any point, but there are no cancellation fees. There are a host of small suppliers offering to supply a year’s energy for around £800 a year compared with the £1,200-odd charged by one of the big six providers. • See if you can switch supplier and save money with the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/21/the-future-of-politics-will-be-dominated-by-migration","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T16:58:32Z","webTitle":"The future of politics will be dominated by migration | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/the-future-of-politics-will-be-dominated-by-migration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/the-future-of-politics-will-be-dominated-by-migration","fields":{"headline":"The future of politics will be dominated by migration","bodyText":"The List, detailing 34,361 deaths (Dying refugees is nothing new, and they don’t all drown. For 25 years we’ve looked away, 20 June), is a sombre reminder of some who have died in the legitimate exercise of their fundamental right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution, and in their search for a place to live where they may enjoy a minimum level of safety, security and economic, social and cultural rights. However, the names of most missing and dead refugees and migrants across the world are not known, their families not traced; where bodies have been found, they are often buried in unmarked graves. Families do not know if a missing relative – a parent, spouse, brother, sister or child – is alive or dead. On 10 and 11 May, some 50 civil society participants from around the world, and from a wide spectrum of disciplines, gathered on Lesbos as part of the Last Rights Project. The resulting Mytilini declaration of 11 May – see www.lastrights.net – is a summation of agreement reached as to the significant, fundamental issues to be highlighted. More should and will be done, but this document provides renewed focus and spotlight on the rights of the bereaved, missing and deceased, a tool for lawyers, campaigners and activists to challenge practices of states and use to persuade. It works internationally, irrespective of jurisdiction or cultures, and at local as well as higher level. We do not want this to become just another dust-laden document on a shelf. It will be a difficult process in a contested, contentious area. It will need all our persuasion and tenacity to gain traction with states.

Catriona Jarvis Co-founder and co-convener, Last Rights • The way immigration utterly dominated your 20 June edition is a harbinger of things to come, as people grasp that this issue, and how to tackle it, will dominate the future of politics. To solve the migration crisis, which is tearing European and now US politics apart, will require a three-pronged approach. This must consider the pros and cons of immigration from the perspective of the countries the migrants have left, the migrants themselves, and the views of the majority in the country migrants have entered or are attempting to enter. The rapid rate of population growth in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean will add to the urgency of this approach. Democratic, progressive and internationalist policies would include ones that meet the concerns of the majority with stricter border controls, but which also grasp the urgency of seeing all foreign policy, aid and trade agreements in terms of improving the lives of the majority in poorer countries, and thus helping to minimise permanent migration globally. Progressive policies could range from increasing living standards for the poorer section of society through fair taxation to limiting arms sales, decarbonising economies and reducing resource use. Finally, the other forces that have caused insecurity in the recipient countries – globalisation, austerity and the increasing additional threat of automation roaring up the skill ladder – must be reversed. The disruption at present caused by migration could be the prism through which such long-sought goals finally become reality. Colin Hines Author, Progressive Protectionism • The more I see the restrictive policies of “Fortress Europe”, the more a line from Bruno Bettelheim’s book The Empty Fortress resonates: “But I believe that knowing the other – which is different from knowing about the other – can only be a function of knowing oneself.” In this era, populists use the words “refugees and migrants” to inspire fear and rejection. I do not know how much Alf (Lord) Dubs knew “about” Syria or Afghanistan, but he knew what it was like, as a child, to arrive as a stranger on the Kindertransport, escaping Nazis. He used what modest influence he had to amend legislation that has been overwhelmingly hostile to the most vulnerable refugees. The List may stimulate readers better to know “the other” who is desperate to come here. Critically, from behind our white cliffs, it may stimulate us to better know who we, really, are. Woody Caan Editor, Journal of Public Mental Health • Before Roberto Saviano lashes out at his countrymen for “an upsurge of nationalism that displays racist animus” in opposing immigration, he needs to come up with something better than his three solutions to the problem (Italy’s war on migrants makes me fear for my country’s future, 19 June). Firstly, making all current illegal immigrants legal is the opposite of a solution. The message to would-be illegal immigrants is that if you hang around long enough you will get in. As Saviano says, it’s been done before. Secondly, “we should get to work on regulating visas”. Does that mean everyone gets a visa and you haven’t solved the problem, or does it mean only some get visas and you haven’t solved the problem? Thirdly, getting agreement from other European counties to accept Italy’s immigrants. Laughable. It’s never going to happen. Mass migration is a massive problem, and it is not going to be solved by liberals like Saviano calling those who oppose it nationalist racists waging a war on migrants or by any other slogans or empty rhetoric. Derek Matthews Newcastle on Clun, Shropshire • For centuries the “developed world” has exploited the resources of the “developing world”, holding back their chance for economic growth and security. So it is hardly surprising that the people who live there are coming here to get their money back. We need a new approach to the so-called migration problem, based on a fairer distribution of where the world’s wealth is spent. Eric Goodyer Birsay, Orkney • Roberto Saviano says that when it comes to illegal immigration “Italy has not earned the right to say: ‘Right, that’s enough.’” I agree that Matteo Salvini is “flagrant in his nastiness” towards migrants trying to reach Europe. However, I was surprised when some liberal Dublin-based Italian friends of mine told me that “something must be done” about the out-of-control problem of illegal immigration in their homeland. It doesn’t help that other European countries, notably the UK and Ireland, continue to refuse to take in their fair share of refugees and economic migrants. Emmanuel Macron summed up the hypocrisy of many in the EU when he attacked Italy’s “cynicism and irresponsibility” in turning away the rescue ship Aquarius. Salvini had some justification in dismissively pointing out that France had committed to accepting 9,816 migrants under a 2015 EU redistribution scheme but had so far accepted only 640 people.

But her enduring legacy will be the groundbreaking Samaritans Listener scheme which she founded in HMP Swansea in 1991 after a 15-year-old boy hanged himself in the prison. The Listener scheme, whereby prisoners are trained to provide a patient and compassionate ear for fellow prisoners in distress, is one of the most innovative ventures introduced to the UK prison system and has saved countless lives. The governor of Swansea at the time, Jim Heyes, was a man of foresight who had been deeply affected by the death of the youngster and welcomed the Samaritans into his prison. He worked closely with Kathy to establish the Listeners as an integral part of his prison regime. Between them they created “a living organism”, as one governor described it, which has spread so that now every prison in the country is obliged to have such a scheme and to have a relationship with the Samaritans as part of their key performance indicators. I first met Kathy when I was an early-years life prisoner. As deputy chair of Samaritans, she visited HMP Nottingham in 1992 to meet the new group of Listeners, of whom I was one. We were nervous, but she put us at ease and persuaded us that our voluntary roles would save lives. Fourteen years later and two years after my release, I met her again when I was asked to present her with the 2006 Perrie award, granted each year to the person who has done most to promote an understanding of the work of the Prison Service in England and Wales. In 1994 Kathy was appointed MBE for services to prisoner welfare. As well as being a part of the service’s Safer Custody Group from the early 1990s, she was the suicide prevention adviser to high-security prisons from 2001 until 2007. Born in Northwood, Middlesex, Kathy was the daughter of Frances (nee Weir) and Allan Biggar, who met during the second world war – her mother was in the Waaf, her father in the RAF. After the war, Frances became a full-time mother to Kathy and her sister Janet. Allan worked in the family publishing business, before going into journalism, writing for the Sporting Life and the annual Bloodstock Review. Kathy was educated at Northwood college for girls. At 18 she went on an exchange trip to live with a French family for six months and during this time developed an interest in photography. On her return, she enrolled at Ealing School of Art, studying and qualifying in the subject and planning a photography career, which took her into the research department of Unilever. Soon afterwards she joined her local branch of Samaritans and became a stalwart of the Hillingdon branch throughout the 70s and 80s. In the mid-70s Kathy was a co-founder of the festival branch – outreach tents at music festivals such as Knebworth and Reading – she and her colleagues arguing that the Samaritans were then seen as “too white and too middle-class” and that they needed to reach out to more diverse and younger people. Her colleague Phil Howes, another festival branch founder, remembered that “Kathy was like a mother hen and we were the chicks all running after her.” Her Samaritan work at Hillingdon brought Kathy into contact with many prison leavers suffering mental health problems and other vulnerabilities and it was this experience that made her decide to change careers and join the Probation Service at Feltham in 1973. Several years later she became the prison probation officer in HMP Wandsworth. There she recruited prisoners who were coping well to “keep an eye” on those who were obviously not, and this was the starting point of what eventually became the Listeners. In 1991 Kathy was given the pivotal role of liaising between the Prison Service and Samaritans, travelling around the country persuading prison governors of the merits of the scheme. Kathy met her future husband, Bill Baker, in the early 80s when he was a computer programmer for ICI and a fellow Samaritan. Bill also later became a probation officer and the couple were married in 2001, bringing Kathy three stepchildren. Following their retirement in 2007, Kathy and Bill decided to go on a world sightseeing trip which was cut short when Bill was taken ill and then diagnosed with cancer. Kathy nursed Bill until his death in 2009. Kathy, now a Samaritan at the central London branch, kept up her involvement with the Listener scheme and other initiatives to reduce suicide in prison, even after she, too, was diagnosed with cancer early in 2016. In 2017, the Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody (IAP) undertook a collaboration with the national newspaper for prisoners and detainees, Inside Time, National Prison Radio and Samaritans to reach out to those in custody, seeking their ideas for keeping people safe in prison. They received more than 200 detailed letters from prisoners, one of whom wrote: “I’m just one of many who have been saved by the Listeners.” Kathy responded personally to every letter. “Through her professionalism and humanity, Kathy not only saved countless lives, she enabled people in prison to see that they too could save lives and help fellow prisoners in extreme distress,’” said Juliet Lyon, chair of the IAP. “She had presence,” said Berny, a former long-term prisoner and Listener who after her release became a close friend of Kathy. “Wherever Kathy was, there was a sense of incredible kindness, love and acceptance.” Kathy rarely spoke about why she did what she did, although she once said: “Enabling people to talk about how they feel is a real gift.” People from all walks of life, and in particular people in custody, will be eternally grateful that she shared that gift. She is survived by her sister and her mother. • Kathy Mabel Baker, probation officer and Samaritan, born 10 June 1947; died 7 June 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/21/children-camps-normal-life-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T17:23:34Z","webTitle":"Children are held in camps, yet normal life goes on.

It’s chilling","bodyText":"I was going to write about Chuck E Cheese this week, the US chain restaurant and “family entertainment centre” popular as a party venue for seven-year-olds. After attending one such celebration at the weekend, I had some whimsical thoughts about how the place functions as an on-ramp for capitalism, charging parents large amounts of money to watch as their children are stoked into a state of near hysteria, competing for worthless bits of plastic that, after winning, they immediately discard. However, I couldn’t bring myself to pursue it, nor to send an email, nor to have much in the way of a conversation that didn’t ultimately dock in the ongoing US immigration scandal. “Scandal” seems an inadequate word. Obscenity is closer to it, and to the experience of carrying on with business as usual while, out of the corner of one eye, more details from the child detention centres emerge. Trump’s presidency has been one long series of outrages, a chief concern of which has been the twin risks of normalisation and outrage fatigue. It’s a paradox of social media that, while it encourages shouty overreaction to trivial disputes, it also traffics in distraction from much bigger transgressions. In this scenario, citizens are reduced to a state of numbness and apathy, caught up in a cycle of responding to each buffoonish Trump tweet while the bigger picture pixelates away to abstraction. Fake outrage on the internet is supposed to have deafened us to the advent of a genuine emergency. In this case, it didn’t, or at least hasn’t appeared to so far. The separation of some 2,300 children from their parents was – and continues to be, even after the executive order reversing the policy, but not softening Trump’s line on “zero tolerance” – different. This was a category of threat that everybody who isn’t a sociopath or a Republican seeking the approval of his base understands. And yet, particularly to those of us living in the US, the question remains: what would it take to get us to call off the day’s work and respond to the news as if to a personal emergency? The answer is, probably, nothing would. (Read the French writer Vercors’ stories of the Nazi occupation.) In this instance, giving money seemed the quickest and most effective thing to do, and in the last few days, donations have poured in to organisations such as the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, a nonprofit organisation in Texas providing legal and other support to separated families that raisedmore than $16m in a single Facebook fundraiser. There is a rally on 30 June. And yet things go on. This is both reassuring – a basic tenet of human resilience is the ability to hold more than one thing in our heads at a time – and simultaneously deeply chilling. Writing in the New York Review of Books about Milton Mayer’s 1955 analysis of ordinary life in Nazi Germany, Cass Sunstein said: “Mayer suggests that even when tyrannical governments do horrific things, outsiders tend to exaggerate their effects on the actual experiences of most citizens, who focus on their own lives and ‘the sights which meet them in their daily rounds’.” Thousands of children are still in detention. The emergency goes on. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/22/retired-nhs-nurse-family-britain-pauline-pennant-jamaica","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"‘They have traumatised our lives’: the retired NHS nurse too scared to visit family in Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/22/retired-nhs-nurse-family-britain-pauline-pennant-jamaica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/22/retired-nhs-nurse-family-britain-pauline-pennant-jamaica","fields":{"headline":"‘They have traumatised our lives’: the retired NHS nurse too scared to visit family in Britain","bodyText":"A retired nurse in Jamaica who was charged more than £4,000 for cancer tests has said she is too afraid to visit her family in Britain after NHS debt collectors warned her she could be detained by immigration officials. Pauline Pennant, 70, who retired to Jamaica in 1993 after 30 years working mainly in London hospitals, fell seriously ill on a visit to the UK three years ago when she was diagnosed with secondary bone cancer. For Pennant, the 70th anniversary of the MV Empire Windrush’s first arrival at Tilbury docks is overshadowed by the fear of being detained if she returns to Britain. The ordeal has left her too afraid to visit her seriously ill brother at University Hospital Lewisham or attend her granddaughter’s graduation at Birmingham University next month. She was ordered to pay £4,388 for tests at Croydon University hospital after a law change three months earlier that requires overseas visitors to pay for most NHS healthcare, even if, like Pennant, they are British citizens who still pay UK taxes. The former nurse has felt forced to pay £50 a month from her UK pension to the bill after she was warned by the debt collection agency CCCI Credit Management, acting for the hospital, in October last year that she could be detained by the UK Border Agency unless she paid the total sum within 60 days. The letter, which also said the Home Office would be informed if the amount remained unpaid, was sent to her home in the Jamaican port town of Ocho Rios and came despite repeated unanswered pleas to the hospital to resolve her situation, Pennant said. The saga has cast a huge shadow over Pennant’s once-cherished memories of the country where her parents arrived in the early 1950s as part of the first wave of Windrush generation migrants from the Caribbean. “I’ve never, ever thought of the UK as somewhere I’d have negative feelings about. I’ve never felt like that until now. The letter I got [from the debt collectors] said they would stop me – I don’t know if they’ve put a stoppage on me coming back or not [but] I don’t want to be traumatised over that. I don’t need that at this point in my life,” she said, adding that she wanted a letter of assurance from the Home Office that she will not be detained if she returns to Britain. The health and social care secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said in a letter to Pennant’s MP, Steve Reed, this week that he “fully sympathised” with her case but that she was liable to pay because she was not currently resident in the UK. Pennant is furious that retirees were never told about the rule change. “If I knew this was going to happen I would have been prepared with insurance,” she said. She also wants to know where her UK tax is going if not to the NHS. “They have traumatised our lives. They are just playing games with our emotions and I’m sick of it. They don’t care about people. They disregard us and think we’re trash,” she said. Pennant has been overwhelmed by the number of people who have offered to help pay her £4,388 bill since the Guardian published her story on 23 May but is determined to fight to change the “hostile environment” approach. “It’s not about money. I want attitudes to change, I want policies to change,” she said. “I want them to treat us like normal people who have contributed, we’ve paid our tax – we’re still paying tax – we’re now at a stage where we should be reaping the benefits. But with all this I’m now feeling that my father’s generation, and now us by extension, are reaping the bitter end of the stick.” Melvin Collins, 72, a retired Midlands youth worker who has been stranded in Jamaica since visiting the island three years ago, said he hoped Britain’s Caribbean community would boycott the government’s annual Windrush Day celebration announced this week by the communities minister, Nick Bourne, after months of damning revelations. He said any celebration involving the prime minister or the Home Office would be a “charade” and that communities should organise their own commemorative events. “The black community in the UK must reject this notion of a celebration event being organised by this government. Theresa May probably did more to harm [the Windrush generation] than anyone else,” he said. Collins was contacted by the government’s hastily established Windrush taskforce within days of a Guardian article reporting how he was left destitute in Jamaica after his “indefinite leave to remain” passport was wrongly taken by an immigration officer at Gatwick airport. The former Walsall council worker has relied on handouts from family and friends since his UK pension was stopped when he could not answer letters sent to his home in the Midlands. Collins is due within days to receive a new passport allowing him indefinite leave to remain in the UK and once again see his children and brother. After three years of frustrated attempts to resolve his crisis, the speedy resolution brings a bittersweet feeling. “I have to get home. I’m desperate,” he said from his 92-year-old aunt Lena’s flat, where he has been staying on the outskirts of Montego Bay. “I’m hurt. I’m 72 bloody years of age, I’ve lost three good years of my life not being able to move. I don’t trust them and I’ll never trust them again.” Meanwhile the government has announced that is setting up a Windrush commemoration committee to “consider how best to create a permanent tribute to the Windrush generation and their descendants”. The body will be chaired by Lady Floella Benjamin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/22/the-age-of-patriarchy-how-an-unfashionable-idea-became-a-rallying-cry-for-feminism-today","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T05:00:20Z","webTitle":"The age of patriarchy: how an unfashionable idea became a rallying cry for feminism today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/22/the-age-of-patriarchy-how-an-unfashionable-idea-became-a-rallying-cry-for-feminism-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/22/the-age-of-patriarchy-how-an-unfashionable-idea-became-a-rallying-cry-for-feminism-today","fields":{"headline":"The age of patriarchy: how an unfashionable idea became a rallying cry for feminism today","bodyText":"On 7 January this year, the alt-right insurgent Steve Bannon turned on his TV in Washington DC to watch the Golden Globes. The mood of the event was sombre. It was the immediate aftermath of multiple accusations of rape and sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein, which he has denied. The women, whose outfits would normally have been elaborate and the subject of frantic scrutiny, wore plain and sober black. In the course of a passionate speech, Oprah Winfrey told the audience that “brutally powerful men” had “broken” something in the culture. These men had caused women to suffer: not only actors, but domestic workers, factory workers, agricultural workers, athletes, soldiers and academics. The fight against this broken culture, she said, transcended “geography, race, religion, politics and workplace”. Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, was one of 20 million Americans watching. In his view, the scene before him augured the beginning of a revolution “even more powerful than populism”, according to his biographer Joshua Green. “It’s deeper. It’s primal. It’s elemental. The long black dresses and all that – this is the Puritans. It’s anti-patriarchy,” Bannon declared. “If you rolled out a guillotine, they’d chop off every set of balls in the room … Women are gonna take charge of society. And they couldn’t juxtapose a better villain than Trump. He is the patriarch.” He concluded: “The anti-patriarchy movement is going to undo 10,000 years of recorded history.” Until very recently, “patriarchy” was not something rightwing men were even supposed to believe in, let alone dilate upon with such apocalyptic relish. It was the sort of word that, if uttered without irony, marked out the speaker as a very particular type of person – an iron-spined feminist of the old school, or the kind of ossified leftist who complained bitterly about the evils of capitalism. Even feminist theorists had left it behind. Nevertheless, “patriarchy” has, in the past year or so, bloomed in common parlance and popular culture. Once you tune into it, you cannot escape it: it is emblazoned on banners and T-shirts; it is an unexpected recent addition to the vocabulary of the red-carpet interview; it is there in newspaper headlines, explaining everything from the Irish abortion vote to the recent murder of 10 people in Toronto in a van attack, allegedly by a violently misogynistic “incel” – a man who believes he has been denied a right to sex with women. Outside the anglophone world, the Spanish patriarcado has been getting a workout; so too the German Patriarchat, the Italian patriarcato and the French patriarcat. As the #MeToo campaign has grown, so has the use of “patriarchy”. It has burst its way out of the attic of half-discarded concepts to greet a moment – one of fourth-wave feminist ferment – in which there is a newly urgent need to name what women are still struggling against. The resurgence of the term is all the more surprising when one considers the forces ranged against it. Many people would question the existence of something called “patriarchy” to begin with – pointing to the strides made in gender equality over the past century, and insisting that instances of sexism are individual and isolated, destined to fade further over time, rather than evidence of a persistent structure of inequality. There are others, meanwhile, who regard the term’s very reappearance as another sign that #MeToo has “gone too far” – and see “patriarchy” as the hysterical war cry of McCarthyite feminists determined to hunt down men who are guilty of nothing more than past behaviours once considered perfectly acceptable. For some sceptical liberals, there is a resistance to the ideological implications of grand concepts such as “patriarchy” (or “neoliberalism”), which are seen as oversimplifications of a more complex reality. Among gender studies academics, it is no longer in wide use. Once a term debated in endless articles, conferences and books, many theorists now regard it is as too blunt and monolithic to capture the nuances of oppression. Paradoxically, some on the right have enthusiastically taken up the term – regarding it not as an evil to be stamped out, but as a “natural” difference between the genders, ordained by God or biology, to be protected against rampaging feminism. But for those who have lost a basic trust in the forward motion of human progress – or who were born too recently to have known it – “patriarchy” seems exactly the word to explain the continued existence of pervasive, seemingly ineradicable inequality. The moment of #MeToo brought this into relief: it revealed to many feminists that despite all those years of working hard, of leaning in, of waiting till unfairness gradually ebbed away, of absorbing and internalising sexism, of building starry careers or else toiling away in menial jobs in the hope that their children would have it better, you could still be pinned to a bed or cornered at a party or groped, or leered at or catcalled by a man – simply because of your woman’s body. In this moment, the concept of “patriarchy” has offered itself as the invisible mechanism that connects a host of seemingly isolated and disparate events, intertwining the experience of women of vastly different backgrounds, race and culture, and ranging in force from the trivial and personal to the serious and geopolitical. For it allows us to ask, according to the philosopher Amia Srinivasan, “whether there is something in common between the Weinstein affair, the election of Trump, the plight of women garment workers in Asia and women farm workers in North America, and the Indian rape epidemic. It allows people to ask whether some machine is at work that connects all the experiences they’re having with all the experiences others are having.” The return of “patriarchy” raises the question: does the naming and understanding of this invisible mechanism offer the key to its destruction? * * * For much of human history, the persistence of male domination was so much part of the oxygen of life that patriarchy was not even identified as a concept – unlike democracy, autocracy or oligarchy, whose relative merits were vigorously debated by the Greeks. The notion that male supremacy was “natural” was self-fulfilling, since those who wrote the laws, the poems, the religious books, the philosophy, the history, the medical treatises and the scientific texts were, very largely, men writing for the benefit of men. As Jane Austen’s character Anne Elliot says: “Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands.” You might even say that patriarchy’s particular power is its capacity to make itself as invisible as possible; it tries very hard not to draw attention to the means of its endurance. But if you look at the world with patriarchy in view, you might see how some intelligent, successful and apparently assertive women fail to leave men who humiliate them and monitor their every move (such are the hallmarks of “coercive control”, now a criminal offence). You might see why even apparently liberal organisations, even those run by women, still have a gender pay gap. Or why about 80 women a year, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, are murdered by a male partner or ex-partner. Why women do more childcare and housework than men, and why this domestic “second shift” has until recently been completely ignored by economists. Why the clothing of Angela Merkel and Theresa May is avidly critiqued, but that of Emmanuel Macron is not. Why there are so few meaningful female characters in films. Some concepts are like a pair of spectacles that allow otherwise invisible or inexplicable things to be seen with sudden sharpness: “patriarchy” is one of them. The word literally means “rule of the father”, from the ancient Greek. There are many different ideas about its extent and force. Some people have used it to describe patterns derived from the structure of the family; to others, it is an entire system of oppression built on misogyny and the exploitation and brutalisation of women. It is not simple, in fact, to produce a concise definition of patriarchy. But at its simplest, it conveys the existence of a societal structure of male supremacy that operates at the expense of women – rather in the way that “white supremacy” conveys the existence of a societal structure that operates at the expense of black people. Part of the idea of “patriarchy” is that this oppression of women is multilayered. It operates through inequalities at the level of the law and the state, but also through the home and the workplace. It is upheld by powerful cultural norms and supported by tradition, education and religion. It reproduces itself endlessly through these norms and structures, which are themselves patriarchal in nature; and thus it has a way of seeming natural or inevitable, or else, in a liberal context, it is obscured by piecemeal advances in gender equality. Because it offers the idea of a structure of power relations, rather than a series of specific sexist acts, “patriarchy” accommodates the idea that not all men enthusiastically uphold it or benefit equally from it; and that some women may, on the other hand, do a great deal towards supporting it. It also allows for the fact that however much we might loathe it, we all, perforce, participate in it. Only “patriarchy” seems to capture the peculiar elusiveness of gendered power – the idea that it does not reside in any one site or institution, but seems spread throughout the world. Only “patriarchy” seems to express that it is felt in the way individual examples of gender inequality interact, reinforcing each other to create entire edifices of oppression. Take the fact that only about 20% of rapes and sexual assaults in England and Wales are reported to the police, and that of those only a tiny proportion – 7.5% in 2015 – results in a conviction. Why should that be? The most immediate reason is that only a few are brought to trial – a fact that, in isolation, illuminates very little. But the concept of patriarchy helps to reveal that such a trial is merely the pinnacle of a structure supported on myriad props. These props might include all kinds of things without obvious connection: a legal system historically designed by men; the lingering misrecognition of rape as simply an excess of male desire; a police force carrying a legacy of sexism; the cultural and religious shaming of sexually active women; the objectification of women’s bodies; pornography; the fact that women in general are discouraged from speaking out (and if they do, they may expect baleful consequences, as Mary Beard has shown in her book Women and Power). That is before you scrutinise the act of rape itself: for some feminists, sexual violence is so clearly a means of controlling women that it is not only an outrage often perpetrated under patriarchy, but its very underpinning. Once you see the world through the lenses of “patriarchy”, the thought naturally arises: what would the world be like if it weren’t there? Some feminists have argued that if women gain equal rights in society, patriarchy will be at least sufficiently tempered. Others have argued that even if equality were achieved, patriarchy would still exist, because human institutions – political, legal, educational, cultural – are themselves, in their bones, patriarchal structures. But it says something about the nature of this inquiry that it has most vividly been answered by writers of speculative fiction. In the 19th-century novel Herland, Charlotte Perkins Gilman imagined a women-only society: one of calm justice, efficient agriculture and comfortable clothing with lots of pockets. In Naomi Alderman’s novel The Power, published last year, women, through a kink of evolution, gain superior physical strength over men. A bloody revolution ensues, and there is no hint that the resulting reversal of patriarchy – matriarchy – will be any less oppressive than what it has replaced. It seems to be a zero-sum game. * * * “Patriarchy” is not a stable concept. It has fallen in and out of fashion, flourishing at moments of feminist renewal. Nevertheless, feminism began without it. Mary Wollstonecraft was clear, in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) that there was such as thing as “the tyranny of men”, but it was another 60 years before the term “patriarchy” was adopted as something like a theory of social relations. By the mid-19th century, the world was coming to seem older, bigger and more unstable than it had done before. In 1859, Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published. Marx’s Das Kapital would follow in 1867. At the same time, work by anthropologists and ancient historians was revealing that there were, and had been, family structures, legal systems and whole societies that looked radically different from those in modern Paris, Berlin or London. Industrialisation and urbanisation were underway in Europe, especially in Britain; women were rapidly entering the workforce. Two years after On the Origin of Species, and six years before Das Kapital, a Swiss jurist and classicist called Johann Jakob Bachofen published a book whose influence remains nearly as pervasive – even though hardly anyone has heard of it now, its substantive claims have been repudiated, and it has never been fully translated into English from its original German. It was taken up strongly by Friedrich Engels; it deeply interested Sigmund Freud; and its theories were absorbed by early archaeologists and prehistorians. The book was called Das Mutterrecht (“Mother Right”), and its grand theory was that, in a distant prehistoric era, the father’s role in begetting children had not been yet recognised, and women (and mother goddesses) held power in the world. This highly speculative account of a matriarchy simultaneously birthed the idea of “patriarchy” as a historically contingent, manmade, societal structure that had, according to Bachofen, eventually superseded matriarchy. His method involved close readings of Greek literature and some contemporary anthropological studies. According to his interpretation of Aeschylus’s Oresteia, for example, Orestes’s acquittal for the murder of his mother, Clytemnestra, on the grounds that she was not a parent but only a “container” for his father’s seed, echoed the moment when the patriarchy established itself – when “the Apollonian age [emerged] out of the ruins of mother right”. Many academics would now argue that such myths are not really echoes of real matriarchal societies – but instead operated, as Mary Beard put it, “to justify the existence of the patriarchy, as charter myths for why men run things”. For Bachofen, matriarchy and patriarchy were opposites: dark versus light, “the bloody law of the earth” set against “the pure celestial power of the sun”. His vision of the elementally opposed “female” and “male” has been hugely influential. The idea of an earthbound, essentially non-rational femininity has sometimes been claimed by feminists; in a very different way, you can hear the echoes of the rhetoric, roughly filtered through Nietzsche and Jung, in the statements of rightwing male supremacists of today, especially those who speak of the “chaos” of the feminine. Bachofen himself was no feminist. The idea of the Amazons – mythical female warriors – particularly disturbed him. They represented “an extreme and decadent form of gynecocracy … man-hating, man-killing, bellicose virgins”, he wrote. When the term “patriarchy” started to circulate in this new formulation, it opened up new avenues of thought on the left. Engels, in The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, drew deeply on Bachofen in order to argue that patriarchy was a crucial factor in the emergence of capitalism. For him, the arrival of patriarchy – which was associated with the recognition of fatherhood, the development of monogamous marriage and inheritable private property – represented “the world-historical defeat of the female sex. The man took command in the home also; the woman was degraded and reduced to servitude, she became the slave of his lust and a mere instrument for the production of children”. It took a female thinker, and a feminist, to pull “patriarchy” out of the realm of theory and into the zone of experience. Virginia Woolf’s Three Guineas (1938) set “patriarchy” to work on the reality of her own circumstances. For her, it described the dynamics within families like hers – in which the father held economic power and authority, boys were trained for public life and girls were debarred from either a serious education or the opportunity to earn a living. The battle lines were drawn “between the victims of the patriarchal system and the patriarchs”. In other words, it was “the daughters against the fathers”. Woolf did not here write of “patriarchy” as a social structure that went beyond the boundaries of the bourgeois household. Nor did she have time for feminine essentialism: she predicted that the opportunity for women to amass capital and property on equal terms as men would mean that women could change “from being the victims of the patriarchal system … to being the champions of the capitalist system”. She expanded: “Behind us lies the patriarchal system: the private house, with its nullity, its immorality, its hypocrisy, its servility. Before us lies the public world, the professional system, with its possessiveness, its jealousy, its pugnacity, its greed.” It is an ambiguous picture: she shows little admiration for the capitalist world she describes. And yet in her formulation – an idea that some later feminists would find themselves echoing – the “creative destruction” of capitalism had the capacity to leave patriarchy behind. * * * In the late 1960s and early 70s, amid the ferment of revolutionary thought on the campuses of western Europe and north America, a new generation of feminist activists emerged. It was clear to them that oppression continued to bear down on women despite their increased access to the rights that Woolf’s generation fought for – access to education, the vote and the workplace. It was also obvious that existing theories of power were not equipped to explain this oppression: women had been of little interest as subjects for economics, history and sociology, with questions of gender inequality either ignored entirely or regarded as a natural byproduct of societal development. For the feminists of the second wave, part of the work was to bring women into the light. Oppression could be eradicated only if it could be identified, understood and effectively treated, quite possibly with radical or revolutionary medicine. “Patriarchy” at first provided the most useful focus for this work. Kate Millett’s Sexual Politics (1970) was an early text that attempted to flesh out “patriarchy” into society’s “most fundamental concept of power”. For her, patriarchy was everywhere; it was “the most pervasive ideology of our culture”. Even ordinary, apparently harmless social norms were in fact tools of oppression, according to her analysis: romantic love, for example, was simply a means of emotionally manipulating the female by the male, tricking her into subservience. Female compliance was also ensured by force – by rape. Women were socialised into pleasing, flattering, entertaining and gratifying men. Millett called the assumed birthright of male dominance “a most ingenious form of ‘interior colonisation’,” which was “sturdier than any form of segregation, and more rigorous than class stratification, more uniform, and certainly more enduring”. The feminist Rosalind Coward, author of Patriarchal Precedents: Sexuality and Social Relations (1983), one of the weightier academic tomes on the subject, recalls going to “endless conferences and meetings” in the 1970s and 80s where the idea of the patriarchy was discussed, analysed and thoroughly broken down. Her own book sets out some of the most pressing questions, not least the conundrum of where it actually came from. “Patriarchy offers itself as an account of the history of sexual relations, but at a certain point the same question has to be asked: why was it men who took control and what were the interests thus served? These questions lead back with an unerring certainty to the same divisions: are there natural sexual differences in which the sexes have distinct interests? Or are sexual dispositions produced by the patriarchal structure itself?” She had hit on a problem of circular thinking in relation to patriarchy – if it had emerged from some kind of a pre-patriarchal society, then surely the patriarchy would have been required in order to produce it in the first place. “Patriarchy” sprouted dozens of reformulations and refinements as feminists attempted to theorise it into a coherent system of domination. The radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon took a hardline view: she saw patriarchy as inscribed into the very structures of the liberal state. “Men against women” was precisely the fuel that kept society, as it is currently constituted, running. By contrast, the African American feminist bell hooks resisted the notion that the primary conflict in society was one of “men against women”, which seemed inherent in radical definitions of “patriarchy”. For her, it could be simply defined as “institutionalised sexism”. In order to end it, everyone, male and female alike, must “let go of sexist thoughts and action”. Lived reality threw up problems with the concept. Experience tells us that some men are oppressed more than some women. Not all women are oppressed in the same way. Writers such as hooks pointed out that for African American women, the family was not necessarily the site of oppression it was for white people, representing a place of possible refuge from the traumas of white supremacy. The kind of workplaces available to many black women, too, were not of the liberating kind accessible to educated white women. Queer theorist Judith Butler critiqued MacKinnon’s universalising view of patriarchy on similar grounds, arguing that it involved “erasures” of other forms of subtle and layered oppression; it was a kind of “theoretical imperialism”. Butler also sought to question the “naturalness” of gender. There were many possible categories of gendered and sexual practice, she argued, not simply the binary definitions that dominated the culture. And for psychoanalytically inclined feminist thinkers such as Jacqueline Rose, “the notion that all men are a category in opposition to all women breaks down because not all men are men,” she told me. “That is, not all men embody the kind of masculinity that men are supposed to inhabit.” The eventual rejection by many feminists of the usefulness of “patriarchy” as a fine-grained analytic concept coincided with a general diminuendo in feminist debate in the 1990s and early 2000s – a period later identified by the feminist Beatrix Campbell as a time of “neoliberal neopatriarchy”. Rapid globalisation and a culture of hyperindividualism, Campbell argued in The End of Equality (2013), had in fact led to yet more extreme forms of oppression, citing brutal conditions for labouring women in Mexico, the disproportionate number of female foetuses aborted in India and everywhere a working week “institutionalised in the interests of men unencumbered by duties of care”. While feminism had not died, during this period, it had certainly withered, she wrote. A few years earlier, in her book The Aftermath of Feminism (2008), Angela McRobbie had questioned her own initial enthusiasm for the symbols of the “third-wave feminism” of that period: Sex and the City; “girl power”; pole-dancing classes. In those days, to throw around the word “patriarchy” – when many people assumed that moral and economic progress were destined to eradicate inequality – would have seemed eccentric, misguided or plain mad. Women, or so it seemed, had never had it so good. * * * Patriarchy is nimble and lithe. Its margins of operation always seem to be expanding. Feminists have naturally tended to arrange their battle lines in front of the aspect of oppression that they have regarded as the most pressing. If “patriarchy” has returned as an idea in public debate, it is because feminism has returned with renewed vigour; because inequality has not been eradicated. In 1990, the feminist Sylvia Walby crisply laid out six areas of patriarchal oppression in her book Theorizing Patriarchy; they still seem to be ticking along nicely. In the home, women still do most of the domestic labour. In the workplace, a legal right to equal pay has not resulted in the eradication of the gender pay gap. At the level of the state, women are underrepresented nearly everywhere in the world in parliaments, legislatures, the military and other bodies. In terms of male violence, the charity Rape Crisis estimates that in Britain, 11 rapes are carried out or attempted every hour of every day. Women and men are still judged differently when it comes to sex. And the “patriarchal gaze” is still strong in education, religion, culture and the media. And so, for feminists right now, the uses of “patriarchy” are greater than its analytic flaws; it allows feminists to perceive the gap between the status quo and what they would like to achieve. “If patriarchy weren’t effective, we wouldn’t need feminism; if it were totally effective, we wouldn’t have feminism,” Jacqueline Rose told me. Feminists of an older generation note that the popular revival of “patriarchy” has not (yet) been accompanied by the intense debate and academic theorising that flowered around it the 1970s. It is a slogan and a popular rallying cry rather than an analytic tool. “What I don’t like about it,” said Mary Beard, “is that it is convenient and simple. I don’t really like ‘misogyny’ either, for the same reason. It’s no more a tangible ‘thing’ than capitalism. Saying ‘crush the patriarchy’ has a nice ring, but it doesn’t contain any political analysis.” While it is true that lots of intangible things are pressed into service as useful abstractions for helping us understand the world, some feminists still worry that “patriarchy” is in danger of being oversimplified in the course of being co-opted into public debate. “It is now seemingly used almost interchangeably with sexism,” Rosalind Coward said, “and it certainly doesn’t seem to be accompanied by a discussion about where it came from.” Jacqueline Rose told me: “It’s used as a call-out phrase, as if it explained everything. It’s fine to use it as a tool, as long as you don’t mistake it for a complete description of how the world is organised.” But then, perhaps the revival of “patriarchy” is a bellwether for today’s feminism, which is presently more concerned with action than theory. The concept has survived its biggest theoretical challenge – that of intersectionality, which argues that “patriarchy” universalises and oversimplifies the subtle realities of oppression – because it offers a description of the world that many people recognise, and that unites the many people who want to fight against it. It is particularly suited to today’s fast-moving, hyper-connected digital feminism, where immediate, personal connections can be made in an instant between feminists across the world and radicalising work done in a moment. “Patriarchy” is also deeply energising to those who use it. There is a certain relief in giving a name to the affliction. It has a satisfying ring of old-fashioned radicalism about it, and it comes with a sharp flavouring of conflict. “Patriarchy” is a battle cry. That is not surprising: the internet has enabled the rapid expansion of feminist campaigning, but also the deep and sometimes violent radicalisation of those who fear and hate it. A reaction against the new feminism has arrived almost simultaneously, as the discontents of disgruntled and unsettled men are stirred and stoked online, in the so-called manosphere. Cynical politicians crusading against “political correctness”, such as Trump, have fed off this baleful energy. In this clamorous world, “patriarchy” has become “the patriarchy”, a further simplification that makes it seem even more crude and concrete – less of an invisible mechanism, more of a statue to be smashed. One might reasonably ask whether the patriarchy is truly in any danger, as Steve Bannon fears. It is easier to topple patriarchs, as Susan Faludi pointed out in the wake of Weinstein, than patriarchy. Powerful men who have been called out by #MeToo have left the room, but the room itself still looks very much the same. (Some of the men, too, look very much as if they will be returning to the room quite soon.) If anything can unravel “the rule of the father”, it is likely to be the gradual shift in the way gender and sexuality are being understood. New ways of bringing up children outside traditional family structures will chip away at it. So will the rising generation of bold young feminists who have not internalised oppression like their elders, and who are calling out sexism and misogyny where they see it. But Bannon can relax. As Mary Beard said recently: “Patriarchy has had several thousand years of practice – of course it’s good at it. It’s very good at bolstering its own sexist values.” If a horde of angry leading women did take a guillotine to the testicles of Harvey Weinstein, patriarchy would survive. The word “patriarchy” ought to be a reminder that Weinstein and his ilk are the symptom, not the disease – but it is easier to tackle individuals than structures, signs rather than causes. At the moment – although the picture varies wildly across the globe – feminists are increasingly using the tool of “patriarchy” to recognise the subtle depth of the forces that keep oppression in place, from the expectations about the behaviour of women in the workplace to the way they are portrayed in fiction. It will be harder to unravel the effect of this cultural inheritance than it was to get the vote. As Max Weber observed, it is the very longevity of patriarchal traditions and norms that serve to prop it up – “the belief in the inviolability of that which has existed from time out of mind”. The eradication of patriarchy looks like a task of enormous complexity; when it is smashed, it will take a lot down with it. And so the patriarchs – from the bully in the White House to the bully in your workplace – are still in charge. For now.

There were more people who wanted to travel than places available. “There was a long queue, lots of people hustling and bustling to get tickets, offering to pay more – but my name was on the list,” said Gardner, now 92. When the passengers disembarked at Tilbury docks there were RAF officials waiting to welcome former servicemen, but Gardner and his brother, Gladstone, were not interested in returning to the air force and headed straight back to Leeds, where they had done some of their RAF training. Seventy years later, Gardner is still in Leeds, with his eight children, 16 grandchildren and 21 (he thinks) great-grandchildren all living nearby. He is happy with his decision to move to the UK. “I have absolutely no regrets about anything. If I could start over, I would do everything the same,” he said in an interview at his home, sitting with two of his daughters, one granddaughter and his newest great-granddaughter, just a few weeks old. But he acknowledged there had been difficult moments over the decades, as attitudes towards immigration shifted. News of the Windrush scandal over the past few weeks has been particularly disturbing. Although he knows none of those affected, Gardner said he was shocked to hear of Caribbean-born long-term UK residents being deported, detained, sacked from their jobs, made homeless and denied benefits or healthcare. “I was disgusted. I never thought such things would happen. It is a disgrace. To think of the hard work we put in to get things as they are in England today,” he said. A friend had warned him in the 1980s that he should be sure to get a passport because otherwise he risked being thrown out of the country, so he travelled to London to make an application. “If he hadn’t told me, this might have happened to me. It shouldn’t be happening at all,” Gardner said. “It’s definitely racism. They haven’t been throwing out Poles or any Europeans in that way. It’s not right. We worked so hard.” He will be at a service in Westminster Abbey commemorating the Windrush anniversary on Friday morning, and welcomes the opportunity to try to meet other surviving passengers, but he is very critical of the government’s actions over the passport scandal. “I want the government to sort it out. They’re all legal.” In his memory, the journey on the Empire Windrush was like a holiday. Many of the other passengers from Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados had also served in the RAF and were old friends. They slept in hammocks and on bunks on a lower deck, and did not much meet the other passengers. The ship stopped for a few days in Bermuda, where he encountered segregation for the first time. “That was the first time I saw a sign saying ‘no blacks’. In Jamaica nobody bothered, everybody mixed. But when we got to Bermuda we were trying to have a picnic. A man came to tell us you can’t sit there in that park. We told him what to do with himself,” he said. There were occasional flashes of hostility in the years after he returned to England. During his time training in Leeds with the RAF, he and other Jamaican servicemen had been welcomed, staying in a hostel to which they planned to return in 1948. But when they arrived back, attitudes had changed and they were told there was no room for them. Initially they had trouble finding somewhere to live. Gardner slept in a chair for a few nights before they found a room in a house that was let only to West Indians. The landlord knew “there was prejudice; he saw that there was some money to be made”. Finding work was initially hard because the clerk at the local labour exchange was very hostile. “I went to the labour exchange every day. The little old man would look up from his desk and say: sorry son, nothing for you. I heard that time and again. I’m sure he was racist.” One morning Gardner visited when there was an employer looking for workers. “I told him I was a motor mechanic. He said: can you strip an engine? I said that’s the least of of my worries – putting it back together, that’s the difficult bit.” Gardner was hired to help rebuild old Sherman tanks before they were sold to Shell in Kuwait. His new employer asked the labour exchange clerk why he hadn’t recommended Gardner or any of his Jamaican friends, all experienced motor mechanics. He got no reply. There were other memorable moments of discrimination. When Gardner was setting up a Caribbean cricket club, and had paid to hire equipment, the man in the sports hire shop decided not to give it to him. “Everything was arranged; it must have been racism. We didn’t get angry, we put our money together slowly and bought some more gear each week.” The Leeds Caribbean cricket club is still thriving. Gardner married a woman from Yorkshire in 1951. “I didn’t see eye to eye with her father, he didn’t like me at all, but he adored the grandchildren.” Everyone experienced some level of difficulty. “My brother was a very good cabinetmaker but he couldn’t get a job as a cabinetmaker here because he wasn’t in the union. He couldn’t get in the union because he didn’t have a job. So he had to get a factory job,” he said. “We didn’t have time to get angry. As long as we got a job, whatever job.” There were a few pubs in Leeds that did not welcome black customers in the 1950s and 1960s. “We just thought: ignore them, get away from it, find a place where you can enjoy yourself, then you can relax. If you know they don’t want you then why would you want to be there?” Gardner was always in work, occasionally coming up against obstructions but shrugging them off and pressing on. “I never said a word about it, I didn’t tell the kids about it, they knew there were nasty people around. I thought: treat everyone respectfully and you will be treated respectfully.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/21/marilyn-monroe-arthur-miller-movies","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T16:57:33Z","webTitle":"The never-ending story of Marilyn Monroe | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/21/marilyn-monroe-arthur-miller-movies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/21/marilyn-monroe-arthur-miller-movies","fields":{"headline":"The never-ending story of Marilyn Monroe","bodyText":"In her review of Arthur Miller’s play Finishing the Picture at the Finborough theatre (21 June), Miriam Gillinson says that the playwright could not get his former wife Marilyn Monroe out of his system.

Two 15-year-olds sit reading novels, while others kick footballs or play chase. One boy does some press-ups. The hum of conversation and flurry of movement contrasts with most other French secondary schools, where playgrounds can be eerily silent as pupils stare at their mobile phones. In La Gautrais, no one looks at Instagram, Snapchat or YouTube. Here mobile phones have been banned. Few seem to miss them. “I do have a phone, but I leave it at home and don’t really think about it much,” shrugged one 14-year-old girl in a denim jacket. “I don’t rush to check it after school. When I get home, first I’ll have a snack, I’ll chat to my mum, do some homework, then I might look at my phone. But only if I’m waiting for an important message.” Two of her friends don’t have mobile phones at all. “We don’t really need phones because we’re always chatting to each other in person, we chat the whole time – too much probably – and we’re really good friends,” one said. La Gautrais middle school in the village of Plouasne banned the use of mobile phone on its grounds four years ago, long before the French president, Emmanuel Macron, made an election promise to outlaw children’s phones in schools in an attempt to “detox” teenagers increasingly addicted to screens. From September, all nursery, primary and middle schools will ban mobile phone use. More than 90% of 12- to 17-year-olds are believed to own a mobile phone in France, and children were already banned from unauthorised use in class. But , as in the UK, it was left to headteachers to decide whether to limit phones in breaktime. La Gautrais’s 290 pupils between the ages of 12 and 16 come from surrounding villages in this farming area. Since the ban, staff have noticed more social interaction between children, more empathy and a readiness to learn at the start of lessons. There is less “switching-off anger” at having to move from breaktime gaming on smartphones to focusing in class. “No phone use at school gives pupils a moment’s peace from social networks and some children tell us they appreciate that,” said the headteacher, Yves Koziel. “On social networks there’s an acceleration and extreme simplification of group relationships which can create conflict, even bullying. We’re freeing them from that – at least during the day. We’re cutting the umbilical cord and offering some respite from it.” Koziel said he was pleased to see children returning to “ordinary things”, such as chatting, games and breaktime clubs and activities including dance and knitting. “I think children are more available for social interaction when they’re obliged to really speak to each other,” he said. Policing the ban has not been difficult. Pupils switch off phones and leave them in schoolbags and there are fewer than 10 confiscations a year. “At my previous schools, sometimes phones were in pencil cases and pupils were checking them or writing messages on phones on their laps,” Laura Floch, an English teacher, said. “Here, phones aren’t an issue.” In March, Floch took a group of 15-year-old pupils to London for a five-day trip, visiting sights including the British Museum and the Museum of London. The teenagers were not allowed to use their phones during the day or during excursions, except when asking to take photographs of sights, but they could use them in evening free time. She said: “They knew it was fair and they accepted it. But I could see other groups of children from France on similar trips at the same museums just sitting on benches and staring at their phones during the whole museum visit instead of taking part.” Sitting with his friends at breaktime, Anatole Desriac, who recently got his first mobile phone at the age of 15, said he approved of the ban. “When I’m with my friends I prefer a proper conversation,” he said. “If you’re all standing around with phones, you talk about what’s on the screen rather than really listening to each other.” He and his friends use their phones to listen to French rap on the long bus journey. At home, playing Fortnite on PlayStation was just as enticing as a phone, but all their parents limited screen use. “Knowing how to use phones in moderation is just part of life for us,” Christian-Steven Kitoko, 16, said. Desriac’s mother, Nicole Lefeuvre, a librarian, said: “Children and parents tend to agree that it’s a good thing not using phones at school. Parents of teenagers find it hard enough to be constantly negotiating screen time at home.” Her rules include no phones before the age of 15, no phones in bedrooms, no screens at all on Thursdays and school-holiday reading time for novels, comics or magazines. In the playground, many under-14s said their biggest worry was breaking their phones, smashing them or dropping them in water so they were happy to leave them at home for safety’s sake. One 16-year-old girl said she did not mind keeping her phone switched off on though she felt attached to it. “I have to know it’s there and I keep it in my jacket pocket, touching it regularly. I feel a bit lost without it.” In Bourges in central France, Jean-Claude Chevalier, the headteacher at Littré middle school, which has 600 pupils, introduced a ban on phone use at breaktimes this year because of what the playground had become. “Staff were surprised to see hundreds of children simultaneously glued to their phones during break – all sitting down staring at a screen and not talking,” he said. “It brought a loss of empathy, because children can use much stronger language on a screen than they would use face to face.” None of the fears about banning phones had materialised. “We thought there might be more playground violence and rowdiness but that wasn’t the case. Pupils talk more, the playground is livelier,” Chevalier said. “We thought we’d have to confiscate dozens of phones a day, in fact the number of confiscations has gone down. We thought the toilets would be monopolised by children sneaking a look at their phones, but that hasn’t happened at all. “What we have seen is that pupils seem less addicted to phones.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Do we know any Ross?” Well, of course we do, the lovable rogue! And of course London cannot change him … or can it? This was a slightly time-wasting episode, redeemed by some beautiful lighting and cinematography. It would have been greatly enhanced by a lot more insight into the home life of Sindy Doll and Dr Enys. Still, this is how it goes when you get into a series. Seeds are being sown and things have to be dragged out a little. We can’t be hyperventilating every Sunday night. The initial scenes depicting Ross’s absence were hilarious. Ah, the temptations amid the fire-eaters, elephant statues and pink-haired tarts of crazy Olde London Towne. “My dearest Demelza …” He’s at the House of Commons. He’s making a speech. If this were real life, I would definitely start watching BBC Parliament. “My dearest Ross …” Demelza is collecting apples. She’s visiting the mine. Oh dear, that is not going to keep her out of mischief. They didn’t spend Christmas together? But the anti-slavery debate rages on. And it must be linked to the industrial revolution. I know Cap’n Ross was only doing his best, but it didn’t really sound as if anyone was listening to him. Back at Trenwith, Cousin Verity was breathing some welcome fresh air into the place, although it wasn’t a patch on Aunt Agatha’s comic interventions, and I felt as if the wonderful Ruby Bentall (Verity) could have been given so much more to do here. Geoffrey Charles, wearing his best pudding bowl haircut, came home to a house full of pineapples. And Evil George made friends with a man with a frilly blouse, who said a lot of suggestive and inappropriate things to Elizabeth. Happy times for Evil George, meanwhile, who discovered that not only can you become an MP just by buying a constituency, but you can also buy extra MPs at the same time. “Very. Powerful. Indeed,” he gasped, in a Trumpian tweet. The birth of baby Sarah to the usurped Horace the pug, Sindy Doll and Dr Enys was too brief a scene, perhaps to spare viewers’ emotions as storm clouds gathered. Dr Enys knows something we don’t and he is not telling Sindy Doll either. Meningitis? Scarlet fever? Hydrocephalus? I couldn’t face Googling the possibilities, I’m afraid, ’Darkers, and I expect we will find out soon enough. (Please, no spoilers below if you have read the books.) It’s such a shame this is clearly going to take a dark turn, as I like Caroline’s entertaining pretence that she doesn’t want to be a mother, even though I am sure it is anachronistic. Surely an aristocratic woman during this time would never be able to talk about her baby being ugly, no matter how playfully. Ross’s work experience as an MP was cut short when they started to run out of whatever it is they mine at the mine, which – I can never work this out – is called a wheel or wheal. I could look it up but I have lost the will (wheel? wheal?) to live. He came back as soon as he could, rescued his late father’s favourite unintelligible, philandering pirate friend from being killed on the beach and bought everyone a round at the pub. But still it wasn’t enough to convince Zacky that Cap’n Ross hadn’t become Rees-Moggified. “Be ’e now too grand for the likes of we?” “Do you think me out of touch with my own mine?” (Yes! You don’t even know how to spell “wheel”.) However, Zacky slept on Ross’s cunning plan and immediately changed his mind for no reason whatsoever other than that it was a different scene. This was necessary so that it can all go horribly wrong next week and everything will collapse on someone’s head, just like it did on Francis back in the day. There was some shoehorning of Rebecca Front as Whitworth’s mother (more of this, please, otherwise what’s the point in casting her?), some brief toe-wiggling action from Morwenna’s sister, some pining from Drake and some business about Pascoe’s bank, which is where Ross keeps all his money. Otherwise, this was one long setup for some terrible things that will unfold next week. Still, at least Ross and Demelza got back together. And she got some earrings. “You don’t suspect an attachment there still.” “No more than you suspect my attachment to Hugh.” Oh, do put these ghosts and ideals behind you and have a tussle by the fire. That’s better now, isn’t it? Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor Geoffrey Charles (Louis Davison) stole quite a few scenes without actually having that much to do. It helped that he had one of the weirdest and most disturbing lines in series four: “My tutor was a noted flog-bottomist. But now I shall have my own fag.” I am still trying to pretend I didn’t hear this. If you are thinking (a) he doesn’t look like Charles and yet (b) he looks strangely familiar, then you would be right on both counts. Davison replaced Harry Marcus, who played the younger Charles in series three. And Davison is familiar because he is the son of Peter Davison, known in our house as the fifth doctor. We salute Davison for having to wear one of the worst haircuts in Poldark so far, worse even than Prudie’s. (An extra drop of laudanum for Doctor Who fans: David Tennant is Charles’s brother-in-law, as Davison’s half-sister Georgia Moffatt is married to the 10th doctor. Don’t say I don’t spoil you with these facts.) Classic Poldark lines “Your beauty is legendary.” “As is your reputation, sir.” Frilly Blouse Man (I) gets his claim in early. Why do I feel this isn’t the last we have seen of him and his frilly blouse? “When our elevation comes … it is our children who will benefit.” Yes, Evil George, which is why you are going to go absolutely batshit when you find out for certain that Valentine is not your child. (Am I right in thinking that Evil George has not actually managed to father any children yet?) “Yes, Horace, you must stay and guard Miss Sarah.” Has the pug cursed the baby with the mark of Horace? “I, on principle, always accept what ladies have to offer.” Oh Frilly Blouse Man (II), do take a cold shower. Regulation reverse-sexism bare chest moment Dr Enys took the bullet this week, bearing the brunt of the chest-baring in one manly swimming scene. Are those your favourite jodhpurs or are you just pleased to see us, Dwight? You could almost physically see Ross passing the baton with some relief. I hereby vote for Dr Enys to take over all chest-baring duties. Next week Trouble at the mine. Something terrible happens with Caroline, Dr Enys and the baby. Evil George feels he is still one step ahead. And the pig’s-tail-buttocked vicar attempts to have Morwenna committed so that he can suck her sister’s toes whenever he wants.

A former history teacher, Keith advocated imaginative, pupil-centred teaching and learning, and under his leadership Rotherham schools had a good reputation. Since these were the schools in which his own children and those of his colleagues were educated, he would ask the question: “Why wouldn’t they be good schools?” Keith was also a leader in education in the wider Yorkshire and Humberside region. He sat on the boards of the former GCE and CSE examining bodies for the northern region, and nationally was an adviser to the Association of Metropolitan Authorities (later part of the Local Government Association). Keith came from a working-class home in a pit village. He was born in Featherstone, West Yorkshire, the son of Dorothy (nee Davis) and Lewis, both of whom worked at the colliery, his mother as a coal washer, his father a wagon shunter. His education was disrupted by illness and he left school at 14, working first as a scarecrow chasing birds off a local farmer’s fields, then serving a joinery apprenticeship. He joined the Labour party and became chair of the local Labour League of Youth. There he met his future wife, Bernice Glover, and together they attended Workers’ Educational Association classes in Leeds. Encouraged by one of the lecturers, Patrick Duffy (later a Labour MP and minister), and supported by his trade union and by Bernice, Keith went to Ruskin College, Oxford, and then read philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford. After graduating, he qualified as a teacher at the University of Leeds, taught history at Wakefield Cathedral school and then joined the education service at Wakefield prison. Wakefield council then appointed him as an education officer. In 1970, Keith moved to Rotherham as deputy director, then director of education of Rotherham metropolitan borough council. Keith never forgot his roots, and through his ingenuity the children of Rotherham’s mining villages were fed during the school holidays of the 1984-85 miners’ strike. After retiring as director, Keith was asked to help the Hesley group of schools for pupils with special educational needs for a period. This temporary position continued in various capacities for almost 20 years until Keith gave up work at the age of 82. He remained involved in education in Rotherham, as a school governor and as a member of the corporation of the local college. He had many interests, particularly sport, staying loyal to the teams he had supported since boyhood – Yorkshire Cricket Club, Wakefield Trinity rugby league club and Leeds United. Above all was his love of and support for his family. Keith and Bernice were married for 65 years. She survives him, along with their sons, Matthew and Martin, and grandchildren, Josh, Jake, Cara and Ben."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/23/david-byrne-american-utopia-tour-hammersmith-apollo-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-23T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"David Byrne review – still making sense","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/23/david-byrne-american-utopia-tour-hammersmith-apollo-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/23/david-byrne-american-utopia-tour-hammersmith-apollo-review","fields":{"headline":"David Byrne review – still making sense","bodyText":"One strand of western thought still assumes that the mind and the body are distinct. To generalise, dance music is for bodies while art rock, say, titillates the mind. David Byrne begins each night on the highly unorthodox tour for his most recent album, American Utopia, seated at a table stroking a brain – like a memento mori, only pinker. It is the only splash of colour on a grey, bare stage, encircled by shimmering beaded curtains. So far, so cerebral: the song is Here, from the new album, and its lyrics describe sections of the cerebellum. Byrne was, of course, once the frontman of a band called Talking Heads (and not, say, Grinding Hips), whose anxious, querying post-punk appealed to lateral thinkers. In the magnificent 2017 film, 20th Century Women, set in 1979, the band are referred to as “art fags”. Another film – the 1984 documentary, Stop Making Sense, about Talking Heads’ concept-heavy Speaking in Tongues tour – set an artistic benchmark so high few other films about music have ever come close. This tour is an artistic endeavour not far off Stop Making Sense’s high-water mark. Byrne’s youthful air of surprise has given way in recent years to a more professorial demeanour, to which he has recently added a foppish Andy Warhol haircut. But one of the secrets of Byrne’s early success, mid-period extemporisations and absolute continued relevance is his devotion to rhythm. Byrne explained his choice of Stop Making Sense’s outsized suit to an interviewer at the time as a device to make his head appear smaller. “Because music is very physical, and often the body understands it before the head.” This unprecedented, exquisite live show finds a 12-strong band in near-constant motion, with percussion to the fore: at several points, half a dozen musicians are playing bits of drum kits hanging off harnesses they are wearing, a cross between an American high school marching band and a Brazilian carnival procession. (The harnesses are so discreet, the keyboard player’s instrument appears to hover in mid-air.) Everyone is in (normal-sized) grey Kenzo suits and barefoot; by the end, backing vocalist Chris Giarmo’s jacket is entirely black at the back, and Byrne’s own back is piebald with sweat. There are moments where Byrne gnomically ruches up his trouser leg to reveal an ankle, or rolls up his jacket sleeve to reveal an inner elbow. At the end of a lot of songs, he hoicks up his trousers – since the tour began, you can imagine Byrne has shed the odd pound. Pop is no stranger to troupe dancing, but working musicians don’t normally move this perfectly, rearranging themselves like psychic starlings into clumps or lines, posing, vogue-ing, proceeding backwards in circles; choreographer Annie-B Parson is the architect of these manoeuvres. You can see the link to a previous Byrne outing – 2015’s US-only Contemporary Colour shows, since released as a film – which found Byrne reinterpreting the US sports pastime known as “colour guard”, where flag-spinners join marching bands for half-time performances. This set, by contrast, is all grey and minimal and yet somehow just as kaleidoscopic. A huge swath of songs – Talking Heads songs, Byrne solo outings drawn from various periods, covers, collaborations – have all been subtly rescored to fit a show heavy on funk, fun, drama, shadowplay and a sprinkling of overt politics. Between two recent songs – Dog’s Mind and Everybody’s Coming to My House – Byrne encourages everyone to vote “in every election they possibly can”. The second encore finds the band covering Janelle Monáe’s 2015 anthem Hell You Talmbout, which lists the names of young African Americans killed by law enforcement or other violent confrontations. The old Talking Heads favourites are pure pleasure, spanning moods as diverse as I Zimbra, This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody) and a frankly magnificent version of Once in a Lifetime, which Byrne announces by staggering around, spotlit, quoting his own former movements. Although released through Todo Mundo and Nonesuch, Byrne’s US labels, American Utopia was an album shaped in association with creatives at London XL Recordings subsidiary Young Turks, in which a phalanx of obscure electronic producers were drafted in to create novel soundscapes. I Dance Like This was probably the most jarring of these, with a chorus veering towards the industrial. Live, it becomes one of the night’s unexpected highlights, more heavy metal than machine music. “I dance like this,” it goes, “because it feels so damn good/If I could dance better, well you know that I would.” Byrne and his troupe of musicians dance magnificently. You could say the also pretty much resolve the whole Cartesian mind/body split in the process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/21/times-article-comparing-mike-ashley-to-kim-jong-un-was-fair-ipso-rules-press","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T16:10:09Z","webTitle":"Times article comparing Mike Ashley to Kim Jong-un was fair, Ipso rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/21/times-article-comparing-mike-ashley-to-kim-jong-un-was-fair-ipso-rules-press","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/21/times-article-comparing-mike-ashley-to-kim-jong-un-was-fair-ipso-rules-press","fields":{"headline":"Times article comparing Mike Ashley to Kim Jong-un was fair, Ipso rules","bodyText":"Mike Ashley, the boss of Sports Direct, can be legitimately compared to the despotic North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, the British press regulator has ruled. The sportswear tycoon had complained to the press regulator Ipso after an article in the Times suggested he shared many characteristics with the supreme leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Ashley, who has faced years of criticism over working conditions at his business after the Guardian went undercover at Sports Direct’s main warehouse, argued the comparison was unfair because he was not “responsible for extensive humanitarian crimes, and for extreme social and political suppression”. The accusations were made in a comment piece that appeared in the Times business section in September 2017. The article included suggestions that Ashley was a “supreme leader”, that he was “in charge of what many regard as a rogue institution”, that his “inner circle is packed with family members and toadies”, that he “routinely flouts the norms of good behaviour and sticks two fingers up at his critics”, and that he was a “relative lightweight, but has run circles around his much more powerful enemies”. The article went on to state: “Apart from that, and a common rotundity, there is no similarity between Mike Ashley and Kim Jong-un.” The Times argued these observations were fair comment with “adequate factual basis”. Sports Direct made a legal complaint to the newspaper in October before following it up with a complaint to Ipso earlier this year. Following an investigation Ipso concluded it was “clearly a polemical comparison” which was a “matter of comment and interpretation” and the Times had been able to show it was made “on an adequate factual basis”. “The article did not suggest that the complainant and Kim Jong-un were directly equivalent, deserving of similar moral condemnation,” said Ipso. “The newspaper was able to show that the comment had been based on an adequate factual basis, and there was no failure to take care not to publish inaccurate or misleading information in making the comparison.” Ipso did, however, conclude that the Times had included a significant inaccuracy in the article with its claim that Sports Direct’s Shirebrook warehouse was “found by parliament” to have been run like “Victorian warehouse” and that it had “gulag conditions”.

A major report into deaths at the Hampshire hospital in the 1990s found on Wednesday that 456 patients had died after being prescribed opioid drugs which they did not need, such as diamorphine, by the now-retired GP Jane Barton. A panel of experts, led by the former bishop of Liverpool James Jones, said there was an institutional practice of using life-shortening drugs and that consultants were aware of what Barton was doing, while nurses gave the drugs and the pharmacist dispensed them. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, apologised to the families in the House of Commons and later said that hundreds of lives could have been saved if whistleblowers had been encouraged come forward. The families say they want to see those responsible prosecuted, and Hunt said the Crown Prosecution Service and police should look at the report. However, Peter Walsh, the chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents (AvMA), which helped some of the families get inquests for their relatives in 2009, said it may be difficult to bring criminal charges. “Gross negligence manslaughter is still an option, but every time they have looked at it so far, the police and CPS have said there isn’t enough evidence.” People, however, could be held to account for how the situation was handled, he said. “Senior people all the way through to ministers knew that the families were right and yet they continued to pooh-pooh them and suppress information. “I think that the families and wider public will only have confidence if some people are seen to be held to account for the failure to act and for keeping a lid on this and what people have described as a cover-up.” Suzanne White, the head of clinical negligence at Leigh Day, said the law firm would be “watching carefully” as the CPS considered the evidence, but the civil courts might be an alternative option for the families. “Other legal avenues open to the families include challenging the decision not to have an inquest into the death of a loved one,” she said. “The fact that out of the hundreds of deaths at the Gosport War Memorial hospital there appears to have only been 11 inquests is shocking. “Families may also look to the civil courts to bring a claim against the hospital under the Human Rights Act. In this way they can also seek to uncover the truth about how a loved one died … If the CPS decide that they aren’t bringing criminal charges then the decision could be challenged, as could the actions of the police in the scandal.” Prof Sir Brian Jarman, the head of the Dr Foster unit at Imperial College London, said similar situations were probably happening elsewhere. However, Dr Eileen Burns, the president of the British Geriatrics Society, said the culture within the NHS had changed. “It’s obviously difficult to categorically say this could never ever happen anywhere, but I think there are lots of reasons why we can be reasonably optimistic that it is not likely to be happening currently. Culturally, things have moved on quite a long way.” Burns said the unquestioning authority of doctors had significantly diminished and they now worked in teams with nurses and other specialists. A nurse would not be afraid to make suggestions to a doctor about the level of pain relief a patient needed. Staff were expected to contribute anonymously to any doctor’s annual appraisal, where they could raise concerns, she said, and hospitals had regular reviews of all patient deaths to see whether anything could have been done better. Burns said the deaths at Gosport were terrible but she feared the fallout might cause the pendulum to swing too far away from the use of pain-relieving drugs at the end of life when they were needed. “We need to be very careful we get the balance right,” she said. “We need to treat every single person as an individual as much as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/21/stephen-coxen-sued-over-rape-damages-st-andrews-university","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T16:55:03Z","webTitle":"Man being sued for damages denies raping St Andrews student","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/21/stephen-coxen-sued-over-rape-damages-st-andrews-university","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/21/stephen-coxen-sued-over-rape-damages-st-andrews-university","fields":{"headline":"Man being sued for damages denies raping St Andrews student","bodyText":"A man has again denied raping a St Andrews University student who was too drunk to resist, in a rare civil action that follows his acquittal at a criminal trial. Stephen Coxen, 23, from Bury, Lancashire, is being sued by the woman, known as M, for nearly £100,000 in damages for raping her and injuring her tongue. He was acquitted of rape at a high court trial in December 2015, after the jury found the case against him not proven, a Scottish criminal verdict that stops short of finding the accused not guilty but leaves him innocent in law. Coxen told Edinburgh sheriff court the woman began kissing him without warning at a nightclub during freshers’ week at St Andrews in 2013. Thursday’s hearing was suspended abruptly after M left the court in distress during Coxen’s account of the evening, while four unidentified members of the public were sitting in court. Proceedings resumed nearly 20 minutes later and the court was closed to the public. Shortly before M left, Coxen had told his advocate, Stephen O’Rourke QC, he believed she had begun bleeding while they were having sex because it was her period.“I got quite distressed and I left her property quite quickly,” Coxen said, adding that his reaction was “immature, stupid” and was because he felt “grossed out” by it. Asked by O’Rourke what he now thought of his reaction, Coxen said: “I would apologise for that. [It was] very rude.” M said the blood was the result of rape, and that Coxen injured her tongue by forcing her to give oral sex while holding her head. Janusz Knepil, a toxicology expert, told the court that the amount of alcohol M had consumed left her with “a very, very high possibility of unconsciousness”. Coxen told the court that M had approached him in the Lizard Lounge nightclub, and the pair had been very affectionate towards each other. “We were passionately kissing,” he said. “She seemed like she was enjoying herself.” Under cross-examination by M’s counsel, Simon Di Rollo QC, Coxen said he had no recollection of how much he had drunk that evening. Challenged on his evidence given at trial that he was not very drunk, Coxen said that may have been the case. Di Rollo pressed Coxen on three key parts of his defence case, which Di Rollo said were disputed by the evidence and other witnesses. Coxen’s claim to have taken M’s mobile phone because she had no pockets in her jeans was a lie, Di Rollo said. Her jeans did have pockets and she also had a handbag with her. Coxen said he was unable to remember what he had told an old schoolfriend, Dominic Hurst, who was studying maths at St Andrews and whom he was visiting, about the events that night. Coxen agreed on Thursday that he admitted to Hurst the night had ended badly only after Hurst had been questioned by police in Scotland in early 2014, which led to the two men exchanging text messages. Coxen was also wrong to claim the gate to M’s flat was opened by another woman, Di Rollo said. Both her flatmates testified on oath that they did not, and there was no trace on M’s mobile phone of any calls he says she made to get her flatmates to open the gate. Di Rollo told the court Coxen had exercised his right to silence when he was questioned by police in 2014 about what he did at the gate. M alleges she was so drunk she dropped her phone, and that he took it. Di Rollo asked him whether that was a sign she was too drunk to consent to sex. Coxen replied: “I’m not sure whether one is equal to the other.” Coxen also confirmed he had been thrown out of the nightclub by three bouncers after an altercation with several other guests, who had accused Coxen and M of bumping into them. Di Rollo asked Coxen whether he believed M was lying to everyone about being forced to give oral sex, including to her family, her friends, her doctors, the police and the courts. “Yes,” Coxen replied. The case is due to end on Friday, with the judge, Sheriff Robert Weir QC, expected to give his decision at a later date."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/21/pamplona-court-to-release-sexual-abuse-gang-on-bail","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T17:22:21Z","webTitle":"Pamplona court to release sexual abuse gang on bail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/pamplona-court-to-release-sexual-abuse-gang-on-bail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/21/pamplona-court-to-release-sexual-abuse-gang-on-bail","fields":{"headline":"Pamplona court to release sexual abuse gang on bail","bodyText":"The five men jailed for sexually abusing an 18-year-old woman at the running of the bulls festival in Pamplona two years ago are to be released on bail of €6,000, according to reports. The case, known as the “wolf pack” trial because of the name the men used in their WhatsApp group, caused a national outcry after the defendants were sentenced to nine years in prison for sexual abuse, but acquitted of rape. The verdict, delivered at the end of April, led to protests across Spain and prompted the then government to announce a review of sexual offences legislation to establish whether such crimes were adequately defined and categorised. José Ángel Prenda, Alfonso Cabezuelo, Antonio Manuel Guerrero, Jesús Escudero and Ángel Boza were sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment, five years’ probation and ordered to pay €10,000 each to the woman. Guerrero, a Guardia Civil police officer, was fined €900 for stealing her phone after the attack. On Thursday the Spanish news agency Europa Press reported that the provincial court in Pamplona had ruled that the men, who have been in custody since July 2016, could be released on bail while a higher court studied the original sentence. It apparently ordered them to surrender their passports and report to court three times a week, and banned them from entering the Madrid region, where the victim lives, and from attempting to contact her. Both prosecutors and defence lawyers are protesting against the nine-year sentences. Under Spanish law, those convicted of a crime cannot usually be held for more than two years if a final sentence has not been handed down. The men were found guilty of the “continuous sexual abuse” of the woman in the lobby of a building in the early hours of 7 July 2016. Under Spanish law, sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. One of the judges argued that the men should have been cleared of all charges except the phone theft. The case was widely seen as a cross-examination of the 18-year-old woman rather than the men who attacked her. The proceedings were criticised after the judges accepted into evidence a report compiled by a private detective hired by some of the defendants. The detective had followed the woman over several days and produced photographs of her smiling with friends. This was used to suggest she had not suffered any lasting trauma, prompting hundreds of women to demonstrate outside court holding signs reading: “We believe you, sister.” Defence lawyers claimed the woman had consented and had let one of the men kiss her. They also said that 96 seconds of video footage from the men’s phones – showing the woman immobile and with her eyes shut during the attack – constituted proof of consent. The prosecution said the victim had been too terrified to move. “The defendants want us to believe that on that night they met an 18-year-old girl, living a normal life, who, after 20 minutes of conversation with people she didn’t know, agreed to group sex involving every type of penetration, sometimes simultaneously, without using a condom,” the prosecutor Elena Sarasate said. The verdict was criticised by many senior politicians, including Pedro Sánchez, the leader of Spain’s socialist party who recently became the prime minister. “She said NO,” he wrote on Twitter at the time. “We believe you and we’ll keep believing you. If what the ‘wolfpack’ did wasn’t group violence against a defenceless woman, then what do we understand by rape?” News of the men’s release prompted women’s groups to call protests in cities including Pamplona, Madrid, Zaragoza, San Sebastián and Barcelona on Thursday and Friday. Laura Berro, the equality and LGBTI councillor at Pamplona’s city council, said the court’s latest verdict was proof of the patriarchal nature of justice. “It’s shocking,” she tweeted. “But we will not shut up or be paralysed.” Reuters contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/24/fly-by-night-lift-notes-from-the-field-an-octoroon-phobiarama-theatre-reviews-susannah-clapp","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"The week in theatre: Fly By Night; Notes from the Field; An Octoroon; Phobiarama – reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/24/fly-by-night-lift-notes-from-the-field-an-octoroon-phobiarama-theatre-reviews-susannah-clapp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/24/fly-by-night-lift-notes-from-the-field-an-octoroon-phobiarama-theatre-reviews-susannah-clapp","fields":{"headline":"The week in theatre: Fly By Night; Notes from the Field; An Octoroon; Phobiarama – reviews","bodyText":"High above Thamesmead there are new feathery constellations. Constellations that move. They soar like sparks from a fire, scatter like glitter confetti, but they have propulsion. Like fireworks, they make patterns – spirals and crescents and chevrons – but they keep going, fanning out into new shapes, taking off into different regions of the sky. They are pigeons. More than 1,500 of them, sent up with LED lights attached to their feet; trained by the American artist Duke Riley. Riley, a long-time pigeon fancier who has also specialised in scrimshaw, graffiti, tattoos and mosaics, first produced Fly By Night on the Brooklyn waterfront, choreographing the birds with flags and whistles. The show was also an act of recovery: Riley was aware that pigeon coops were vanishing from New York roofs, where they had been commonplace. The London show also has a history – and a heart. These pigeons are flying over the former site of the Royal Arsenal. During the first world war while the arsenal manufactured new weapons, carrier pigeons were used in battlefield communication, taken to the trenches in wicker baskets. The coops used in Fly By Night are modelled on those used in that war. The effect of these silver soarings is extraordinary, even without the backstory. A creature often batted aside as a shit-dropping nuisance becomes beloved: any rebel leaving the flock and perching near the audience is welcomed enthusiastically. The plumed ballet makes people look up – which Londoners do rarely – and see new things in the sky. It makes them, looking down, see their city in a new perspective. Riley is not the only artist doing pigeon-work. In this country, Nathaniel Mann, composer in residence at the Pitt Rivers Museum, has been making pigeon-whistle symphonies. Let’s hope we hear more of them. Fly By Night is part of LIFT, a festival that lives up to its name. Its adventurousness is theatrical yeast. Nearly 20 years ago it gave me my first real taste for work that, coming from all corners of the world, often flew off the conventional stage: angels flitting through a disused telecom tower; a bunch of Australian men hanging out in the window of a Clapham department store. It is also often politically incisive. There will be few more forceful pieces about the condition of America than Notes from the Field. Anna Deavere Smith, of West Wing, has based her urgently delivered words on some 200 interviews she conducted in four areas of the country. Together they are an indictment of the way criminalisation and incarceration works in the States. Against anyone who is not white. On a bare stage sometimes backed with video footage, sometimes accompanied by Marcus Shelby on double bass, Deavere Smith populates the stage with witnesses, victims, penal experts. She is a schoolgirl who sees a classmate thrown to the floor by a cop for using her mobile phone. She is a preacher with cartwheeling hands and a bell-like voice who draws on her “sanctified imagination” to rouse her congregation (us) at the funeral of a boy whose spine was severed while under arrest. She is a woman with no climbing experience who shins up a flagpole to take down the Confederate flag. And a fisherman, a Native American – four times more likely to be imprisoned than a white man – struggling with anger in giant orange waders. As in her Twilight: Los Angeles, staged last year at the Gate, the power depends on a ventriloquial gift – but also on a modesty that stops audiences merely marvelling at the performance, and lets them hear the anecdotes as if delivered by the source. This testimony is strong, but Deavere Smith goes beyond this, to argue about the channelling of children from money-starved schools to better-funded prisons. Investment, she declares is policy. Policy that has left the States bubbling with violence. “This is not an African-American problem. It is an American problem.” There’s a different attack on preconception and prejudice in An Octoroon. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ drama, transferring from the hit-spinning Orange Tree, belongs to the age of the meta-play – to the epoch of, among others, Ella Hickson’s The Writer. Ingenious, self-aware, ebullient, taunting. Ned Bennett’s production both stages and spoofs Dion Boucicault’s 1859 melodrama about a plantation owner who falls for “the Octoroon”, a woman who is one-eighth black. At the centre is versatile Ken Nwosu. Having introduced himself as “a black playwright”, he whites up to play both hero and (with a change of hat) villain: obliged to fight himself, he does so nimbly. The title is ripe for ridicule (which eighth?) and Jacobs-Jenkins bashes up every stereotype: giggling fortune-hunter, Native American. At one point, as part of this general dismantling, the stage itself gets taken to pieces. With conventions cleverly and playfully ruffled, when a tap-dancing rabbit in plus fours appears, she looks like the most naturalistic character on stage. Every now and then LIFT just takes you for a ride. As in Phobiarama. The Dutch theatre-maker Dries Verhoeven has mashed together miscellaneous fears in a pop-up hut through which the audience loop in dodgem cars. Darkness; snaggle-toothed bears; clowns. Brexit; terrorism; very big blokes. A fact sheet talks of “unbalancing the visitor”, of “shared vulnerability”, of exploring threat “on a neurological level”. Never trust a show that needs to explain itself.

Jason Kessler, who was behind the “Unite the Right” rally in August 2017 where white nationalists held a torchlight rally, clashed with protesters and caused a political furore when Donald Trump blamed “both sides” for the violence, filed an application with the National Park Service (NPS) to hold a “white civil rights rally” outside the White House. Kessler had received initial approval from the NPS to hold the rally on Saturday 11 August and Sunday 12 August, the Washington Post reported. The weekend marks the anniversary of the Unite the the Right rally in Charlottesville, where Heather Heyer was killed when James Alex Fields Jr, a self-described Nazi, drove his car into a crowd of protesters. In Kessler’s application for a 2018 rally permit he said the purpose of the event was: “Protesting civil rights abuse in Charlottesville, VA/white civil rights rally.” He asked for permission to hold a rally at Lafayette Park, located in front of the White House, for 400 people. In a section of the form asking if the applicant believed anyone might “seek to disrupt the activity”, Kessler wrote: “Members of antifa affiliated groups will try to disrupt.” The NPS told the WUSA-9 news channel it had approved Kessler’s application, but was yet to issue a formal permit. Last year’s Unite the Right was nominally intended to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee from Charlottesville’s Emancipation Park. The event saw neo-Nazis and white supremacists march through the city holding torches and chanting “Jews will not replace us”, and the next day waving Confederate and Nazi flags and wearing far-right regalia at a demonstration in Emancipation Park."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/21/opportunity-knocks-for-australia-at-world-cup-but-they-fail-to-open-door","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"Opportunity knocks for Australia at World Cup but they fail to open door | Kieran Pender","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/21/opportunity-knocks-for-australia-at-world-cup-but-they-fail-to-open-door","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/21/opportunity-knocks-for-australia-at-world-cup-but-they-fail-to-open-door","fields":{"headline":"Opportunity knocks for Australia at World Cup but they fail to open door","bodyText":"It was Australia’s first point at a World Cup since 2010 but it could have been so much more. A draw with Denmark has left the country on the brink of yet another group stage exit. Unless the Socceroos beat Peru on Tuesday, and other results are favourable, Australia’s Russia campaign will end in the same manner as their escapades in South Africa and Brazil. Samara is famous as a hub for Russian space efforts, and Denmark began with rocket-like propulsion. Australia’s defensive line was cut apart by Christian Eriksen and Nicolai Jørgensen, with the duo combining to lethal effect for Eriksen’s seventh-minute opener. But the Socceroos came back into the game – helped by a VAR-determined Mile Jedinak penalty – and soon looked the better team. Despite a 24-team gulf between them in the Fifa rankings, Australia dominated the second half and should have secured victory. “The conclusion is: we have one point and we deserve four points from these two games,” the manager, Bert van Marwijk, said. “We had chances to win and we deserved to win.” After his team’s loss to France, Van Marwijk complained about a lack of creativity. Australia showed much improvement in this department, with the mercurial midfielder Tom Rogic enjoying one of his best matches in a Socceroos shirt in recent memory. “They created against Denmark so many chances,” the manager observed. “I must be satisfied about the way we played, the creation of chances.” This time, it was the finishing that let Australia down. “The only thing we have to do is put the ball in the goal,” Van Marwijk quipped. His team had 14 attempts on goal to Denmark’s 10, five on target for each side. Andrew Nabbout was energetic but lacked precision, the substitute Tomi Juric was anonymous. Tim Cahill remained conspicuously glued to the bench, despite the pleas of pundits back home, while Daniel Arzani’s late sparks of brilliance could not ignite the Socceroos. It feels as if opportunity knocked for Australia but they did not open the door. Van Marwijk was hired as a pragmatic, result-oriented replacement for Ange Postecoglou, who once said he would never be happy with three points achieved via dour football. But just as Postecoglou was unable to navigate the Socceroos beyond the group stage in Brazil or at the 2017 Confederations Cup, nor does it look likely that Van Marwijk’s alternative style will fare any better. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Indeed, the similarities to last year’s campaign in Russia are beginning to induce deja vu. On both occasions a narrow opening loss has been followed by a promising but ultimately insufficient performance, a draw where three points were sorely needed. If the Socceroos stay true to history, they will shine against Peru and a win will elude them again. But hope springs eternal among the 15,000 Australia fans reported to be in Russia. While progress to the knockout stage remains a mathematical possibility, Australia’s boisterous and beer-soaked fans will continue to sing. Van Marwijk’s preference for stability was underlined on Thursday with an unchanged lineup and identical substitutions, despite the different context into which Arzani, Juric and Jackson Irvine were introduced this time. But a World Cup-ending shoulder injury to Nabbout and another poor showing from Robbie Kruse will force the Dutchman’s hand. A running trope of Van Marwijk’s press conferences has been his pointed refusal to engage in any discussion of selection or tactics. Asked whether three matches in 10 days will necessitate further change, he again gave nothing away: “This team is fit.” Australia will return to their nearby base in Kazan, before they fly to Sochi’s Black Sea beaches for the showdown with Peru on Tuesday. It will take good fortune, both at the Fisht Stadium and in Moscow (where France meet Denmark), for the Socceroos to qualify for the next round. Australian fans could leave Russia feeling hard done by: so far two impressive performances have been left unrewarded by the footballing gods. The Denmark manager, Åge Hareide, mused after the stalemate “the World Cup is tough”. The Socceroos are all too aware."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/21/big-stars-little-interest-when-movie-heavyweights-fizzle-on-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-21T15:36:17Z","webTitle":"Big stars, little interest: when movie heavyweights fizzle on TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/21/big-stars-little-interest-when-movie-heavyweights-fizzle-on-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/21/big-stars-little-interest-when-movie-heavyweights-fizzle-on-tv","fields":{"headline":"Big stars, little interest: when movie heavyweights fizzle on TV","bodyText":"It’s too early to tell whether Paramount Network’s new Yellowstone series will be a hit, but reviews haven’t exactly been kind so far. The New Yorker called it “ponderous” and “preposterous”. The Hollywood Reporter called it “a big sprawling mess”. The Guardian gave it two stars. Which would normally be nothing to worry about, except for one thing. Yellowstone marks the big television debut of Kevin Costner, and you just know he expected more from it. When film stars cross over to television, they’re supposed to be unmitigated successes. Look at Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman in Big Little Lies. Look at Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in True Detective. Anthony Hopkins in Westworld. Ewan McGregor in Fargo. Viola Davis in How to Get Away with Murder. Kevin Costner has won Oscars for acting and directing. He was once the biggest movie star in the world. You suspect that he wanted Yellowstone to be more adored than it actually is. But it’s fine. Not all film-to-TV transitions work out as they should. Here are some of Costner’s contemporaries who’ve similarly struggled to find success on the small screen. Naomi Watts, Gypsy (one season, 2017) It wasn’t just that Gypsy was cancelled. It was that Netflix cancelled it in such an almighty hurry, just six weeks after it debuted. Some would argue that the cancellation came seven weeks too soon. A sexy thriller that lacked all trace of sexy thrillingness, Gypsy was as preposterous as it was boring. The whole thing was a tragic waste of Naomi Watts, especially given her career-best performance over on Twin Peaks: The Return that same year. Vince Vaughn, True Detective 2 (one season, 2015) Every actor in Hollywood saw what True Detective did for the careers of Harrelson and McConaughey, but Vince Vaughn was the one unlucky enough to actually get cast in its sequel. The second season was a profound disappointment, baffling and rushed and unfocused, and Vaughn came off worse than anyone. What could have been a defining moment in his career became a brand new low, thanks in part to the ridiculous monologue he delivered to a stain in the second episode. Robin Williams, The Crazy Ones (one season, 2013) This could have been so great. Created by David E Kelly, The Crazy Ones was set to be Robin Williams’ big return to TV comedy after a three-decade absence. But something about it just didn’t work. The single-camera set-up and lack of studio audience left Williams projecting into a void, which gave the show a feeling of unintentional spookiness, and viewers fled in their millions. An upsetting way for such a spectacular career to end. Billy Crystal, The Comedians (one season, 2015) If you never got the feeling that Billy Crystal loved Curb Your Enthusiasm, then this series was solid gold proof. In the FX show The Comedians, Billy Crystal played Billy Crystal pitching a show to FX, specifically to a character transparently based on FX’s real boss. If it had actually been funny, then Crystal might have just pulled off such a masturbatory premise. But it wasn’t, so he didn’t. Jennifer Lopez, Shades of Blue (three seasons, 2016) Quick hands up: who knew there was a Jennifer Lopez cop show on TV? And who knew Ray Liotta was in it? That’s right, nobody. Shades of Blue is one of those weird network procedurals that appears to have been churned out overnight by a machine. Nothing is ever really that gripping. No boundaries are ever really pushed. It’s not clever or funny or sexy or good. And ratings have dropped off a cliff to such an extent that this year’s season has already been called its last. It will die unmourned by all. Woody Allen, Crisis in Six Scenes (one season, 2016) And now to the very worst film-to-TV transition in all of history. It wasn’t that Amazon’s Crisis in Six Scenes gave us an imperfect version of Woody Allen, because Woody Allen has already been giving us an imperfect version of Woody Allen for the last 25 years. No, it was that Crisis in Six Scenes was such a precipitous drop-off in quality – badly written, badly shot, badly paced, badly acted – that it made you long for dreck like Cassandra’s Dream, because at least that had the good grace to be relatively short. After he’d signed up to make it, Allen said: “It was a catastrophic mistake. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m floundering. I expect this to be a cosmic embarrassment.” At least he was right about that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/21/roland-rudd-driver-questioned-insider-dealing-finsbury","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-22T11:50:21Z","webTitle":"Roland Rudd's driver questioned in insider dealing inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/21/roland-rudd-driver-questioned-insider-dealing-finsbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/21/roland-rudd-driver-questioned-insider-dealing-finsbury","fields":{"headline":"Roland Rudd's driver questioned in insider dealing inquiry","bodyText":"A chauffeur who works for the City PR heavyweight Roland Rudd was questioned by financial regulators as part of an investigation into insider dealing, it has emerged. The driver is understood to have been interviewed about eight months ago with the full cooperation of Rudd’s PR firm, Finsbury, whose staff have since been informed. Senior executives were later questioned about his role. In an internal memo, Finsbury’s managing director, James Murgatroyd, wrote: “I want to let you know that Roland’s driver has been interviewed by the Financial Conduct Authority in relation to a share-dealing investigation. “He has not been charged with any wrongdoing, and there is no suggestion that he dealt or profited personally. Finsbury is cooperating fully with the FCA’s investigation. “You know how seriously we take our adherence to the highest standards of ethics and governance – this is paramount for our clients’ trust in highly important and sensitive situations. It is everyone’s personal responsibility to uphold these standards. “You will understand that legally we cannot make any other comments at this stage. You may confirm to clients what’s in this note and make clear that this is an isolated event.” The interview with the chauffeur, first reported in the London Evening Standard, is understood to be part of a wider inquiry into insider dealing in the City. There is no suggestion that the driver or Rudd have done anything wrong. Rudd, brother of the former home secretary Amber Rudd, is one of the most influential power brokers in the City. His firm provides public relations advice and crisis management communications to some of Britain’s biggest companies and often works on multibillion pound takeovers. More recently, Finsbury has advised the board of its own parent company, WPP, on the fallout from an investigation into the conduct of the advertising company’s founder, Sir Martin Sorrell, who resigned in April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2018/jun/24/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-run","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-24T08:00:21Z","webTitle":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'run'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2018/jun/24/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-run","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2018/jun/24/your-pictures-share-your-photos-on-the-theme-of-run","fields":{"headline":"Your pictures: share your photos on the theme of 'run'","bodyText":"The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘run.’ Share your photos of what run means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.

The homespun wizardry of the haberdashery department bewitches me like a grownup’s Diagon Alley. And when my children were little, I found the no-nonsense advice and cheery colours of the nursery department profoundly comforting. But even those of us who love department stores have to admit that it is, at this point, a sepia-tinted and nostalgic kind of affection. The decline of the department store is in direct proportion to the rise of the brand. The allegiance of the modern shopper is to their favourite brand – with which they may have a “relationship” on Instagram or via pop-up shops – not to a permanent physical space. Department stores were once proud of their independence in selling 40 brands of soap and 12 styles of notebook. But this stout even-handedness is in danger of making them appear less glamorous than branded boutiques. It is not a coincidence that the department stores hardest hit are those that have little identity as a brand. (Can anyone define what House of Fraser stands for?) John Lewis, with its emotive Christmas adverts, has worked hard to buck the trend by amplifying its personality, while Selfridges has redefined itself as experience over retail. Department store shopping is by its nature time-inefficient and requires human contact. When you think you have found the escalator it usually turns out to be the wrong one. You will need to ask directions, and make purchases on multiple floors. This is all at odds with the modern consumer’s instinct for speed and individualism, enabled by technology. The same technological forces that did for the landline are lined up against the department store. In order to tempt the modern consumer to get off their phone and into the store, the most forward-thinking department stores are turning retail into modern entertainment. Selfridges stages ambitious multisensory art exhibitions, John Lewis incorporates pop-up rooftop restaurants, while Liberty hosts a sewing school. And Harrods’ new toy department features light tunnels and fancy-dress fitting rooms, while Harvey Nichols runs cocktail masterclasses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
