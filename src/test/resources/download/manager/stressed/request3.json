There was always the moment in a Paul Brown show where the audience gasped; the flaming staircase at the end of Pelléas et Mélisande (Glyndebourne, 2004), the carnival of giant rutting rabbits in The Fairy Queen (Glyndebourne, 2009). Sometimes the show was one extended coup de théâtre. The Tempest (2000), where Ariel dived through dark waters on the flooded stage of the Almeida, was described in the Guardian as the most inventive staging of Shakespeare since Peter Brook’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. The 2009 Aida, on the lake stage at Bregenz, upped the ante with speeding gun-boats and a sky-ballet of shipyard cranes. Paul was my friend for nearly 40 years, and I never knew him to repeat an idea. Yet for all the fabulous invention, there was a scrupulousness to Paul’s character and creativity that rejected spectacle for spectacle’s sake. Nor was he swayed by audience expectation; he could do “ravishing” like no one else (as evidenced by his 2006 Tosca at the Royal Opera House) but inclined, often, towards the ravaged. Working up designs for La Traviata in Verona (2004), he knew very well that the amphitheatre crowd liked its Violettas piped in meringue. He gave them a bald and battered whore, and took an extra kick at populist sentiment with a shrine of cellophaned flowers. Paul was fast and very funny, charming enough to convince the grandest divas they would look marvellous in a chicken suit, or dragging a chandelier, on their knees, through mud. His period costumes were exquisite and always authentic; he could tell you, to the month, when a stock or a stomacher was first worn, but ducked the dead hand of historicism with forensic attention to character. It was entirely fitting that his Oscar-nominated costume designs for the 1995 film Angels and Insects turned on the notion of clothing-as-carapace, a notion which later found apotheosis in the gorgeous, glinting bugs that shimmied from behind the fridge in Rameau’s Hippolyte et Aricie (Glyndebourne, 2013). The modern “clothes, not costumes” mantra bounced off Paul. “It doesn’t really cut it,” he pointed out, “when you’re making a frock-coat for a beetle.” He micromanaged sets to an astonishing degree. Staging Coriolanus and Richard II in the derelict Gainsborough Studios in 2000, Paul was excited to find a number of old doors, richly textured with guano. Informed that this was a technical bio-hazard, he allowed the doors to be washed, but each individual splatter was painted back on by hand. Paul enjoyed unusually close collaborations with directors, and worked predominantly with Graham Vick and Jonathan Kent; Vick remembers “an incredibly powerful intellect and personality”. Kent compares the director/designer relationship to a marriage. “We had a long-running stand-off over Wellington boots.” he recalls, “I kept banning them, Paul kept sneaking them in. For 20 years.” Born in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, the son of Alan Brown, a master printer, and his wife, Enfys (nee Jones), Paul was educated at Christ college, Brecon, and at the University of St Andrews, where he took an MA in English literature. Student drama in the early 1980s was a drab “black box and hessian” affair. Paul tore down the hemp and swathed the college theatre in cloth-of-gold, most notably for a staggeringly precocious production of Dryden’s Amphitryon (baroque to his soul, Paul loved nothing better than a deus ex machina). His talent was nurtured by Malcolm Edwards, a London director then working in St Andrews, and soon Paul was moonlighting in West End shows. Friends stuck doggedly to the narrative, in lectures and tutorials, that Paul was “just parking, and would be along presently”, but the gaff was blown when, in his final term, he arrived to register for exams in the English department; barely acquainted with the building, he swept, rather grandly, into a broom cupboard (and was too embarrassed to come out). On graduating, he studied stage design with Margaret “Percy” Harris at the Riverside Studios, London, and after an indecently short period in fringe theatre, flipped into the fast-stream. Rarely sleeping, fuelled by Nescafé and pastry, he was unimaginably prolific. In 2004 alone, Paul had 21 separate operas playing in the UK, Verona, Chicago, Paris, New York, Sydney, Madrid, Bologna, Amsterdam and San Francisco. In 2013 he won the Royal Designer for Industry award for his role in fostering UK set and costume design on the world stage. In his late 30s, Paul found great happiness with Andy Cordy, an artist, and they celebrated their civil partnership in 2006. They lived in a 15th-century manor house in Pembrokeshire with assorted poultry, and dogs called Merkin and Fecal. (“They’re Welsh names,” Paul always assured interested, non-Welsh children.) The creative hub was a London basement, thick with fumes from spray-mount and lined with glowing jars of pigment like an alchemist’s cell. Costume-drawings, which he often undertook in bed, were a form of meditation for Paul; worked up in coloured pencil line by line and layer by layer, sketches took on the depth and shine of silk, velvet or feathers. Pencils reduced to stubs were honourably retired to the Tin of the Little Heroes. Paul was diagnosed with cancer in December 2015. He worked, as he wished, to the end. It is hard for so many of his friends to think there will be no more calls pinging in from airport lounges around the world, starting, always, with the same, Peter Pan crow (“It’s me!”) and ending in a firework spatter of farewells (“Bye now, bye-bye, bye … bye”). Paul was not only the most influential stage designer of his generation, and a generous mentor, but also an extravagant gift of a friend. Paul is survived by Andy, his mother and his sister, Jane. • Paul Gareth Brown, stage designer, born 13 May 1960; died 13 November 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/27/glitter-reproductive-rights-rise-of-nail-bar-activism-female-only-spaces-domestic-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T16:34:55Z","webTitle":"‘One minute we’re talking glitter, the next reproductive rights’: the rise of nail bar activism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/27/glitter-reproductive-rights-rise-of-nail-bar-activism-female-only-spaces-domestic-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/27/glitter-reproductive-rights-rise-of-nail-bar-activism-female-only-spaces-domestic-violence","fields":{"headline":"‘One minute we’re talking glitter, the next reproductive rights’: the rise of nail bar activism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nail bars may not generally be considered a hub of political activism but, at Tropical Popical in Dublin, a wave of socially conscious beauty is spreading. “One minute we’re talking about pink glitter, the next we’re discussing women’s reproductive rights,” says its founder, Andrea Horan. A cursory glance at the salon’s Instagram feed illustrates her point. Nails emblazoned with vulvas and hot-pink 8s in a nod to Repeal the 8th, the campaign to end Ireland’s abortion ban, feature alongside more straightforward designs of pineapples and polka dots. Tropical Popical wasn’t conceived as a feminist salon, but its politics became more pronounced when Horan began using it to promote the work of her Repeal-focused women’s platform, the HunReal Issues. Vagina-decorated nails are part of a bid to normalise conversations about abortion; in the week leading up to Dublin’s March for Choice in September, the salon was packed with women requesting manicures to match the message of the march. The salon is also one way to engage those not interested in current affairs. In the run-up to Ireland’s general election last February, Horan asked staff how they were voting. “A lot of them were just, like, ‘I don’t know – whatever my mam and dad are voting,’ or, ‘I don’t really vote,’” she says. “I suddenly snapped and thought: ‘There is this big army of women who work in beauty and if they were mobilised, there would be a lot more women’s voices calling for women’s issues to be prioritised.” Tropical Popical isn’t alone in mixing politics with nail polish. In the UK, activist Charlie Craggs educates people about her experience of life as a transgender woman through a pop-up salon, Nail Transphobia, while nail-art sensations WAH Nails, in east London, have set up workshops to help young businesswomen in the trade. In the US, New York-based manicurist Ami Vega creates “socially conscious” nails, highlighting ideas around Black Lives Matter and domestic violence. Charity-run salons providing training for disadvantaged women are also becoming popular. In London, Art Against Knives runs two-weekly community nail bars, both staffed by young women living on estates in Barnet. They offer business skills, mentoring and help with CVs – along with housing domestic violence services. The Shine Nail Bar in Leeds also provides volunteering and employment opportunities. Still, is it not problematic to marry beauty – and the rigid ideals with which it is associated – with women’s rights? Not so, says Horan: “You can celebrate femininity without going against the principles of feminism.” The fact that nail bars are largely women-only spaces makes them a good base for starting tricky conversations, she says. WAH Nails’ founder Sharmadean Reid believes the “youth club” feel of salons also boosts their campaign-ready credentials, pointing out that a manicure is one of the only beauty treatments that allows easy chatter: “You can’t have a conversation if your hair is being blow-dried because it’s too noisy; you can’t have a conversation in a facial.” Nail bars have also shed their reputation for being a luxury only the very wealthy could afford. Indeed, they thrived in the last economic downturn, providing an update on the adage that lipstick sales go up when recessions set in. Then there’s the closeness they foster: “You’re holding someone’s hand for an hour so it gives you the opportunity to build up intimacy really fast,” says Horan. The visual impact of nail art is also important – it can embolden the wearer, spark debate and engender a sense of community. But does this hold true when it comes to the nail industry’s unethical reputation? You don’t need to do more than skim the headlines intermittently to associate the sector, in Britain and the US at least, with stories about exploitation and human trafficking – mainly of women. In September, a report by the UK’s independent anti-slavery commissioner, Kevin Hyland, voiced concern about the trafficking of enslaved people from Vietnam to work in the nail bar industry, calling for tighter regulation. There is no data on the number of salons run in this way, but, according to Mark Breadon from the Association of Nail Technicians, the body is collaborating with the Home Office to introduce licensing to eliminate corruption of this kind. However, progress is slow due to lack of consensus between councils, as well as feeble support from Westminster. “Unfortunately, no politician is willing to take it on board because it’s not a big vote winner,” he says. Given that disheartening reality, the notion of nail bars being a hotbed of women’s activism may seem unconvincing. Yet, returning to Andrea Horan at Tropical Popical, that perspective “tars a whole industry … with one very general brush”. Perhaps a fair way of putting it, then, is that, while the sector needs a clean-up, there are plenty of reputable nail bars – and as a concept they are well-placed, perhaps uniquely so, to have a positive impact on women’s lives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/11/yang-fudong-best-photograph-seven-intellectuals-in-a-boat-suspended-in-the-air-china-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Yang Fudong's best photograph: seven intellectuals in a boat suspended in the air","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/11/yang-fudong-best-photograph-seven-intellectuals-in-a-boat-suspended-in-the-air-china-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/11/yang-fudong-best-photograph-seven-intellectuals-in-a-boat-suspended-in-the-air-china-interview","fields":{"headline":"Yang Fudong's best photograph: seven intellectuals in a boat suspended in the air","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This shot was taken in 2006 in Shandong province, near the port city of Weihai – I was there to film the fourth instalment of a five-hour video work, Seven Intellectuals in a Bamboo Forest. The film is based on the third-century fable of the seven sages: seven young people who sought to escape corrupt court politics and together left the city in search of their future. The theme of the instalment was “a small island on the sea of belief”. As the seven city dwellers try out life as fishermen, the narrative explores the tension between their dual identities. I’d never been to Weihai, but intuitively opted to shoot there. We spent about a month on location, doing a couple of three- to four-day shoots on the beach. This particular day was strenuous, a bit like working on a construction site: shooting a film isn’t that different from manual labour. We started at six in the morning. The actors worked exactly as the local fishermen do, labouring in the heat to load and unload fish from boats and transport their luggage. We didn’t have a clear script – that isn’t how I work. I usually start with a vague idea and improvise with whatever I find on site. We happened upon a boat-lifting machine; some locals explained they used it to hoist vessels to the shore so they could unload the fish. I liked how the thick, steel cable coiled into the sea. I imagined my protagonists voyaging aimlessly in a boat suspended in the air. There were a lot of people on set: a crew of about 30, plus seven actors, including Huang Lu, who stars in Li Yang’s film Blind Mountain. We shot this sequence at dusk. We figured out how fast and high the cable could go. We asked the actors to jump on the boat, then set the mechanism in motion and filmed and shot stills as the boat moved backwards towards the sea. Shooting the film in black and white was a way to conjure a sense of distance and alienation, of timelessness. I also like the purity, the simplicity that black and white imparts. I find it dreamlike. While the first two parts of the film had a musical soundtrack, the other parts had only natural sound. From a Chinese perspective, this image is melancholy and beautiful. It is hopeful. It represents yearning and uncertainty. The seven characters aren’t intended to depict any particular group – rather, they represent young people as a whole, Chinese or foreign alike. All young people have hopes and dreams as well as doubts. We live in a fast-changing world. People are able to travel to different places. This work poses the question of whether we have a spiritual dimension to our lives. Imagining the future, enjoying the experience of visiting a museum – these are spiritual things. For me it’s not the identity of these seven young people that matters, it’s their spirit. Yang Fudong’s CV Born: Beijing, 1971. Trained: Studied oil painting at the China Academy of Art, Hangzhou.

Rather, he had the look of a man who’d one day spontaneously combust behind the camera while filming a yakuza cheese-wiring off someone’s foot. Yet here he comes, the respected auteur, with his centennial film Blade of the Immortal; another recent work of the one-time provocateur swearing allegiance to that most orthodox of Japanese traditions, the samurai film. Even if his version of orthodox features the odd lute that converts into a gnarly nunchucks staff. With Blade of the Immortal, Miike inches closer to the top of the list of cinema’s most prolific directors. He will probably have outstripped his countryman Kenji Mizoguchi (101) by the time you reach the end of this paragraph. But a few more gonzo chanbara will be needed before he’s matching the likes of Casablanca director Michael Curtiz (175), John Ford (140-odd, including various shorts) or Jean-Luc Godard (well over 100, depending on how you count various video and TV credits). Curtiz and Ford worked in cinema’s early days, when feature lengths were shorter, as well as under the Hollywood studio system during the production-line frenzy of its golden age. You suspect those numbers would be impossible for anyone starting out in film now. Miike himself chalked up his first 10 credits working on the even more rough’n’ready Japanese video circuit. By the mid-1990s, as he was transitioning to celluloid, he was making five films a year. He claimed that he had an annual appointment in January to get his head shaved because he’d be too busy for haircuts during the rest of the year. He’s also living proof that quantity doesn’t necessarily mean sacrificing quality. No one would deny that his work has had its dips and its rough edges; even in the relatively lavish Blade of the Immortal, some of the costumes look as if they’re straight out of the cosplay shop. But Miike has produced accomplished work in a surprising variety of genres, including ones outside of the ultraviolent shockers – such as Ichi the Killer, Dead Or Alive and Audition – that got picked up in the west. Not many people are aware of Miike the chronicler of Osakan working-class life in Young Thugs: Nostalgia, or Miike the family entertainer (Ninja Kids!!!). Not being precious has gifted him this consistency. It’s almost an alien idea in a time dominated by the overthought film-making-by-committee of the blockbuster industry, or in which we venerate scarcity merchants such as Kubrick and Tarantino (who says he’ll tap out after 10 films). There’s a lot to be said for getting on with it, like Miike. It breeds the kind of mother-of-necessity invention Werner Herzog (around 50 full-length films) has made his watchword. Hitchcock (53 films) proceeded in more calculated steps, but maybe keeping a three-a-year average in the 1930s was what geared up his creative metabolism to effortlessly turning out three classics in 1958-60: Vertigo, North By Northwest and the artistic breakthrough of Psycho. There’s no doubt the quick-fire approach fuels a certain kind of director. Refusing to stand on the formalities of either fiction or documentary, preferring improvisation and the roving digital style, Michael Winterbottom apparently can’t stop sprouting new projects – 25 features in 22 years. Who knows what’s driving that – but sometimes it’s obvious when a hot streak is drawing its energy from some psychic heat source. There was scant separation in the violent anticonformism in the life (37 years) and art (40 films) of Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Racking up Alien prequels like web-browser tabs as part of his rally over the last decade, it’s hard not to believe intimations of mortality aren’t driving Ridley Scott, now 79 years old. Being prolific doesn’t work for everyone – or for ever. You get the impression that Woody Allen might have detrimentally scienced the recent run of films that has carried him over the 50th feature mark. Proxy for younger self: check. Mild philosophical noodling: check. Postcard Euro-capital setting with added tax-production credits: check. Making more films this decade (five) than in the previous 40 years (four) seems to have made the ever more self-parodic Terrence Malick forget what editors are for. Both should either consider a pause – or maybe stepping things up to Miike levels. There’s no bad habit a blast on the nunchucks staff won’t cure. • Blade of the Immortal is out on 8 December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/01/2018-essential-theatre-pinter-suranne-jones-carey-mulligan","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T10:05:08Z","webTitle":"All-star Pinter, a Suranne Jones thriller and Carey Mulligan goes solo: 2018's essential theatre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/01/2018-essential-theatre-pinter-suranne-jones-carey-mulligan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/01/2018-essential-theatre-pinter-suranne-jones-carey-mulligan","fields":{"headline":"All-star Pinter, a Suranne Jones thriller and Carey Mulligan goes solo: 2018's essential theatre","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Birthday Party Toby Jones, Zoë Wanamaker and Stephen Mangan star in a revival of a Pinter play reviled at its premiere in 1958 and now accepted as a modern classic.

Her latest play, showing a Brooklyn couple checking into a spookily sinister Gettysburg B&amp;B, is more a study in magical realism. Acclaimed at its American premiere in 2015, the play is directed at the National by James Macdonald and stars Anneika Rose and Tom Mothersdale. • 17 January-3 March, Dorfman, National Theatre, London.

An ambitious opening season includes plays by Schiller, Aristophanes and Tennessee Williams and kicks off with a premiere from the prolific Howard Brenton that looks back to autumn 1940 when 2,300 bombs were dropped by the Luftwaffe on Southampton itself. But the play, we are assured, is a story of courage and survival. • 7 February-3 March, NST City, Southampton. Box office: 023-8067 1771. Girls and Boys Carey Mulligan, whose impressive stage credits feature The Seagull and Skylight and whose movies include Suffragette and Mudbound, stars in Dennis Kelly’s disturbing one-woman play.

The Belle’s Stratagem This neglected gem from Hannah Cowley, first seen in 1780, is a riposte to Farquhar’s The Beaux’ Stratagem and a tribute to female ingenuity. Transposing the action from London to Edinburgh’s New Town, Tony Cownie’s adaptation shows the heroine, Letitia (once played by Ellen Terry), using her wits to reclaim the attention of Doricourt who, having travelled throughout Europe, now loftily scorns what he terms “dull Scottish lassies”. • 15 February-10 March, Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh. Box office: 0131-248 4848. Macbeth You have to admire the courage of Rufus Norris. With little experience of Shakespeare (though he did once direct a production of The Tempest), he tackles this notoriously tricky tragedy on the National’s most exposed stage. Fortunately he has Rory Kinnear, once a tremendous Hamlet, and Anne-Marie Duff, equally at home in the classics and new plays, as, arguably, Shakespeare’s only truly happy married couple. • From 26 February, Olivier theatre, London. Box office: 020-7452 3000. The Cherry Orchard Astonishingly, given his Russophile tendencies when director of the RSC, this will be Michael Boyd’s firstever Chekhov production. It is part of Bristol Old Vic’s ambitious Year of Change season and will see designer Tom Piper reconfiguring the 250-year-old theatre’s auditorium. Kirsty Bushell, who never fails to impress, and Jude Owusu head the cast of Rory Mullarkey’s adaptation that will also play at Manchester’s Royal Exchange. • 1 March-7 April, Bristol Old Vic. Box office: 0117-987 7877. Frankenstein In the 200 years since its publication, Mary Shelley’s novel has inspired countless theatrical adaptations: most recently, Danny Boyle’s sensational National Theatre production and Mel Brooks’s hilarious musical, Young Frankenstein. Now April de Angelis comes up with a new version that, one hopes, will capture something of the radical Shelley’s rage against social injustice and the hero’s divine presumption. Matthew Xia, who has staged Wish List and Into The Woods, directs and Shane Zaza stars as the vainglorious Victor. • 9 March-7 April, Royal Exchange, Manchester. Box office: 0161-833 9833. The Last Ship Sting’s musical, based on his own memories of growing up in Wallsend, lasted a bare three months on Broadway in 2015. Now it has been extensively reworked and is launched, appropriately enough, in Newcastle before undertaking a national tour. It tells the story of a sailor who returns home to find the shipbuilding community he once knew in chaos and a local foreman, played by Jimmy Nail, fighting to save it. With Sting’s score and a brand-new production by Lorne Campbell, New York’s loss should be Tyneside’s gain. • 12 March-7 April, Northern Stage, Newcastle. Box office: 0191-230 5151. Strictly Ballroom: The Musical Drew McOnie directed and choreographed this version of Baz Luhrmann’s 1992 hit movie at West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2016. Now it’s been revamped and recast, but it remains the same deliciously corny story about a talented young dancer who defies the rules and finds a new partner in an overlooked cleaner. Jonny Labey as the fleet-footed hero, Zizi Strallen as the dance-hall Cinderella and singer Will Young head the cast and, if it’s anything like the Leeds production, it should dance up a storm. • From 16 March, Piccadilly theatre, London. Box office: 0844 871 7630. The Fantastic Follies of Mrs Rich Mary Pix (1666-1709) is hardly a name to conjure with. She is, however, one of that generation of Restoration female wits gradually being rediscovered by our theatres; this play, written in 1700 and originally titled The Beau Defeated, gets a rare outing from the RSC. It’s the story of a wealthy widow who’s after a title, boasts a large number of roles for women and is directed by Jo Davies who had a previous success at Stratford with The Roaring Girl. • 23 March-14 June, The Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon. Box office: 01789 403493. Pericles Dismissed by Dr Johnson as “a mouldy tale”, this late Shakespeare, with help from an unnamed collaborator, has enjoyed a huge revival of fortune in recent years. Clearly something in this epic story of a seagoing hero’s misfortunes, of his reunion with a lost daughter and of his dead wife’s rebirth chimes with our hunger for resurrection myths. Cheek by Jowl’s Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod, having traversed the globe themselves, for the first time offer us Shakespeare with a French company. • 6-21 April, Silk Street theatre, Barbican, London.

I’ve no idea why there’s a pervading assumption that, for men to ablute, they must first be seduced by novelty products emblazoned with humorous “bants”, or packaging got up to look like motor oil, but here we are. Since this customer bears no resemblance to my husband, any of my four brothers, two sons or dozens of male friends, I’m inclined to keep things simple, elegant and useful. Among my favourites in the luxury category are Aesop’s gift sets, such as the Boston (£50): gender-neutral, but reliably loved by men, these contain several of Aesop’s wonderful products (in this case, mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, body balm, shower gel, cleanser, face tonic and moisturiser), all in aeroplane-friendly doses, very stylishly packaged and arranged in a black travel pouch. A less expected, but nonetheless big hit among men are Bliss Glamour Gloves (£39). The name is a bit off-putting, admittedly, but these blue gloves lined with skin-softening and soothing gels and oils are brilliant for anyone whose hands suffer at this time of year. Just pop on for half an hour (the gloves are stretchy, so fit most sizes, and can be used 50 times), then apply the accompanying heavy-duty hand cream to finish. An easier sell is a subscription to a shaving club. Harry’s is particularly good, since the German blades (five per cartridge) come up at less than two quid a pop. You could start him off with a razor to house them, and some nice aloe shave gel, for £14. Jo Malone’s English Oak &amp; Hazelnut Cologne (£45) is listed by the brand as strictly female, but I’ve no idea why, since it’s as sexy, refined and appropriate on men as it is on women. It’s an outdoorsy type of scent and perfect for this time of year: spicy, warm and soft, but sufficiently green and uplifting to remain jolly. To my nose, it lasts a lot longer than most colognes, including its Jo Malone stablemates. In fact, I recently chose this very fragrance for my groom on our wedding day, and could still detect it at 2am, as we passed out in a drunken heap."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/26/sinai-mosque-attack-death-toll-300-gunmen-isis-flags","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T00:05:39Z","webTitle":"Sinai mosque death toll raised to 305 as reports claim gunmen carried Isis flags","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/26/sinai-mosque-attack-death-toll-300-gunmen-isis-flags","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/26/sinai-mosque-attack-death-toll-300-gunmen-isis-flags","fields":{"headline":"Sinai mosque death toll raised to 305 as reports claim gunmen carried Isis flags","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Egypt was reeling on Saturday from the worst atrocity it has suffered in recent years, with officials putting the death toll from the bomb and gun assault on a Sinai mosque at 305. The figure includes 27 children. A further 128 people were wounded in the attack on the Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, north Sinai. A bomb ripped through the mosque as Friday prayers were finishing, before militants opened fire on worshippers. In response, airstrikes were directed at “terrorist” locations, said military sources. Egypt’s chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, said the attack was carried out by 25-30 militants who had stationed themselves at the mosque’s main door and 12 windows before opening fire on those inside. More than 50 ambulances ferried casualties from the mosque, about 25 miles west of the city of Arish, to nearby hospitals. Pictures from the scene showed rows of bloodied victims inside the mosque. Theresa May yesterday told the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, that the UK “stands ready to help in any way possible”. Downing Street added that the two leaders agreed that international co-operation was needed to tackle the problem of terrorism. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but it marks a significant escalation in a region where, for the past three years, Egyptian security forces have battled an Islamic State insurgency that has killed hundreds of police and soldiers. It was reported yesterday that the assailants were carrying the Islamic State flag. The attack was not only one of the worst terrorist incidents in Egyptian history, but also the first on a mosque. The justification for assaulting a Muslim place of worship appears to be that the mosque was frequented by Sufis, a sect considered by many Islamist extremists to be heretical. There are, however, many conspiracy theories circulating, which suggest the atrocity has provided the president with a convenient opportunity to demonstrate his security credentials. In a nearby outdoor cafe, in the shadow of another mosque frequented by Sufis, Sayeda Zeinab, most patrons were adamant on Saturday that the attack was purely politically motivated. “This was all because of the elections,” said one customer. Sisi is widely expected to stand in elections due to be held early next year to try to retain the presidency. When he first ran in 2014, the message of his campaign was that the former army general was the only man who could bring stability to the country and prevent the chaos that has engulfed neighbouring Libya and Syria from ever reaching Egypt. “I supported him,” said the customer. “But I would never vote for him again. I’ll take just about anyone else; he can’t win.” With a sharp drop in tourism, following the 2011 Arab Spring, Sisi has presided over a period of economic instability, in addition to one with a sustained terrorist threat. “Do any of us live as well as we used to?” said the customer. “My salary is a third of what it used to be.” All around the cafe and in the street are signs of the upcoming elections. Posters draped from the lamp-posts show Sisi’s smiling face, accompanied with an appeal for him to “Build it” – meaning to re-run for office. This is supposedly a grassroots movement, although some community figures have reported being given petitions to hand out, sent to them by the interior ministry. With the elections drawing closer, this attack seems to have shaken the nerves of the government. The president has reacted swiftly, promising to meet the attack with extreme force, as well as declaring three days of public mourning. In a press release on Saturday, the state information services said he had ordered that 200,000 Egyptian pounds (£8,478) be paid to the families of victims for every member killed. Within hours of the attack, security forces also reported airstrikes in the vicinity of the attack. Yet the mood in Cairo is one of calm. The number of people killed and injured in the Sinai attack is much higher than in past terrorist atrocities. However, north Sinai remains a no-go area for journalists, making it difficult to confirm details. Cairo’s residents are used to stories of violence from the Sinai region. “It feels like a long way away,” says Ahmed Yousef, 30, a telecoms engineer. “They can’t even get into Cairo, it’s too crowded.” In July, at least 23 soldiers were killed when suicide car bombs were detonated at two military checkpoints in the Sinai. Isis claimed responsibility. The local Isis affiliate, Wilayat Sinai (the governorate of Sinai), also carried out the previous deadliest attack in the region when, in 2015, it brought down a Russian passenger jet that was carrying tourists back from the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing 224 people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/everyman/3712","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:00:26Z","webTitle":"Everyman crossword No 3,712","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/everyman/3712","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/everyman/3712","fields":{"headline":"Everyman crossword No 3,712","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/26/only-one-sick-country-europe-britain-germany-merkel-hung-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T00:05:39Z","webTitle":"There’s only one sick country in Europe – and it’s not Germany | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/only-one-sick-country-europe-britain-germany-merkel-hung-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/only-one-sick-country-europe-britain-germany-merkel-hung-parliament","fields":{"headline":"There’s only one sick country in Europe – and it’s not Germany","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Suddenly Germany, famed for its political stability, betrayed a new vulnerability last week. Or so some would have you believe. One of the tragedies of modern Britain is the implosion of the political centre. And without the ballast of a strong centre, we are steadily losing the capacity to think straight. This was a case in point. Chancellor Merkel’s attempts to build a coalition government fell apart. Eurosceptic liberals and green ultras could not agree a programme for government with her Christian Democrats. The British right gloated at the prospect: this was the moment to exact better terms in the Brexit negotiations from a mortally wounded Germany now suddenly brought to earth. It was thinking far removed from any reality. Germany is neither politically nor economically mortally wounded. Yes, there is a major political crisis following a hung election, but Germany will find a way through, rather more satisfactorily than stuffing a tiny minority party with a billion-pound bribe, as the Tories did with the Democratic Unionists. Its political system requires its principal parties to keep on talking to each other if none can command an overall parliamentary majority; they have their ideologies, but tempered by the necessity of dialogue to form a potential programme for government. A resolution will be found, or another election called, with the electorate more keenly aware of the choices they are making. It is democracy by grownups. That is what is happening. German Social Democrats, after an impassioned plea by the president to put public before party interest, will poll their members about the terms for creating a possible coalition with Merkel’s Christian Democrats. There will be enormous wariness: junior partners in coalitions don’t fare well in either Germany or Britain, but Merkel will be going cap in hand to her left-of-centre rivals as her last option. For them, it could be the opportunity to put the social firmly back in Germany’s social market economy. The economic backdrop to the negotiations could scarcely be more benign. Germany is beginning to grow strongly. Meanwhile, the eurozone, derided in Britain for its sclerosis, austerity, social cruelty, unsustainability and imminent collapse, is growing at the fastest rate for 10 years. German unemployment is lower than in Britain, and not achieved by many of those in work suffering stagnating real wages and insecurity. Germany has a strong budgetary surplus; there is huge scope to increase its already formidable economic competitiveness by stepping up its spending across new technology. It is not Britain that is going to be at the centre of the latest European industrial revolution, but Germany and France. Yet none of this intrudes into our insular political debate. Germany is not about to capitulate to British demands to be cut a special deal on Brexit so that we can enjoy all the trade and market access benefits of EU membership without any of the responsibilities. Why would any German politician want that? Why would they need to? We are the supplicant country in desperate and growing trouble, if only we could see it. That was the message of last week’s budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility projects that economic growth over the next five years will average 1.4%, an unprecedented, brutal downward revision of its forecasts. Productivity is projected to grow at a snail’s pace, so there is virtually no growth in earnings adjusted for inflation. It is the bleakest official forecast I can remember. Nor does it capture all the risks. Sir Ivan Rogers, UK representative to the EU between 2013 and 2017 – in his lecture at the Hertford College series on prime ministers and Europe on Friday evening (full disclosure: I am Principal at Hertford, Oxford) – predicted the only feasible Brexit trade deal would be one based in principle on the Canadian free trade agreement, but which could take up to a decade to negotiate in legal detail. This, along with the absence of other trade agreements, which will take equally long to negotiate, would represent such a shock to British trade flows that he thought it would topple the UK into a full-blown recession. As shocking was his revelation that some leading Brexiters were fully aware of the economic risks, but wanted to organise the pain so it comes early rather than later in the run-up to a 2022 general election. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, one of the few remaining substantial centrist British political figures, knows all this. But to acknowledge it openly would, given the current state of the Conservative party, cost him his political life. He would be confirmed as the pessimistic, unpatriotic Eeyore working against the will of the people. Instead, he has to talk of the opportunity ahead, and how the performance of the UK economy “continues to confound those who seek to talk it down”. It is rubbish, as well he knows. But the atmosphere does not permit the truth to be said. Britain remains the exceptional country that is going to get an exceptional deal congruent with its exceptional destiny. British exceptionalism is a national delusion, and a shaft of light is that it is gradually being dispelled. Our economic performance is woeful, to be cruelly exposed when outside the EU. And there is an emerging consensus about the need for an industrial strategy both to support more fast-growing, knowledge-intensive firms and to try to close Britain’s huge geographical inequalities. Milton Keynes, with half Liverpool’s population, produces the same volume of goods and services. For all its political weakness, the government is set to launch an industrial strategy white paper tomorrow – reinforced by Hammond earmarking another £2.3bn for research and development in 2021 and £7bn for the productivity fund in 2022. Jam tomorrow, maybe, and years behind what is happening in Europe and China, but a welcome signal of a new direction of travel. It is the beginning of thinking straighter, but too many cling to Britain’s alleged exceptionalism, firing up so many Brexiters. The question in British politics is how soon the economic severity of what lies ahead will change minds – and whether exceptionalism can survive 20 years of wage stagnation, recession, stasis and the inevitable setback in house prices. It is not Germany that is the sick man of Europe, the cherished belief of the Brexiters, but Britain. Real change, even recommitting to Europe, will follow that growing realisation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/26/egypt-iron-fist-response-terror-attacks-never-works","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T00:05:39Z","webTitle":"The ‘iron fist’ response to terror attacks in Egypt never works | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/egypt-iron-fist-response-terror-attacks-never-works","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/egypt-iron-fist-response-terror-attacks-never-works","fields":{"headline":"The ‘iron fist’ response to terror attacks in Egypt never works","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, cultivates a hard-man image. His response to Friday’s atrocity at al-Rawdah mosque in northern Sinai was wholly predictable. Hours after Islamic State-linked gunmen killed more than 300 Sufi worshippers, Sisi sent waves of warplanes to exact revenge. “The air force has … eliminated a number of outposts used by terrorist elements,” the military said. If only it were that easy. If Sisi and his generals knew the location of such terrorist outposts, why had they not already been destroyed? It is probable the targets were chosen randomly and yet more innocent lives may now have been lost. This, in turn, may exacerbate Egypt’s long-running problem with Islamist insurgents. Speaking to the nation after the mosque attack, Sisi – a former general who seized power in 2013 in a military-backed coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government – reverted to the only language he knows. “The police and military will avenge our martyrs and restore peace and security,” he said. “We will respond with brute force.” But like an alcoholic who takes a drink and hopes that somehow the outcome will be different this time, Sisi’s addiction to violence is a kind of madness. Egyptian leaders before him, notably Hosni Mubarak, all tried to physically crush their opponents. They all failed. And Sisi will, too. In the 1990s, before al-Qaida and Isis fully emerged, Islamist extremists tried to weaken Mubarak’s autocratic regime by targeting security forces, the Coptic Christian minority, and western tourists in Luxor. The official response, notably in underdeveloped Upper Egypt, was mass arrests, shoot-to-kill orders, torture and a scorched earth policy. “Those actions destroyed the livelihoods of farmers and their families, who then became prey for recruitment by the very groups the government was trying to defeat,” says Mona Eltahawy, a Reuters correspondent in Cairo at the time. More recently, the largely ungoverned spaces of northern Sinai province have become a new locus of militant activity. Sinai has been under a state of emergency, and closed to outside agencies and media, since 2014, when militants killed 30 Egyptian soldiers. In 2015, a Russian passenger jet carrying 224 tourists and crew from Sharm el-Sheikh was shot down. Friday’s atrocity, like the airliner attack, has been blamed on Wilayat Sinai, an Islamist group with links to Isis that has previously hit Coptic churches in Cairo and Alexandria, although no claim of responsibility has yet been reported. Sisi’s “iron fist” tactics have proved futile. The Isis connection appears to be strengthening as the terror group’s “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria is degraded. Isis is reportedly regrouping in neighbouring Libya. Northern Sinai may also become a destination of choice for displaced jihadis. Unlike al-Qaida, which generally eschews civilian targets, Wilayat appears bent on maximum mayhem. By murdering Muslims, albeit Sufi Muslims who zealots view as apostates, the group has issued a challenge to Egyptian society as a whole. Such lethal recklessness could eventually prove Wilayat and Isis’s undoing, by alienating ordinary Egyptians and people in similarly impacted Arab countries. But Sisi’s unthinking return violence could have the opposite effect, leading to further unchecked escalation. Long experience shows that more killings, repression and dictatorial rule are not the answer for Egypt, any more than for other post-Arab Spring countries. Egypt under Sisi has become a black hole for human rights and democratic governance. Yet the US and Britain turn a blind eye, while a bloodthirsty Donald Trump tweets demands for revenge. Until the state rejects systemic violence as a form of policy, the violence of non-state actors will persist and grow. That’s a hard lesson for a hard man like Sisi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/26/observer-view-on-social-care-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T00:05:39Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on the social care crisis | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/observer-view-on-social-care-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/observer-view-on-social-care-crisis","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the social care crisis","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It beggars belief that the chancellor failed to mention social care once during his budget speech last Wednesday. For well over a year, there has been an overwhelming consensus that Britain’s care system for older people and disabled adults is on the brink of crisis. Yet Philip Hammond simply left it out. His omission has rightly attracted criticism from two former Conservative health secretaries in the Observer today. Means-tested support for social care is provided by councils, which have seen government grants cut significantly in recent years. As a result, council spending on social care has fallen by up to 30% in some areas since 2010. Three independent health thinktanks have produced a joint estimate that Wednesday’s budget will leave a £2.5bn funding gap by 2019. This will put huge pressure on the NHS, as people who can’t access care deteriorate and end up in hospital wards instead. And it will leave millions without the care they need. The number of people getting state help with the costs of their care has fallen by more than a quarter since 2011, while the charity AgeUK says there are 1.2 million older people who struggle without help to carry out everyday tasks such as washing and dressing. That this leaves older people and their families in an intolerable position has not been enough to spur the government into action. An ageing population and the rising cost of providing care mean we should be spending more, not less. Yet we are further than ever away from a long-term funding solution. A mix of short-term opportunism and political missteps has made social care increasingly toxic in the last decade. In 2010, Labour plans to introduce a charge on estates to fund a National Care Service were branded a “death tax” by the Conservative opposition. Earlier this year, ill-thought through plans in the Conservative manifesto that would have required individuals to run down all their assets, including their house, to £100,000 before state support would kick in, were labelled a “dementia tax”. Instead of offering solutions, ministers are saying families need to do more for their older relatives. This is hopelessly insufficient: the increasing incidence of complex conditions such as dementia mean growing numbers will need professional support, not just care from their loved ones. Government has nothing to say on how families can square the circle of being expected to put off retirement for longer, with caring for elderly parents. The government has announced another consultation on social care funding . It’s the last thing we need. Since 1997, there have been no fewer than four independent commissions and five government papers on funding reform. We already have the answer: as a society, we need to be spending more to ensure people experience a humane end of life. There are different ways to do this, but some are more racked with problems and injustices than others. Today, the Observer reveals the government has told local authorities it has dropped its plans to impose a cap on care costs in 2020. Good riddance. The idea was that people would be expected to cover their own care costs until they reached a cap of £72,000, and that they would insure themselves against these costs with private insurance. But this plan was always flawed. Specialist insurers have warned the government there is no market for this type of insurance. Basic human psychology means people are reluctant to save for their retirement income, let alone pay to insure an outcome half a lifetime away that they simply hope won’t happen. Insuring for long-term care costs is also difficult because there are huge levels of uncertainty about what will happen to those costs decades down the line. At any rate, introducing a cap without properly funding councils to provide care for people who meet the cap is pointless. This year’s Conservative manifesto proposal is deeply unfair. Why should those unlucky enough to develop care needs in later life have to meet the costs of care, while the luckier escape altogether? The proposal leaves the anomaly that someone who develops cancer gets the costs of their care covered by the state, while someone who gets dementia has to pay up themselves. If anything, the case for funding social care along the same lines as the NHS is even stronger than in the case of healthcare. It would be expensive, but there are plenty of ways it could be collectively funded by affluent baby boomers; for example, through inheritance tax or a higher rate of income tax for high-income pensioners enjoying the fruits of overly generous final salary pension schemes that are funded by younger workers. The real block is not money – it is a lack of political bravery. While Brexit ticks on, social care remains perhaps the most neglected aspect of our social infrastructure. There’s no greater emblem of the toxic stasis at the heart of this government than its failure to fix it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/25/arlene-foster-dup-will-prevent-northern-ireland-internal-barriers-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T16:01:58Z","webTitle":"Arlene Foster says DUP will prevent 'internal barriers' after Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/25/arlene-foster-dup-will-prevent-northern-ireland-internal-barriers-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/25/arlene-foster-dup-will-prevent-northern-ireland-internal-barriers-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Arlene Foster says DUP will prevent 'internal barriers' after Brexit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Democratic Unionist party, which holds the balance of power at Westminster, will use its parliamentary muscle to prevent any special post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland that could “decouple” the region from the rest of the UK. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said she welcomed assurances from Theresa May that there will be no “internal barriers” between the province and Britain after the UK leaves the EU. Foster’s 10 MPs keep May and the minority Conservative government in office. In her speech to the DUP’s annual conference in Belfast on Saturday, Foster expressed confidence that May’s government will not agree to any post-Brexit special status for Northern Ireland. Nor would the DUP accept any special laws in Northern Ireland that “will have to mirror European regulations”. The Irish government and northern nationalists have demanded that the region be given special status that would keep it part of the single market and/or the customs union. They have argued that Northern Ireland is a pro-EU region with 56% of the local electorate having voted to remain in Europe in the referendum. “No such internal barriers will be countenanced and that as we joined the then-European Community as one nation, will leave as one United Kingdom,” Foster told several hundred DUP delegates. The DUP leader said that while her party wanted a “sensible Brexit”, it would “not support any arrangements that create barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom or any suggestion that Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the UK, will have to mirror European regulations”. She continued: “The economic reality for our economy is that our most important trading relationship is with the rest of the United Kingdom and we will do nothing that puts that at risk in any way.” Foster received a rapturous response to her speech in which she said her party’s MPs would fight for the “best deal for Northern Ireland, but we care about vulnerable people in Bristol and Birmingham every bit as much as those in Belfast”. She said the successful fight by DUP MPs at Westminster to save the triple lock on pensions and the retention of the winter fuel payment proved this. On the absence of a power-sharing government in Belfast, Foster said she still believed devolution was the best way to govern Northern Ireland. Commenting on the row over Sinn Féin’s demand for an Irish language act, which that party says is a precondition to entering a new devolved government, Foster stressed that she had no problem with the Irish language, which she said “does not damage to our unionism or the union we cherish”. On the £1bn-plus aid package the DUP extracted from May as a price for propping up the Tories, Foster said: “Do you remember how some said that the DUP would pursue a narrow agenda in our negotiations? What was secured was for everyone across Northern Ireland.” Before Foster’s address Sammy Wilson, the DUP MP for East Antrim, raised one of the biggest cheers of the day when he described Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, and the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, as a “pair of cowboys”. The veteran DUP MP was referring to remarks by both Varadkar and Coveney that advocated a special deal for Northern Ireland, which would in effect keep it with one foot inside the EU. However, there was less jingoism and overt displays of flag-waving patriotism at this year’s DUP conference. Elected representatives from district councillors right up to DUP figures at Westminster declined to speak without permission from the party’s press office about their views on Brexit, the border or other controversies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/nov/26/anti-muslim-online-bots-fake-acounts","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T00:03:38Z","webTitle":"Anti-Muslim online surges driven by fake accounts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/26/anti-muslim-online-bots-fake-acounts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/nov/26/anti-muslim-online-bots-fake-acounts","fields":{"headline":"Anti-Muslim online surges driven by fake accounts","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A global network of anti-Muslim activists is using Twitter bots, fake news and the manipulation of images to influence political discourse, new analysis reveals. Many have recorded significant growth in their social media followings over the past year, co-ordinating to push the message that Islam is an “imminent threat” to western society. Researchers from the anti-racist organisation Hope Not Hate found that the impact of tweets from one controversial US activist, Pamela Geller, who is banned from the UK, is magnified by 102 bots, automated or semi-automated accounts that automatically tweet or retweet their content. Researchers also monitored a sample of popular anti-Muslim Twitter accounts in Britain and the US between March and November this year, and found that, on average, there was a 117% growth in followers. Geller, described by critics as a figurehead for Islamophobic organisations, produces the Geller Report, which doubled its viewers to more than two million people each month between July and October. The Gates of Vienna counter-jihadist blog, described by critics as a training manual for anti-Muslim paramilitaries, also doubled in visitors per month during the same period. Patrik Hermansson, researcher for Hope not Hate, said: “The growth among Twitter accounts and websites spreading anti-Muslim hate is alarming. In such a key area of public interest, it is an indication of increased interest in these views and, as each account or site grows, more people are exposed to deeply prejudiced anti-Muslim views.” The study also charts how terror attacks in the UK have been exploited by anti-Muslim activists over social media, with several prominent anti-Muslim Twitter accounts in the UK acquiring a significant number of followers in their aftermath. During the hours and days following the Manchester attack, Tommy Robinson, former leader of the English Defence League (EDL), gained 40,042 followers, an increase of 17%, with the majority – 29,396 – coming within 48 hours of the attack. Robinson gained 22,365 after the Westminster attack: he had a weekly average increase of 6,422 followers from March to November 2017. The aftermath of the London Bridge attack in June was used to illustrate how anti-Muslim activists took advantage, with 32 of the top 100 most shared tweets about the attack expressing negative sentiments about Muslims. The study also accuses Breitbart, run by Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, of spreading fake news, stating that “its reporting on Islam and Muslims is largely indistinguishable from the anti-Muslim movement’s rhetoric or even that of the far right”. The study says a network of online forums and image boards serves as an echo chamber to amplify and spread fabricated anti-Muslim social media campaigns. The most notorious recent example was the exploitation of a photograph of a Muslim woman walking past a group of people helping a victim of the Westminster attack in March 2017. The image gained traction after a Twitter user called @Southlonestar claimed the image revealed the woman’s indifference to the victim being treated. It was recently revealed that @Southlonestar was one of 2,700 accounts handed over to the US House Intelligence Committee by Twitter as a fake account created in Russia to influence UK and US politics. The image of the Muslim woman – who has since spoken of her distress at the attack and the abuse she suffered afterwards – was later superimposed on pictures after the Manchester attack. Researchers claim in their report that bots were employed to amplify Geller’s messages on Twitter, identifying at least 102 accounts that exhibit characteristics of bots, including only exclusively posting content with links to Geller’s website and being highly synchronised, meaning they post the same content at almost the same time. The simplest bots follow and retweet other users. A user with a large number of followers is generally easier to trust and may seem more “legitimate”. The more advanced bots often mix human control with artificial intelligence, and are notoriously difficult to detect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/26/observer-view-on-irish-border-farce-and-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T00:06:38Z","webTitle":"The Observer view of the Irish border farce and Brexit | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/observer-view-on-irish-border-farce-and-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/26/observer-view-on-irish-border-farce-and-brexit","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view of the Irish border farce and Brexit","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A scathing critique of the British government’s conduct of the stalemated Brexit negotiations, compiled from reports by Irish diplomats in EU countries, slipped into the public domain last week. The timing of the leak was not coincidental. It precedes a critical heads-of-government summit in Brussels next month, when Theresa May is gambling the negotiating impasse will finally be broken. This summit is shaping up to be a watershed moment for Britain’s misconceived and ill-managed bid for a deal with the EU before the door slams shut a short 16 months from now. The impact of the Irish leak was twofold. The contempt privately expressed by some EU government officials for the flailing efforts of David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, provided further evidence that they are making an epic mess of things. That’s important in terms of the shifting mood in Britain, where public awareness of the unaffordable economic and social cost of Brexit, especially a hard Brexit, is growing by the day. The leak also helped remind Westminster of Dublin’s acute worries about the likely negative consequences for Ireland, whose economy is uniquely dependent on exports to Britain and British transit routes. Such reminders are necessary. The extraordinary degree to which ministers have ignored, minimised or fudged the complex issues surrounding future border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic is nothing less than scandalous. Nearly 18 months after Britain voted to leave the EU, we still do not have a clear idea how the reimposition of a “hard border”, which nearly everybody agrees would be a disaster, can be avoided. The government’s sub-par working paper in August merely revealed the extent of its cluelessness and inattention. It was rightly dismissed in Brussels as “magical thinking”. May and many in her party seem unable to grasp that the border issue is about a lot more than trade. At stake is the ability of people and communities to connect across an island whose bitter history of subjugation, division and injustice is never far from the surface. At stake is the integrity of the 1998 Good Friday agreement, the proud, shared achievement of Labour and Conservative prime ministers. At stake is future North-South co-operation and what the Irish term the “all-island economy”. At stake, potentially, is the amicable relationship between the UK and Ireland that has been painstakingly patched together amid the gravestones of centuries of tears and blood. When the EU taskforce dealing with Brexit and the border “mapped”, or listed, specific areas of collaborative political, economic, security, societal and agricultural activity that could be adversely affected, the total was a staggering 142. They range from co-ordination on the ongoing paramilitary threat to cross-border ambulance services and bus routes. A resurrected post-Brexit border does not have to be physically imposed to still be deeply psychologically and socially damaging. The prospect of Ireland’s old dividing lines being revived and retrenched thanks to another English failure of imagination and leadership is morally repugnant. As a nation, we have been here before. Have we still not learned the lessons of our shameful Irish past? Judging by the complacency oozing out of Downing Street, maybe not. As in so many other areas of British life, when it comes to Brexit, May betrays the legacy and achievements of her more competent predecessors. The government continues blithely to maintain that all this will somehow be sorted out, claiming that Britain and Ireland are on “the same page”. This is delusional and misleading. By declaring at the outset that, come what may, Britain would leave the single market and the customs union, May has effectively ruled out a whole range of possible compromises. She has boxed Britain into a wholly avoidable corner. And the Irish are not fooled. Suggestions by one senior minister that US-Canada border arrangements could be replicated are shot down by another minister, who points out that a physically defended, guarded and patrolled demarcation of that type would be unacceptable to Dublin and the EU. Hong Kong, with its one country, two-systems arrangement with China, is seen as another possible paradigm. Even the Isle of Man is mentioned. Yet for all this blather, the bottom line is unchanging. To avoid the deal-breaking “regulatory divergence” that is anathema to Michel Barnier, the chief EU negotiator, and all the unwanted knock-on effects, Northern Ireland must surely remain in the customs union and single market or, which is much the same thing, agree to abide by its rules. As the Brussels showdown looms, the dire truth is that May and her chums still do not have an answer. They do not have a plan and appear not to have a clue. Step forward the Irish government, which, unlike the Brexiters, has been focused on the border all along. Last week’s leak was another sally in Dublin’s intensifying campaign to pressure London to stop waffling and get serious. When he met May in Gothenburg this month, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, was blunt. Dublin had noted Britain’s flat rejection of its earlier proposal that the EU border be relocated at Irish Sea ports. Varadkar’s government rejected as malicious anonymous suggestions in London that this idea was part of a devious Sinn Fein reunification plot. Varadkar played his ace. He warned May that unless he received a formal, written guarantee that a hard border would not be reintroduced, Ireland would veto Britain’s summit request that phase one of the negotiations be concluded and the talks move on to a UK-EU trade deal. Brexit-backing politicians had not “thought all this through”, Varadkar said, but now he was determined to concentrate minds. While EU member states might agree “sufficient progress” has been made on the other phase one issues – Britain’s divorce bill and citizens’ rights – Ireland would not sign off on the border, as matters stand now. This stark threat to capsize the government’s lagging Brexit timetable and torpedo the crucial trade talks before they are launched caught May by surprise. So, too, did the fact that Varadkar’s tough stance had the backstage backing of Barnier and the EU commission. Has it worked? Behind the scenes, officials are scurrying to make up for lost time, looking to convince European counterparts that a solution is attainable. Ministers, instead of fobbing off critics, are belatedly engaging. They point out, reasonably, that future arrangements at the Irish border partly depend on agreement on the broader UK-EU trade relationship. If a high-access, low-friction deal can be achieved, the border will not loom so large. If the opposite occurs, or there is no deal, all bets are off. At least they finally acknowledge the problem. May is now reduced to hoping that a number of things, over which she has little or no control, do or do not happen. She must hope her advisers can conjure up a convincing border plan in time for the EU summit. She must hope her narrow-minded allies in the Democratic Unionist party, who unhelpfully accuse Varadkar of hijacking Brexit to promote a united Ireland, will fall into line. She must hope a possible, unrelated snap general election in the Republic does not complicate matters further. And, having repeated the classic 19th-century British politician’s mistake of neglecting Ireland, May must hope the EU proves more forgiving, more flexible and more far-sighted than she."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/25/irrelevant-criminal-record-checks-harm-job-hopes","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T20:30:33Z","webTitle":"’Irrelevant’ criminal record checks harm ex-offenders’ job hopes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/25/irrelevant-criminal-record-checks-harm-job-hopes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/25/irrelevant-criminal-record-checks-harm-job-hopes","fields":{"headline":"’Irrelevant’ criminal record checks harm ex-offenders’ job hopes","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The criminal records system is hampering the rehabilitation of ex-offenders, according to new figures. Nearly three quarters of the million or so convictions revealed to employers each year in criminal records checks are more than a decade old. Only around 5,000 – one in 197 – are considered relevant to a person’s job application. The figures, released after a freedom of information request, have prompted fresh calls for overhaul of the system administered by the Disclosure and Barring Service. It has also led to claims that relying on the checks creates a culture of complacency among employers. The Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, which unearthed the information, found that, out of a total of 4.2m requests for disclosure of criminal records in 2015, just 6% produced any criminal record information. This involved 1,020,111 recorded convictions; 742,482 dated back a decade or more. About 700 – 0.018% – related to sexual offences. Only 5,167 were deemed by the centre to be relevant to the job a person was applying for. “We were really struck that hundreds of thousands of disclosures related to historic offences,” said Roger Grimshaw, research director at the centre. “A lot can change in a decade or more. It’s important that mistakes of the distant past do not prejudice people’s chances of employment and rehabilitation.” Requests for disclosure of criminal records are commonly believed to be made for employers offering jobs involving positions of trust, such as teachers, care workers or solicitors. But checks can be requested by any firm whose employees have contact with children or vulnerable adults. “Over four million roles every year involve an enhanced DBS check, and although these were designed for jobs that involve close contact with children and vulnerable groups, it’s gone way beyond that now,” said Christopher Stacey, co-director of Unlock, a charity for people with convictions. “Unlock regularly gets contacted by people who have been asked to do an enhanced check to be a delivery driver or a receptionist.” Last week The Times reported that a qualified teacher had lost two jobs after his rape acquittal in 2011 was disclosed in criminal records checks.A recent report by Labour MP David Lammy suggested that the current criminal records regime was holding back black and minority ethnic people.Earlier this year the Law Commission recognised that there was a tension between the pressure for disclosure and the need to help an offender with rehabilitation. It stated: “The law regulating the circumstances in which an individual is obliged to reveal his or her criminal record must strike a careful balance between providing that individual with an opportunity for rehabilitation (for his or her past offending to be ‘forgotten’) and ensuring that there is adequate protection in place to guard against the risk that the individual might reoffend and that, as a result, harm may be caused.” In 2013 the “filtering” of convictions was introduced, to ensure that old cautions and convictions that had not resulted in a custodial sentence would not be disclosed. However, all convictions still have to be disclosed if someone has more than one. “This can affect somebody who stole two chocolate bars when they were 14 and they’re now in their 50s,” Stacey said. “Having to relive one of the worst moments in their lives by explaining it to a stranger puts a lot of people off applying and unnecessarily anchors people to their past. The routine rejection by employers locks people out of the labour market and has a considerable financial cost to society through out-of-work benefits.” Unlock has called for introduction of a criminal records tribunal, so individuals could apply not to have their criminal records disclosed in particular circumstances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/25/stuart-broad-steve-smith-ashes-england-tactics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T13:58:42Z","webTitle":"Stuart Broad delighted with Steve Smith’s frustration at England tactics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/25/stuart-broad-steve-smith-ashes-england-tactics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/25/stuart-broad-steve-smith-ashes-england-tactics","fields":{"headline":"Stuart Broad delighted with Steve Smith’s frustration at England tactics","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"After scoring the 21st and slowest century of his Test career the Australia captain, Steve Smith, highlighted the defensive tactics employed by England. The response from Gabba favourite Stuart Broad in the opposition camp? “Perfect.” The meticulous planning of Joe Root during the home side’s first innings here in Brisbane had been widely praised during days two and three of the series opener, given five of the Australian top six fell head first into traps set by the England captain and his bowlers. Smith was the one that got away, however, with his wonderfully patient 141 not out from 326 balls providing the first standing ovation of the match and setting up a 26-run first-innings lead for the hosts. Josh Hazlewood’s two late strikes then left England effectively seven for two. The 261 balls it took the 28-year-old to reach three figures made it the slowest Ashes century by an Australian since David Boon at Lord’s in 1993 and Smith offered his thoughts on the suffocating fields that could become a feature of the series. “They were pretty defensive from the outset,” he said. “It was almost as though they were waiting for our batters to make a mistake. Unfortunately, the top four made those mistakes. It might be a series where boundaries are hard to come by. But if you bat for long enough, rotate the strike, you’ll get bad balls as the bowlers get tired.” Broad, who sent down 10 maidens in his 25 overs for figures of three for 49, said in response to Smith’s frustration: “Perfect. We know the Australians like to score quickly. If we can restrict them and stop them scoring a lot of boundaries then we’ll have periods of taking wickets.” On Smith’s epic rearguard, Broad said: “He played brilliantly and it’s what you come to expect from him in Australia isn’t it? He played with patience, was disciplined around off stump. But also credit to our bowling attack, we didn’t let him get away. “He doesn’t seem to get lbw or bowled too much. If you look at the past four years in Australia, he’s had one bowled on 170 when trying to hit it out the ground and a couple of lbws when it was reversing. The best batsmen don’t miss straight balls and the outside edge is his biggest threat. If we get a pitch with any sideways movement and more pace it brings the edge into play.” The 31-year-old was left baffled by questions about the fitness of his strike partner, Jimmy Anderson, who had a spell off the field during the afternoon. While this was explained away as a case of having some strapping on his torso redone, England’s attack did report one minor injury from their nine hours spent out in the field. Moeen Ali, who picked up two for 74 from his 30 overs, appeared to lack some snap in his delivery. While some of his rustiness could be attributed to his side strain that meant he missed all but one of England’s warm-up matches, the Observer understands the all-rounder is also suffering from a nasty cut on his spinning finger. Though the pitch has turned less as the game has progressed, Moeen could well be required to put in a significant stint when Australia bat in their second innings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/2017/nov/26/azed-crossword-2372","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T00:01:38Z","webTitle":"Azed crossword 2,372","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2017/nov/26/azed-crossword-2372","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2017/nov/26/azed-crossword-2372","fields":{"headline":"Azed crossword 2,372","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Special instructions The Chambers Dictionary (2014) is recommended.

In fact, this Chinese fighting hero is already part of phenomenon that can match both of those epics in size. For the books of Guo Jing’s creator, the author known as Jin Yong, have already sold more than 300m copies. The world’s biggest kung fu fantasy writer, Jin Yong enjoys huge popularity in the Chinese-speaking world. In the west, however, his name is barely known, largely due to the complexity of the world he has created and the puzzle that has posed for translators. Now, for the first time, the beginning of his extraordinarily popular series, Legends of the Condor Heroes, has been translated into English for a mainstream readership. It is a task that has already defeated several translators, yet Anna Holmwood, 32, from Edinburgh has managed it – or at least the first volume. Her British publisher, MacLehose Press, plans a 12-volume series, with Holmwood’s first volume, A Hero Born, due out in February. Agent Peter Buckman, who sold the rights to the series to the publisher, came across the works almost by chance as he searched the internet for “bestselling authors”. “Jin Yong was in the top 10, though I’d never heard of him; nor did I read Chinese,” he said this weekend. Comparisons with Tolkien or George RR Martin might sound overblown, but in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Taiwan, Jin Yong’s works are classics, loved like fairytales or national legends. “These books are read by so many Chinese people when they are teenagers, and the work really stays in their heads,” Holmwood told the Observer. “So, of course, I felt a great weight of responsibility in translating them – and even more as publication draws near.” Set in China in 1200, A Hero Born tells of an empire close to collapse. Under attack from the Jurchen Jin dynasty, the future of the entire Chinese population rests in the hands of a few lone martial arts exponents. A novel in the wuxia, or fighting hero, tradition, it was written under the pen name Jin Yong by Chinese journalist, Louis Cha Leung-yung. A founding editor of the Hong Kong daily newspaper Ming Pao, in the 1950s he put together a set of stories charting the progress of a young martial arts fighter during the Song dynasty and serialised them. The plots were fictional but the historical background was real. They became the biggest Chinese publishing hit of the last century. Cha, who is now 93 and lives in seclusion, created a vast imaginary world over 15 novels, which spawned films, games, comics and television shows. Buckman bought the rights and sold them on to a British publisher after meeting Holmwood and discovering how little of the series was available in English. “Anna did a sample chapter of the first of the Condor Heroes books and I sent it out to various publishers. My old friend Christopher MacLehose, who specialises in translated masterpieces, had discovered from a Chinese friend how Jin Yong’s work was like Simenon’s is to the French or Tolstoy’s to the Russians – a part of the common culture, with one generation of readers passing on their enthusiasm to the next,” he said. Although there have been academic translations published over a decade ago, including an edition of The Deer and the Cauldron translated by John Minford, attempts to tackle the wider work have been abandoned. Holmwood, who studied Chinese at Oxford University, first discovered the book in Taipei and later moved to Hangzhou, in east China, while she worked on her translation. Fellow translators are now being drafted in to help with the task, but the challenge facing all of them is to faithfully represent the kung fu moves along with the Chinese philosophies and religions that are all woven through the plot. Even the fighting skill of the warrior in A Hero Born, for instance, which literally translate as “the 18 palm attacks to defeat dragons”, is in fact derived from a Taoist classic ascribed to Lao Tzu, dating from 2,500 years ago, and has a strong philosophical element in addition to movement. “I am of the belief that a lot of readers like a bit of a challenge as they go along,” said Holmwood, who now lives in Malmö, Sweden, with her Taiwanese husband and son. That is why fans of Lord of the Rings try to learn Elvish. So I don’t explain everything, although I have written a very short prologue to introduce some of the elements of the story.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/25/new-centre-at-manus-still-a-construction-site-says-tim-costello","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-25T02:44:22Z","webTitle":"New centre at Manus still a construction site, says Tim Costello","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/25/new-centre-at-manus-still-a-construction-site-says-tim-costello","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/25/new-centre-at-manus-still-a-construction-site-says-tim-costello","fields":{"headline":"New centre at Manus still a construction site, says Tim Costello","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fifty-seven men formerly detained on Manus Island have spent the night on mattresses in a classroom because they could not be housed in the new but unfinished Lorengau centre, despite claims to the contrary by the immigration minister, Peter Dutton. “The West House, which is meant to accommodate 300 is clearly unfinished and has no kitchen facilities and is still a construction site,” Reverend Tim Costello told the Guardian. “The bathroom in the unfinished wing only has squat toilets and the shower block is currently under an inch of water,” he said, having been shown photos taken by men at the centre. “It clearly requires more than just polishing the tiles as Peter Dutton has suggested,” he said. Costello is in the Manus township for the Australian Council for International Development, which is funded by World Vision, where he is chief advocate. He told the Guardian he had met refugees on Friday night and again on Saturday morning, and had seen photographs they had taken of the facilities. He was not permitted to enter. More than 300 refugees and asylum seekers – who had been living without running water, electricity, or regular food supplies for three weeks in the old detention centre – were moved on Friday to alternative accommodation at Lorengau township. Costello said he had been shown pictures of people with lumps, bruises and scratches where refugees were allegedly hit with iron bars, but as far as he was aware there were no cases of broken bones. Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist and detainee on Manus, said the biggest immediate issue was the trauma that many men had experienced as a result of the beatings. “After four and a half years here, someone beat them. They are traumatised and humiliated,” he said by phone from Manus. “The big issue is there are no psychological facilities on Manus. They need people to talk to,” he said. Despite completion of the relocation by the PNG police, the atmosphere on the island remains tense. Costello said local police and immigration authorities had told the men they were looking for alternative accommodation for the 57 but it was not clear what would happen. There was also resentment among the local population about Australia’s actions. “Most people are friendly but there are elements who resent what’s going on, including one community leader who expressed to me the view that Australia had just walked away from its responsibilities. “Even the police commissioner feels that way: that the Australian government has just left,” he said. In an effort to sway the Australian prime minister on refugee policy, a group of Rhodes scholars has written to their fellow Oxford alumnus, Malcolm Turnbull, expressing “disapproval, horror and shame” at the treatment of detainees being held on Manus and Nauru. The tight-knit global community counts Turnbull and former prime minister Tony Abbott among its members and is made up of former international students from around the world who have studied at Oxford on scholarships from the Rhodes Trust, set up by Sir Cecil Rhodes. Forty scholars have signed the letter. While most are from Australia, there are several from South Africa, Pakistan, Canada, the US and New Zealand who have put their names to the open letter. The letter does not reflect the views of the trust itself. “It has been over two weeks since your government decided to cut off electricity and stop providing food and water to the 600 men detained on Manus. The situation is now a humanitarian crisis,” the group wrote. “Australia must finally take responsibility for the welfare of those it has detained and left languishing offshore. The fate of those men is in your hands - as is Australia’s international reputation,” they say. “We are extremely disappointed that you, as a Rhodes Scholar, have failed to act to prevent the crisis on Manus. Your lack of leadership and compassion in this instance is at odds with the values of the Rhodes community.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/24/davinson-sanchez-tottenham-hotspur-baresi","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-24T23:00:07Z","webTitle":"Graceful Davinson Sánchez brings touch of Baresi to Tottenham’s backline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/24/davinson-sanchez-tottenham-hotspur-baresi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/24/davinson-sanchez-tottenham-hotspur-baresi","fields":{"headline":"Graceful Davinson Sánchez brings touch of Baresi to Tottenham’s backline","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rarely can a club have broken their transfer record with such little fanfare. When Davinson Sánchez arrived at Tottenham in August for a fee of up to £42m, most headlines simply noted that at last Spurs had bought someone, anyone, after a summer of inactivity. Three months later, however, and that fee now seems significant because it is starting to look like a bargain. The 21-year-old Colombian centre‑half has taken to the upper echelons of club football with an ease as graceful as his running style. It was his Sánchez on Sánchez tackle that led to the free-kick which opened the scoring in last Saturday’s north London derby. But it was not a foul. Holding off the Chilean, Davinson reached his long leg around his opponent to scoop the ball away. He was Tottenham’s most composed defender on an unexpectedly torrid afternoon and carried that performance into midweek where he won his duel with Dortmund’s feted striker Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang. Sánchez combines imperious physicality with impeccable pace, but most striking is his composure. For someone so young, though the defender’s single previous season in European football was a marquee one at Ajax, he never seems ruffled. He is able to read a defensive situation effectively and choose the appropriate means to deal with it. His role model, one he acquired after involved YouTube study, is Franco Baresi. You can understand why. Yes, he makes mistakes; Aubameyang ghosted behind him to turn Andriy Yarmolenko’s glorious backheel past Hugo Lloris for the opening goal on Tuesday. But he has not made many and his manager, Mauricio Pochettino, looked pleased at being finally able to wax lyrical about his acquisition. “I am so happy with him,” Pochettino said before Saturday’s Premier League encounter with West Bromwich Albion. “He is doing well, very well. He’s only 21 years old but he is more mature than that. In only a few months, he’s showing he can do a fantastic job for us. “You see against Dortmund how many times he was with Aubameyang one v one. Or look against Swansea against Tammy Abraham, or Real Madrid against Cristiano Ronaldo. How many central defenders can play one v one and escape? How many players can be tight and press and think ‘If you run, I run’ because they are so confident in their running? Not many centre-backs in the world can do this. But we expect more from him. He’s one of the best today, but there is massive potential for him to improve.” For his manager those areas of potential include, well, everything. “Tactical, physical condition, technique, every single aspect because he’s still very young,” Pochettino said. “He arrived late in the transfer market and with no proper pre-season because he was playing in the qualification for the national team in Colombia. He had no time to work with us. We need one month and a half or two months’ pre-season with him and then I’m sure he’s going to show a different level.” Sánchez’s career to this early point has been action-packed. He has made 16 appearances for Tottenham this season, and played 45 times for Ajax as they finished runners-up in the Dutch and Europa League. Before that, as a 19-year-old, he won the Copa Libertadores with his boyhood club Atlético Nacional of Medellin. That season he learned his trade as a defender having passed through the Nacional youth system in midfield. Asked why Sánchez has adjusted to the rigours of the Premier and Champions League so quickly, Pochettino said: “Because he’s so clever, very humble and he’s very open to learn. “He’s a player that when you tell him something his reaction is to be open and be critical with himself. That is a massive skill for a player, when he’s so open to improve”. If Sánchez continues the progress he has made in each year of his career so far, Pochettino is confident his name will feature in many more headlines yet. “He has the opportunity to be one of the best centre-halves in the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/26/student-rugby-team-forced-to-cancel-event-mocking-miners-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T22:02:20Z","webTitle":"Durham student rugby team forced to cancel event mocking miners’ strike","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/26/student-rugby-team-forced-to-cancel-event-mocking-miners-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/26/student-rugby-team-forced-to-cancel-event-mocking-miners-strike","fields":{"headline":"Durham student rugby team forced to cancel event mocking miners’ strike","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A miners’ strike-themed party organised by a student rugby team has been cancelled after being criticised as deplorable by university authorities. Members of the Trevelyan College rugby team at Durham University had been due to depict the conflict between miners and Margaret Thatcher’s 1984 government. Organisers of the “Forwards vs Backs” social event, due to take place on Wednesday, asked some students to attend with “flat caps, filth and a general disregard for personal safety” and “think pickaxes, think headlamps, think 12% unemployment in 1984”. Others were asked to dress as members of Thatcher’s government, with a view to reproducing the tensions that raged between the two sides, or as “working-class-beating-bobbies” or “Falkland war heroes” to inject some “variety” to the event. However, the event was cancelled following complaints from the Durham Miners’ Association. “We were appalled to learn of a social event advertised by Trevelyan College rugby club which referred to miners in incredibly derogatory terms and sought to trivialise the police violence at Orgreave,” the association said. “We are pleased that Durham University and Trevelyan College took very prompt and appropriate action by cancelling this event. Unfortunately, this episode has caused a great deal of hurt and anger for many in the local community who are rightly very proud of their mining heritage.” Guests were told to “expect a confrontation bigger than the Battle of Orgreave”. The area around the university in County Durham has a rich history of mining, with many villages springing up around the pits during the 19th century as the demand for coal grew. At the height of coalmining in the UK, before the dependence on cheaper, foreign-bought coal, tens of thousands of miners worked in pits across the region. The miners’ strike of 1984-85 brought clashes between miners and police in villages such as Easington Colliery. The end of the dispute saw the power of trade unions significantly diminished. Owen Adams, the pro-vice-chancellor of Durham University, said: “Durham University and Trevelyan College utterly deplore this event, which is wholly unacceptable. “The event has been cancelled by the students concerned. We are speaking to those students and we are considering what further action to take in due course. “We know that most students are active and positive residents of their communities. Regrettably, there are occasions where student behaviour falls short of the standards we expect. “We have a very active education programme that explains our code of conduct for those living in the local community and aims to enhance students’ sense of belonging. This code of conduct highlights that the university reserves the right to take appropriate action against those who fall short of these standards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/nov/27/talking-points-australia-take-control-by-stealth","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T09:41:19Z","webTitle":"Ashes first Test talking points: Australia’s big guns take control by stealth | Rob Smyth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/27/talking-points-australia-take-control-by-stealth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/27/talking-points-australia-take-control-by-stealth","fields":{"headline":"Ashes first Test talking points: Australia’s big guns take control by stealth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1) Smith and Warner outsmart England’s attack Stuart Broad said before the series that England would play on the egos of the Australia batsmen by denying boundaries. But the egos never landed in Brisbane. The exaggerated patience of Steve Smith, in the first innings, and David Warner, against the second new ball, symbolised an Australia performance that had an unexpected brain:brawn ratio. With the exception of two short spells of ferocious pace bowling, they took control of the match through stealth rather than aggression. They did not just outplay England; they outsmarted them too. They are far more flexible than many realised, and do not be surprised if they show that again by selecting the uncapped swing bowler Chadd Sayers ahead of Pat Cummins in Adelaide. 2) Cook could yet find the recipe for feast In elite sport thirty-somethings are never out of form. They are either playing well or they are finished at the top level. Alastair Cook, who made two and seven at the Gabba, is the latest victim of a culture in which extreme views are so commonplace that sitting on the fence has become a virtue. Yet even by the modern standards of jumping to conclusions, the speed with which the most productive batsman in England’s history has been written off is staggering – a case of putting two and seven together to make five. No evidence has been offered against Cook, just a vague intuition that he is guilty of being past it, your honour. The mundane truth is that Cook might be on the way down and he might not. It is too early to say. He is very fit for a 32-year-old and there was nothing in either dismissal that we have not seen many times before. As with most openers, Cook’s career has been a mixture of feast and famine. Maybe he is just a bit out of form. 3) Clear heads will be needed in Adelaide An England team can prepare for losing the first Test of an Ashes tour. It is probably not a bad idea to do so, given Australia’s record in Brisbane. The hard part is coping with the immature coverage and overwhelming negativity that can follow such a defeat – especially when it is accompanied by unexpected problems like the allegations against Jonny Bairstow. Fatalism wheedles its way into the players’ lives and pretends to be their only friend. England need to have complete faith in their plans and judgment and allow cool heads to prevail in the next few days. They can double-down on Adelaide in the knowledge that, if they win the game, the mood will change at a stroke. In the meantime it might be an idea to cancel the breakfast newspapers and get everyone to delete Twitter apps. 4) Sideways movement may offer salvation Steve Smith was the highest scorer on either side in the 2015 Ashes, yet many England fans still felt he had been exposed. That was because he made four consecutive single-figure scores in the pivotal Tests at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. Those pitches offered plenty of sideways movement, which is Smith’s Kryptonite, and he was caught in the slip cordon on each occasion. Conditions should be similar in the day-night Test, which gives England legitimate hope of making life more difficult for Smith. No right-thinking person doubts that, in favourable conditions, he is almost unstoppable. England were admirably creative at the Gabba, yet he barely played a false stroke. They still need to work out how to dismiss him on flat pitches. But they will hope that issue will not arise until the third Test. 5) Supporting cast have fluffed their lines An email to our over-by-over coverage highlighted one of England’s biggest problems at Brisbane: “Much was made of the risk of Australia’s going into this match with a four-man attack. England, it appears, went in with a two-man attack.” James Anderson and Stuart Broad were beyond reproach but the others were handled with ease. We suspected Moeen Ali would be outbowled by Nathan Lyon; we did not think he would be outbowled by Joe Root. An even greater concern is the change seamers: Chris Woakes has a dreadful record in overseas Tests, even if there are some mitigating circumstances and Jake Ball haemorrhaged runs in a largely slow-scoring game. England will surely consider bringing in Craig Overton for Ball at Adelaide. Overton swings the ball and he can bat. Well, in theory: he has made a first-class hundred before but his scores on this tour are 0, 0 and 0. 6) Stokes’s absence makes for a sorry tail The one part of the first Test that really evoked the 2013-14 whitewash was Australia’s bowling to England’s lower-order batsmen, who were bombed viciously by Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc in particular. England’s Nos 8 to 11 scored 59 runs in the match; Australia’s last four batsmen scored 63 in the first innings alone. It is likely to be a recurring theme of the series, though England do have some options that may improve things slightly: they could bring in Craig Overton for Jake Ball, and switch Jonny Bairstow, who was twice out playing unnatural shots because he was running out of partners, with Moeen Ali. But a consequence of Ben Stokes’s absence is that one of England’s main strengths – their lower‑order batting – has become a damaging weakness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/26/how-to-avoid-blame-for-the-underfunding-of-the-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T19:00:18Z","webTitle":"How to avoid blame for the underfunding of the NHS | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/26/how-to-avoid-blame-for-the-underfunding-of-the-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/26/how-to-avoid-blame-for-the-underfunding-of-the-nhs","fields":{"headline":"How to avoid blame for the underfunding of the NHS","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The continuing row about health spending (Intervention by health chief meant NHS got less, 25 November) reflects the current structure of NHS governance, which is not fit for purpose. In the old days the relevant cabinet minister was unambiguously responsible for ensuring that the NHS had sufficient funding to provide an adequate health service. But, in accordance with recent fashion, NHS England was hived off as a kind of executive agency, with its chief executive undertaking a form of contract under which he was responsible for providing an adequate service. He could make representations to the Department of Health on the minimum necessary funding, but the minister would then negotiate with the Treasury and have the final say in the settlement. If the amount on offer was inadequate in his view, then given his formal role Simon Stevens could not continue in office without making clear in public that it would not be enough to maintain an adequate service. This structure, which is now widespread in the public sector, is convenient for ministers who want to avoid responsibility for day-to-day operations in public services. But the divided responsibility promotes “small government” dogma and unaccountable power. Alan Bailey (Second permanent secretary HM Treasury 1982-85), London • The government is so weak that rather than give the NHS the money it needs to function properly it cuts it back due to the intervention of the head of NHS England. Conversely of course this could be an attempt to blame Simon Stevens for the fact that the budget didn’t award the NHS anything near what it requires. Either incompetent or cynical or both. This about sums up this government’s approach. It is so busy covering its own back that the needs of its suffering citizens are ignored.

Forty people are reported to have been hurt in the incident at the packed Butterfly club in Adeje on the island in the Canaries at about 2.30am on Sunday. Revellers were sent tumbling into an empty basement after an area of floor about 4 metres by 4 metres gave way, according to reports. An Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “We are in contact with a number of British nationals who have been injured in an incident in Tenerife and are offering consular assistance.” Local firefighters said the injured included two French men, two British men, a Romanian man and a Belgian woman. Injuries included broken legs, ankle sprains and bruises. The Butterfly is a popular gay nightclub, and features drag shows and dancers on Saturday nights, according to its Facebook page. Emergency services took 21 people to hospital and treated another person at the scene who was released, the regional government said. Another 18 people went to hospital by their own means to be treated, according to the mayor of Tenerife. “After the floor collapsed, the people who were inside fell to the basement from the height of approximately one floor,” a spokesperson for the regional government told Agence France-Presse. Video posted by Tenerife firefighters showed a gaping hole right in front of the club’s stage.

It will be only the second time that the UK’s highest court has sat outside its headquarters in Westminster. Earlier this year, justices held a session in Edinburgh. At the end of April, five justices – the supreme court president Lady Hale, deputy president Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Hodge and Lady Black – will sit in the Inns of Court Library at the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast. Kerr is a former lord chief justice of Northern Ireland. Hale said: “My colleagues and I strongly believe that the experience of watching a case in person should not be limited to those within easy reach of London. This is the second time that the court has sat outside London. “The supreme court is committed to being one of the most open and accessible in the world and, like all our hearings, our Belfast cases will be livestreamed via our website for everyone who cannot get to see us in person.” One of the cases being heard in Belfast will be Lee v Ashers Baking Company Ltd. The justices will hear arguments about whether a bakery directly discriminated against a customer on the grounds of sexual orientation when the bakery said it could not fulfil an order for a cake with “Support gay marriage” written on it because of its owners’ religious beliefs. The court will also hear a case on whether a policy on allowances for widowed parents breaches human rights laws. In a separate development, the Law Society has issued a report urging the government to restore access to early legal advice on the grounds that cuts to legal aid have proved to be a false economy. The study follows a similar recommendation by the Labour-backed Bach Commission. The Ministry of Justice has begun formally reviewing the impact of deep cuts imposed by the 2012 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act. Research conducted by Ipsos Mori for the Law Society shows a clear statistical link between obtaining early legal advice and resolving problems sooner, the latest report concludes. “Without early advice, relatively minor legal problems can escalate, creating health, social and financial problems, placing additional pressure and cost on already stretched public services,” said Christina Blacklaws, the society’s vice-president. “Anyone who can’t afford to pay for early legal advice may struggle to identify solutions – meaning simple issues spiral and can end up in court, bringing unnecessary costs to the taxpayer.” The study found that, on average, one in four people who receive early professional legal advice resolved their problem within three to four months. However, after nine months, only one in four of those who did not receive early legal advice had resolved their issue. “The benefits of early advice are clear. We are calling on the government to ensure justice is accessible to those who need it,” said Blacklaws."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/nov/26/antonio-conte-chlesea-tactics-shake-up","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T17:04:33Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte shaking up title-winning tactics to keep Chelsea’s rivals guessing | Jonathan Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/nov/26/antonio-conte-chlesea-tactics-shake-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/nov/26/antonio-conte-chlesea-tactics-shake-up","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte shaking up title-winning tactics to keep Chelsea’s rivals guessing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To stand still, as Peter Reid once observed, is to move backwards. There is need for permanent revolution, constantly to be battling the twin demons of familiarity and complacency, stimulating your own players while preventing your opponents ever being quite sure what you will do next. No team can ever rely on one tactic forever: a withdrawn winger won Alf Ramsey’s Ipswich the league in 1962; it almost got them relegated once everybody had worked it out a year later. Chelsea’s title triumph last season was rooted in the 3-4-2-1 to which Antonio Conte switched after the defeat at Arsenal. Opponents struggled to break down the block of three central defenders screened by two midfield holders and they struggled to deal with two inside forwards floating in the pockets outside their own holding players but inside the full-back. The change of shape was so devastating it brought 13 wins in a row, but even by the end of the season, teams had begun to work out ways of countering it, largely by mirroring shape for shape. So perhaps it is understandable that Conte should look to move on, that he should tweak and develop the system. Anfield on Saturday was the third time this season in the league that he has preferred a 3-5-1-1 to the 3-4-2-1. He did it away to Tottenham, when N’Golo Kanté, David Luiz and Tiémoué Bakayoko provided a platform for Willian, and he did it at home to Manchester City, when Hazard played in front of Kanté, Bakayoko and Cesc Fàbregas. On Saturday it was Hazard playing in front of Kanté, Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater. Fairly clearly, Conte sees it as a system to be deployed against other top sides. A six-man central block is hard to play through for anybody; City produced one of their best performances of the season at Stamford Bridge and yet were restricted to a single goal. Philippe Coutinho was repeatedly crowded out on Saturday. But whatever the benefits of the shape in that regard, there are clear drawbacks. The advantage of the 3-4-2-1 is that it offers both stability and two players who have the freedom to take up unusual positions, probing for weaknesses. Pulling back one of the inside-forwards places a huge creative responsibility on the one who is left. Eden Hazard thrived in the first half on Saturday, supported occasionally by the forward surges of Marcos Alonso on the left and Drinkwater’s runs from deep. But in the second half, once James Milner and Jordan Henderson had got themselves sorted out, Hazard was largely anonymous until support arrived from the bench in Pedro and Willian. Not only that, but requiring Alonso to get forward so frequently – and he is highly effective at that, as was demonstrated by his winner against Tottenham – poses defensive problems. Three times in the first half simple one-twos created crossing opportunities for Mohamed Salah as he got into the space behind the left wing-back, while for much of that opening period he was able to attack Gary Cahill on the left of Chelsea’s three central defenders. That in turn was partly the result of the lack of cover offered by Bakayoko, whose adaptation to the Premier League has not been straightforward. Jürgen Klopp closed down that game of chicken at half-time, switching Salah to the left so Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain could move to the right and track Alonso, meaning both sides looked less threatening on that flank. By the end it seemed strange it had been played at all. As Conte switched through the gears, bringing on Fàbregas, then Pedro, then Willian, Chelsea became more and more threatening. All those defensive neuroses Liverpool have built up over the last few seasons were exposed again. Every ball in the box caused panic. The equaliser may have been fortunate but it was not unexpected. That it was only the second goal Liverpool have conceded at home this season is baffling. The message was clear: attack them and they will crumble. Conte was not as cautious as José Mourinho and Manchester United had been here but the ultimate question was the same: by not being ruthless in going for Liverpool’s vulnerabilities, had a title challenger rather needlessly given away two points?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/26/celtic-motherwell-scottish-league-cup-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T16:59:53Z","webTitle":"Forrest and Dembélé seal Scottish League Cup for Celtic over Motherwell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/26/celtic-motherwell-scottish-league-cup-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/26/celtic-motherwell-scottish-league-cup-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Forrest and Dembélé seal Scottish League Cup for Celtic over Motherwell","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brendan Rodgers may soon run out of Celtic records to break. Until then, at least he has worthwhile personal incentive. Celtic’s ultimately comfortable retention of the League Cup means Rodgers has become the first manager in the club’s history to win his first four domestic trophies. He is the first since the legendary Jock Stein to collect four in a row. Celtic’s unbeaten domestic record has now stretched to a staggering 65 games. One wonders what the Irishman’s next trick could possibly be. The answer, of course, resonates in the wounding events which preceded this win over Motherwell. Celtic were thumped 7-1 at Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night, a result which triggered the latest questioning of a supposedly dreamy Rodgers approach and admission here of “a sore one”. The manager’s most meaningful, ongoing challenge is to compete better in the Champions League while remaining dominant at home. “We had to tick a few character boxes after midweek and once again the players produced,” Rodgers said. “A fourth trophy in 12 months is a phenomenal achievement. The players deserve all the credit for that; they have a hunger and desire to keep going.” Rodgers said he was unaware of the historical significance of this achievement until it was mentioned to him on Saturday. “Of course, that is a very special thing to have happened. Especially when you consider this club has had so many great managers. But this is a trophy for everyone at the club.” Controversy provides a useful Scottish football backdrop, as routine, in these times of results formality. Motherwell complained vehemently about the penalty award which triggered Celtic’s second and decisive goal. The runners-up had a case, given how easily Scott Sinclair toppled with Cédric Kipré in close quarters. Kipré was also dismissed, which only added to Motherwell’s sense of grievance. “For me, there was no contact,” the Motherwell manager, Stephen Robinson, said. “It completely changes the game. It is hard to take, a defeat in that manner. I would rather have been pumped 6-0 or 7-0. He hasn’t laid a finger on him, he hasn’t touched him. It is so hard for the boy [Kipré] to take, sent off in his first ever cup final.” To suggest Sinclair was not touched at all represented exaggeration from Robinson but there is no question the former Aston Villa player embellished the situation. That, or he has a balance issue. Rodgers said of the Motherwell complaint: “It’s always that way, isn’t it? I look and think it’s a penalty. The defender cannot get there so impedes him, pulls him. I definitely thought it was a penalty.” Sinclair was equally adamant. “I felt a little tug on the arm and went down,” he said. Two wrongs don’t equal a football right but Kipré had been fortunate to stay on the pitch after an early, wild challenge on Moussa Dembélé that somehow went unpunished. In truth, as will inevitably be lost in the wave of noise, Celtic seemed on course for victory at the penalty juncture anyway. After a dire first half – which would have suited Motherwell perfectly – James Forrest broke the deadlock with a curling, left-foot finish after cutting inside to collect a Callum McGregor pass. Equally valuable for Celtic was an outstanding Craig Gordon save from Louis Moult’s close-range header. Gordon was among those to receive fierce criticism following events in Paris. Dembélé dispatched the spot-kick which was the upshot of the Sinclair affair. Leigh Griffiths rattled the post as Celtic chased a third, as did Moult with the final kick of the game. This was to prove the precursor to celebrations from Rodgers and his players which, domestically at least, have become so familiar. “The culture we create allowed us to come into today with a real positive attitude, to work well, and the players showed that,” said Rodgers. “They put real energy into the game and the quality of their football at times was very, very good. It was a great victory for us.” Dons see off Kilmarnock with ease Two early goals and a fine Stevie May effort extended Aberdeen’s impressive run at Rugby Park with a 3-1 win over Kilmarnock. The Dons struck twice in the opening 15 minutes to all but seal a comfortable three points and a seventh consecutive Scottish Premiership win in Ayrshire. Kenny McLean opened the scoring after just 54 seconds before Kirk Broadfoot’s own goal as Aberdeen took immediate control. Jordan Jones pulled one back in the second half but a fine piece of individual play from May saw him grab his fourth of the season and a welcome win for the visitors before Jones was sent off late on following a clash with Shay Logan.

But demand is now threatening to outstrip supply, leaving Spaniards facing steep price rises in their most prized Christmas delicacy. The recent lifting of import restrictions has allowed top-of-the-range ham to find its “rightful place in the market, alongside caviar and truffles”, René Lemée, the head of exports for the famous Cinco Jotas brand, told El País newspaper. The Chinese, pork lovers par excellence, have now been seduced by jamón ibérico. The problem is that the best ham takes years to produce and, as demand outstrips supply, it is pushing up the price by as much as 10%. A 7.5kg leg sells at between €150 and €600 (£135-£540). Spanish ham comes in many forms, but to be defined as jamón ibérico de bellota (acorn-fed Iberian ham), which is what the Chinese want, it must first come from Iberian blackfoot pigs, or from 50% crossbreeds. These pigs must then spend several months of the year roaming the dehesa, a pasture planted with oaks, feeding on grass and acorns. During the last few months before being slaughtered they must live exclusively on this diet. Not only are there relatively small areas of dehesa – mostly in north-west and western Spain – but each pig needs about two hectares (five acres) to fulfil its needs. Once slaughtered, the animals’ legs are plunged into vats of salt and hung and dry-cured over a range of temperatures for a minimum of 36 months, with the best hams cured for about 48 months. “It’s inevitable that the price in Spain is going to rise,” said Roberto Batres, the director of Shanghai de Delaiberia Gold, which exports ham, wine and olive oil to China. “The companies licenced to trade in China don’t have enough jamón de bellota to meet Chinese demand.” In an effort to meet demand the Chinese have started importing raw frozen pork from Iberian pigs and curing the meat themselves, although Batres says the product is excessively salty. The production and consumption of top-quality ham is the subject of the same awe and mystery as the making of fine wine. Cutting de-boned jamón de bellota on a ham-slicing machine is regarded as sacrilege. The leg must be bolted on to a frame called a jamonero and then cut by hand using a long, narrow blade. Most towns in the ham-producing areas of Extremadura, Castilla y León and Andalucía hold solemn ham-slicing competitions, often attended by hundreds of spectators. “They have established a ham-cutting school in China and a professional association,” said Batres. “That’s a sign of how far the product has penetrated the local market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/26/irene-blackburn-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T16:38:51Z","webTitle":"Irene Blackburn obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/26/irene-blackburn-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/26/irene-blackburn-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Irene Blackburn obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My grandmother, Irene Blackburn, who has died aged 99, was known for her sense of fun and her ability to laugh at herself. She was often very funny – both on purpose and inadvertently, such as the time we went to see the musical about the life of Buddy Holly and she thought the real Buddy Holly was in it. Irene was born in Leeds, the only child of Eva (nee Clayton), a maker of butchers’ aprons, and John Farrar, who worked for a leather company. She attended Cross Flatts school in Beeston. She recalled that she once beat the main playground bully by turning on him with the stick he used to beat other children. Having left school at 14, Irene worked in various jobs, including as a machinist at the tailors Campbell, Stewart and McDonald, making clothes for retailers such as Marks and Spencer. During the second world war she worked as a telephonist at the Post Office in Leeds city centre. At this time, Irene met and married Les Blackburn, who was a womenswear cutter at Campbell, Stewart and McDonald, and they set up home in Harehills. Their first daughter, Olwyn, was born in 1945. My mother, Avril, was born in 1948, this time with the help of the new NHS. In 1966 Olwyn emigrated to Australia and went on to have four children of her own. Irene enjoyed several trips to Canberra to meet her grandchildren, who christened her Supergran due to her small stature and formidable nature. I will remember her travelling in the car, marvelling at the countryside, giving a running commentary on everything she saw. Even in the last years of her life, she continued to take a delight in the things around her. Les died in 1993. In 1997 Irene formed a relationship with Syd Barstow, who ran a newsagent’s shop in Leeds; Syd died in 2010. She is survived by Olwyn and Avril, her granddaughters, Mary-Ann, Sue Ellen, Cherie and me, and by six great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/26/safety-fears-as-junior-doctors-left-to-run-aes-and-other-hospital-units","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T21:30:05Z","webTitle":"Inexperienced doctors are being left in charge of A&Es, regulator warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/26/safety-fears-as-junior-doctors-left-to-run-aes-and-other-hospital-units","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/26/safety-fears-as-junior-doctors-left-to-run-aes-and-other-hospital-units","fields":{"headline":"Safety fears as junior doctors left to run A&Es and other hospital units","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The safety of hospital patients is being put at risk because inexperienced young doctors are too often being left in charge of A&amp;E and other units, Britain’s medical regulator has warned. Understaffing and pressures on senior doctors mean trainee medics are being forced to “fend for themselves” by looking after patients whose conditions they are not qualified to treat, said the General Medical Council, which has shared the findings of an in-depth study with the Guardian. “We are very worried when trainees tell us that they have been put in a position where they have been asked to act above and beyond their clinical competence and capabilities. That’s a concern because it creates very clear risks to patients from doctors who may not know what they’re doing,” said the GMC’s chief executive, Charlie Massey. “In some cases trainees are being left to fend for themselves when they clearly don’t have the competence to make the decisions about patients’ treatment that are being asked of them. That’s a real concern. Significant proportion of trainees, especially those early in their careers, feel very exposed in terms of what they are being asked to do,” added Massey. “Trainees left in this situation feel agitated and anxious that they don’t have enough supervision and worried that they might inadvertently cause harm to patients,” he added. The boss of the regulator warned that junior doctors who act beyond their competence “are at risk of losing their licence” if the care they give a patient proves to be substandard and damages the patient’s health. In its annual survey of the education and training received by Britain’s 55,000 junior doctors, the GMC heard about incidents that caused it concern about them being left in charge, despite their inexperience. In one hospital a group of young foundation-year doctors not long out of medical school began an overnight rotation in the A&amp;E unit despite having had no induction or assessment of their skills. “There was a very real risk that they could be working beyond their competence because they were on a night shift with limited supervision, therefore they might have had to undertake tasks for which they weren’t qualified,” said Massey. In another emergency department a foundation-year doctor on duty in the resuscitation unit called three times for support from senior colleagues but no one came to help her. “She had no choice but to make decisions about that patient herself, even though she wasn’t confident that she was competent to do so.” Senior medics in a third A&amp;E unit reported that junior doctors were displaying symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, such as continually interrupted sleep and uncertain decision-making. “That worried them and that worried us.” Dr Sarah Hallett, the deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s junior doctors committee, said: “It is an all too common problem that many junior doctors move into new posts without a thorough induction. “This is not the fault of senior doctors, who we know are under immense pressures and face ever-increasing workloads in a health service that is more and more overstretched. Despite this, it is crucial that junior doctors have access to appropriate training, and are able to work in an environment that is safe for both them and their patients.” A year on from the junior doctors dispute in England that prompted eight walkouts by trainees, the number rating their training as good or very good remains high at 76%. However, “a worrying number of doctors in training continue to raise concerns about heavy workloads and shortness of sleep while on duty, with some missing educational opportunities because of these pressures”, the GMC’s report says. About 40% of trainees across all four home countries said their workloads were heavy or very heavy, although that is slightly fewer than last year. 54% work beyond their rostered hours, either daily or weekly. 22% regularly feel short of sleep while they are on duty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/27/clark-details-industrial-strategy-productivity-business-watchdog-white-paper","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-27T00:01:08Z","webTitle":"White paper to set out industrial strategy in bid to boost UK productivity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/27/clark-details-industrial-strategy-productivity-business-watchdog-white-paper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/27/clark-details-industrial-strategy-productivity-business-watchdog-white-paper","fields":{"headline":"White paper to set out industrial strategy in bid to boost UK productivity","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government is to highlight five key areas where the UK needs to improve its performance when it reveals on Monday the details of a new industrial strategy designed to increase productivity. Greg Clark, the business secretary, will announce the creation of an independent watchdog to monitor progress made in boosting innovation, upgrading infrastructure, increasing the level of workplace skills, ensuring that the strength of the City is reflected in funds for companies and spreading prosperity to all parts of the country. A white paper to be published by Clark will also reveal that the government intends to set up long-term strategic deals in four sectors seen as having growth potential: construction, life sciences, automotive, and artificial intelligence. New investment in the UK by the US-owned life sciences company Merck, known as MSD in Europe, creating 950 jobs, shows the benefits of the sort of partnership between Whitehall, the private sector and universities the government wants to create in its four sector deals, he will say. “Our life sciences sector is one of the UK’s fastest developing industries, with a turnover in excess of £64bn, employing 233,000 across the UK. “MSD’s commitment today, and the wider sector deal investment we have secured, proves the process outlined in the industrial strategy can give companies the confidence and direction they need to invest in the UK. It will ensure Britain continues to be at the forefront of innovation and represents a huge vote of confidence in our industrial strategy.” The white paper’s focus on five core areas follows extensive consultation since the publication of a green paper at the start of the year. Clark believes the need for an industrial strategy has been made all the more pressing by last week’s budget, in which the Office for Budget Responsibility halved its forecast of the UK’s long-term productivity trend to 1%. The white paper will note that the need for the UK to seize available opportunities has been made more important by the Brexit vote. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, announced plans in the budget to raise UK spending on research and development from 1.7% to 2.4% of national income by 2027, a fillip to Clark’s goal of fostering new ideas and turning them into commercial products. The government thinks extra spending on R&amp;D could mean bout £80bn of additional investment in advanced technology in the next decade. But Clark also wants the white paper to concentrate on some of the other factors he believes explain the gulf between UK productivity and that of countries such as Germany. In particular, he wants the white paper to focus on Britain’s poor skills record, its under-investment in infrastructure and on narrowing the productivity gap not just between the south-east and the rest of the UK but also within regions themselves. Clark has also been receptive to the idea proposed by the CBI that there should be an independent industrial strategy commission – based on the OBR model – to provide an objective assessment of progress towards the white paper’s goals. The paper will identify four grand challenges, global trends that the government sees as shaping the future: artificial intelligence; clean growth; an ageing society; and future mobility from driverless cars to drones. Industrial strategy went out of fashion in the Conservative party after the defeat of the 1974-9 Labour government by Margaret Thatcher. But Clark believes a new approach based on competition rather than on picking winners will help address Britain’s long-term problems. The business secretary believes the government has a role to play in putting UK companies at the vanguard of the new wave of technologies such as robotics and genomics, but he also thinks the white paper can help improve productivity in more traditional sectors, such as food and drink. “We are at one of the most important, exciting and challenging times there has ever been in the history of the world’s commerce and industry,” Clark will say. “We are renowned for innovation and discovery, with some of the best universities and research institutions in the world producing some of the most inventive people on earth. “We have commercial and industrial sectors – from advanced manufacturing to financial services; from life sciences to the creative industries – which are competitive with the best in the world. “But any serious strategy should address the weaknesses that stop us achieving our potential, as well as our strengths, and this industrial strategy does that. Britain’s productivity performance has not been good enough, and is holding back our earning power as a country. “So this industrial strategy deliberately strengthens the five foundations of productivity: ideas, people, infrastructure, business environment and places.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/26/robert-mugabe-taking-things-very-well-say-relatives","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-26T16:44:42Z","webTitle":"Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe ‘taking things very well’, say relatives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/26/robert-mugabe-taking-things-very-well-say-relatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/26/robert-mugabe-taking-things-very-well-say-relatives","fields":{"headline":"Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe ‘taking things very well’, say relatives","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A “jovial” Robert Mugabe is “taking things very well” five days after stepping down as president of Zimbabwe after 37 years in power, close associates and relatives have said. Gideon Golo, the former central bank governor and the former president’s business adviser, said Mugabe was in good spirits when he last saw him on the morning before the inauguration of the country’s new leader, Emmerson Mnangagwa, on Friday. Mugabe was forced to resign by a military takeover, which led to popular protests and impeachment in parliament, but only after negotiating a deal that guaranteed immunity from prosecution, protection for his business interests, and a $10m (£75,000) cash sum. The same protection is extended to his family members and relatives. Mugabe, 93, will also keep his salary of $150,000. His wife, 52-year-old Grace, will receive half after his death. “He is fine. I have been to see him; he is quite jovial. He is actually looking forward to his new life, farming and staying at the rural home. He has taken it well,” Leo Mugabe, a nephew, said. The former first lady was now concentrating on plans to build a university in his honour. “I like the spirit she has … she is with him all the time. She is an amazing person. She wants to continue planning the Robert Mugabe University so they have something to do,” he said. In August, Zimbabwe announced plans to build the $1bn postgraduate university in Mazowe, 20 miles (35km) outside Harare. The plan drew fierce criticism. Mugabe’s rule left Zimbabwe with a worthless currency, vast debts and a devastated infrastructure. One local Zimbabwean newspaper reported that the ageing autocrat wept as he signed his resignation letter last Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/30/floating-nfl-players-an-ex-gunner-in-bulgaria-and-adelaide-ashes-tests","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"Floating NFL players, an ex-Gunner in Bulgaria and Adelaide Ashes Tests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/30/floating-nfl-players-an-ex-gunner-in-bulgaria-and-adelaide-ashes-tests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/30/floating-nfl-players-an-ex-gunner-in-bulgaria-and-adelaide-ashes-tests","fields":{"headline":"Floating NFL players, an ex-Gunner in Bulgaria and Adelaide Ashes Tests","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"1) Remember former Arsenal midfielder Conor Henderson? Probably not as he only played one FA Cup game for them, admittedly in a 5-0 win over Leyton Orient, before spells at Hull City, Crawley Town, Grimsby Town and Eastbourne Borough. Well the English-born midielder has only gone and scored a 94th minute winner for his current club FC Pirin Blagoevgrad against the also superbly named Cherno More Varna. As injury-time winners go, a free-kick in off the bar isn’t a bad way to pick up the points for a team at the wrong end of the Bulgarian ‘First Professional Football League’ (we didn’t come up with the name), as proved by the excitable celebrations from the midfielder and his giddy team-mates. 2) American football is getting weirder by the week. Following on from the mystery of the disappearing USC player, The Buffallo Bills’ Zay Jones defies physics and floats back to his feet in the NFL match against Kansas City Chiefs. We’ve watched this numerous times and still can’t understand what’s going on. 3) Fifty-five hardy souls braved temperatures of -30c to compete in the Antarctic Ice Marathon, which takes place 600 miles from the south pole. The winner, Frank Johansen from Denmark, skipped through the ice and snow wearing thermal layers while intermittently stopping for hot food and drink, in a very respectable three hours and 37 minutes. 4) South Yorkshire is not famed for its November sunshine so goalkeeper Felix Wiedwald could be forgiven for not taking a cap with him for Leeds’s trip to Barnsley on Saturday. The German goalkeeper’s squinting and using his hand as a makeshift visor was not sufficient in stopping the sun’s rays, so rather than summon the kitman, Wiedwald turned to the travelling Leeds fans from where he was given a plain black cap to ensure the shiny thing in the sky troubled him no more. To make things better Leeds won the game 2-0 and Wiedwald returned the cap to his new friend and gave him his goalkeeper jersey, too. 5) The second Ashes Test starts on Saturday in Adelaide, a ground that has been a less unhappy hunting ground for England than some Australian venues in recent times. Take 2010, for example, when Kevin Pietersen’s sparkling double-hundred laid the groundwork for a comprehensive innings victory. Different times. There have been some English horror stories though, none more painful from a tourists’ perspective than their slow-motion crash on day five in 2006 at the hands of a Shane Warne-inspired Australia. Though Mitchell Johnson’s evisceration of England four years ago lives in the memory too. Going further back, it was an Adelaide Ashes Test where the bodyline controversy was at its most heated. Here’s some hot Larwood-on-Australia action from 1932 6) David Thornhill just went to watch his beloved Norwich City play Preston but the Canaries fan was forced into action as an emergency fourth official after an injury to an assistant referee.

Jeff Fairburn declined to say how much he would donate or which charities would receive the money. He said the uncapped bonus scheme was drawn up before he became chief executive in 2013 and he regretted that his company’s performance had been overshadowed by uproar over the payout. He said he decided some time ago to give some of his bonus away but that he had wanted to take an “old-fashioned approach” and keep the decision private. “It’s now clear that this belief was misplaced and so I am making my plans public and recognise that I should have done so sooner. I am setting up a private charitable trust which I plan to use to benefit wider society over a sustained period of time by supporting, in a very meaningful way, my chosen charities. “I would like to make it clear that I did not seek these levels of award nor do I consider it right to keep them entirely for myself. Once it became apparent that our outperformance would lead to a very significant award for me, I made plans to use a substantial proportion of the total to support the charities that are particularly important to me and my family.” Fairburn’s announcement follows mounting uproar over the record-breaking bonus plan, with Persimmon accused of benefiting from the taxpayer-backed help-to-buy scheme. There has been widespread criticism from corporate governance groups, politicians and the boss of rival housebuilder Redrow, Steve Morgan, who described Fairburn’s bonus as “very, very wrong”. Persimmon’s chairman and senior independent director have quit the board over the scheme, set up in 2012, which will hand more than £500m to 140 senior staff. Fairburn has collected £50m of shares and will qualify for another £60m this year.

The number of problems related to treatments such as lip fillers and Botox has almost trebled, jumping from 378 in 2016 to 931 in the space of 12 months, according to data from Save Face, a government-approved register of accredited practitioners. Experts have put the dramatic growth down to a rise in the number of celebrities, including US reality TV star Kylie Jenner, openly discussing their procedures. This has resulted in a rise in demand, they say, leading to unqualified practitioners offering basement deals online. Data shows 83% of procedures were administered by non-medics. “In the last year we have received an alarming increase in reports of procedures gone wrong and rogue practitioners,” said Ashton Collins, the director of Save Face. “Reality stars get free treatments if they promote them all the time on social media. It plants the seed and people like Kylie Jenner and Kardashians are constantly in the media for having treatment, so as popularity for cosmetic procedures rises, sadly, as does the number of unscrupulous people who want to make money out of it,” she said. The highest number of complaints were about dermal fillers, with the vast majority linked to lip procedures. The most common problems included people complaining of uneven results, unsightly lumps and nodules, unusually painful swelling and infection. One of the biggest risks with injections that go wrong is that a patient could develop necrosis, a form of cell injury that results in the premature death of cells. This can lead to permanent scarring. Figures show 72% of all complaints last year were from patients who had found the practitioner on social media. The Guardian was able to access several Facebook pages offering cheap lip fillers for between £100 and £140. Save Face said it had hundreds of reports from accredited members who had treated patients who suffered from serious complications after treatment. Doctors and campaigners called for more action to make sure rogue operators were not allowed to practice. There is no regulation around dermal fillers, and they can be administered without medical training and practitioners can buy the products online. “There needs to be more regulation and work done to educate the public that these are medical procedures and lip and dermal fillers can have really catastrophic permanent side-effects if they go wrong,” Collins said. Simon Eccles, consultant plastic surgeon and Secretary of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS), agreed there should be more education for those putting in fillers, as well as the public. He noted a rise in the number of patients coming to him after procedures went wrong. “If you are going to buy a car, you don’t say ‘I want that red car over there’. You want to know more about it. People need to know what to ask when they get these procedures. Have you had training? How long have you been doing this for? What are possible complications or side-effects?” he said. Eccles saw one woman recently who had filler in her upper lip and three weeks later she developed necrosis. “It left scarring on her lip and nostril. If the person who had done the procedure had recognised the complication it could have been dealt with straight away but they didn’t and that led to significant problems,” he said. In 2013, Bruce Keogh, then the medical director of NHS England, recommended a number of restrictions on the cosmetic surgery industry after the PIP scandal, in which breast implants made from unauthorised silicone ruptured at twice the rate of other implants. He called for regulation to ensure staff were qualified, and for appropriate record-keeping of the use of filler products. Dan Poulter, the Conservative health minister at the time, said the recommendations needed to be fully implemented to tackle the “cowboy cosmetic practitioners damaging and injuring people”. Tijion Esho, a cosmetic doctor at the Esho Clinic who features on E4’s Body Fixers, said: “The government really needs to take action, as this is no longer a private sector problem. Patients with adverse outcomes now are seeking desperate help at our A&amp;E departments and GPs where medical staffing may not be trained to see these emergencies. I wrote to Jeremy Hunt earlier this year highlighting the issue.” Renée Hoenderkamp, a GP and owner of the Non-Surgical Clinic, London, said: “People need proper training and proven credentials before they do it [cosmetic procedures]. Patients should not be able to go to people’s kitchen and have it done there, it needs to be in a proper clinic. You need to have insurance … otherwise what happens when things go wrong?” Hoenderkamp added: “I am seeing lots of young girls who want lip fillers … I’ve seen people with the wrong products put in, or with it put too close to the surface so they develop nasty lumps and sometimes it’s put outside of the lining of the lip. Often they are not properly consented with no information given about what could go wrong before the fillers are inserted.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Since Sir Bruce Keogh’s comprehensive review, we’ve improved the safety of cosmetic procedures through stronger regulations, better training, robust qualifications for practitioners and better information – including giving the Care Quality Commission new powers to rate cosmetic surgery clinics – all of which will allow people to make informed decisions about their care. “We also urge anyone seeking a cosmetic procedure to take the time to find a qualified, reputable and registered practitioner.” CASE STUDY ‘It looked like it was migrating from my lips to my face’ A little bit over a year ago I booked to get my lips done based on a recommendation I got. When I turned up to get the procedure done, the woman was practising from her house. The procedure was very uncomfortable and it took a lot longer than I imagined. Alarm bells were ringing because it was different to usual injections I have had – I’d always gone to a nurse for my Botox. This treatment took a very long time and was incredibly painful. I don’t believe I was numbed up. Before I left she kept saying to me, “If you get any lumps just massage them out.” It all felt really lumpy but I didn’t really panic too much. I kept massaging, but it was incredibly painful and so swollen that eventually I was struggling even to do that. After a few weeks I started to notice the swelling was going down but there was what seemed like a little hole on the right side of my mouth. I noticed that product was leaking from it. Again, I wasn’t panicking too much because I didn’t know what to expect. I messaged the woman who had done my treatment on Facebook, as that is how we had been corresponding. She told me that it could be an infection and to just leave it well alone. If it got worse she told me to contact her again. A few months passed and the unevenness was so obvious. The product almost looked like it was migrating from my lips to my face. I now know that means it had been inserted into the wrong part of my lips. I messaged again to ask if she could fix it, and if not give me my money back so I could go elsewhere. She replied saying she was shocked and offended and that she wasn’t going to help me. I left it a bit longer. I was trying to wear lipstick to cover it all but it still looked like I had a scar where the product was sort of moving into my face. I wrote to the woman who did my procedure to say that if she did not give me my money back I would consider legal action. I sent a message over with the pictures of my face and she wrote back straight away. She said she’d fix it but I asked her to get a doctor or a nurse in. I thought: “I don’t want you anywhere near my face.” Eventually I got looked at by a professional. The problems arose because the product had not dissolved and steps were then taken to break it down. I had to go back for a few sessions. Eventually, the lumps on the left side and the scars on my face went but there is still product left. It was too painful to get it all out, but I’d had enough of injections in my mouth for about a lifetime. I’m now in the process of taking legal action agains the practitioner. The whole process has taught me the hard way not to take people at face value and opt for cheap treatments advertised on social media. What seemed like a good deal at the time actually ended up costing a great deal more in the long run both emotionally and financially.

Now the medium is taking it to another level, with a string of podcasts being turned into TV shows. Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson’s brilliant podcast 2 Dope Queens has already hit HBO in the US, creepy online dating tale Dirty John is in production and Pod Save America from Obama’s smart-talking former scriptwriters will come to HBO as part of their mid-term coverage. But which podcasts should be the next to make it to the small screen? Ear Hustle Life inside San Quentin’s prison is the antithesis of the edgy but ultimately playful world’s of Orange Is The New Black and Prison Break. A glimpse into what it’s really like behind bars would make a shocking but moving TV show. Finding a happy ending might be tricky when prisoners are talking about how cell mates spend every night threatening to kill them, but Ear Hustle for the eyes (Eye Hustle, if you will) would be as gritty as it comes. If narrators Earlonne Woods (serving 31 years to life) and Antwan Williams, who’s been in prison since he was 18, remain as warm and appealing as they are on a podcast, TV could make stars out of them. Athletico Mince Football’s parallel universe would make the best Saturday afternoon sports show ever. The hilarious rambles of Bob Mortimer and Andy Dawson provide the perfect relief from posturing punditry and their wares would easily translate to TV. OK, so there’s very little football left in it, but who cares when the Mince can dish up the latest from Steve McLaren’s Hair Island. Chuck in a few match predictions from Peter Beardsley, a fans’ phone-in and a voiceover shouting “Gooooal” and get ready to crown the Saint and Greavsie of the new millennium. The Butterfly Effect With Jon Ronson Move over The Deuce, Ronson’s podcast about the evolution of the porn industry would make fascinating TV. Even if the telly version just focused on how German tech geek-turned porn king Fabian Thylmann came to dominate the world of adult entertainment there’d be enough scope for a great story. But what would be even more fascinating would be Ronson’s unglamorous exposé of how porn stars fall out of favour in those “fallow” years between popular search terms like teen and – hideous acronym incoming – MILF. Ronson’s sensitive storytelling would really come to life with the visuals to match. My Dad Wrote A Porno If BBC Three and ITV2 don’t start a bidding war for the rights to this millennial juggernaut of a podcast, there’s something wrong with the world. Pots-and-pans saleswoman Belinda Blumenthal would waste no time setting up her own casting couch and yet more smut would ensue as actors queue up to audition to play the “unspeakably beautiful” heroine. Daisy Ridley and Charlotte Crosby are fans, but whoever gets the part would have to be broadminded to say the least as scenes of naked horse box romps and lusty behaviour at sales conferences are guaranteed. The Orbiting Human Circus (of the Air) One of the weirdest podcasts out there, Neutral Milk Hotel’s Julian Koster aural variety show would be a challenge for programme makers. Koster and his mysterious broadcasts from the top of the Eiffel Tower is an assault on the ears (in a good way), so you can only imagine what it would do to the eyes. Come to think of it, a show that’s like Stranger Things meets The Greatest Showman could be amazingly bad or everyone’s new telly obsession.

Heavyweight Jonathan Goldstein’s mission to revisit people’s regrets “like a therapist with a time machine” is podcast gold and would make a cracking low-key documentary. Moments where lives went wrong, from lending Moby some CDs to being hit by a car, are crying out for some soft focus interviews and long shots of subjects looking out of sun-dappled windows. The Nod It would be too simplistic to suggest that Britanny Luse and Eric Giddings could be the new Will &amp; Grace. Or even the new Karen and Jack. But they need to bring The Nod to Netflix. The hosts’ friendly rivalry gives rise to many an important debate and their “Good For The Blacks?” strand could stand alone as a panel show in which the merits of Drake, The Bachelorette and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s relationship are thrashed out. Missing Richard Simmons There’s both joy and intrigue in the tale of the fitness instructor who inspired his Lycra-clad disciples with mantras like: “Sweat is just fat crying” but then disappeared, leaving no trace. Simmons’ story would make a bleak comedy in a world as hyper-colourful and shiny as The Good Place, particularly if he’s sitting in luxury laughing at all the people who are trying to track him down. Put Steve Carell in a pink toweling robe and pass him a Kale Martini and he could slip right into the role. The Guilty Feminist Surely the time for an edgy, female-led discussion show is now, so the Guilty Feminists should wave their placards until it gets commissioned. Deborah Frances-White and her razor sharp guests have so much funny material they’d be a post-watershed delight. Confessions such as “I’m a feminist, but I once worked with a man so handsome I secretly hoped people would think I’d slept my way into the job” could make this lot the Loose Women de la nuit. The Joe Rogan Experience What Graham Norton and Jonathan Ross need right now is a rival who will shake things up. One who’ll let their guests talk for three hours straight. One who won’t stop them when they want to go into detail about their experience with ayahuasca or love for mixed martial arts. And one who’ll challenge them to a cage fight if the mood takes him. Rogan could not just revolutionise the Friday night sofa chat show, but rip it up and throw the couch out of the window."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/14/york-realist-review-donmar-warehouse-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T10:49:58Z","webTitle":"The York Realist review – town and country clash in Peter Gill's moving romance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/14/york-realist-review-donmar-warehouse-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/14/york-realist-review-donmar-warehouse-london","fields":{"headline":"The York Realist review – town and country clash in Peter Gill's moving romance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The intersection of class and sex has long fascinated dramatists: you only have to think of August Strindberg, DH Lawrence and John Osborne. Peter Gill’s beautiful play, first seen in 2001, owes a lot to that tradition, but Robert Hastie’s revival, shared between the Donmar and Sheffield Crucible, reminds us that it adds a layer of understated poetry. The situation is relatively simple. George, a farm labourer living in a tied cottage with his mother, gets involved with John, who has come up from London in the 1960s to work as assistant director on a revival of the York Mysteries. What is moving is the way their affair is tacitly accepted by George’s family. But this is also a play about the way art has, over the centuries, become the property of the middle classes. One of the reasons George is hesitant about appearing in the Mysteries, initially performed by medieval guild members, is that the cast is made up of “doctors and that”. One of the play’s best scenes shows George’s family returning from a performance and nervously expressing their enthusiasm. As George’s mum says, “It was very Yorkshire, wasn’t it? Not that I mind.” Among the many gulfs in the play, as Hastie’s production subtly reminds us, is that between town and country. The eyes of Jonathan Bailey’s John shine with naive excitement as he takes in the world of cowsheds and kitchen ranges, yet you know that, emotionally and professionally, he is irrevocably metropolitan. Ben Batt’s George is similarly rooted in rural Yorkshire, and when he cries, resisting a move to London, “I live here”, he makes it sound like a declaration of religious faith. Both actors are excellent and, even if Lesley Nicol as George’s mum seems a bit stagey, there is a lovely performance from Katie West as a local girl devoted to George, even though she is well aware of his sexual preference. At one point she quotes a line from the Bible – “There is no remembrance of former things”, but Gill disproves that by unforgettably showing how, in England, class both was, and probably always will be, a dividing factor. • At Donmar Warehouse, London, until 24 March.

Speaking at a child protection summit in Stockholm, Mordaunt said she would attend an appointment with the NCA after meetings with charity leaders, regulators and experts in recent days. “While investigations have to be completed and any potential criminals prosecuted accordingly, what is clear is that the culture that allowed this to happen needs to change and it needs to change now,” she said. Her comments come as pressure mounts on the charity over revelations that staff used sex workers in countries including Haiti and Chad. Marks &amp; Spencer, which has run a “Shwopping” partnership with Oxfam since 2008, said it was monitoring how the charity dealt with the situation. The actor Minnie Driver became the first celebrity patron of Oxfam to step down in the wake of the scandal. Mordaunt has stopped short of stripping Oxfam of its government funding, but insists the charity provide full details of those involved in the misconduct to authorities in the UK and abroad to allow legal action to begin. Allegations have also emerged that one of the aid officials embroiled in the scandal was forced out by another British charity seven years earlier following an investigation into the use of sex workers. Roland van Hauwermeiren is said to have agreed to leave his job with Merlin in Liberia in 2004 following an investigation into sex parties with local women, according to the humanitarian news website Irin. Merlin, a medical emergency relief charity, has since merged with Save the Children. Van Hauwermeiren went on to work for Oxfam in Chad and Haiti, where the charity’s staff are alleged to have used sex workers. An investigation by the Times found Van Hauwermeiren resigned from his role as the head of mission in Haiti in 2011 after admitting that prostitutes had visited his villa there. He later worked for the French charity Action Against Hunger as country director in Bangladesh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/14/the-uk-is-divided-and-the-worse-for-it-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T10:41:18Z","webTitle":"'The UK is divided and the worse for it': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/14/the-uk-is-divided-and-the-worse-for-it-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/14/the-uk-is-divided-and-the-worse-for-it-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'The UK is divided and the worse for it': your best comments today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A piece on making a positive case for the UK to remain in the EU, Australia’s banning of over-the-counter codeine, and an analysis of Australia’s government-run endangered species projects have got you talking today. To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. Fear and abuse won’t change Brexit minds If there is a strong and positive case to be made to those who voted against despair, surely it’s best made now, writes Hugh Muir. ‘The truth is this country is divided and it is the worse for it’ The whole point is the grievances that need addressing can not be tackled properly at all by leaving the EU, in actual fact they are made worse. Worker’s rights, the economy, educational opportunities, a level playing field, individual rights and opportunities for the young are all ways of addressing social inequality and all were safeguarded by the EU, the network of rights and the collaboration of countries aiming for prosperity and peace. The truth is this country is divided and it is the worse for it. BobinDay ‘I don’t think anyone who voted Leave is under any illusion’ I reluctantly voted Leave. I haven’t changed my mind for one simple reason; it was a long-term decision and we haven’t even left yet. It’s like investing; you take a long-term view with it. Short-term volatility is expected and it you ended up tracking the movements of the FTSE on a daily basis, like some people have been with Brexit, then you’d end up going out of your mind. I don’t think anyone who voted Leave is under any illusion about this. FatherChewyLouie ‘A new referendum would be an outbreak of sanity’ I think you’ll find it’s the deceitful Brexit vote and subsequent delusional and anti-democratic behaviour of the UK government which has damaged the UK’s standing. Reversing that via a new referendum based on what’s actually on offer instead of pie in the sky would be an outbreak of sanity which still wouldn’t heal that fully, but it would be a start. rd232 Making codeine prescription-only was right. Where do we go from here? The restriction will save lives. But people need better support to move beyond codeine and take control of their pain, writes Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz. ‘Pain is not going to go away by taking away a drug that very effectively stops it’ Disastrously stupid decision. Pain is not going to go away by taking away a drug that very effectively stops it and regardless of what so called experts say, it does. It’s just going to clog up Bulk Billing surgeries with people on weekends. Silky48 ‘If it was ineffective for treating that kind of pain, no one would use it’ I would agree that the evidence clearly shows low dose codeine is ineffective for chronic pain. But many users of this product are using it for acute pain, not chronic. A toothache, period pain, a sprained ankle. If it was ineffective for treating that kind of pain, no one would use it - at least not more than once. But it is effective. People need to be able to treat acute short term pain without having to run to the GP for a prescription. Soniaahhh ‘Official management: been there, done that, useless’ There will always be someone like me chipping in with their personal pain story, in my case an ever-worsening spine from hell. I have several boxes of disprin/codeine bought over the counter in advance of all this. The point is that they will still be there after a year or more because I use them sensibly, mainly to get sleep, the best cure for pain. As for official management: been there, done that, useless. That is where the frustration lies. At 75 I was managing very nicely thank you and have been for years. Now my discipline use counts for nought. ronnycraven ‘Absolute scandal’: how does restoring a ship help endangered species? The Australian government is providing $255m to projects it says will benefit threatened animals and plants – yet there is little chance the species actually occur at many of the sites. ‘There’s a resource starvation in the rest of the country’ This article regarding the spending of threatened species funding indicates bizarre choices of projects. I support a thorough audit of the program. Is funding being directed to projects, not based on outcome priorities, but on whether the local MP is LNP or the electorate is marginal? It is difficult to understand the logic of spending decisions, if this report is accurate. I am not questioning the value of the works being undertaken but there is a suspicion they are being classed as threatened species projects when that is not the case and perhaps other more valuable projects are not being prioritised for funding. Beekeeper49 ‘It’s all about tax cuts to big business’ More evidence of this government’s lies and hypocrisy. They pay lip service to the welfare of our nation but their greedy small minded agenda is purely to look after the top end of town. Our environment and quality of life means nothing to them, it’s all about tax cuts to big business. moneytherootofevil Comments have been edited for length.

Bye... Meanwhile, my colleague, Ed Aarons, sends word that Adam Pengilly, a British IOC member, has been advised to go home after an altercation which left a security guard injured. It sounds like a guard tried to block his way, he ran past, and the guard fell ands hurt himself. Full story to follow presently, but for now you can read about it here. In the men’s ice hockey, Czech Republic lead Korea 2-1 while Canada are 4-1 up on Switzerland - both are playing the third period. Elsewhere, Canada and Sweden are locked at 6-6, also playing an extra end. GB are now second in the table behind Japan, who are 2-0. They really needed that – a second defeat and they were in all sorts. And after an extra end too! With one stane apiece remaining, it’s still one to China in the house ... but they run too far with their final effort, leaving it dead centre. If GB can play off it, they win... So at 7-7, End 11, we have a Chinese timeout. They have one stone in the house, two left to play, and GB have the hammer. Japan have beaten Korea 7-5... Right then, scran is done, so I, I being Daniel Harris, am back. Here comes End 11 ... China’s captain, Wang Bingyu, plays a marvellous draw with the final shot of the 10th end, and a tie means we will play another end. Great Britain, though, will have the hammer. Eve Muirhead and co are still very much in this. Down on Sheet D, where Korea are vying with Japan, there is whooping and cheering but Muirhead is a picture of focus, as Great Britain attempt to topple China here. The Great Britain team are all smiles out there on the ice at the moment, as Sloan sends another China stone packing. With only a couple of shots left each in this end, this really is the business end of things. A good first shot from Lauren Gray puts Great Britain into a healthy position as China ready themselves to respond. Muirhead earns Great Britain another shot and, with the 10th end to play, they nudge themselves into a 7-6 lead. China have the hammer but trail. A great effort by China, with an ambitious shot from the skipper but surely Great Britain will take a point in this ninth end now. The worst that can happen is that they would be level-pegging going into the final end ... As Great Britain take a time out in the curling, take a break from the action by having a wander through our gallery of day six in Pyeongchang: Back to the curling, where Anna Sloan has just played a lovely shot to give Great Britain half a chance of picking up a point or two in this ninth end. Geisenberger, Ludwig, Wendl and Arlt seal victory in 2.24.517mins. Canada take silver and Austria, who got under way with David Gleirscher, take bronze. That is Germany’s ninth gold of the Games. Muirhead plays two brilliant shots, to counteract the work of Bingyu Wang, the China captain. China have one shot to respond, but with no room for error, they take their time over getting out of a bit of pickle. But when Wang eventually delivers the final shot of the eighth end, they hit the jackpot so to speak. China lead 6-5. In the men’s ice hockey, Czech Republic lead Korea 2-1 while Canada are romping away with the lead, 4-0 up over Switzerland, also in Group A. Hello! Let’s get straight into things. And at the Gangneung Curling Centre, Eve Muirhead’s Great Britain team trailed China 5-3 but have pulled level to 5-5. They are on the eighth end. Still to come? There is men’s biathlon and in the luge relay, Latvia currently lead the way. Anyhow, I’m off for a scran; Ben Fisher will guide you through the next part of the day. Meanwhile, in the curling, China lead GB 5-3, playing End 7; GB have the hammer. That really was an incredible performance from Bloemen, who smashed the Olympic record which Bergsma had only just set. Bloemen is loving the moment, greeting into his hands, and well he might. Bergsma gets silver for Netherlands, Tumolero bronze for Italy. “Speedskating reminds of the old description of football paraphrased: They all have a turn, then the Dutch win,” emailed Mike MacKenzie. He has since thought better of it, emailing: “Speedskating reminds of the old description of football paraphrased: They all have a turn, then the Dutch win. But once in a great while a Canadian wins!” A former Dutch Canadian, but who’s splitting hairs. Sven Kramer is 11.81 seconds outside Bloemen’s time! He’s not even going to get a medal unless he can lift it! Bloemen is already celebrating! In the biathlon, Boe of Norway still leads. Kramer is 3.01 down on Bloemen – which is a chunk, but not insurmountable by any means. Email! “I don’t know if you know,” begins Biggie Smalls Dennis Verweij “that this morning, the Dutch press released a story in which Bergsma’s coach Anema received an official warning letter from the Dutch skating federation for match fixing in the 2014 Sochi games. But this was never released to the public until the story dropped today. The reason for the match fixing seems to be that as associate also with the French national skating federation, Anema approached the Dutch national coach, Koops, to ask that the Dutch to skate slower during the team pursuit so not to over take the french team. This is so the French team could save some face and not lose their funding.” I did not - thanks very much. With 18 laps to go, Kramer is more than a second outside Bloemen... This is worth your time... Sven Kramer has won every Olympic event but this one - “I don’t race to race, I race to win,” or commentator quotes him as saying. He’s going to have to go some... In the women’s curling, GB have closed to 3-4 against China, but need a double-point End or a steal. They’re playing the sixth. He shaves 2.21s off the mark Bergsman just set, and doesn’t he just love it! What can Sven Kramer do about it? He’s about to set off in the final pair... He’s flagging but he’s pushing! Bloemen is going for gold! He takes the ball at -2.1s! Well Bloemen is piling into Bergsman! He’s 2.4s inside him at 9200m! With about half the field in the clubhouse, Boe of Norway still leads the men’s biathlon. Ted-Jan Bloemen, who came second to Kramer in the 5000m, is underway. Nicola Tumolero of Italy is also on the ice. I’ve just been told that my email was incorrectly entered above, so if you’ve been trying to send me genius, please do so once more. But still in the hutch is Sven Kramer, who is no slouch himself. Good luck old mate. He is 13.56s inside the previous leader, finishing in 12:41.98. My word. This is staggering from Bergsma, who hasn’t even got to the sprinting at the end yet. Bergsma is taking this event apart. He’s -11.23 with eight laps to go! Bergsma is -8,.93 inside Lee! It might be time to start thinking about records... Excellent from China’s skip; thanks to her final stone, they pick up three from that End 4, and lead gb 4-2. In the biathlon, Johannes Bo of Norway now leads In the curling, GB are in strife; they’ve got one go left this end, but China have the hammer and three stanes in the hoose to their none. Right, we’re back underway in the speedskating ... well we were then we weren’t a long hold on set leading to a false start. Ghiotto of Italy and Bergsma of Netherlands are back on the line. We’re about to get going again in the speedskating, crowd still buzzing after Lee’s wild run. Can anyone catch him? GB took the third End with the hammer to lead 2-1. Can they steal? The speedskating is halfway through, so they’re taking a break – to polish the ice or somesuch would be my guess. Fredrik Lindstroem of Sweden leads the men’s 20km individual biathlon for the now. Lee is absolutely flying - “I just love endurance, something just happens to me,” he recently said. OPh man! He is inside the time by -3.97! The crowd love that! They are absolutely going for it! China have equalised against GB’s women in the curling. They’re now 1-1 playing the third End. Next up we’ve got a little and large affair: Lee of South Korea, who is a whippy type, and Geisreiter of Germany, who is an obelisk. Belchos picks it up with two laps to go, finding another gear as his coach berates him. And what an effort! He’s -0.42, so takes the lead and that was a serious amount of suffering he endured at the end there. Belchos is now +0.62 with four laps to go. Swings still leads. Back in the 10,000m, Belchos is bousting, 4.29 seconds inside Swings’ time at 13 laps. Bokko is bushed. GB have just taken the first end 1-0, with the hammer. The men’s biathletes are just getting going, so all of a sudden there’s all sorts going on. Good. Belchos of Canada and Bokko of Norway are underway, while GB’s women’s curlers, who lost to USA earlier today, are playing End 1 against China. Tsuchiya has closed the gap a bit as the distance begins to bite, but Swings puts it in too and finishes in 13:03.53, 6.67s ahead. Tsuchiya of Japan is nearly nine seconds behind Swings of Belgium with nine laps to go. Neither of these is expected to contest the medals. Right then, the men’s 10,000m speedskating is underway. That involves six heats of two and 25 laps of the track. We’re not far off live sport, I’m pleased to report. This is what we’ve got for you: Women’s aerials in the freestyle skiing 11am GMT Women’s and men’s preliminary ice hockey 12.10pm GMT Luge team relay – luge team relay! – for medals 12.30pm GMT Ski jumping from 11am GMT Men’s 10,000m speedskating final 11am GMT Tangentially, I didn’t realise that our venue’s full name was “PyeongChang Wednesday afternoon”. You live and learn. I just don’t know anymore, I really do not. After winning gold, Shaun White apparently let a bit of Old Glory drag on the snow. This from the Washington Post: “However, that happy moment was marred for more than a few viewers because of the way the 31-year-old handled the flag. At a news conference in PyeongChang Wednesday afternoon, the four-time Olympian said he wasn’t aware he’d let the flag touch the ground. ‘I remember being handed the flag. I was trying to put my gloves on and hold the flag and the board,’ he said. ‘Honestly, if there was anything, I definitely didn’t mean any disrespect. The flag that’s flying on my house right now is way up there. Sorry for that. But I’m definitely proud — very proud — to be a part of Team USA and being an American and to be representing for everyone back home.’” And here they are yesterday. I have recently been alerted to the Norway men’s curling team’s troosers. In the women’s ice hockey prelims, Finland have beaten OAR 5-1. Top of that group are USA and Canada, who are both 2 and 0. More on that... Oh. Other Shaun White stuff. In the men’s ice hockey, Sweden have beaten Norway 4-0. Earlier today and also in that group, Germany beat Finald 5-2. Fancy something to read? I interviewed Zoe Gillings-Brier, GB’s top snowboard crosser, who is terrifyingly impervious to fear. In the third period of that men’s ice hockey, which has been confiscated from our tv screens in favour of an ice skating rerun, Sweden now lead Norway 4-0. Aw! Did you know that... Chimene “Chemmy” Alcott-Crawford is named after Sophia Loren’s character in El Cid? Something I’ve learnt this Games: Chemmy Crawford-Alcott is really good on the telly. Does she know anything about football? Otherwise, things are a little quiet for the next bit. However, I do still have love for the street. We’ve got the men’s biathlon coming up at 11.20am GMT. Kuzmina gets silver for Slovakia, and Dahlmeier, who already has two golds this Games, adds a bronze to it. Amanda Lightfoot is 68th. She’s 22! It looks like Dahlmeier will catch Preuss, but probably not Kuzmina. Dahlmeier’s coach is alongside her hollering as she dances uphill, exhorting her to even greater feats. Meanwhile, Oeberg celebrates, laughing and wailing. It’s very pleasant to see. Dahlmeier is shooting needing five from five for a medal ... and down they go! She’s now pacing it around the track to see how high she can get ... but surely she’s not going to pick up 31.2 seconds? Oeberg is nearly home. Preuss of Germany has just nailed her shooting, and she’s chasing Kumina hard for silver. BBC seem to think that GB’s Amanda Lightfoot is “eyeing glory”; the leaderboard seems to think she is “47th”. Dahlmeier of Germany, who has won gold in the two biathlon events so far, is on the charge. She’s got plenty of time to make up, but not too much such that she’s out of it. Back to ripping yarns of winter sport, here’s my tip: if you’ve no idea what you’re doing, have a lesson before you’re body is too battered and bruised to be responsive. In the biathlon, we have a new leader: Oeberg of Sweden. She’s served her time and would be a popular champion... Period two is did, and Sweden still lead Norway 2-0, but where they were showboating earlier, now they’ve been forced to compete. Anyone got any winter sports stories? I once skied into a tree at Uxbridge dry ski-slope – beat that if you dare! Kuzmina still leads the biathlon, but there are plenty of athletes still out there. Here’s Sean Ingle from Pyongchang with a little snippet of Elise Christie. Team GB’s Elise Christie, whose hopes of a 500m short track speedskating gold medal ended with a dramatic crash and plenty of tears, insists that she is over what happened on Tuesday night - and is looking forward to going for a medal in the1500m on Saturday. “I picked myself up the next day,” she said. “I’ve heard from Jessica Ennis and Kelly Holmes and they are my two biggest heroes and it’s overwhelming they’ve messaged me.” Four years ago in Sochi, Christie followed heartbreak in the 500m with disqualifications in the 1500m and 1000m. But she maintains that she is now a much stronger athlete and is confident there won’t be a repeat performance. “This is a total opposite feeling to Sochi and I feel ready to go again,” she said. “I’m super focused for the 1000m, which is my last event, because that’s my favourite and best distance.” However she promises that she won’t change her all-or-nothing aggressive style, which has brought her three world titles but plenty of Olympic heartache. “I’ll still be racing fearless,” she said. “I’m trying to enjoy the moment I’m in and not focus on everything that has gone wrong.I know I’m capable of medalling in the 1500m because I’m the world champion.” Norway can’t take advantage, and then have a player caught in the nose by a skate. He leaves the ice, claret abounding, but seems ok. Meanwhile, in the ice hockey, Norway have a two-man advantage so take their timeout to give their players a breather and sort tactics. They have 40 seconds to do something, but more importantly, this is playing on the PA. Gotta love 1992. In the women’s 15km individual biathlon, Anastasiya Kuzmina of Slovakia currently leads. Different strokes, different folks. On the ice, Norway have had a player sent to the sin-bin after a little scuffle; a scufflet. After their best period of the match so far, Norway are now short-handed. Not Winter Olympics-related, but you should definitely furnish your morning with requisite anger by reading this. As noted by Owen Gibson on Twitter: “Did the FA use this deal to promise to keep up the pressure on worker’s rights? They did not. But they did agree to arrange some friendlies.” It’s still 2-0 Sweden in the ice hockey, but Norway are putting it in this period, making it harder for the favourites. GB men’s curling team are pleased to have beaten Japan 6-5. They actually competed pretty well last evening in losing to Canada, the defending champions, so will have decent confidence going into tomorrow’s game with Sweden. The women’s biathlon is underway – helpfully, all the official site told us was that it’d been rescheduled. But guns are on backs and skis are on snerr – or is it snurr? In the men’s skeleton, Dom Parsons is 0.03s off a bronze medal following today’s first run. He’s also got a new syoot, which has caused some consternation. Here’s Sean Ingle on that... It’s the end of the first period, and Sweden still lead Norway 2-0. Also in their group are Finland and Germany; the former have already beaten the latter. What’s it like to do the skeleton? I daren’t even contemplate, but here’s Barry Glendenning put through his paces by Lizzie Yarnold. We’re at the ice hockey rink watched a men’s prelim. Sweden, the favourites, have been pounding away and Norway and have just bundled home their second goal for 2-0. Which is to say that we’re neither replete nor angishtukt with current activity, but hey, let’s talk! Morning all! In the next little passage, for your de-lectation we have: Women’s aerials in the freestyle skiing 11am GMT Men’s and women’s preliminary ice hockey LIVE Luge team relay – luge team relay! – for medals 12.30pm GMT Ski jumping from 11am GMT Men’s 10,000m speedskating final 11am GMT What’s happened We’ve had some medalling. Settle in … Team USA’s Mikaela Shiffrin took gold in the women’s giant slalom, putting her in a favoured spot to retain her Sochi gold in Friday’s slalom event. France’s Pierre Vaultier clung on to his Olympic men’s snowboard cross title, pipping Australia’s Jarryd Hughes, who had to settle for silver, his country’s second second place of these Games. Norway’s Ragnhild Haga won a gruelling women’s 10km free cross-country skiing, ahead of Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla, and Norway’s Marit Bjoergen and Finland’s Krista Parmakoski, who share third spot on the podium. Aksel Lund Svindal won Norway’s first ever men’s downhill gold medal at a Winter Games (I know! But it’s true). And Germany’s Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot got not only a gold but a world record in the pairs free skating. I’m now throwing the live blog stone in the direction of Daniel Harris. He’s got the rest of the day covered. The men’s curling round robin session 3 is done and dusted. Here’s where they finished up. USA 9 - 10 Italy Norway 4 - 7 Canada Team GB 6 - 5 Japan Denmark 7 - 9 Switzerland The top four teams in the group qualify for the semi-finals – I’m just waiting for official confirmation on which four that’ll be. Team GB’s Elise Christie, whose hopes of a 500m short track speedskating gold medal ended with a dramatic crash and plenty of tears, insists that she is over what happened on Tuesday night and is looking forward to going for a medal in the 1500m on Saturday. I picked myself up the next day. I’ve heard from Jessica Ennis and Kelly Holmes and they are my two biggest heroes and it’s overwhelming they’ve messaged me. Four years ago in Sochi, Christie followed heartbreak in the 500m with disqualifications in the 1500m and 1000m. But she maintains that she is now a much stronger athlete and is confident there won’t be a repeat performance: This is a total opposite feeling to Sochi and I feel ready to go again. I’m super focused for the 1000m, which is my last event, because that’s my favourite and best distance. However she promises that she won’t change her all-or-nothing aggressive style, which has brought her three world titles but plenty of Olympic heartache: I’ll still be racing fearless. I’m trying to enjoy the moment I’m in and not focus on everything that has gone wrong.I know I’m capable of medalling in the 1500m because I’m the world champion. The Norwegian holds on to that top spot and gets the gold to prove it in the women’s 10km free cross-country skiing. Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla swoops up behind her for silver. And we have a shared – or, I’m going to wager they’ll hammer out two medals – bronze for Norway’s Marit Bjoergen and Finland’s Krista Parmakoski. Scandinavian athletes: very good at cross-country skiing, it turns out. We’re going into the final end of the men’s curling round robin session 3: let’s see where we’re up to. USA v Italy stands at 9-9. Norway have slipped behind Canada 4-5. Team GB and Japan are level-pegging at 5-5. And Switzerland have a 7-6 advantage over Denmark. I mean, fair enough. It’s pretty tiring just watching them. They’re still flying in the women’s 10km free cross-country skiing – Norway’s Ragnhild Haga currently tops the leaderboard. Elise Christie, upon whose shoulders much of Team GB’s medal hopes rest, was “heartbroken” after finishing fourth in the women’s 500m short track final. But a message from Olympic superstar Jess Ennis-Hill seems to have lifted her spirits. As it would for most of us, frankly. Christie still has the 1500m and 1000m to come. We knew she was unassailable in top spot, but here’s the official confirmation. 1 Mikaela Shiffrin (USA) 2 Ragnhild Mowinckel (Nor) 3 Federica Brignone (Ita) Aksel Lund Svindal today won Norway’s first ever men’s downhill gold medal at a Winter Games and hardly anyone was there to see it. According to Reuters, only a couple of thousand spectators made it to the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. Not even the North Korean cheerleaders popped by. Svindal was a bit disappointed: I think it’s a little bit strange, to be honest, that we’re having the Olympics and there’s that few people in the stands, and it’s a bit sad. If we had this race in Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Sweden it would be packed, it would be 50,000 people, probably in the US too. Team GB’s Dom Parsons says his high-tech kit could yet make all the difference as he recovered from two poor starts to be 0.03 seconds off a bronze medal at the halfway stage of the men’s skeleton. The 30-year-old from London’s start times only put him 20th and 21st in the field of 30 competitors. But aided by his new aerodynamic kit, which has been the talk of these Winter Olympics, he rapidly picked up speed to finish his runs in 50.85 and 50.42 sec. That left Parsons in fourth, 0.91 seconds behind the South Korean Sungbin Yun, who has the advantage of having slid hundreds of times on his home track compared with the half-a-dozen practice runs his rivals have enjoyed. However the Briton sits just 0.17 behind the Russian Nikita Tregubov and 0.03 behind Latvia’s Martin Dakurs – and is hoping a combination of better starts and his game-changing skin suits can make a difference. “Those little differences you can make in technology do have an impact,” he said. “It is a bit like F1, obviously not with the same kind of budget or divas as some have a reputation for.” The men’s curling round robin session 3 rumbles on, and Italy have now pulled ahead of the US, by 9-3. Norway has also leapfrogged Canada: that’s now at 4-3. It’s now 4-2 for Team GB over Japan. Switzerland have edged further ahead of Denmark at 5-4. At the halfway mark in the women’s 10km free cross-country skiing, and home favourite Lee Chaewon is ahead. Or was – Australia’s Barbara Jezersek has just spoiled her fun. Under way right now is the women’s 10km free cross-country skiing, which the competitors can probably complete more swiftly than I can type out the name of the event. Sweden’s Hanna Falk currently leads. Earlier we saw a world record and a gold medal fall (not literally) to Germany’s Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot in the pairs free skating. Reuters has this roundup: Savchenko and Massot wowed the judges with a brilliant and haunting performance to claim both a pairs free skate world record and an Olympic gold medal as they rallied from fourth place to the top of the podium on Thursday. Outside the medal places after a disappointing short programme on Wednesday in which Massot doubled a triple jump, the two performed a flawless free skate and fell to the ice in tears after finishing their routine. After waiting anxiously for three more pairs to skate, they both wept when the gold was confirmed, with Savchenko, who claimed two Olympic bronzes with former partner Robin Szolkowy, sobbing in Massot’s arms as he pressed his face into her hair. Snapping off a flawless series of jumps and flowing choreography, the two broke their own world record in the free skate with 159.31 points for a total of 235.90. Silver went to Chinese world champions Sui Wenjing and Han Cong, who narrowly missed out with a total of 235.47, as Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford secured bronze for Canada. North Koreans Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik were out of sync on a double Axel but their inspired free skate still earned them a personal best score of 124.23 points. They finished 13th overall with a combined total of 193.63 points, another personal best. Let’s check in on the curling, where the men’s round robin session 3 is in full, yet precisely controlled, swing. The US and Italy are neck-and-neck on 6-6. Canada lead Norway 3-2. It’s also 3-2 for Team GB over Japan. And Switzerland have Denmark at 5-3. The winners of that thrilling snowboard cross big final have their tiger teddies, if not yet their medals (you can read why here) and they look pretty pleased. To confirm, France’s Pierre Vaultier took top spot, Australia’s Jarryd Hughes silver, and Spain’s Regino Hernandez rounded out the podium. You can read our report here: As Mike catches his breath after that snowboard finale, I’m stepping in for the next couple of hours of live and chilly sport. The women’s giant slalom continues, but Team USA’s Mikaela Shiffrin will not be beaten at the top of the leaderboard; she’ll just need to sit through a few more rounds before that gold medal is officially hers. Norway’s Ragnhild Mowinckel and Italy’s Federica Brignone are currently in the other podium positions. What a thrilling end to the men’s snowboard competition. Disappointment for Pullin and Baumgartner in the end, but Jarryd Hughes can be mighty pleased with his silver, Australia’s second of the Games, and third overall. And that’s all from me for now. My colleague Claire Phipps is on deck to take over, so until next time. Snowboard cross final: And we’re off! Vaultier is fastest out of the traps... big air from Pullin and he falls, as do Baumgartner and Dierdorff! And there’s no catching the Olympic champion, who defends his title! Hughes claims a magnificent silver! And it’s bronze for Hernandez! Mikaela Shiffrin is poised to take gold in the women’s giant slalom. All top 30 riders are done and dusted and with a huge gap separating them and the rest of the field, it would take something quite special (and incredibly unlikely) for the American not to win. Norway’s Ragnhild Mowinckel is in the silver medal position, and Italy’s Federica Brignone bronze. Snowboard cross semi-final 2: Baumgartner is indeed in this race, despite what I claimed earlier, and the American leads early before complete havoc breaks out! Every rider except Baumgartner falls, leaving him to cruise over the line. At one point it doesn’t look like he’ll be joined by anyone at all but Hernandez gets himself up makes second. Dierdorff, eventually, crosses in third, but it’s disappointment for Noerl, Robanske and Lindfors. So, two Americans and two Australians will contest the final with the reigning Olympic champion, Pierre Vaultier of France, and Regino Hernandez of Spain. Oh dear, Olyunin has had to be stretchered off the course. It doesn’t look like he’ll be competing in the small final. Snowboard cross semi-final 1: The three Australians are in this one but only three can go through – and it’s a strong heat. But Pullin and Hughes do it! That pair are left to their own devices after Bolton goes down and a pile up does for the others! Vaultier eventually crosses in third but Olyunin and Haemmerle are out of medal contention! Concern for Bolton as he calls for medical attention. Let’s hope he’s OK and can compete in the small final. Snowboard cross quarter-final 4: Baumgartner, the veteran American, is through! He finishes secod sandwiched in between Noerl and Lindfors. OK, we’re getting closer to the business end of things. The first semi-final is coming up. Snowboard cross quarter-final 3: Four fallers! Carnage behind the front two Hernandez and Dierdorff. They’re allowed to cruise to qualification, before one of the fallers, Christopher Robanske of Canada, eventually appears to secure third place, a mile behind the two leaders. Kearney of the US is one of the unlucky ones. Snowboard cross quarter-final 2: Bolton and Pullin line up alongside each other in the middle of the six riders at the top of the hill and they’re both through by the time they get to the bottom! But it’s a close call for Bolton, who starts well but slips back to fourth before a misjudged jump and nasty fall from Godino opens the door. Bolton crosses the line in third, Pullin’s in second, with Olyunin first. Snowboard cross quarter-final 1: Top three go through, three head home. And Jarryd Hughes is safely through, in second, but there’s some concern for Scharirer who loses control midair and stacks it behind the leaders towards the end of the course. Vaultier and Canada’s Kevin Hill join the Australian in the semis. Scharirer, despite landing heavily on his back, is back on his feet though, and we can all breathe a sigh of relief. Snowboard cross 1/8 final 8: Oh this could be good news for the remaining competitors as two real contenders – Omar Visintin and Lucas Eguibar – fall early in the final heat. Italian Emanuel Perathoner and the popular American Nick Baumgartner are left pretty much on their own to complete the course. Mateusz Ligocki, a mile behind, takes third. And that’s that for the first round. We’ve got four quarter-finals to come, then two semis and two finals (one small and one big). Snowboard cross 1/8 final 7: Another faller in the seventh heat – it’s Daniil Dillman of OAR who loses control on a jump – and young Eliot Grondin of Canada doesn’t do much better as Germany’s Martin Noerl takes first place. Snowboard cross 1/8 final 6: Here we go! Finally some carnage! Sadly, it Australia’s Adam Lambert who’s involved, clipping Lluis Marin Tarroch and taking the Andorran down. Lambert manages to regain his feet, but the damage has been done and he doesn’t make it through. Hagen Kearney of the US wins the heat having avoided the drama unfolding behind him. Snowboard cross 1/8 final 5: Jonathan Cheever sneaks through in third but it’s disappointment for his fellow American Mick Dierdorff, whose fourth place is not enough. The women’s giant slalom second run is under way. Three skiers down so far and Czech Ester Ledecka is the early pacesetter for now. Snowboard cross 1/8 final 4: Chumpy Pullin is up next, and like Bolton before him, he fizzes out into an early lead. He looks confident throughout, gets some nice air on several jumps and crosses the line in second. That’s enough to put him into the same quarter-final as his compatriot Bolton. Nikolay Olyunin (OAR) and Michele Godino of Italy are also through. Snowboard cross 1/8 final 3: Here goes Cam Bolton, and the Australian bursts out to lead early on. Clearly that’s the best place to be, and he manages to stay out there for much of this heat, staying out of trouble before being overtaken by Swiss Jerome Lymann on the final straight. Merlin Surget of France completes the top three. Snowboard cross 1/8 final 1: The potential for disaster in this event is high, but Jarryd Hughes encounters no problems as he, Pierre Vaultier of France and Markus Schairer of Austria go through. Before we focus on the snowboard cross, an update from the figure skating: Germans Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot have set a pairs free skate world record of 159.31 points after a sensational performance. The duo broke down on the ice after bettering the previous record they had set at last year’s Grand Prix final. This just in: 16 Olympics staff and spectators were injured when winds ripped through venues yesterday, causing considerable damage and postponements to several events. “Sixteen people had slight injuries, 13 were operational staff and three were spectators,” Games spokesman Sung baik-you said. “They suffered light injuries, were treated and then sent home.” Sixty tents were slightly damaged, Sung added, before wind speeds returned to normal levels this morning. Here’s Chumpy on the telly. He likes the beach as well as the mountains, apparently. Good stuff. Adam Lambert is another of four Australians in the finals; Jarryd Hughes and Cameron Bolton are the others. All go in separate heats, of which there are eight in total, with five riders in each. The top three in each heat go through. For the US, Jonathan Cheever and Mick Dierdorff go together in heat 5, while Hagan Kearney and Nick Baumgartner are also in action. For the record, Great Britain aren’t represented. So, there it is! I think we can say with some certainty that Svindal has become Norway’s first men’s downhill gold medallist! There are still several to go, but all are lower ranked skiers and none will threaten the old man of the slopes. Compatrior Kjetil Jansrud claims silver and Beat Feuz has to settle for bronze. Meanwhile, the snowboard cross finals are nearly upon us – we’re about 20 minutes away. Incredibly, if Svindal can do it, it will be Norway’s first men’s downhill gold medal at a Winter Games. It’s the one event that has always eluded the winter sports-mad nation, but the 35-year-old is on the verge of breaking that particular duck. And barring a massive surprise, his fellow Norwegian Kjetil Jansrud will take silver and Beat Feuz bronze. Svindal appears set for gold in the men’s downhill. The Norwegian’s 1:25.67 remains untouchable, and there aren’t too many other realistic contenders at the top of the hill remaining. He’s nervous, for obvious reasons, but with each run now he’s nearing glory. Meanwhile, the power of sport and all that: The issue of Great Britain’s super sleek skinsuits has raised plenty of debate over the past few days in the run-up to today’s start of competition. Even the Guardian has been prompted to post an editorial on it: Also high on the terror table, skeleton, is a fascinating sport, not least because it’s difficult to understand why anyone would throw themselves, head-first, down a hard icy track at high velocity. Our very own Barry Glendenning attempted to get inside the heads of these fearless souls a couple of years ago. Here are his findings: Back to the present day, and the first two men’s skeleton heats are done and dusted. Brilliant home favourite Yun Sungbin delighted the local crowd by dominating both sessions, clocking times of 50.28 and then 50.07, and the world the generally by wearing a pretty natty Iron Man helmet. Britain’s Dom Parsons impressed in his completely legal skinsuit with fifth and third, while Ghana’s Akwasi Frimpong, who has attracted his fair share of pre-Games interest, came in last (30th) in both runs but still managed to garner (excuse the pun) huge support. Let’s check in with the pairs free skating event at the Gangneung Ice Arena. Canada’s Kirsten Moore-Towers and Michael Manrinaro have been ousted from the gold medal position, falling to fifth, with Italy’s Valentina Marchei and Ondrej Hotarek now leading the field with an overall total of 216.59. Their nearest rivals are the Olympic Athletes from Russia, Natalia Zabiiako and Alexander Enbert in second on 212.88. The men’s downhill is in full swing. It really is a terrifying event. If you’ve got the TV on in the background, you could be forgiven for thinking there’s a Formula One grand prix on, such is the Channel Seven commentator’s excited tone and use of various jargon (time splits etc). And that’s quite apt, given the breakneck speeds at which the skiers are hooning down the mountain. Norwegian legend Aksel Lund Svindal is top dog at the moment, closely followed by compatriot Kjetil Jansrud. Beat Feuz is in danger of not finishing with a medal, in third and nervously looking over his shoulder at the racers to come. One of the many joys of an Olympic Games is reading of the stories that emerge – the athletes and their inspirational tales, the hardships overcome, triumphs over adversity and so on. And, of course, stories about Australian Kim Jong-un lookalikes named Howard. You’re welcome. Get your skates on, another busy day of action awaits in Pyeongchang! Lazy puns aside, we should indeed be in for another cracker this first Thursday of the Winter Games, with plenty of medals up for grabs. More of that in a bit. First though, a quick recap of what has already happened. No medals decided yet, but several events are under way. Mikaela Shiffrin, the US medal hope, finished the first run in second as the postponed women’s giant slalom first run finally got the green light in what, as far as can be told from the TV, were fine conditions at the Yongpyong Alpine Centre. Italy’s Manuela Moelgg topped the timesheets, having clocked a benchmark 1:10.62. The men’s downhill, which also fell victim to the adverse weather conditions earlier in the week, is up and running, with Swiss world champion Beat Feuz having just flown down the mountain to assume the gold-medal position. The women will return to decide the medals in run two afterwards. The pairs skating is also under way, with Canada’s Kirsten Moore-Towers and Michael Manrinaro currently leading, but with only five of the 16 couples having danced so far. Sadly, there will no Harley Windsor in the free skate which will decide the medals, after he and partner Ekatarina Alexandrovskaya could only manage 18th place yesterday. Still, the 21-year-old will surely be happy enough with his performance, having made history by becoming the first Indigenous Australian to appear at a Winter Games: Hopefully more Indigenous kids get into winter sports. One of Windsor’s compatriots, Chumpy Pullin, is another point of interest in snowboard cross and we’ll have a gold medallist before the end of the day in that event too. Chumpy, so named because of a dog food advert if you believe what you read, has laid down his first run and sits in 12th. Other medal events to stay tuned for today: Two biathlon medals will be decided at the Alpensia Biathlon Centre – the women’s 15km individual and the men’s 20km individual. In cross-country skiing, the women go in the 10km free. At the sliding centre, it’s the luge team relay. And the men’s 10,000km speed skating takes place at Gangneung Oval in the Korean evening. Plus, there’s the usual serving of curling and ice hockey, with a side of bobsleigh, freestyle skiing, skeleton and ski jumping. Phew. Of course, you could just check out our fancy schedule, which also helpfully shows start times, customised to wherever you are in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/15/nothing-to-do-with-threatened-species-coalition-accused-of-overstating-spending","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T22:00:53Z","webTitle":"'Nothing to do with threatened species': Coalition accused of overstating spending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/15/nothing-to-do-with-threatened-species-coalition-accused-of-overstating-spending","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/15/nothing-to-do-with-threatened-species-coalition-accused-of-overstating-spending","fields":{"headline":"'Nothing to do with threatened species': Coalition accused of overstating spending","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor has accused the federal government of overstating its spending on threatened species projects and the Greens have called for an urgent auditor general’s review of all threatened species expenditure by the Department of the Environment and Energy. It comes after the Guardian revealed the government was claiming projects such as heritage building works at the Old Melbourne Gaol and the Polly Woodside – an old cargo ship in Melbourne’s CBD – had benefits for threatened animals and plants that are unlikely to occur at those sites. Documents produced by the department show that the government’s $255m in threatened species money is being used for generic environment programs and projects that appear to be unrelated to threatened species work. Examples of some of the projects include conservation work and graffiti removal for second world war military remnants at Cape Pallarenda conservation park in Townsville, Queensland; weeding and construction of a bike washdown station for a mountain bike club in Tasmania; native garden projects in western Sydney schools; and construction of boardwalks in community parks and wetlands in various states. “Some of the projects that the government has claimed are about threatened species clearly have nothing to do with threatened species,” Labor’s environment spokesman, Tony Burke, said. “Real action on threatened species demands large-scale protection of habitat. “That means conservation decisions like the protection of the Kimberley, which the Liberals opposed; protection of Tasmania’s forests, which the Liberals opposed; and protection of the oceans, including the coral sea, which the Liberals opposed.” Following the revelations, the Greens’ environment spokesman, Senator Andrew Bartlett, has written to the auditor general, Grant Heir, to ask for “a comprehensive review of all threatened species expenditure within the environment and energy department as a matter of urgency”. “Since colonisation over 200 years ago, Australia has had the highest rate of mammalian extinction in the world. Recent reports, including the federal government’s State of the Environment Report, show that Australia is undergoing an extinction crisis,” the letter states. “Some of this is due to issues such as the legislative regime and adequacy of funding levels, but there appear to be significant problems regarding how effectively current funds earmarked for threatened and endangered species is utilised.” The government says it is spending $255m on more than 1,200 projects that benefit threatened species, but a table produced by the environment and energy department shows $156m of that figure is drawn from spending for other programs, namely 20 Million Trees and the now defunct Green Army. The table shows $60m is targeted threatened species money, including $29.9m for the government’s threatened species recovery hub, $3.3m for Tasmanian devil conservation and $9.2m for various marine projects. While environment groups said some good conservation work was being done through these programs, it was “scandalous” that many unrelated projects were being represented as having benefits for threatened species. The Australian Conservation Foundation and The Wilderness Society are among wildlife organisations also calling for an independent audit of threatened species expenditure, in addition to an Australian National Audit Office inquiry into threatened species program design that is currently underway. The Wilderness Society national campaigns director Lyndon Schneiders said he feared the government was using funds meant to protect imperilled species “as a way of shoring up votes in marginal seats.” “It’s bad enough that large amounts of money that should be going to essential conservation programs are hived off to the minister’s pet projects. But it is also concerning that so little is committed to the protection of species,” he said. “The community actually has a high expectation that threatened species and endangered species are being protected and that’s what makes this so heartbreaking.” Guardian Australia gave environment and energy minister Josh Frydenberg, the environment and energy department and the threatened species commissioner, Dr Sally Box, specific questions more than a week before publishing the initial story on funding for threatened species projects. No answers were supplied. In a statement, Frydenberg said: “The [threatened species] commissioner role was created to help address the number of native plants and animals facing the threat of extinction, to bring new national focus on threatened species issues and to mobilise support for conservation efforts for Australia’s endangered native flora and fauna. “The [threatened species] strategy sets out our approach of science, action and partnership and establishes ambitious targets to recover threatened species. These targets include: tackling feral cats, improving the futures of 20 bird, 20 mammal and 30 plant species and improving recovery practices.” Further comment has been sought from the minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/14/why-pyeongchang-winners-are-receiving-plush-toys-not-medals","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T08:15:41Z","webTitle":"Why Pyeongchang winners are receiving plush toys on platters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/14/why-pyeongchang-winners-are-receiving-plush-toys-not-medals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/14/why-pyeongchang-winners-are-receiving-plush-toys-not-medals","fields":{"headline":"Why Pyeongchang winners are receiving plush toys on platters","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With the first medals awarded at the Winter Olympics, the internet exploded with a question: why were athletes given teddy bears, with no sign of their hard-won gold, silver or bronze medallions? Immediately after winning their events, athletes stand on a podium as a procession of women wrapped in red coats bring out three trays of plush toys in the shape of the official Olympic mascot. It turns out it is not a “teddy bear” at all, but a white tiger considered a guardian animal in Korean mythology. The arrangement has led to awkward images of emotional athletes beaming mere minutes after becoming Olympic champions, standing on a podium with an unfamiliar plush toy. A similar version of the toy sells for 25,000 Korean won (£16.70) at the official Olympic store and is made in China. In previous years athletes have been given flowers, with medals given out immediately after events in the summer Games. Athletes in Pyeongchang do eventually get medals, but at a joint ceremony later in the evening. “The flower ceremony, or in this case the cuddly toy ceremony, is a longstanding tradition,” said Mark Adams, director of communications for the International Olympic Committee. “With the outdoor events it’s quite obvious,” he added, referring to the subzero temperatures at many mountain venues. The practice of staging a small ceremony immediately after winter events started at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/14/barnaby-joyce-repels-insurgency-as-labor-targets-rental-arrangement","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T08:49:13Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce repels insurgency as Labor targets rental arrangement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/14/barnaby-joyce-repels-insurgency-as-labor-targets-rental-arrangement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/14/barnaby-joyce-repels-insurgency-as-labor-targets-rental-arrangement","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce repels insurgency as Labor targets rental arrangement","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Barnaby Joyce has managed to fend off an internal insurgency triggered by rolling controversy over his personal life, at least for now, but Labor has doubled down on a gift of free accommodation in Armidale from the prominent local businessman Greg Maguire. Wednesday opened ominously for Joyce with one of his colleagues predicting he would be visited by a shoulder tapping delegation over the course of the day, but supporters of the deputy prime minister rallied early, hitting the airwaves with public statements of support. With the Nationals divided on how to resolve the controversy, it became clear that dissenters, which numbered between five and six MPs, did not have the numbers to pose any immediate existential threat to Joyce’s leadership in the absence of more damaging revelations. But while the insurgency fizzled, Labor continued to press the deputy prime minister in parliament on a range of fronts and, outside the parliament, Joyce’s old political foe Tony Windsor, and his former backroom adviser John Clements, continued to stoke controversy about a rural women’s dinner in 2011, where the Nationals leader is alleged to have behaved inappropriately. Joyce emphatically and categorically denies the allegations, which have circulated for months, and has reserved his legal rights. Guardian Australia has made efforts to verify the various accounts, but no one has been prepared to speak on the record. A legal firm acting for one of the parties alleged to have been involved in the incident has also characterised the allegations in circulation as “false and vexatious”, and on Monday signalled potential legal action. Windsor took to social media on Wednesday to allege Georgie Somerset, a board member of the ABC, had been at the dinner. Guardian Australia has made repeated calls to Somerset. The calls have not been returned. After talks on Tuesday night, when reports surfaced that a delegation would put the deputy prime minister on notice, Joyce supporters rallied early. David Littleproud, who Joyce elevated to cabinet in last year’s reshuffle, appeared on the ABC early on Wednesday morning to demand that critics of the deputy prime minister either “put up or shut up”. The Nationals’ deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, who had made no public comment about Joyce since the controversy over his private life erupted last week, also fronted the cameras to declare her support for the deputy prime minister and to ridicule talk of a delegation. McKenzie gave a “rolled gold guarantee” that the Nationals party room would hold firm for Joyce. “I have every confidence and I will give you my solid rolled gold guarantee that, come tomorrow, come Friday, Barnaby Joyce will be leading the National party,” McKenzie told Sky News. As well as pressing the prime minister about whether he had confidence in the deputy prime minister, Labor asked in question time whether a declaration Joyce had made about a gift of free rental accommodation in Armidale complied with his obligations under the ministerial standards, given he had not declared the identity of the donor in the register of members interests. The gift was from Maguire, a prominent local businessman who is active in politics in the New England region. In 2004, Maguire was named in a Senate inquiry as having been an intermediary who had sought to get Windsor to retire from politics. Maguire had asked Windsor what it would take to consider leaving politics and whether he would be interested in a diplomatic or trade posting overseas, Windsor’s campaign manager, Stephen Hall, told a Senate inquiry. The matter was referred to the federal police but no charges were laid. Joyce told parliament that, because the gift was from “a close friend”, it didn’t have to be declared at all, and the gift covered a period when he was not a member of parliament. The rules state that gifts “in a purely personal capacity” don’t need to be registered unless the MP judges that a conflict of interest “may be seen to exist”. While Joyce has defended both the favour from Maguire and his transparency about it, the deputy prime minister was publicly critical of the Labor senator Sam Dastyari when he took a donation from a Chinese businessman in order to settle a personal bill, characterising it as “an overdraft by call”. “How can it be that that individual, how can that individual just ring somebody up and miraculously without question say, ‘Look, I need $1,670’. ‘Sure, here you go. Here’s $1,600. Why don’t you ask for more?’ What a great relationship,” Joyce told the ABC."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/ng-interactive/2018/feb/15/david-squires-on-the-afls-plan-to-reach-a-global-audience","type":"interactive","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T17:00:56Z","webTitle":"David Squires on ... the AFL’s plan to reach a global audience","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/feb/15/david-squires-on-the-afls-plan-to-reach-a-global-audience","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/feb/15/david-squires-on-the-afls-plan-to-reach-a-global-audience","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on ... the AFL’s plan to reach a global audience","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/14/queensland-accepts-court-block-on-acland-coalmine-extension","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T03:40:03Z","webTitle":"Queensland accepts court block on New Acland coalmine expansion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/14/queensland-accepts-court-block-on-acland-coalmine-extension","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/14/queensland-accepts-court-block-on-acland-coalmine-extension","fields":{"headline":"Queensland accepts court block on New Acland coalmine expansion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Queensland government has accepted a landmark land and environment court ruling from last year and refused to provide an environmental licence to the New Acland coalmine extension. Following the longest case in the court’s history, a judge last year recommended against New Hope’s plans to expand the mine into prime agricultural land on Queensland’s Darling Downs, primarily over concerns about impacts on groundwater supplies, but also on air quality and noise. In his ruling in May 2017, Judge Paul Smith said: “It is beyond doubt that the mining proposed ... will cause disruptions to aquifers in the Acland region which will have an impact on nearby landholders.” It was the first time the court had recommended an environmental authority for a mine, known as New Acland coalmine, be rejected outright. While the court decision was treated as a victory in a David-versus-Goliath battle involving dozens of local residents and groups, the state government’s environment department released its final verdict on Wednesday. Concerns the court’s recommendation could be ignored were raised this week after the ABC revealed the Queensland government had already thrown New Hope a lifeline and offered the miner a chance to submit revised groundwater modelling. Jo-Anne Bragg, solicitor at the Queensland Environmental Defenders’ Office, said: “Today’s decision by the environment department was a test for both our newly elected government and for the department – whether it would follow independent and transparent court analysis of evidence, or be persuaded by New Acland’s new groundwater work, which the government allowed to be provided in a last-minute submission process behind closed doors.” The decision may not be the end of the road for the New Acland coalmine stage 3 extension, or the community that is fighting it. The company has applied for judicial review of the land court’s decision, which Bragg said could invalidate the department’s decision. Ellie Smith, from Lock the Gate Alliance, said: “This is a wonderful day for Acland farmers and residents. They ran the longest legal challenge in the history of the land court, and won, and we’re all relieved that decision has been respected by the department. “This vindicates everything local people have worked so hard to protect for the last 10 years – rich farming country, groundwater and the health and wellbeing of their families,” said Smith. “They have suffered health impacts and severe mental distress as a result of the negative impacts of the existing mine and fears about the expansion.” The judicial review will commence hearings on 19 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2018/feb/17/dirty-secret-why-housework-gender-gap","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-17T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"Dirty secret: why is there still a housework gender gap?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/feb/17/dirty-secret-why-housework-gender-gap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2018/feb/17/dirty-secret-why-housework-gender-gap","fields":{"headline":"Dirty secret: why is there still a housework gender gap?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Why, exactly, is housework so annoying? Certain specific chores are obviously pretty unpleasant: few people relish cleaning the toilet, or extracting mouldy vegetables from the bottom drawer of the fridge. But why housework in general? Part of the answer, surely, is that it’s unending, so you never achieve that satisfying sense of getting it out of the way, nor even of having made a little progress. The only reason you’re stacking the dishwasher is so the dishes can be dirtied again tomorrow; you’re fishing the toddler’s toys from under the sofa so he can fling them back there as soon as he wakes up. “Few tasks are more like the torture of Sisyphus than housework, with its endless repetition,” wrote Simone de Beauvoir, in The Second Sex, published in 1949. “The clean becomes soiled, the soiled is made clean, over and over, day after day.” Needless to say, De Beauvoir wasn’t objecting solely to the work, but to the division of labour: housework is also annoying because, if you’re a woman living with a man, it’s highly likely you end up doing most of it, no matter who earns more, or who spends longer at the office. To be fair to us, men do a lot more housework than in 1949. But women still do a lot more than that. So now both sexes have grounds to resent how much of their lives they spend with Toilet Duck in hand, or scooping bits of spaghetti from the kitchen sink. Nor are same-sex couples immune from these sexist expectations. In 2016, a revealing American study presented people with fictional accounts of gay and lesbian households, asking them to judge which partner ought to take responsibility for childcare, groceries, laundry and fixing the car. Reliably, respondents assigned the stereotypically female tasks to the partner described as having the more stereotypically feminine interests, such as a fondness for shopping or romantic comedies. What’s puzzling is that housework doesn’t seem to be following the same trends as other fronts in the struggle for equality. Over the last half-century, across the developed world, more and more women have gone to work, the gender pay gap has been steadily narrowing, and fathers have spent more and more time with their children. But the “housework gap” largely stopped narrowing in the 1980s. Men, it seems, conceded that they should be doing more than before – but then, having half-heartedly vacuumed the living room and passed a dampened cloth over the dining table, concluded that it was time for a nice sit-down. In Britain in 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics, women did almost 60% more of the unpaid work, on average, than men. As of a few years ago, even in Sweden – that bastion of equality where “latte papas” in stylish knitwear choose full-time fatherhood at no apparent cost to their sense of masculinity – women were averaging 45 more daily minutes of chores. When the Guardian invited readers around the world to unburden themselves about their own housework battles, their complaints overwhelmingly confirmed this picture, often despite the fact that neither partner had really intended things to work out that way. Dig deeper into the numbers, and things look worse: according to some studies, in heterosexual households where the woman is the main breadwinner, the more she earns, the less her partner will contribute to the housework. And, of course, to the extent that women scale back their career ambitions in order to focus on domestic matters – childcare plus housework – this inequality at home perpetuates inequality at work. (“It’s not a glass ceiling, it’s a sticky floor,” to quote the title of one book addressing that question.) Meanwhile, everywhere, men get special credit for the chores they do do, because their contribution gets assessed at “the going rate”, as the sociologist Arlie Hochschild put it in her 1989 book The Second Shift: if a man does a bit more than the notional average man in his community, he’s viewed as exceptionally helpful. It would be easy, and perhaps not totally unfair, to explain this as another straightforward case of men acting like entitled jerks. But the daily experience of tussles over housework suggests that something more complicated is going on. If you do the lion’s share of the chores in your home, the chances are you have mixed feelings about the idea of your spouse taking on a bigger burden, even if he were willing – because you suspect he’d do them wrongly, or to an insufficiently high standard. (In one US survey, some women said they were more likely to delegate tasks to their children than their husbands for precisely this reason. “My wife insists on doing most of the cleaning and all of the laundry because of her belief that I don’t do well at these tasks,” as one male respondent to our survey put it, echoing many others.) In her memoir-cum-self-help book, Drop The Ball, the American writer Tiffany Dufu calls this “home control disease”, and diagnoses herself as a recovering sufferer. This isn’t the simple sexism of the man who’d rather drink beer and watch Top Gear, but the insidious, internalised sexism of the woman who’s been raised to see an impeccable home as a sign of her worth. “We obsess about things that honestly aren’t important in the scheme of things, because you’ve been socialised to attach your value to those things,” Dufu says. “A well-managed home is still a gendered expectation, which is why it’s so very difficult for men to get home control disease – they just don’t attach it to their value.” A man who places a high priority on domestic cleanliness is just a clean man; a woman who doesn’t is a bad woman. Researchers argue that this probably explains the tendency for men to do less housework, and women a greater proportion, as the woman takes on more of the breadwinning: both sexes, subconsciously disturbed by their violation of traditional gender norms, start acting hyper-conventionally to compensate. It also helps explain why women usually assume the extra burden of the “worry work” – the job of keeping track of what needs to be done in the first place – while men merely pick tasks from this readymade to-do list. (“It would be nice if he’d clean the bathroom without me asking him once in a while,” as one woman told the Guardian.) Behold the power of gender: were men to take on more of this worry work, many women would presumably just worry that their spouses weren’t worrying hard enough, or about the right things. And, of course, they’d be right. All the anecdotal evidence suggests that, generally speaking, men genuinely don’t care as much as women about a clean and tidy home. “There exists no standard definition of what has to be done in a household,” Stephen Marche writes in his 2017 book The Unmade Bed: The Messy Truth About Men and Women In The 21st Century. “There is only what feels so intensely like it needs to be done that it needs to be done… The question of what constitutes a clean bathtub has as many answers as there are people.” The same sexist socialisation undoubtedly explains men’s lower standards. But the situation leaves even well-intentioned men in a fix. If you’re a man who doesn’t mind mess, surely your commitment to equality doesn’t require you to meet standards of domestic perfection you don’t care about, and which are, as mentioned, only the result of stupid sexist expectations in the first place? Wouldn’t it make more sense – wouldn’t it be, dare one suggest, more feminist – for your partner to chill out and let things slide? “Viewing housework inequality as entirely a phenomenon of exploitative men free-riding off [women] makes sense only if you think men derive equal enjoyment from a cleaner and neater home,” observes the New York magazine columnist Jonathan Chait. “I like having magazines strewn across the coffee table. My wife doesn’t. I won’t protest when she stacks them up somewhere, but when she does it, I don’t regard it as her participation in the shared household duties.” The “hope of the future”, Marche argues, is for us all to do less: “Housework is perhaps the only political problem in which doing less and not caring are the solution, where apathy is the most progressive and sensible attitude… Leave the stairs untidy. Don’t fix the garden gate. Fail to repaint the stained ceiling. Never make the bed.” At this point, I should be candid: I’m not the kind of man who’s comfortable with mess. I’m the kind who stacks up magazines, like Chait’s wife; I’m the kind who conducts a regular late-evening circuit of the kitchen and living-room, wiping and tidying and neatening and reimposing order, sometimes even if my partner’s already done so, which I realise is obnoxious. (She’s cleaner than me but I’m tidier than her, a state of affairs that mainly promotes peace, but also occasional cross-border skirmishes over unmade beds or gunk in the oven.) I’d also say I take on my share of the worry work – though admittedly this just leads to the new problem of worrying about which of us is supposed to be worrying about what. I’m delighted to report that, in an interview for this article, my partner confirmed my sense that I truly do do around half the housework, though the conversation became slightly aggravating after that. “I do sometimes wonder if you love the way the house looks clean and tidy, or if it’s that the house being in any kind of disorder makes you feel out of control,” she said, with galling perspicacity. “I’m always shocked, after you’ve done the cleaning, that there’s still something there that horrifies me – some disgusting bit of slime around the sink, even though you’ve tidied everything into neat little piles. And for someone who thinks he’s so frigging tidy, I’ve got to tell you, you leave a trail of things behind you. Sometimes I walk around with the baby just picking things up and putting them back where they belong. I don’t know if you even notice that. In fact, that’s the most irritating thing, to me, when it comes to housework – thinking you don’t always notice what I do.” These defamatory allegations aside, I do think my divergence from the cliche of the mess-loving male gives me more credibility in endorsing Marche’s call for more neglect. As a neat-freak, I take no pleasure in the idea of embracing the mess, but I fear we may have to. We tend to assume there must be some way of organising life so that our homes stay orderly, without women being held back in their careers, or resentments starting to fester. But who’s to say this is a puzzle it’s possible to solve? Maybe something’s got to give – and since it shouldn’t be workplace equality or happy relationships, it’s going to have to be the dusting. Good communication, Dufu notes, makes this all much more tolerable: “If you’ve decided the car won’t be cleaned for six months, there’s no resentment when the car isn’t cleaned.” (She and her husband made a spreadsheet of tasks, with a column for each of them, and an important third column for “no one”.) This works if you’re single, too. In a BBC documentary, JK Rowling once addressed the question of how she’d found time to write the first Harry Potter book while raising a baby alone. “The answer is: I didn’t do housework for four years,” she said. “Living in squalor. That was the answer.” “I consider myself a feminist and am driven mad feeling that I, like my mother and so many others before me, have succumbed to this bullshit ‘female role’,” one Guardian respondent wrote. It would be a very good thing if men were to start shouldering their share of the housework burden. But it would be an equally good thing if men and women alike could put down some of that burden, stick it in the cupboard under the stairs, and forget about it. Women wish they didn’t have to do so much housework; men don’t feel the need to do it. If the patriarchy is so invested in the cleanliness of our carpets, let it come round at the weekend and vacuum them itself. • Commenting on this piece?

A freedom of information (FOI) request by the University and College Union (UCU), which represents university staff, found that 95% of university leaders are either members of their remuneration committee or entitled to attend meetings. Just seven of the 158 institutions surveyed said their vice-chancellor was in effect barred from attending. Of those who responded, almost half (47%) said their vice-chancellor was a member of the remuneration committee, while of those who were not members, 67 were still allowed to attend committee meetings. The findings, published on Thursday, will anger critics who have accused vice-chancellors of paying themselves inflated salaries – while students accrue huge debts – via “shadowy” remuneration committees which lack transparency. The FOI request also asked institutions to send full minutes of the most recent meeting of their remuneration committee. Three quarters of universities failed to send full minutes; 89 institutions (55%) agreed to share minutes, but only 40 did so without any redactions. Fresh guidelines on senior executive pay published by the Committee of University Chairs (CUC) last month made clear that vice-chancellors should not sit on the committees deciding their salaries and should play no part in the decision-making process, but critics complained the guidance was voluntary and lacked teeth. It was drawn up in response to growing pressure from politicians, including the former universities minister Jo Johnson and Labour’s former education minister Andrew Adonis, who have condemned rising vice-chancellor salaries and the lack of transparency around executive remuneration. The code is currently out for consultation and is expected to be adopted later this year. The new university regulator, the Office for Students, has warned it will intervene if the sector cannot put its house in order. Last year, Bath University was the subject of a damning report into senior pay and governance at the university. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) said oversight of vice-chancellor Prof Glynis Breakwell’s pay, which peaked at £468,000 a year, lacked transparency and that the reputation of the university had been damaged by its handling of the matter when concerns were raised. UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, called for all vice-chancellors to be removed from remuneration committees and barred from attending meetings. She said staff and students should be given seats on the committees and all minutes should be made public. “For too long universities have got away with painting remuneration committees as independent bodies to deflect attention over senior pay. “The time has come for proper transparency of senior pay and perks in our universities and that starts with full disclosure of the shadowy remuneration committee. “We are pleased the Office for Students has said it wants to tackle the issue but plenty of politicians have tried to address the problem in the past and failed. Staff and students should be given seats at the top table in universities and all minutes should be made public.” A spokesman for Universities UK, which represents institutions in the sector, said: “It is right to expect that the process for determining senior university staff pay is rigorous and transparent. “The CUC’s new remuneration code, currently being consulted upon, will provide important guidance for university remuneration committees to ensure senior pay decisions are fair, accountable and justified, while recognising that competitive pay is necessary to attract first rate leaders.” Responding to the research, John Rushforth, the CUC’s executive secretary, said: “We dispute the suggestion that vice-chancellors set their own pay now, but the CUC is clear that vice-chancellors shouldn’t be members of remuneration committees in the future. “Universities must be transparent about the decisions that they make. We must keep senior post holders’ pay under review, and be able to justify our decisions publicly.” Vice-chancellor pay has risen sharply in recent years. According to the UCU, the average pay for vice-chancellors in 2005/06 was £165,105 (not including pensions), which increased by 56.2% over the next decade to £257,904 in 2015/16. Next week UCU members at 61 universities will launch four weeks of strike action, to protest against planned changes to their pensions which they say will mean a typical lecturer will received £10,000 a year less in retirement. Commenting on the research Lord Adonis said: “This underlines the criticism I have been making of the poor governance of universities, which has led to disgraceful pay levels for vice-chancellors. “If the universities regulator, the Office for Students, was doing its job, it would halt this immediately – but its own chief executive is the former chief lobbyist for the vice-chancellors [Nicola Dandridge was formerly chief executive of Universities UK], so she manifests the very conflict of interest she is supposed to be regulating.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/14/simple-minds-review-barrowland-glasgow-jim-kerr","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T12:29:16Z","webTitle":"Simple Minds review – a jumbo celebration of past and present glories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/14/simple-minds-review-barrowland-glasgow-jim-kerr","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/14/simple-minds-review-barrowland-glasgow-jim-kerr","fields":{"headline":"Simple Minds review – a jumbo celebration of past and present glories","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In a crammed hometown venue you suspect they could fill twice over with friends and family alone, Simple Minds are throwing a party.

The result is a jumbo-sized celebration of past and present glories sprawling enough to include the new record played in its entirety, two mercifully brief on-stage interviews with a local DJ and a snowballing cavalcade of standouts from a career that has zigzagged between electronica-infused post-punk and strident, stadium-filling anthems. They have even brought along a customised disco ball. With singer Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill the only remaining founder members, Simple Minds certainly look different from their blokey 1980s heyday: their current line-up includes the fluid drummer Cherisse Osei and eccentric solo artist the Anchoress. The overall effect sounds modern and muscular, capable of evoking the early robo-funk of Love Song and the lushly orchestrated new ballad Barrowland Star, which gets a suitably rapturous reception in the venue that inspired it. Kerr performs with the innate confidence of a frontman who knows he has a flotilla of showstoppers in reserve. He power-croons Waterfront, the towering song built on an unstoppable Terminator bass line, and leads the crowd through the air-punching chorus of Alive and Kicking.

Romanian director Corneliu Porumboiu has come up with a personal documentary that could be called the football theorist’s anxiety at the thought of his old sports injury. It’s a true story which is also an odd social-realist parable, with a bit of the deadpan comedy and bureaucracy-satire to be found in Poromboiu’s fiction features, such as 12:08 East of Bucharest and Police, Adjective. It’s pregnant with implied meaning and amenable to different levels of interpretation, and yet determinedly inconsequential and tonally noncommittal, blankly filmed until the very last, when Poromboiu switches to a slow-mo, sepia-filtered shot of a country road extending ahead of the traveller, with some voiceover rumination about punishment, knowledge and fate. Throughout the film, I kept thinking of Brian Clough, who was taken out of the game through injury at the age of 29, and then channelled his frustration and perfectionist rage into managing. Infinite Football is a gloomy portrait of Poromboiu’s friend and contemporary Laurențiu Ginghină, whom he interviews at various locations: a sports ground, a gym, the place of work where he is an administrative official. When he was a student in the 80s, Ginghină was on the receiving end of a bad tackle while playing football. The resulting leg fracture wasn’t properly treated and never fully healed. Whatever future he had in football – and this is one of many questions not explicitly addressed – was over. But from then on, Ginghină became obsessed with his own theories for overhauling football, which he expounds at great length to the straight-faced Poromboiu and anyone who will listen. He wants to create a more fluid game that would be less likely to cause injuries, played on a new pitch with the corners flattened to create a quasi-octagonal shape, and following a system that sees each team split into two subteams, attackers and defenders, each confined to their own half. Ginghină sees himself as a football revolutionary, yearning to upgrade and refine the game continuously: infinite football. In the meanwhile, he has to content himself with the existence to which cruel destiny has consigned him: being a pen-pusher in a drab government office. In the middle of their conversation there, Ginghină and Poromboiu are subject to a bizarre interruption by an old lady in her 90s, who wishes to present Ginghină with some paperwork about a building that went up unlawfully on her land 27 years ago – a situation that officialdom still has not resolved. It could be a scripted state-of-the-nation moment from any of Poromboiu’s other films. Another type of director would have got in some sly David Brent-type digs at Ginghină. Poromboiu isn’t doing that, although it’s a response available to the audience. What is he tacitly asking? Could Ginghină have been a decent footballer without the injury? Or might there be something to his ideas? And what is the existential status of the sports injury anyway? If he had been invalided out of the game through a car accident, Ginghină might have railed at unjust fate. But getting brutally tackled on the pitch – that is, assaulted in such a way as to cause serious permanent injury – is a risk that every player, amateur or professional, accepts without thinking about it. Ginghină has in some sense tacitly absorbed this horrible event, and stoically accepted it, without self-pity, while at the same inflating its importance as the most significant thing that has ever happened to him. It is possible that he sees it as a kind of tragic or heroic breakthrough: an agonising and horrible business which nevertheless yielded his visionary views on football. Ginghină sustained his injury in the Ceaușescu era, and developed his theories in the 1990s. It is possible that he himself and his “infinite football” are a desolate, satiric image of Romania itself, limping along and hoping for better. Infinite Football is an austere 70-minute experience, but the eccentric idealism of Laurențiu Ginghină lingers in the mind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/14/football-transfer-rumours-neymar-ditch-psg-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T09:03:49Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Neymar to ditch PSG for Real Madrid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/14/football-transfer-rumours-neymar-ditch-psg-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/14/football-transfer-rumours-neymar-ditch-psg-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Neymar to ditch PSG for Real Madrid?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Having spent the past few months making himself even more popular than Raymond Domenech with the French public, Neymar has decided that he needs a fresh challenge.

Edinson Cavani will certainly be devastated to see the Brazilian leave. But the fun has to stop. It’s time to get serious. Real Madrid want Neymar. Cheerio! It looks like it will be a busy summer in the Spanish capital. Madrid will finance their Barça-bothering move for Neymar by ditching Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, Luka Modric and Keylor Nevas and - you might want to be sitting down before you read the next bit - they are also talking about signing Harry Kane again. And they’re going to nab Mauricio Pochettino. And they plan to wrench the new White Hart Lane out of the ground and airlift it to Spain as soon it is ready. Toby Alderweireld, meanwhile, is off to Manchester United for £25m, and Mousa Dembélé is going to sign a mega-bucks contract with Beijing Sinobo Guoan. It was nice while it lasted, Tottenham! Arsenal are pretending that they have plans in place should Arsène Wenger decide to leave this summer. What that really means is they’re preparing to give him a new 20-year contract. He’s earned it. Crystal Palace are close to completing the free transfer of Diego Cavalieri, a 35-year-old goalkeeper who played for Roy Hodgson at Liverpool. Has anyone seen Christian Poulsen? Ajax’s Justin Kluivert, son of Patrick, says that he could see himself playing in the Premier League one day. Maybe not for Newcastle, though. Milan want to hand Manchester United £30m for Ander Herrera, who did not quite *get it* enough, while Roma will put an £85m release clause in Alisson’s contract in an attempt to end Liverpool’s interest in the goalkeeper. Zenit St Petersburg are pondering whether to rescue Samir Nasri after the midfielder was released by Antalyaspor, presumably for not having enough opinions about things."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/15/us-youth-soccer-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-15T10:00:34Z","webTitle":"Anonymous letters and threats: How racism came to stalk US youth soccer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/15/us-youth-soccer-racism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/15/us-youth-soccer-racism","fields":{"headline":"Anonymous letters and threats: How racism came to stalk US youth soccer","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeromy Tarkon, a youth soccer coach in Boise, Idaho, walked out to his car on a Sunday morning this past January and discovered a plastic-wrapped letter sitting on its windshield. “It’s because of liberals like you,” the letter began, “that our state is full of nigers [sic] and wetbacks.” The anonymous letter writer said one young black player on Tarkon’s club team, Juniors FC, had “made the field unclean when he stepped on it,” and how, if he wasn’t careful, Tarkon himself might one day soon “piss off the wrong parent or families”. Tarkon, a white military veteran originally from California, could have accepted a personal attack, but racially abusing the eight- and nine-year-old children on his team was more abuse than he was willing to tolerate. After consulting with his assistant coaches – all of whom come from immigrant backgrounds – Tarkon decided to publish the letter on the team’s Facebook page and go public with the story. Tarkon’s team, though, had been the victim of racial abuse before. In one incident last year, Juniors FC players were taunted by the parents from an opposing team as they walked out onto the field for a game. “Here come the future convicts,” some parents shouted loud enough for the Juniors FC coaches to hear. “Watch out for your wallets.” In two other separate incidents, Tarkon says that he has heard parents from opposing teams aim the n-word at his players. Tarkon had previously believed that comments like these weren’t worth reporting to the Idaho Youth Soccer Association (IYSA), the state’s governing body and the only institution with the power to levy punishments. He and his assistants figured that their players could respond with their play on the field and that, if the incident was bad enough, they could work something out with the club of the offending party, a process outlined in the IYSA’s policies. “Maybe I haven’t been proactive enough and the reason why is I know we don’t want to get people more mad than they already are,” Tarkon told the Guardian. Tarkon meant that some coaches and parents in Idaho youth soccer resent the success of Juniors FC, in part because the club is run free-of-charge for its players and their families. But he may just as well have been talking about the political mood, not just in Idaho, but across the United States. Reported incidences of racism in US sports nearly tripled between 2015 and 2016 (from 11 to 31), according to Dr Richard Lapchick of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports, and grew by a third between 2016 and 2017 (from 31 to 41). Then there’s the depressing list of abuse that occurs off the field, from LeBron James’s house being daubed with racist graffiti to the high school football players who posed in KKK hoods next to a burning cross. Racial abuse that may have once been a cause for public shame is now aired openly as racists feel more emboldened to share their opinions. “It seems all of a sudden refugees are a big issue [in America],” said Juniors FC assistant coach Adin Ćatović, a Bosnian refugee. “Living here from 1993 until now, there have been many refugees that have come and gone and settled here and moved to different states. There was not ever ... this big issue that refugees are a problem.” Kibrom Milash, a parent of a Juniors FC player and an Eritrean refugee from Ethiopia whose well-loved restaurant was destroyed by arson in 2015, has experienced firsthand this shift in attitude. Last July, in a shocking act that made local news, racist vandals scrawled the n-word on the side of Milash’s wife’s car. More recently, Milash’s 10 year-old son Biruk has been the on-field target of racially charged vitriol from opposing parents and coaches. Juniors FC assistant coach José Loza believes that the rise in racial abuse targeting Idaho’s Latino community comes from a growing sense among some of the state’s white population that whites are dwindling into a minority. (While the state’s Latino population has grown over the past decade, Idaho’s non-Latino white population remains 82.4% of the total). “Growing up here, it gets to the point where you don’t let those little things get to your head or hurt you,” explained Loza. “But at the same time, the more you think about it, sometimes it does kind of get you a little upset. Like why am I being called [racist names] if I’m also a citizen and part of [this community]? I love this country.” The experiences of Juniors FC, however, are not unique to Idaho. From California to New Jersey and Michigan to Louisiana, players, parents, and coaches relay similar stories to the Guardian of racial abuse. Frequently, young Latino players are the targets. “Speak English!” and “Go back to Mexico!” are some of the most commonly reported comments. These comments can have a profound effect on the physical health and well-being of their targets. Study after study has found that racism and racial abuse induce a stress-response in their victims that leads to ill health. A 2011 study published in the American Journal of Public Health even found that the mere anticipation of racism was often enough to trigger a fight-or-flight response in subjects. The institution capable of punishing the perpetrators of on-field racial abuse in Idaho, the IYSA, has so far done little to immediately address Tarkon’s letter. The IYSA’s president, Craig Warner, admits that the organization hasn’t done enough in the past to stamp out this type of racist behavior. “We could do more than we’re doing now,” Warner conceded in an interview with the Guardian. One of the main obstacles to justice – and a reason why so few reports of racial abuse have come across Warner’s desk – is an arbitration process that often devolves into a case of “he said-she said.” Without any hard evidence of wrongdoing – for example video or audio of the incident – a racist abuser need only lie in order to escape punishment from the IYSA. That’s precisely what happened to Steve Lynch, an Asian American victim of racial abuse. During a heated argument at a match last year, an opposing coach mocked the shape of Lynch’s eyes with a racist gesture. Despite multiple witnesses corroborating his account, Lynch watched as his assailant walked way from the IYSA’s Judicial and Ethics Committee without a punishment. It was his word versus someone else’s. Incidents like this one deter members of Idaho’s youth soccer community from speaking up and taking cases of on-field abuse to the IYSA: racial minorities will often shrug off experiences of racism like the one that Lynch reported. “You brush it off,” Ćatović said of the kind of racism he’s experienced on the soccer field. “You move on to the next game. You look at [the perpetrators], ‘OK, you’re racist. I’m going to move on.’ For us adults, it’s a little bit easier for us to deal with.” Warner and the IYSA are currently trying to figure out how to encourage victims to report incidences of racial abuse. They are considering everything from inserting more explicitly anti-racist policies into their rulebooks to enlisting the help of US Youth Soccer, the national governing body, in a nationwide anti-racism campaign. (As of this writing, US Youth Soccer has not responded to repeated requests for comment.) Regardless of the path it chooses, the IYSA already has the power to change its policies and punish persistent offenders. Warner, to his credit, recognizes the power the IYSA has to change the on-field behavior of parents and coaches. “We’ve really got to look much, much longer into the future because this [racial abuse] will only get worse over time if you don’t try to stem it or create policies or have somewhere where people can report it,” Warner said. For now, Tarkon and Juniors FC have taken matters into their own hands. They’ve used their media exposure to elicit support from within the Boise community and have drawn national attention from both fans and pro players. Yet until members of the Boise soccer community – and coaches, parents, and administrators nationwide – agree to consistently report on-field racial abuse and give voice to the most vulnerable members of their community, little will change. “This doesn’t just lie on the shoulders of the IYSA,” Tarkon said. “This falls on all of the adults [who] are supposed to be role models; we haven’t done enough to bring attention to this. “It should only have to happen once before we step up cohesively as a soccer community and say, ‘It doesn’t matter what color uniform it is. It doesn’t matter what team you play for. We’re not going to tolerate this. We’re not OK with this and it needs to stop and we need to put things in place to protect our kids.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2018/feb/14/markets-calm-ahead-of-us-inflation-data-and-imfs-uk-report-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T15:00:07Z","webTitle":"Markets nervous again as US inflation unexpectedly spikes higher - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/feb/14/markets-calm-ahead-of-us-inflation-data-and-imfs-uk-report-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/feb/14/markets-calm-ahead-of-us-inflation-data-and-imfs-uk-report-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Markets nervous again as US inflation unexpectedly spikes higher - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"After a calm start to the day in the run-up to US inflation data, markets turned nervous again as the numbers came in much stronger than expected. The year on year headline consumer price index figure showed a rise of 2.1% for January, unchanged from December, rather than a fall of 1.9%. The news prompted renewed concerns that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than expected, despite another set of data showing disappointing US retail sales. But there was not the panic or volatility seen at times in some recent trading sessions. So on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points having lost as much as 150 points initially. European markets fell back in the immediate aftermath of the US figures but have since edged back into positive territory. The FTSE 100 is up 0.7%, Germany’s Dax has added 0.3% and France’s Cac has climbed 0.45%. Earlier eurozone industrial production beat expectations while GDP growth for the fourth quarter was in line with forecasts. In the UK, businesses expect wage settlements to pick up in 2018 according to the Bank of England’s latest agents’ report. But the IMF said the UK had to do more to boost its productivity. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Here’s Andrew Wilson of Goldman Sachs Asset Management on the inflation numbers: Recent market turbulence highlights market sensitivity to firmer price and wage data, however we do not think investors should wed their investment outlook to today’s data alone, not least given it is clouded by methodology changes and weather-related distortions. Today’s firmer-than-expected print, which is in some sense encouraging given it reflects a normalisation in components that have been notably weak, may extend recent market volatility, as expectations for Fed rate hikes are recalibrated higher. In our view, market-pricing for Fed policy understates the solid macro backdrop, including a 17-year low unemployment rate, and the impact of fiscal stimulus, and we think there is scope for more rate hikes this year than the Fed’s current projection for three. That said, we think today’s data should viewed in conjunction with PCE inflation– the Fed’s preferred measure of prices – and wages, which were the culprit for the recent volatility spike, which will be released at the start of next month. The Dow is now down 130 points but the mood seems calmer than might perhaps have been expected. The FTSE 100 has actually recovered ground after an initial slide in the immediate aftermath of the higher than forecast US inflation numbers. It is now up 40 points or 0.54%. Germany’s Dax is effectively flat, while France’s Cac has climbed 0.2%. The higher than expected inflation figures have put pressure on Wall Street in early trading, as rate hike fears resurface. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 100 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened down around 0.36%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Dow and S&amp;P500 futures tanked after the US CPI inflation numbers beat forecasts, signalling that this inflation-triggered selloff could have further to run. As previously noted there was not a huge amount of conviction in the bounce so the market is susceptible to further weakness and the inflation data is supplying plenty of reason to de-risk... Coming off the back of the 2.9% increase in average hourly earnings, this CPI print will crystallise the prevailing view in the market that we are heading for higher rates and higher inflation. Whether or not this is sustained will be proved in due course and no one can predict the trajectory of travel, or the destination, but the warning lights are flashing and equity markets are taking notice. On the other hand retail sales were dreadful. January retail sales posted the biggest decline in 11 months while most concerning of all December data was revised to show sales were flat versus the previous reading of +0.4%. Aggregate demand may not be what it seems. What’s most concerning about this is the risk of stagflation – rising inflation and slower growth. Combined the picture is not a good one for risk today. US economist Jay Shambaugh on the inflation figures: Soft retail sales could be a temporary phenomenon but higher inflation is not, says economist James Knightley at ING Bank: The US data has provided quite a few surprises. Inflation rates have held steady at 2.1% for annual headline consumer price inflation and 1.8% for ex food &amp; energy, rather than fall to 1.9% and 1.7% respectively as the consensus had predicted. Meanwhile retail sales were far softer than expected, falling 0.3%MoM versus forecasts of a 0.2% rise. Starting with inflation, the main surprise came in apparel, which rose 1.7%MoM. We had suspected it would rebound at some point given its very soft run, but not quite as quickly (it is the biggest increase in more than 10 years). Energy also rose sharply – up 3%MoM, while medical care rose 0.4% (fastest growth for 6M). As for retail sales there was a wide range of forecasts (the Bloomberg survey had numbers ranging from -0.2% to +0.5%), which presumably reflected the uncertainty relating to bad weather at the very beginning of the year. We had thought there would be a switch to internet sales, but it wasn’t enough to offset the big fall in auto sales (-1.3%MoM). Building materials (-2.4%MoM), health (-1.2%) and sporting (-0.8%) were all weak, but clothing was up 1.2% and gasoline sales were up 1.6%. We think the softness in retail sales is temporary. With tax cuts, record low unemployment, rising wages and high confidence levels meaning the outlook for spending remains good. However, we think there could be more bad news for inflation. The dollar’s declines will gradually push up import prices, while energy costs will add to the upside. Then there are last year’s distortions relating to cell phone data plans dropping out of the annual comparisons from March. This on its own will add 0.2/0.3 percentage points to annual core inflation with medical care costs and housing costs pushing inflation higher too. In an environment of strong consumer demand, corporates have the pricing power to pass on higher costs to customers which is going to be increasingly significant given the prospect of a pick-up in wage growth. Taking this altogether we expect core inflation to be back above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target in March with headline inflation hitting 3% by the summer. In turn this healthy growth, rising inflation environment means that we consider there to be upside risk for our call of three Fed rate hikes in 2018. If US inflation was higher than expected, then the retail sales figures are below forecast. They fell 0.3% in January, according to the Commerce Department, recording their biggest fall since February 2017. Analysts had been expecting an increase of 0.2%. Meanwhile December’s figures were revised down from a rise of 0.4% to an unchanged reading. The poor retail sales figures contrast with the inflation figures in terms of when the Federal Reserve might take further action on interest rates. And analysts say the real key piece of data will be the February wages figures: More on the inflation figures: The higher than expected US consumer price index data has rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than expected, and sent another shudder through stock markets. With Treasury yields rising, share prices are again under pressure. Wall Street is now expected to open sharply lower and European markets have lost their early gains. The FTSE 100 is down a handful of points while Germany’s Dax is down 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have gone into reverse, indicating a 200 point fall. Immediately before the inflation data, they were showing a 168 point rise. The US inflation data the market has been waiting for is out, and it has come in higher than expected. The headline figure rose by 0.5% month on month in December, compared to expectations of an increase of 0.3%. The year on year figure was steady at 2.1%, compared to forecasts of a fall to 1.9%. Markets are still holding up well ahead of the US inflation numbers, but what happens after that is anyone’s guess. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: If the numbers show stronger-than-expected readings, then this would reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will have little choice but to tighten monetary policy more aggressively. As a result, we may see renewed selling pressure coming into the bond and stock markets, while the dollar could rise against her weaker rivals. Alternatively, however, if the data releases fall significantly short of expectations, then we would expect to see the opposite happen. And finally, if the data matches expectations then it is hard to say exactly how the markets would react, although we do think that the dollar may rise anyway but not too sure about the equity and bond markets’ reaction. More on US inflation. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says: Rightly or wrongly, U.S. inflation data due this afternoon has come to be seen as a litmus test of whether or not economic conditions continue to support equity market advances. With few major stock indices extending their recent correction much beyond 10% from January highs, market participants are wary that any overshoot in price growth relative to expectations could upset still-fragile sentiment anew. The view is a little ‘totemic’, of course. Quite aside from the old truism around not over-emphasising one, or even a few data points, evidence linking long-term interest rates to inflation rates is notoriously sketchy, meaning markets should discount any short-term impact on rate expectations from inflation changes. Markets are not like that though. Any upside surprises against the 1.9% year-to-year print expected (down from December’s 2.1%), and more importantly 1.7% and 0.2% core annualised and monthly forecasts respectively, will trigger a quick re-think for risky assets. Potential March and May Fed rate rises have probabilities between 75%-77% according to fund futures and they’re now largely been priced into U.S. equities. So the focus is on whether projections of further tightening by the Fed in later months will be vindicated by economic readings in the run-up. Markets could certainly get themselves into lather on the notion that inflation greenlights the full clip of hikes the Fed has cued up It’s notable that whilst the imperfect barometer of U.S. equity market anxiety, the Vix, has inevitably ebbed from spike highs notched when selling reached fever pitch, it remains within the notional ‘fear zone’ above 20. Even if markets take signs of brewing inflation in their stride, we would not interpret the mood as having completely dispelled crisis anxieties until the Vix crosses below that marker. Markets remain in a good mood so far today, but the real test is yet to come, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell: It is going to be interesting to see how investors deal with the various US inflation readings this afternoon. While the headline figure is set to jump from 0.1% to 0.3%, the core number is expected to drop from 0.3% to 0.2%. If the focus is on the former then the markets could be in store for another interest rate-fearing freak-out; if it’s on the latter then the global indices can breathe a (temporary) sigh of relief. Of course, this is without even considering whether or not these estimates will turn out to be accurate... At present the Dow Jones doesn’t look too worried, with the futures pointing to a 130-ish point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street. That would leave the Dow not too far from 24800, its best price in around a week. To confuse things more, the year on year figures are expected to show a dip on the headline rate from 2.1% to 1.9%. The core figure, excluding food and energy, is forecast to fall from 1.8% to 1.7%. The eurozone economy is expected to remain strong after the 2017 performance, says economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank: Growth in the Eurozone economy was broad-based. Germany and Spain maintained strong economic growth with 0.6% and 0.7% QoQ respectively, although this was slightly lower than in Q3 for both economies. Italy disappointed somewhat with just 0.3% growth and continues to lag the Eurozone average despite optimistic data released during the quarter. This rounds out a year in which the Eurozone economy was helped by strong tailwinds and the question is how long these growth rates can be maintained. Even though the ECB has reduced asset purchases, the euro has appreciated against the dollar and politics remains a factor of uncertainty, leading indicators are still pointing to a very strong start to the year. Eurozone industry is a good example of a sector with still has a lot of upside left. As manufacturing surveys have been jubilant recently, industrial production was due to surprise positively. December saw a jump to 5.2% annual growth led by capital- and durable consumer goods production. The acceleration of production growth is unlikely to be a one-off as the outlook for industry remains rosy. Manufacturing businesses are indicating that production for almost four months has been assured by current orders, which is around record highs. Growth in new orders has accelerated over the past six months, which means that expectations for production at the beginning of 2018 are high. Given the current backlog of work in industry, it is no surprise that hiring and investment in capital goods are high on the list of businesses. This adds to the strong economic picture for the start of 2018. Meanwhile the EY Item club has raised its forecast for UK economic growth this year from 1.4% to 1.7%. More signs of the strength of Europe’s economy. Eurozone industrial production rose by a better than expected 0.4% in December compared to the previous month, with an annual gain of 5.2%. Analysts had been forecasting rises of 0.2% and 4.2% respectively. Meanwhile the EU statistics office Eurostat confirmed that eurozone GDP rose by 2.5% in 2017, the fastest growth rate for a decade. During the fourth quarter, GDP rose by 0.6% in both the euro area and the wider European Union in the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, eurozone GDP increased by 2.7% and EU GDP by 2.6%. Businesses expect average pay settlements to pick up this year, according to the latest Bank of England regional agents’ report. Companies think pay settlements will increase from 2.6% in 2017 to 3.1% this year, with rises broadly based across most sectors. Only construction companies expect pay rises to be flat this year. The Bank said: The survey indicated that companies expected an average pay settlement rate of 3.1% in 2018, compared with 2.6% in 2017. The 2017 outturn was higher than the 2.2% that had been expected in last year’s survey, reflecting larger settlements across a broad range of sectors. The increases in pay settlements in 2018 are also expected to be broad-based, with only the construction sector expecting pay settlements in 2018 to be the same as in 2017. Other conclusions from the report: Growth in activity had held steady at a modest pace. Professional services firms had reported a pickup in growth; goods export volumes had strengthened, construction output growth had continued to slow. Investment intentions had remained positive, but mainly reflected investment to maintain business activity. Recruitment difficulties had remained at an elevated level Over in Italy, the latest growth figures came in slightly less than expected. Fourth quarter GDP rose by 0.3% quarter on quarter, down from the 0.4% recorded in the previous three months and expected to be repeated this time round. But over the whole of 2017, Italy’s economy grew by 1.4%, the strongest performance for seven years. The IMF has some suggestions as to how the UK could improve its productivity: Build more homes, including by easing planning restrictions. Housing is very expensive in the UK. With more houses available, they would become more affordable and it would be less costly for workers to move between regions to take better-paying jobs. That would improve living standards and reduce inequality. Improve the quality of infrastructure. Transportation bottlenecks and other infrastructure problems hold back development in regions with lower productivity. Better connectivity would help reduce regional inequalities and support growth. Reform the education system. UK students rank low on tests of basic skills, while UK firms continue reporting shortages of skilled workers, including those with technical education. Better schooling would help young people find jobs, especially once they have obtained a degree. Unemployment rates are the lowest among those with the highest levels of education. Invest in research. Public and private spending on research and development in the UK is relatively low. Increasing such investments would make local companies better able to compete internationally. Britain should give priority to improving its productivity performance, according to the latest assessment from the International Monetary Fund. Following a consulation in the wake of December’s annual health check on the UK economy when it defended its gloomy predictions for the country’s post-Brexit vote performance, the IMF said: Economic growth has moderated since the beginning of 2017, reflecting weakening domestic demand. The sharp depreciation of sterling following the referendum has raised consumer price inflation, squeezing household real income and consumption. Business investment has been constrained. In the medium term, growth is projected to remain at around 1.5 percent under the baseline assumption of continued progress in Brexit negotiations that lead to an understanding on a broad free trade agreement and on the transition process. The baseline outlook is subject to a number of risks, including developments with Brexit negotiations; uncertainty about the recovery of productivity growth, which has been weak since the crisis; and the current account deficit, which reached a record high in 2016. The IMF added: Directors agreed that structural reforms should prioritize enhancing productivity, inclusiveness, and external competitiveness... Since the financial crisis, output growth has been underpinned by strong increases in employment, while productivity growth has been very weak. With the UK unemployment rate at a 42-year low and the annual net inflow of workers from the EU already declining, the scope for future employment gains is more limited. Therefore, economic performance will depend increasingly on the ability of firms to raise output per worker. The shape of the new agreement with the EU will affect productivity performance through its implications for trade, investment and migration. The higher are any new barriers to the cross-border flow of services, goods and workers, the more negative the impact would be. European markets continue to move higher, while US futures are suggesting a positive opening on Wall Street. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the prospect of some hawkish US inflation data later this afternoon the European indices got off to a strong start this Wednesday. The FTSE, which showed some much needed resilience in the face of the UK’s own sky-high inflation figure on Tuesday, rose 40 points after the bell, allowing the index to crawl back over the 7200 mark it has struggled with in the last few sessions. It helped that the pound wasn’t particularly energetic. Sterling failed to make the most out of yesterday’s January’s 3.0% inflation reading, and is continuing to look out of ideas this Wednesday. Against the dollar the pound is up just 0.1%, failing to cross the $1.39 levels briefly seen on Tuesday, while against the euro it has slipped a further 0.1%, leaving it to tease a fresh one month low. After wilting in the face of the euro’s strength on Tuesday the Eurozone indices are clearly in a better mood. The DAX rose 0.6%, sending it back towards 12300, with the CAC and IBEX both climbing 0.4%. Still to come is the region-wide flash Q4 GDP reading, expected to come in unchanged from the previous estimate at 0.6%. As mentioned, Japan’s Nikkei 225 is in the red, mainly due to continuing strength in the yen. The Japanese currency is benefiting from a weaker dollar, despite slower than expected growth. The country’s latest GDP figures showed the economy expanded by an annualised 0.5% in the three months to December, below the forecast 0.9%. After last night’s recovery on Wall Street - which was not followed up in Japan where the Nikkei 225 is in negative territory - European markets have made a bright start. The FTSE 100 is up 46 points or 0.65%, Germany’s Dax has opened 0.9% higher, France’s Cac has climbed 0.5% and Italy’s FTSE MIB has recovered 0.7%. Among the movers in the UK market, Sky has climbed 3% after it won the bulk of the Premier League rights in the latest top flight football auction. But Galliford Try has dropped 14% as the construction group said it planned to raise £150m from investors. It said the collapse of Carillion had increased its cash commitments on a joint venture in Aberdeen by that amount, and it did not want to divert funds from other projects to cover the payment. Meanwhile Serco has added 1% after it said it would pay £29.7m for a portfolio of health facilities management contracts from Carillion, less than the original cost of £47.7m agreed before Carillion’s liquidation. More on the German GDP figures. The country’s economy grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2017, in line with expectations. The figures were boosted by strong exports, according to the statistics agency, albeit growth was slower than the 0.7% recorded in the previous quarter. Over the entire year, the economy grew by 2.2%, the strongest performance since 2011. Economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank called it an impressive performance, but warned of the political risks ahead: The strong 4Q performance also means that without any growth in the next four quarters, annual GDP growth in 2018 would come in close to 1%. Looking ahead, the same fundamentals which have supported growth in 2016 and 2017 should still be in place in 2018. The only question is how much additional stimulus low interest rates, the strong labour market and the recent upswing of the entire Eurozone economy can still provide to the mature cycle of the German economy. In our view, still a lot. The German economy still has some upward potential as the output gap is positive but not extraordinary high compared with previous cycles, capacity utilisation is above its historical average but still lower than in 2007 and investments have only started to increase this year. Judging from previous cycles, the economy could continue its current pace for at least one or two more years, without showing signs of overheating. Obviously, there are also risks to this positive outlook for the German economy, just think of a protectionist wave coming from the US, a sharp appreciation of the euro or renewed political tensions, geopolitically, in the Eurozone or domestically. Interestingly, the last one has clearly moved up on the scale from “remote” to “clear possibility”. ...These days, Germany clearly shows two different faces: the well-known one of a strong and high-performing economy and the unknown one of fragile politics. It looks as if in the future any German Schadenfreude on political chaos in other European countries will be very muted. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Much of the recent market turmoil came after US wages growth was stronger than expected, prompting talk of rising inflation and the prospect of central banks increasing interest rates and withdrawing financial stimulus more quickly than previously expected. With that in mind, today’s US consumer price index data will be closely watched to see if inflationary pressures are indeed picking up. And even though the Federal Reserve does not take much account of the CPI measure when determining interest rate policy, there is enough nervousness around that a stronger than expected figure could have repercussions for stock markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Today’s US CPI inflation report has taken on an importance all of its own in the wake of the recently strong wages numbers, never mind the fact that the Fed doesn’t even use CPI to target inflation. Nonetheless this renewed focus on inflation, not only in the US but more globally has raised concerns that central banks may well be behind the curve when it comes to assessing the outlook for the next few months... Much importance is being attached to today’s US January CPI report, however it is unlikely to tell us too much more than what we already know about inflationary pressure in the US economy. Various ISM prices paid surveys are telling us that prices are rising at their highest levels since 2011, yet thus far we haven’t seen much evidence of it in the headline numbers. Even now indications are for CPI to slip back to 1.9% from 2.1%, while retail sales for January are expected to show a rise of 0.2%, a modest slowdown from the 0.4% rise seen in December. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: Today’s US CPI release will be one on the most closely watched data prints in recent times. Let’s not forget that the recent rout in equities started with a surprising acceleration in US earnings growth, which promoted fears that inflation may pick up soon, which in turn sent treasury yields higher. Should these fears be played out today in an unexpected strengthening in inflation, then a renewed sell off in equities and bonds could be on the cards and the dollar could benefit. With so much riding on the CPI data, we are expecting a very cautious morning of trading in general. Markets have been reasonably calm so far this week, with Wall Street recovering from early losses yesterday to end higher for the third day. Europe is expected to open higher when trading begins shortly. Here are IG’s opening calls: Apart from the US data, we also have German GPD figures, which are in line with expectations, as well as eurozone growth data. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is due to release its latest assessment of the UK shortly.

Shellfish reefs, formed by millions of oysters or mussels clustering together in or near the mouths of estuaries, have declined by up 99% since British colonisation. Yet they are not formally recognised as a threatened ecosystem under Australian environmental law. A study led by the Nature Conservancy Australia and published in the peer-reviewed open access journal Plos One on Thursday found that the number of reefs formed by Australian flat oysters, Ostrea angasi, had declined 99% from 118 found in historical records to just one, in Tasmania’s Georges Bay. The number of reefs formed by rock oysters, Saccostrea glomerata, which are found on coastal banks around Sydney, declined 90% from 60 known historical locations to six surviving reefs. It is even more drastic than the decline in the Great Barrier Reef, which suffered unprecedented mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 that are believed to have killed up to half of the coral, and the shrinking of kelp forests, which have declined 90% off the coast of Western Australia due to successive marine heatwaves. “While it and other coral reefs are indeed under threat, it’s the shellfish reefs that have really suffered the most,” James Cook University senior researcher Ian McLeod, a co-author on the study, said. “It’s just that most of them disappeared before we were born so people aren’t aware we’ve lost them,” Chris Gillies, marine manager at the Nature Conservancy Australia and lead author on the study, said researchers would use the data from the latest study to apply this month for shellfish reefs to be included on the threatened ecosystem list under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. “As a species they are not going to be wiped off the map, but as an ecosystem there is not many of them left,” he said. “It’s like river red gums. There are always going to be river red gums but river red gum forests – there’s very few of them left.” Gillies said that he hoped the proximity of shellfish reefs, which have historically been found in high population areas such as Sydney harbour and Melbourne’s Port Phillip Bay, would help drive community support. Restoration projects, involving dropping rocks into the previous reef sites and seeding those rocks with oyster larvae, have already been funded along Australia’s southern coast. “It’s something that’s right under the nose of most coastal Australians,” Gillies said. “These reefs are restorable with funding. We can bring back the reef sand, all the benefits that come with that as well.” The benefits are in water filtration, increased local fish production, and bank stabilisation. A one-hectare oyster reef can filter 2.7bn litres of sea water per year, removing 142kg of nitrogen and 22kg of phosphate. That is about 100L of water per oyster per day. Those toxins are converted into pellets, which provide a rich food source and allow the reef to sustain 375kg of new fish per hectare per year. Researchers examined fishing records and Indigenous middens to determine the locations of historic shellfish reefs, which were harvested and polluted to extinction by white settlers in the late 18th and early 19th century. Much of the information came from newspaper clippings, often from people writing in to complain that the oyster bank they harvested had declined. Mention of natural oyster reefs dropped away by the 1950s. Farms using pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), a Japanese native, soon took over the food supply. “People essentially forgot about native oyster reefs because they stopped farming from them, and they left them behind in the fishing records,” Gillies said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/14/marriage-equality-campaign-seeks-abolition-of-religious-rights-to-discriminate","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T05:08:27Z","webTitle":"Marriage equality campaign seeks abolition of religious rights to discriminate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/14/marriage-equality-campaign-seeks-abolition-of-religious-rights-to-discriminate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/14/marriage-equality-campaign-seeks-abolition-of-religious-rights-to-discriminate","fields":{"headline":"Marriage equality campaign seeks abolition of religious rights to discriminate","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Exemptions in discrimination law that allow religious institutions such as schools, hospitals and aged care facilities to discriminate against staff and clients based on beliefs should be abolished, the Equality Campaign has said. The Equality Campaign, which prosecuted the case for marriage equality in the postal survey campaign, has made the call in a submission to the Ruddock religious freedom review. The submissions follow a call from Christian Schools Australia and Adventist Schools Australia for schools to retain the ability to hire and fire teachers and other staff and exclude students based on their beliefs and adherence to religious codes. The Equality Campaign said that the cross-party same-sex marriage bill, which passed in December, “struck a fair balance and should not be revisited” and called on the review to reject proposed amendments in the rival conservative Paterson same-sex marriage bill. The Equality Campaign said religious exemptions allowing discrimination in employment, education and delivery of goods and services should be repealed. The exemptions “go too far” – allowing publicly funded religious social services to “lawfully turn away LGBTI people, single mothers and others where this refusal is in line with the charity’s religious beliefs”. “Religious exemptions act as a barrier to vulnerable people accessing the support services they need,” it said. Religious exemptions were a focus in the campaign because of a threat from the Catholic church to sack staff who engaged in same-sex marriage and because of the sacking of a gay teacher in Western Australia. The Equality Campaign co-chair Alex Greenwich, who gave evidence to the Ruddock review in one of its closed hearings in Sydney on Wednesday, told Guardian Australia that sexuality and faith were not in conflict. “We talked about the fact it’s one thing to have your belief protected and another to target the LGBTI community in discrimination law exemptions ... which create an environment of fear, which prevent LGBTI people from being their whole self,” he said. The Human Rights Law Centre recommended that all rights and freedoms in the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, including freedom of religion, should be legislated. Both the HRLC and Equality Campaign called for the creation of a human rights act and recommended that religious belief or activity – including not having a religious belief – should be introduced as a protected attribute under federal anti-discrimination law. The HRLC also called for federal anti-vilification laws to prevent “public advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that incites discrimination, hostility or violence”. It said that religious exemptions to discrimination law should be repealed in favour of a “general limitations clause” that differential treatment that would otherwise be discrimination is only allowable “where there is a legitimate aim and where reasonable, necessary and proportionate”. “Alternatively, we propose that religious exemptions are only available to organisations that do not receive any government funding, or ... are not available to organisations providing goods and services to vulnerable groups.” A submission from the Freedom for Faith thinktank, endorsed by church groups including Hillsong, the Presbyterian church and the Anglican diocese of Sydney, has called for a religious freedom act to give religious institutions a positive right to uphold their values in employment practices. But not all religious groups have called for rights to discriminate. The National Council of Churches in Australia, in a submission written by its president, the Melbourne Anglican bishop Philip Huggins, said the right to freedom of religion was “in reasonable shape” in Australia. Keith Joseph, the Anglican dean of Darwin, submitted that “religious freedom does not entail freedom from general social obligations, including ... on providers of commercial goods and services to provide [them] without discrimination”. Joseph said that Christians should “have no fear” about providing services to same-sex weddings because it was possible to do so “without condoning the wedding”. The inquiry has now advertised hearings throughout February in capital cities and will report its findings by the end of March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/14/what-happens-after-barnaby-joyce-resigns","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T07:19:09Z","webTitle":"What happens after Barnaby Joyce resigns? | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/14/what-happens-after-barnaby-joyce-resigns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/14/what-happens-after-barnaby-joyce-resigns","fields":{"headline":"What happens after Barnaby Joyce resigns?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/14/indigenous-australian-figure-skater-harley-windsor-makes-history","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T04:44:36Z","webTitle":"Indigenous Australian figure skater Harley Windsor makes history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/14/indigenous-australian-figure-skater-harley-windsor-makes-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/14/indigenous-australian-figure-skater-harley-windsor-makes-history","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous Australian figure skater Harley Windsor makes history","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"History was made at the Gangneung Ice Arena on Wednesday when Harley Windsor, a figure skater from the western suburbs of Sydney, became the first Indigenous Australian athlete to compete at a Winter Olympics. The 21-year-old, along with his Russia-born partner Ekaterina Alexandrovskaya, delivered a near-clean short program to a cover version of the Rolling Stones song Paint it Black. Skating second, their score of 61.55 briefly put them top of the leaderboard but ultimately it was not enough to progress to Thursday’s free skate. They were edged out of the top 16 with just one couple to perform, eventually finishing 18th. Windsor, a rugby league fan, famously discovered ice-skating at the age of eight after his mother, Josie Winsor, from the Weilwyn and Gamilaraay people, took a wrong turn and they ended up outside the skating rink in Blacktown. His interest pricked, Windsor strapped on a pair of skates and has never looked back. His rise since that fateful day has been rapid. He and Alexandrovskaya count the world junior and Australian national titles among their achievements together. The Rooty Hill-raised athlete partnered with Alexandrovskaya for the first time during a try-out in Moscow two years ago, and after hitting if off, Alexandrovskaya was released by the Figure Skating Federation of Russia and granted Australian citizenship in October last year. Windsor’s mother was in the stands while his father Peter Dahlstrom, of Gamilaraay and Ngarrable descent, was tuning in from Sydney. “It felt good to have the support,” Windsor said. “It’s pretty special knowing so many people were cheering me on. “The attention has been amazing and I just hope I’ll be a bit of a role model now,” Windsor said. “Hopefully more Indigenous kids get into winter sports.” The last Australians to compete in the Olympic pairs were Danielle and Stephen Carr 20 years ago in Nagano."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/14/escaped-prisoner-swapped-twin-recaptured-drugged-peru","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T04:16:20Z","webTitle":"Escaped prisoner who swapped places with twin is recaptured in Peru","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/14/escaped-prisoner-swapped-twin-recaptured-drugged-peru","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/14/escaped-prisoner-swapped-twin-recaptured-drugged-peru","fields":{"headline":"Escaped prisoner who swapped places with twin is recaptured in Peru","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A prisoner who mounted an extraordinary escape from Peruvian jail by swapping places with his visiting twin brother has been recaptured. The arrest of Alexander Jheferson Delgado Herrera marks the end of more than a year on the run from authorities. He had been serving a 16-year sentence for child sexual abuse and robbery when his twin brother Giancarlo visited in January last year. Alexander Delgado Herrera allegedly drugged Giancarlo and changed into his clothes before walking out of the prison, the BBC reported. Amid uncertainty about exactly what occurred, Giancarlo was initially investigated for aiding his brother, but prosecutors eventually dropped charges against him, El País reported. This week saw a breakthrough in the search for the fugitive. “Today there was the recapture of a violator who on 10 January 2017 fled Piedras Gordas when he was supplanted by his brother,” the interior ministry said in a statement. “This relative was in detention in place of him, but today Delgado Herrera has been arrested.” Authorities had been monitoring Delgado Herrera for several months and located him at the front of a building in the seaside district of Callao, the ministry said. He tried to escape when he saw agents from the National Police of Peru but was soon captured. Delgado Herrera claimed he had come up with the dramatic escape plan because he wanted to see his mother, local media outlet Diario Correo reported. The interior ministry had offered a reward of 20,000 Peruvian Sol (US$6,127/£4,401) for information that would lead to his capture. He was apparently also known by an alias, Vaporito. Authorities had previously been stunned by his escape. “It’s unbelievable – in 12 years nobody had escaped from Ancón I,” said a former justice minister, Marisol Pérez Tello."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/14/united-airlines-engine-ua1175-hawaii-san-francisco-disintegrates-over-pacific","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-14T04:28:24Z","webTitle":"United Airlines engine disintegrates over Pacific, forcing emergency landing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/14/united-airlines-engine-ua1175-hawaii-san-francisco-disintegrates-over-pacific","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/14/united-airlines-engine-ua1175-hawaii-san-francisco-disintegrates-over-pacific","fields":{"headline":"United Airlines engine disintegrates over Pacific, forcing emergency landing","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A United Airlines plane flying to Hawaii was forced to make an emergency landing after its engine began to fall apart mid-air. After what was described as “the scariest flight of my life” by one passenger, photos and videos taken through the windows showed an exposed engine shaking in mid-air after the “engine cowling” broke away. The drama on board the Boeing 777-222 began after a loud bang was heard roughly 35 minutes before the flight was scheduled to land in Honolulu. The pilots immediately sent out a distress call and were forced to make an emergency landing. A Google engineer on board the flight, Erik Haddad, who had a clear view of the exposed engine, apparently remained calm throughout the incident, uploading a series of photos to Twitter and quipping: “I don’t see anything about this in the manual.” Another passenger, Maria Falaschi, who uploaded a series of dramatic photos, said it was the “scariest flight of my life” but the pilots did “a great job and so did the crew”, adding that the passengers were prepared for an emergency landing by crew who “handled it well”. A statement from United Airlines said the flight landed safely at 12.38pm local time. “United flight 1175 traveling to Honolulu from San Francisco landed safely after the pilots called for an emergency landing because of an issue with the #2 engine. Our pilots followed all necessary protocols to safely land the aircraft.

United is fully cooperating with the NTSB and FAA investigation of the event.” United said it was “fully cooperating” with investigations by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board.

Many of the songs on her new album, Depth of Field, seem to indicate so. In some places they call to mind Donna Summer; in others they are reminiscent of Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s troubling (and sublime) Murder on the Dancefloor. Her music is shot through with desire, a longing that goes beyond the usual template of imagined and sometimes real slights. Calling a song Never Let Me Go may well not be the most original idea around, but Blasko invests the phrase with a degree of vulnerability and hope that goes far beyond the norm. The songs on Blasko’s sixth album feel possessed of a dark undercurrent, the sort of edge that comes around after you have spent one too many late-night hours waiting for your partner to return home from carousing. You can visualise the mirror ball throwing cascade confusion during the opening song, Phantom, but the lyrics refer to something darker yet, a “phantom heartbeat”. Is Blasko singing about an imaginary child? A never-born? Her poise and her voice are immaculate – crystalline, enticing – but the music and sentiments seem deeply troubled. Blasko herself claims the song concerns other matters entirely. “I asked my dad [a history and English teacher] to record himself reading poetry for inspiration,” she says. “He quoted a line from Nietzsche which contained the word ‘phantom’. This song is about the role that influential people play in your life, forming who you are. I feel I carry them with me. Their presence is so tangible even when they’re not there, like a phantom limb.” A phantom limb: this is what Depth of Field feels to me right now. Songs like the swirling Heaven Sent and beckoning intimacy of Read My Mind race around my head like a real friend, or a forbidden lover. I have carried this album almost everywhere with me for weeks now. Whether it is playing through my headphones or not, Blasko’s cajoling, sensational voice soundtracks the inner sadness and mundane reality of the 10.09 train to Guildford. Another half-hour delay? Another chance to listen to Blasko. Reviewing this Australian songwriter’s Aria-award-winning fifth album, 2015’s Eternal Return, I made reference to Olivia Newton-John. In particular, I feel that both singers have the ability to perform broken hearts that can help shatter and mend real ones, too. I wrote: “Her songwriting craft is so advanced, her grasp of pop so redolent, it is sometimes easy to forget how great a singer Blasko is.” I stand by those sentiments for Blasko’s sixth, recorded on the cusp of an international breakthrough, surely. The brace of betrayal songs – A Shot and Never Let Me Go – stalk these lonely streets with menace and unrequited desire in their hearts – brutal and honest and suffused with melancholia. These are as great as any Australian pop I have heard, from Kylie Minogue to The Easybeats. Similarly, Blasko’s music often feels like it follows the lineage of mod and the core values of that style: aspirational, inspirational, forward looking, tightly wound, late-night fuelled. Every now and then, Blasko wanders into glam-stomp diva territory. And of course she owns it. The deliciously naughty (not fragile at all) Everybody Wants to Sin is Goldfrapp without the high heels, a shiver of delight to seduce the dancefloor. Every dancefloor. Everywhere. • Depth of Field by Sarah Blasko is out through EMI on 23 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/13/mauricio-pochettino-praises-tottenham-character","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-13T23:55:06Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino praises Tottenham character in Juventus comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/13/mauricio-pochettino-praises-tottenham-character","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/13/mauricio-pochettino-praises-tottenham-character","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino praises Tottenham character in Juventus comeback","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino saluted his Tottenham team’s character after they overcame a nightmare start in Turin to draw 2-2 in the Champions League last-16 first leg. The London club were 2-0 down after nine minutes to a pair of Gonzalo Higuaín goals – one of them a penalty – but they stabilised before taking control. Harry Kane pulled one back on 35 minutes and, although Higuaín missed a second penalty in first-half stoppage time, Pochettino was entitled to say that Tottenham were the dominant force. The outstanding Christian Eriksen scored the equaliser in the 72nd minute and the Juventus manager, Massimiliano Allegri, felt the frustration rise. He poured it out afterwards in an attack on the Italian press, whom he accused of underestimating Tottenham. For Pochettino this was one of the finest results of his career and put his team in charge for the return leg at Wembley on 7 March. “At 2-0 down my feeling was so bad,” Pochettino said. “We started sloppily. But we showed great character and I feel so proud. We are a young team in this competition. To show that kind of performance was fantastic. “The energy was fantastic and it’s important to say we played with one day less [of rest]. Juventus played last Friday while we had the derby [against Arsenal on Saturday]. One day in this competition is a lot. The derby was emotional, you spend more energy. And at 2-0 you always need more energy. “We dominated possession and forced them to play deeper and only use the counterattack. We were so focused. Only the opening minutes were difficult to handle. But after that we dominated Juventus and that is a thing to praise. “Not many teams come here and dominate Juventus. We showed we are mature enough to compete in this competition.

Go away.'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“Art history taught me I have no place in history,” said Hannah Gadsby in her furious, hilarious, devastating stand-up show Nanette. “Women didn’t have time to think thoughts; they were too busy taking naps naked in the forest.” This is the central idea advanced in Gadsby’s new two-part ABC series Nakedy Nudes. Her thesis is that the current ideals of beautiful bodies and strict gender norms have a long past, inherited from the ancient Greeks and their Renaissance relatives. The Tasmanian-born comedian who studied art history as an undergraduate has always been a master at communicating big ideas through her personal narrative. After years of touring and TV appearances, Gadsby’s performance on Josh Thomas’s deeply beloved Please Like Me introduced her drolly depressed, thinly fictionalised persona to a global audience (“Sorry I’m late,” she deadpanned grimly in season four. “Someone called me fat in year three.”) and a stream of lucid and viral Facebook posts about the big political events of the moment – from #NotAllMen to the Don Burke revelations to Australia’s damaging pathway to marriage equality – enunciated how each has resonated with her. Then came Nanette, its highly coveted Edinburgh comedy award, its sold-out national tour, and its forthcoming Netflix special. In the show, which shortly commences a month-long run in New York city and will be followed by a book adaptation, she declares her retirement from the stage: “I’m serious when I say I should quit comedy; it’s probably not the forum for this.” By “this”, she means the story of her trauma, which began when she was growing up as a contested citizen in the thick of Tasmania’s 1990s debate about legalising homosexuality, a debate that left her soaked in shame. The bitter, perverse irony derived from this clashing of anguish and gags gives Nanette a sober, moving subtext. In pushing her past into punchlines, the joke is on Gadsby – and by the show’s end, the smile with which she walked onstage is gone. Nakedy Nudes picks up where the art history portions of that stand-up show left off, and “joins the dots”, Gadsby says, between the concepts we’ve inherited from art criticism and the toxic, sexist cultures being torched by the #MeToo movement. The TV show, which follows Gadsby’s previous ABC art documentaries, calls out what interviewee and Sydney artist Deborah Kelly says is women’s overwhelming depiction as “prone, boneless and sexually available” objects throughout much of western art history – all pale glowing limbs and Renaissance ideals. “The body [is] to be looked at by a man,” says Gadsby in the series. “An artist, almost always assumed to be a bloke, looking at a body in the picture frame, almost always a woman.” “The sheer number of paintings of unconscious women is distressing,” she says over the phone. “Most of those women are being watched by conscious men within the painting itself. And that’s normalising a very distressing thing. We see it a lot. “It’s good to take stock of that in light of what’s happening at the moment – with what people are speaking about culturally,” she says, referring to the reckoning against sexual harassment and assault that has followed allegations against Harvey Weinstein. “We haven’t invented that problem in this generation, we haven’t invented it this century. This is something we’ve inherited and it will take a long time to unpick, but it’s not worth defending. “Just because it’s been around for centuries, doesn’t mean it’s cool to be a creepy old man. Stop watching women sleeping; stop watching women having baths. Go away.” For Gadsby, the male gaze in art history is directly related to the male gaze in Hollywood, and society at large. “We’re not seeing anything new,” she reiterates. “The art world doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Being an object, being objectified, [creates] a toxic culture, because we don’t have the same cultural influence as men do. They’ve written the story, they have the power. “#MeToo should not be limited to art or TV. What’s happening in the world where there’s no glamour is worse. There are powerless people in the world who don’t have a voice, who are struggling in this toxic culture of silence.” In the program, Gadsby interviews Australian artists including Julie Rrap, Brook Andrew, Ben Quilty and Bill Henson, who through their work have, she argues, disrupted this distressing, objectifying grand narrative of the nude. “The first disruption is the medium they choose,” she says. “Julie Rrap uses her own body, which is a departure in and of itself because women and female bodies in art have generally been objects, so she’s breaking the mould.” Gadsby also speaks to Wendy Whiteley as a collaborator, not a muse, of her late husband Brett. Gadsby’s voice is direct and down-to-earth – a rarity in the often-elitist sport that is art history. Her approach in taking art history off its highbrow mantle is “just to pretty much be myself”: “I talk slow and I don’t give a shit.” When asked if Nakedy Nudes is about asserting a feminist, queer voice within art history, she says: “That’s been going on for a while – it’s just that no one’s been listening. What the Guerrilla Girls were saying in the 1980s is still what we’re battling today, and that’s just ridiculous to my mind. The new story is the same story.” The Guerrilla Girls is an activist art-group that has agitated for gender equality in galleries and museums. And if art history has been dominated by the images and ideas of straight white men, so too has art criticism – an imbalance that Nakedy Nudes wryly, cleverly talks back to. “You can’t change the story, but you can change the way you tell it and what you focus on,” she says. “You can’t rewrite history, but you can shake it up.” Nakedy Nudes premieres on the ABC on Tuesday 27 February.

If Highways England was serious about “enhancing and protecting” this unique and beguiling place, it would propose a tunnel that is long enough and deep enough to avoid the world heritage site altogether. As recent archaeological finds show, the earth that surrounds Stonehenge still harbours secrets about our past, and to damage our collective history in this way would be a national scandal.

Rashly he said yes. That was mission impossible, he soon discovered. And only weeks into the job, his wife, Pamela, died in childbirth, leaving him with two small children. Yet between 1954 and his retirement in 1983 Sheppard produced no fewer than 16 volumes of the Survey of London. In the process he transformed what had been a sporadic and selective record of London’s historic buildings, area by area, into a model of urban topographical writing, rich in content, authoritative, gracefully composed, beautifully illustrated, and still an unequalled resource for anyone interested in London’s history and architecture. No city in the world can boast an equivalent to the Survey of London series, which is now well past its 50th volume. It owes its modern form and reputation to Sheppard, who may be fairly claimed to be London’s greatest topographical writer since John Stow, the Elizabethan historian. That Sheppard’s name is not better known is due to his modesty. Disliking fuss, he was content to be a tiny cog in the municipal machine that was the London county council, later the Greater London council, so long as he was allowed to get on with the job, aided by a small team of loyal subordinates. Yet he was not without ambition or drive. Some mornings he would bound up the stairs of County Hall, not waiting for the lift, bolt like a rabbit into his office and nestle between a fan of papers, hardly emerging before the next draft chapter had been completed for the typist in his beetling longhand. On others he might be found head deep in some record office or private archive, making the pinpoint-accurate notes from which his texts were composed. As a historian, Sheppard took time to emerge. He was born in Cobham, Surrey, the son of Leslie Sheppard, known as LA Sheppard, an expert on early printed books at the British Museum; his mother, Dorothy (nee Ewbank), had been a nurse and translator in a Red Cross unit during the first world war. Francis attended Bradfield college, near Reading, then studied history at King’s College, Cambridge. After a false start or two, his first satisfactory job was in the West Sussex county record office in Chichester, where he acquired a taste for archives and for the makeup of English townscape, which was as yet little explored. From 1949 to 1953 he was an assistant keeper at the London Museum, now the Museum of London, which moved into Kensington Palace during Sheppard’s time there. Much later he wrote a history of the museum, The Treasury of London’s Past (1991). Its director, the archaeologist WF Grimes, suggested that Sheppard should write a doctorate if he wanted to get on: he chose to study the voluminous parish records of Marylebone. The result was a masterpiece with the consummately uncharismatic title Local Government in St Marylebone 1688–1835. Inspired by the Edwardian scholarship of Sidney and Beatrice Webb and published in 1958, it is a most readable and lucid study of English local government. In the 1950s interest in urban architecture and planning stopped short at the Victorian period. Sheppard was aware of the need to go further, and began to do so in his first volume of the reanimated Survey, on south Lambeth (1956). But the LCC’s historic buildings division, with which he and his colleagues were linked in a sometimes uneasy relationship, was more concerned with the threat to Georgian buildings in the West End, which the researches of the Survey could help to defend. So the series concentrated its investigations during the 60s and 70s on St James’s, Soho, Covent Garden and Mayfair. The impact of these volumes on conserving swathes of inner London was most notable in the case of Covent Garden, where the Survey’s discoveries helped derail the GLC’s own destructive plans for the area. Later Sheppard turned his attention to Kensington, the area where he had been brought up. Under the influence of his friend HJ Dyos, a pioneer of modern British urban history, the Survey started to treat areas of London in a holistic way, drawing urban development, architecture and social and economic history together. Northern Kensington, published in 1973, was the first volume to feature this fuller approach, even becoming something of a bestseller. Despite the demands of the Survey, Sheppard found time to publish in 1971 a first-rate history of the Victorian metropolis, London 1808–1870: The Infernal Wen, and after his retirement the broader London: A History (1998). During all this time he lived not in London but in Henley-on-Thames, where he was very active in civic life for a period. Enraged by attempts to demolish the august Catherine Wheel, an old coaching inn in the town’s main street, he led a successful campaign of resistance. Out of that came the foundation of the Henley Society, of which he was the first secretary. He served for 10 years as a councillor, and for a year as mayor of Henley. He wrote a history of the local brewery, Brakspear’s (1979). Sheppard is survived by Rupert and Joanna, the children from his first marriage, to Pamela Davies, and by Arabella, the daughter of his marriage to Elizabeth Lees, whom he married in 1957 and who died in 2014. • Francis Henry Wollaston Sheppard, historian, born 10 September 1921; died 22 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/12/trump-infrastructure-plan-200bn","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T18:08:56Z","webTitle":"Trump pledges to fix infrastructure but $200bn plan falls well short","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/12/trump-infrastructure-plan-200bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/12/trump-infrastructure-plan-200bn","fields":{"headline":"Trump pledges to fix infrastructure but $200bn plan falls well short","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump unveiled a $200bn plan to fix America’s crumbling infrastructure – a plan that falls woefully short of the trillions civil engineers say is needed to rebuild the country’s tattered backbone and is likely to face intense opposition from Democrats and Republicans. Trump said in a statement: “We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart, and American hands, and American grit.” He said the plans constituted “the biggest and boldest infrastructure investment in American history”. Trump has earmarked $200bn in federal funds to encourage states, cities and private enterprise to rebuild the nation’s dams, roads, bridges, airports and other essential infrastructure. The aim is to encourage $1tn of extra investment. Trump campaigned on the need infrastructure reform, promising to spend “big” on infrastructure and consistently touted his record as a builder. But the promised federal funds are a fraction of the $2tn that the American Society of Civil Engineers says is needed to repair US infrastructure. Last year, the ASCE gave the US’s infrastructure a D+ grade and said failure to act would cost the US economy $4tn by 2025. The plan is also likely to run into opposition in Congress. There is widespread support for public works spending among Democrats, but little appetite to work with Trump. House Democrats have already unveiled an alternative plan that would inject $1tn in direct federal spending – five times what Trump will propose – into infrastructure. Trump is likely to face opposition, too, from fiscally conservative Republicans, especially following the passage of last year’s $1.5tn tax cut plan and last week’s budget agreement, which critics charge will add another $420bn to the national debt. Trump appeared to acknowledge on Monday that the infrastructure plan may not pass. At a press conference, he said the plan was not as important as military spending or the tax cuts he passed in December. “What was very important to me was the military; what was very important to me was the tax cuts; and what was very important to me was regulation. This is of great importance, but it’s not nearly of that category because the states will have to do it themselves if we don’t do it,” he said. On Monday, the White House also released its latest budget plan – a plan somewhat neutered by the Senate’s passing of a two-year budget deal last week. Trump’s budget proposes more than $23bn for border security and immigration enforcement and $13bn to address America’s opioid addiction crisis, but is suggestive: Congress will set spending levels. The president will meet delegates from both sides of Congress this week to push his plan this week. On Monday morning on Twitter he promoted the project. But it is not the first time that Trump has promised a “big week for infrastructure”. In August, Trump launched an “infrastructure week” that was quickly derailed by a press conference where the he blamed “both sides” for the fatal violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/12/its-very-rare-to-wake-up-during-a-general-anaesthetic","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T18:07:48Z","webTitle":"It’s very rare to wake up during a general anaesthetic | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/12/its-very-rare-to-wake-up-during-a-general-anaesthetic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/12/its-very-rare-to-wake-up-during-a-general-anaesthetic","fields":{"headline":"It’s very rare to wake up during a general anaesthetic","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Accidental awareness (when a patient becomes conscious during a general anaesthetic) is an incredibly important issue to both patients and anaesthetists (The long read, 9 February). Patients undergoing surgery can be assured that it is highly uncommon to wake up during a general anaesthetic. The largest ever research study (NAP5) performed on this topic was carried out in 2014 by the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland. It showed that approximately one person in 20,000 reported awareness, and it most commonly occurred before surgery started or after it finished. Anaesthetists work extremely hard to ensure that the approximately 3m general anaesthetics performed each year deliver safe, comfortable and stress-free surgery – we always put patient safety first. Anaesthesia is a highly complex medical speciality and all anaesthetists undergo rigorous education and training programmes and continuous performance appraisals. The risk of accidental awareness differs according to certain patient characteristics and the type of surgery and anaesthetic the patient requires. Our 2014 NAP5 report makes clear recommendations on what steps anaesthetists can take to minimise the risk of awareness and address any psychological harm from these rare events. Important and accurate information about anaesthesia can be found online at http://bit.ly/rcoa_patientinfo Dr Liam Brennan President, Royal College of Anaesthetists Dr Paul Clyburn President, Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland • General anaesthetics do not act by “reacting with the slick membranes of the nerve cells in the brain”. It was shown in 1979 by Franks and Lieb that general anaesthetics had no effect on membranes at physiological concentrations. In 1984 they showed that the anaesthetic molecule, halothane, inhibited the action of the protein luciferase at anaesthetic concentrations similar to those that anaesthetised animals. The most common general anaesthetic, propofol, was shown in 2013 by a team at Imperial College London to interact specifically with one site on a complex five-chain protein present in brain cells called Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid Receptor type A (GABAR-A). Another anaesthetic, etomidate, interacts with the same protein but at a different site. These interactions cause the receptor to remain in the “open” state for a longer period of time, thereby allowing the entry of chloride ions into the cell and “hyperpolarising” the cell, causing it to fire less often. The details of the circuitry that is then involved in shutting down areas of the brain responsible for consciousness are still being elucidated, but it probably involves the thalamus, one of the major structures deep in the brain. Other “hypnotic” drugs in use by anaesthetists such as nitrous oxide, ketamine, and the noble gas xenon, have been known since the late 1990s to act on different proteins in the brain, called NMDA receptors. While the first public demonstration of anaesthesia in western society might have been in 1846, it is worth noting that the Chinese surgeon Hua Tuo (c 140–208) used a concoction of drugs called mafeisan to allow the opening of patients’ abdomens with little pain. The Japanese surgeon Seishu Hanaoka (1760-1835) used a similar combination of drugs to mafeisan which were given orally to perform major surgery. In 1805 he carried out a number of radical operations for breast cancer.

Fifteen lawyers, academics and human rights activists, most based in Hong Kong, have signed an open letter to bishops across the world expressing dismay at an agreement which would involve the Vatican recognising seven bishops appointed by China’s Communist party. The deal is aimed at restoring relations between China and the Vatican, which were cut almost 70 years ago. But the group of leading Catholics say it could create a schism in the church in China. “We are worried that the agreement would not only fail to guarantee the limited freedom desired by the church, but also … deal a blow to the church’s moral power,” the letter says. “Please rethink the current agreement, and stop making an irreversible and regrettable mistake.” The letter comes less than two weeks after a senior Catholic leader in Asia accused the Vatican of selling out the church in its efforts to make a deal with the Chinese government. Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former bishop of Hong Kong, wrote in a blog post: “Do I think the Vatican is selling out the Catholic church in China? Yes, definitely, if they go in the direction which is obvious from all what they are doing in recent years and months.” Last month, the Vatican asked two “underground” bishops – who operate without Chinese government approval – to relinquish their positions in favour of government-appointed counterparts, one of whom was excommunicated by Rome in 2011. One of them, Guo Xijin, said at the weekend he would “obey Rome’s decision” and respect any deal struck between the Beijing and Vatican authorities. Guo and the second bishop, Zhuang Jianjian, are under police surveillance and Guo has been repeatedly detained, including for 20 days last year. The issue of bishop appointments is at the centre of efforts to restore Vatican-Chinese relations, which were officially severed after the foundation of the Communist state in 1949. There are an estimated 10 to 12 million Catholics in China, with about half worshipping in underground churches, and half in government-managed churches. The Chinese government has appointed seven bishops, who are not recognised by Rome. Up to 40 Rome-backed underground bishops operate without Chinese government approval. Negotiations to restore ties between the two powers opened more than 18 months ago, but the issue of bishops has been a major stumbling block. Last year the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the Communist party congress that religions in China “must be Chinese in orientation”, and the government must “provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt themselves to socialist society”. New regulations came into force on 1 February specifying the types of religious organisations that can exist, where they can exist and the activities they can organise. There has been a crackdown on burgeoning evangelical Protestant churches, with many being forced to remove crosses and ordered to disband. According to the Catholic leaders’ open letter, “the Communist party in China, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, has repeatedly destroyed crosses and churches, and the [state-controlled China Catholic Patriotic Association] maintains its heavy-handed control over the church. “Religious persecution has never stopped. Xi has also made it clear that the party will strengthen its control over religions.” It goes on: “We cannot see any possibility that the coming agreement can result in the Chinese government stopping its persecution of the church and ceasing its violations of religious freedom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/13/how-has-dating-changed-in-the-metoo-era","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-13T08:16:27Z","webTitle":"How has dating changed in the #MeToo era?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/13/how-has-dating-changed-in-the-metoo-era","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/13/how-has-dating-changed-in-the-metoo-era","fields":{"headline":"How has dating changed in the #MeToo era?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s been four months since revelations about the behaviour of the Hollywood producer, Harvey Weinstein, first started to emerge.

The good news is that another liveblog will be launching to see us through the rest of the day in Pyeongchang. Be sure to join us again but until then, here’s some reading on Kim’s win: FINAL RESULTS GOLD: Chloe Kim (USA), 98.25 SILVER: Liu Jiayu (China), 89.75 BRONZE: Arielle Gold (USA), 85.75 Kelly Clark (83.50) finishes just off the podium. Judged events are sometimes controversial, but this was an easy call. Kim just has another level. Liu went for the 1080 but couldn’t quite land it, the only blemish on a strong performance. The only tough decision was between Gold and Clark for bronze. China’s Cai Xuetong landed a good but not great final run to take fifth. Most other riders landed a “safe” run and failed to improve upon it. So if you enjoy seeing someone live up to the hype, you surely enjoyed that. Chloe Kim is the best of the world and apparently impervious to pressure. Chloe Kim hugs everyone at the top of the slope before walking over to start a third run that is purely ceremonial at this point. She has the gold. Will she go for back-to-back 1080s? Frontside 1080 is good. Cab 1080 ... she gets it around! And she adds a McTwist. This might be even bigger than her first run ... and it is! With a 98.25, she has posted the two best runs of the day. It’s not just an Olympic gold. It’s a statement. SECOND-TO-LAST RIDER Liu Jiayu with some big amplitude, 720, 900, 540, goes for the 1080 ... No! She can’t land it, and the order is set. THIRD-TO-LAST RIDER Haruna Matsumoto is the last person who can make the podium. She’ll have to beat Arielle Gold’s 85.75. She has a decent run and manages to land the 1080, but as with so many others, she’s not quite clean enough to keep her momentum. That’s a 65.75. Her best run of 70.00 is good for sixth. Arielle Gold clinches bronze. Gold and silver will be Chloe Kim and Liu Jiayu, but Liu has one more shot to change the order. (And then Kim will have one more shot to answer.) FOUR RIDERS LEFT. Here’s Maddie Mastro, the young American who has not yet landed a clean run. And she won’t. She goes for the 1080, which she landed for the first time at the X Games last month, and it doesn’t happen for her here. She’ll finish 12th, but remember that she never went for that “safe” run that might’ve landed her in the top 10 or top 8. She took a “go big or go home” strategy. Chloe Kim has clinched a medal. Queralt Castellet has a big run with back-to-back 900s, but she can’t land the 1080. No improvement on her 67.75, currently seventh. (Cai moved up to fifth.) Cai Xuetong (China) has two world championships and two X Games medals. Big amplitude. Cab 720. Frontside 540. Backside 540. Frontside 900. She’s up to 76.50 Tomito opens with a 900 but loses some speed. She gets back to land a couple of 540s, but the atmosphere just seems down after Arthur’s accident, and she’s not doing much now. Her score isn’t bad at 60.50, but her first run of 65.25 holds up. Seventh place for now -- two riders could pass her. Still, they’re tending to Arthur. She seemed to be holding her wrist to her chest. Not that it matters, but she got a 25.00. Seven riders to go. Kim, Liu, Gold still your podium for now. Australia’s Emily Arthur is back for her last shot at this. Her first run was a so-so 48.25. She slipped on her second. Starts with a 900 and lands not so cleanly. Just doesn’t get a lot of air on her remaining jumps and tries to do too much toward the end, falling on her head. She’s fortunately not hurt badly and manages to get back up to the end of the pipe. Sophie Rodriguez falls after a couple of tricks. So ends her fourth Olympic competition. Mirabelle Thovex lands a perfectly reasonable but not spectacular run. She improves to 63.00. Nine riders to go. Current podium is Kim (93.75), Liu (89.75), Gold (85.75). Gold has taken her final run. Liu and Kim go last. Who is Arielle Gold? Someone who’s been waiting for this for a while. She was due to compete in Sochi but was injured on a training run. Kelly Clark with a big 1080 into a 720. Big air. Pity the judges who have to separate this from Gold’s run. 83.50! Better than her second run but JUST short of Gold’s 85.75. FINAL RUN STARTS with Arielle Gold, currently in fourth. The tension is palpable. Gets a frontside 1080. Crippler and a 900 late in the run. This is good. Is it enough to beat the legend Kelly Clark? She’s needs 76.25 ... She gets it! 85.75. Now Clark gets her shot at a fourth Olympic medal. From Thomas Wahl: “It seems like NBC isn’t showing all the competitors, but how do they do that when it’s “live.” And does the announcing seem even more jingoistic than usual? All the non-US snowboarders on the second run fell. There must be others to show.” Hey, that’s why you also need the app or the live streams or some other source of info. Chloe Kim (USA) 93.75 Liu Jiayu (China) 89.75 Kelly Clark (USA) 81.75 Arielle Gold (USA) 74.75 So Chloe Kim knows she will have the lead going into the final run. Will she go all-out here for back-to-back 1080s? Frontside 1080. She goes for the second but doesn’t quite land it. She still manages a couple of tricks down the pipe, playing to the crowd, but her first-run 93.75 is still ahead. I don’t understand how that’s only a 41.50 unless they’re deducting about 30 points for a fall, but I haven’t read the manual all the way through. Liu Jiayu (China) lands a perfectly good run, pretty much the same as the first. Not really sure why. She might add a couple of points to her first-run score and solidify her grasp on second place, but that won’t challenge Chloe Kim. And it’s 89.75. So that will indeed be difficult to top for silver. REMINDER: We’re in the second of three runs. Only the top run for each rider counts. Three riders left in this run, including our top two -- Chloe Kim and Liu Jiayu. But first, it’s Haruna Matsumoto Good 900, frontside 1080 (first-ever for her, announcer says). And she holds it well! She continues with the run ... then slips after a 720! If she had stayed upright, that surely would’ve troubled Kelly Clark on the podium bubble. But it’s a 46.25, lower than her first-run 70.00. So our top two will remain the top two after the second run. Can Liu challenge Kim? Maddie Mastro (USA) is currently in last place. She goes for the 1080 right away and has the big air for it, but the landing is a little heavy. She doesn’t have much interest in going for a score in the 40s or 50s, so she just coasts down and gets a 7.50. Queralt Castellet (Spain) has beaten Chloe Kim this year, our announcers remind us. She gets a couple of nice jumps in and lands a 1080 ... well, sort of. It’s underrotated, and she loses the momentum she would need to do anything else of note. Her score is 67.75, a bit higher than her first run but only good for sixth right now. Cai Xuetong (China) is up for her second run. She does a 720 that looks so effortless is hard to imagine she actually did both spins. But as with Tomita, it goes wrong near the end (attempting a 900), and she hits her arms on the pipe floor. That’s a 41.25, an improvement over her first run. Sena Tomita (Japan) had a decent 65.25 on the first run. Lands a good 900 with a “melon grab.” Wasn’t that in Back to School? It’s going really well, until it suddenly doesn’t, and she slides onto her back. Ignore this score. But keep an eye on her in the third. She’s not out of this. The Slovenian judge gave Arthur a 4. Harsh. Apologies to Australia. Kelly Arthur just did a bit of a face plant. Not hurt, but her score -- all academic here -- is 9.25. I’m sure everyone wants to know what Leslie Jones of Saturday Night Live is thinking. She’s pumped. And apparently indoors? Rodriguez (France) also botches the landing on a 900 on her way to a 14.75. Her first-run score of 50.50 leaves her in ninth. Thovex (France) drops in again. She starts with a frontside 900, but her landing is shaky, and she isn’t able to get out of the pipe on the other side. She immediately realizes she can’t challenge for the podium after that wobble, so she takes it easy the rest of the way down. Score is 30.25, so her first-run score of 59.50 is still the one that counts. Speaking of Kelly Clark ... she has one good run in the bank already. Huge air to start her second run. Then a 540, then a 1080 then a cab 720, then a crippler. Who says this sport is just for teens and 20-somethings? That may top her 76.25 from the first run. Enough to catch Liu at 85.50 for second? Not quite. 81.75. The bar to reach the podium has been well and truly raised. RUN 2 STARTS with Arielle Gold. She lands a 1080! Loses a little bit of momentum (figure skating judges would call it an underrotation), but she manages to recover for a 900 a little later in the run. Forget that first run. Gold just landed a possible medal contender. Score is ... 74.75. JUST short of Kelly Clark’s 76.25. Up to fourth place. Now they’ll start trying to do better than this ... Kim (USA) 93.75 Liu (China) 85.50 Clark (USA) 76.25 Matusmoto (Japan) 70.00 Tomita (Japan) 65.25 Castellet (Spain) 59.75 And six scores that won’t really matter. We know the bar now. A medal will require a 76.25. A gold will require a 93.75. CHLOE KIM wraps a scarf around her face, adjusts her gloves, eyes the pipe, and here she goes ... Big air. Frontside 1080. Cab 720. Front 900 with tail grab. McTwist. Corked out 720 (taking the announcer’s word for it ... she went upside-down. Surely that’s good for first place. Liu Jiayu (China) is getting better amplitude than most. A couple of 720s, switching side to side. Probably our new leader, definitely top three. Score: 85.50! Well out in front -- possibly a medal-winning run already. Guess who’s next? REMINDER: This is the first of three runs. Each rider will count only her top score. So there’s no reason to fret about whether a run is a 50 or a 10. They won’t be averaged. Haruna Matsumoto (Japan) unleashes a nice solid run. Good grabs, solid turns. It’s good for 70.00, up into second place. Maddie Mastro is sort of the overlooked American here. She’s only 17 but was on the podium at the X Games and in several recent World Cups. She lands a 1080 ... almost. She can’t quite keep her momentum. She gamely finishes the rest of the run. Won’t be in the top three, but that 1080 attempt was a nice signal of her ambitions. Score is 14.00. Two Americans in the bottom two places so far with three riders remaining in the first run. Queralt Castellet (Spain) is in her fourth Olympics. Can she land a 1080? She starts with a couple of high jumps, lands a 900 and then seems to go conservative the rest of the way. Second place? Nope -- third, at 59.75. Cai Xuetong (China) has two world championships (2015, 2017) to her name, but this run doesn’t look quite right from the start, and she botches a landing two-thirds of the way down, losing all her momentum. A mere 20.50 for that one. Sena Tomita (Japan) is just 18. She finished seventh in the recent X Games and comes out strong with a 900. Seemed to spin more than the last couple of riders but without as much variety. But she moves into second with a 65.25. It’s Emily Arthur time. She carried the flag for Australia in the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics and won a silver medal there. Looks like she missed one grab but had a good variety of spins. Her score: 48.25. Clean, but just not quite as much in that run as the others. Sophie Rodriguez is our second straight French rider. She’s in her fourth Olympics, with a career-best fifth in 2010. She’s throwing around a lot of 720s with a nice variety of grabs. She gets a 50.50, ranking third so far. France’s Mirabelle Thovex ... starts with a backside 720. She’s not getting much height on her last few jumps. It’s a 59.50. Kelly Clark already has three Olympic medals. Here she goes again ... Height looks good on her first two tricks, with a frontside 1080. She switches stances, lands a crippler (ouch) and has a clean run. It’s a respectable 76.25. (For the record, Gold got a 10.50 score. Safe to say that won’t medal.) Arielle Gold is up. And here she goes ... And she skids on the pipe on her first landing. An inauspicious start. Good thing they get three runs. It’s gonna be a bright (bright) briiight sunshiney day. Flags are blowing gently in the breeze. The pipe is 260 meters long and 21 meters wide, with seven-meter walls. Four minutes to go. Or something like that. The international feed just kicked in, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re about to start. It’s currently 11:43 a.m. in Sydney, which means competition will be starting at noon. Emily Arthur rides fifth in the first run. How’s the weather? Important question. Yesterday, the Alpine skiing was postponed, but the snowboarding slopestyle competition went ahead. Jamie Anderson won, but many athletes were not happy about incurring the risk of being blown around in the air. Today, it appears we will have Alpine skiing. So it’s probably safe to say the halfpipe competition will go on as scheduled. It’s a rather slow start to the day in South Korea. The mixed doubles curling bronze-medal game is underway. You wouldn’t have guessed from the club-curling misses in their opener against the USA, but the Olympic Athletes from Russia are in this game and lead 3-0 against Norway. The men’s Alpine combined begins at 9:30 p.m. ET, weather permitting. Until then, it’s halfpipe and curling. You’ll need to stay up late or get up early to see a lot today. From the judging handbook, a typo and an admonition ... The order of competition for the first run is the inverse order in which they qualified. To be more specific: 1. Gold (USA) 2. Clark (USA) 3. Thovex (France) 4. Rodriguez (France) 5. Arthur (Australia) 6. Tomita (Japan) 7. Cai (China) 8. Castellet (Spain) 9. Mastro (USA) 10. Matsumoto (Japan) 11. Liu (China) 12. Kim (USA) Beau will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s Amanda Doyle’s profile of Chloe Kim: The snowboarder Chloe Kim is making her Olympic debut in Pyeongchang, and, despite being just 17 years old, it is long overdue. The halfpipe phenom mathematically qualified for the Sochi Games four years ago but wasn’t old enough to compete, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise, according to Kim. “I’m actually kind of thankful that I wasn’t able to go, just knowing what I’m going through now, going into my first Olympics” she told the Guardian last month. “It’s pretty hectic, and I don’t know if my 13-year-old self would have been able to handle it.” Now the Los Angeles-area native, who enters these Games as the gold medal favorite, is more than prepared for this moment. Despite not making it to Sochi, Kim still had a breakout season in 2014, when she became the youngest Winter X Games medalist ever. A year later, she topped the podium, winning her first of four X Games titles.

Through the treetops, she could see the rising moon and a flitting bat, sights that were soundtracked by birdsong (thrushes, blackbirds, rasping rooks) and her own small contribution: an inexpert whistle. Her friend Stephen had told her to keep at this whistling. It would, he’d promised, yield results in the end – and he was right. A moment later, a “swooping shadow” appeared, “suspended on a loop of air as if there was a cushion between his wings and the ground”. This was the tawny owl he had been training, here to pick up its dinner of chopped day-old chicks. Darlington’s much-loved first book, published in 2012, was about otters, animals she crossed Britain to track, meeting along the way all manner of conservationists, ecologists and poets. Owl Sense is on similar territory: there are 13 species of native owl in Europe, and in her book she sets out to try to see them all in the wild, with varying results. The tawny owl, as we’ve seen, is fairly easily ticked off; so too are the barn owl and the little owl (and what gorgeous goblins they are, at just a few inches high). But others prove more elusive. The eagle owl requires a trip to Finland, and the long-eared owl to Serbia; still on her list even now are the snowy owl, the hawk owl, and the great grey owl. How long has Darlington been obsessed with owls? She doesn’t quite say, and perhaps this is one reason why at times – usually when there’s no sharp beak in sight – her narrative feels rather effortful. Delightful though her enthusiasm is, it seems worked up somehow: in the service of needing to complete a book rather than the flame that fired the project in the first place. Of course she writes about the owls superbly well, and her book comes complete with some fine set pieces. The scene in which she invites a taxidermist round to deal with a dead tawny she has been keeping in her freezer – before you panic, she found it while out walking – is wonderful (“the colour remains imprinted on my retina: indecent, purplish-red, rich as heartwood”). She has also done her research. Owl Sense bulges with alarming facts and figures – thanks largely to changes in habitats, there are now fewer than 5,000 pairs of barn owls in the UK – and with some pretty good and weird owl stories, too. Florence Nightingale, for instance, kept a little owl called Athena as a pet, until she was called to Crimea, at which point the abandoned bird was left to starve in her attic back at home. (“Poor little beastie,” she remarked, when she heard. “It was odd how much I loved you.”) In Liverpool, there are reputed to be drug dealers who – can this really be true? – use eagle owls for protection rather than dogs. But to get to these jewels you must struggle through an awful lot of padding. While Darlington was working on Owl Sense, her son Benji fell terrifyingly ill, and perhaps because of this she often loses focus, returning to a subject she has only just put to bed, repeating something she has already said. And she tells us everything, whether pertinent or not: her latest dream, her feelings about Brexit, her conversation with the man sitting next to her on the plane to Belgrade. Do we need to know that she asks Anita, who delivers into her temporary care a burrowing owl called Murray, whether she eats chicken casserole, let alone what Anita says by way of reply? (Answer: no, we don’t.) Her book would have been stronger and more supple without these digressions. After all, as she notes herself, for human beings much of the owl’s power and mystery lies not so much in the shrewd disc of its face, nor even in its slow-blinking stare, but in its noiseless wings, the silent way it hunts, moving ghost-like across its territory under cover of the night. In the 21st century, thanks in large part to JK Rowling, these birds have been made stupidly cute. I read with alarm of the owl clubs that have sprung up everywhere, or that some people now insist on keeping them as pets. But our ancestors saw them as hooting portents of doom, the “fatal bellman” of Lady Macbeth’s description; however much we long to protect them, perhaps the shivers are not to be shaken off quite yet. Sometimes, I just wanted Darlington to quieten down a little, the better to make more room for this majesty, and her awe. • Owl Sense by Miriam Darlington is published by Guardian Books (£15.99).

But is it actually any good? And why exactly does it cost four times as much as an Echo? The HomePod is a voice-controlled speaker that listens out for its wake word “Hey, Siri” and then starts streaming what you say to Apple to interpret your commands and play whatever it is you wish. The fabric-covered cylinder stands an iPhone X-and-a-bit tall (172mm) with a diameter of an iPhone X (142mm), weighing 2.5kg (14.4 times the iPhone X). It’s quite a lot bigger than Amazon’s Echo or Google’s Home, and bigger still than the Sonos One, but it’s also the least assuming. Available in black or white, it has a small gloss touch-sensitive disc on top with light-up plus and minus buttons and a hidden centre display that flashes colour when Siri is listening for you. The rest of the visible surface is wrapped in mesh fabric, with a hidden rubber foot on the bottom. It looks at home on a book shelf, the top of an AV unit or on the kitchen table, but also doesn’t stand out, until you start playing music. Hey, Siri The HomePod may technically be a smart speaker, but really it’s all about the music and less about the utility of a voice assistant. That’s partly because Apple’s Siri is some way behind Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant, both in form and function. Siri is the only smart assistant that offers a choice of male or female voices, which is a nice change, but is an odd mix of well prepared set pieces of personality intermixed with clumsy text-to-speech smashes the illusion of being anything other than a dumb robot. But you don’t have to take my word for it – Siri is the same on the HomePod as it is on an iPhone. On the HomePod Siri can set one timer, but not multiple or named timers like Alexa and the rest can; it can control some smart home devices as long as they’re hooked up to Apple’s HomeKit system; it can answer some relatively limited questions and do the usual unit conversions and calculations. You can also set it up so that Siri can send text messages, create notes and reminders, using the iPhone and account of the person who set up the HomePod when it is on the same wifi network. But that means anyone with access to the speaker could send messages pretending to be its owner – there is no multi-user support at all. Siri is also meant to be able to send messages through WhatsApp and a handful of others, but I couldn’t get it to work – Siri kept saying “WhatsApp couldn’t find” my contact, despite me holding a text conversation using WhatsApp on my phone just fine. Finally, the HomePod can also acts as a giant speakerphone for calls made by an iPhone, which works surprisingly well, but the speaker made a very loud buzzing noise for five seconds at the end of a call and I couldn’t figure out why. Siri can hear you on the HomePod as well as Alexa on an Echo, even over music and noise such as a cooker hood going full blast. Sometimes it heard me even when I thought it didn’t, because the screen on top is difficult to see from distance, prompting Siri to follow up with an “uh huh?” when I remained silent. I often found that Siri was too loud, though, booming out of the HomePod when quietly listening to music. Its volume is linked to that of the music, but at 20% volume or less Siri was too loud and there was no way to make it quieter. Playing Christina Milian instead of Arctic Monkeys Siri’s natural language interpretation still lags behind the competition too, particularly Google’s Assistant. Generally Siri is right about 70% of the time, with some amusing accidents when requesting music, such as asking for AM by Arctic Monkeys and getting AM to PM by Christina Milian or, more bafflingly, getting Eye of the Tiger when asking for “Fauna – Original Mix”. I asked for “Glaciers by Blue Sky Black Death” and got Glass by Incubus, while it took three goes to get Siri to play Euphoric Tape II by the same band, forcing me to listen to snippets of random songs in the process. Once it finally managed to play Euphoric Tape II, it then refused to play either Euphoric Tape I or Euphoric Tape III, always defaulting to the second of the group’s three albums. Siri normally got there in the end after multiple attempts, but it was certainly frustrating. You can control the HomePod with the Music app on an iOS device, which I resorted to for all but generic requests for genre, playlists or artists, but confusingly there are two ways to send music to the HomePod in the same app. The HomePod doesn’t support Bluetooth streaming and doesn’t have an analogue line-in, but does support Apple’s AirPlay. You can send audio from apps, including Spotify, that implement AirPlay but you lose any advanced audio control through Siri, limited to volume, pause and skip. Your iPhone or iPad needs to remain on and connected to the same wifi network too, as it is the conduit through which the audio flows. With the Music app, however, you can also instruct the HomePod to go directly to iTunes or Apple Music to play tracks, which works more like Spotify Connect – your phone doesn’t have to be on all the time for it to continue playing. The trouble is the way you do that isn’t immediately obvious. You have to open the now playing dialogue, tap on the AirPlay button and then wait for the HomePod to show up as a separate bubble below the now playing bubble, which also lists the HomePod as an output but via AirPlay. The biggest drawback of the HomePod is how locked down it is to Apple’s devices and services. You have to have an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 11.2.5 to set it up. It will only play music natively from Apple Music, iTunes purchases or iTunes Match, meaning no radio other than Beats One, and it can only be controlled from an iOS 11.2.5 device. You can AirPlay audio to it from an Apple TV, a Mac or iTunes on a Windows PC, or from apps on an iOS device, including from Spotify or similar, but that’s no good to anyone with an Android device – an issue for any household that isn’t homogeneously Apple. Expansive, beautiful sound While Siri may not be the quite up to scratch compared to its rivals, and getting non-Apple Music to it is more difficult, one thing Apple has nailed is the HomePod’s sound. The HomePod sounds genuinely fantastic for anything from hip-hop and EDM to rock and classical. There’s no adjusting the music to your taste – it’s Apple’s way or the high way – but the sound is deep without being overburdened with muddy bass, light without being shrill and with great separation, meaning you can pick out individual voices, instruments or notes easily. Nothing gets lost, while everything remains rich, full of energy and ambience. It even sounds brilliantly full range at volumes as low as 5%, which is something most competitors fail to do. Apple says its combination of seven tweeters and a woofer, all controlled by its A8 processor, continually adapt to the position of the speaker in the room and the music it is playing. The result is a surprisingly wide and enveloping soundscape from a mono speaker that puts the competition to shame. It sounds just as good against a wall as it does in the middle of the kitchen table. But it’s worth noting that because the sound is less direct, it carries further in directions you might not want it to, which might annoy the neighbours. Observations The volume buttons on the top change the level by 5%, but voice requests for volume changes alter the level in 10% increments – you can specify a certain percentage, with decimals rounded up, so “volume level 12.5%” became 13% HomePod works just fine with iTunes Match, including music you have uploaded that isn’t in the Apple Music library, meaning you don’t need an Apple Music subscription if all you want to listen to is your own music library Setup is simple – place the unlocked iOS device with Bluetooth and wifi on near the HomePod, wait for the setup dialogue box to pop up and after a couple of taps it’s ready to go (although it failed at the wifi setup the first time I tried) Siri was pretty loud out of the box, so make sure you don’t set it up at night or be ready with a finger on the volume down button Apple’s promising an update for AirPlay 2 and stereo pairing of two HomePods together for later in the year through a software update You can mute the always-listening mics, but there’s no visible indicator that Siri is no longer listening Price The Apple HomePod comes in two colours, white or space grey (black) for £319. For comparison, the second-generation Amazon Echo costs £90, the Echo Plus costs £140, the Google Home costs £129 and the Alexa-integrated Sonos One costs £199. Verdict As a simple wireless speaker the HomePod sounds truly brilliant, knocking the socks off most of the competition, including systems costing more. But because it is locked down to Apple-only devices and services it might not be as easy to fit into your existing setup as competitors such as Sonos. Missing true Spotify support will be a deal killer for many, as will the inability to play radio stations and the lack of multi-user support. As a smart speaker, the HomePod is let down by Siri, which simply isn’t up to the standards set by rivals, but the fundamentals are there. The microphones work, so Siri can hear you, and responses are fast, just limited, meaning it could be fixed. Whether Apple is able to catch up to the capability and quality of Alexa and Google Assistant, remains to be seen. It certainly hasn’t managed to on the iPhone for the last couple of years. So as it is now, the HomePod is an Apple-lover’s dream speaker; if you treat it more as a voice-controlled wireless music blaster than a Amazon Echo or Google Home competitor then you’ll love it. But if you want the ability to play Spotify natively, to control more than just the limited number of HomeKit devices, or to simply deliver that advanced voice assistant experience, the HomePod isn’t there yet. Pros: brilliant sound, can hear you very well, full production at low volumes, choice of male or female voice Cons: Siri not up to scratch, no Bluetooth or analogue audio in, no native Spotify or radio, no Android or Windows support Other reviews Amazon Echo second-generation review: smaller, cheaper and better Google Home review: the smart speaker that answers almost any question Sonos Play:5 review: one of the best wireless speakers money can buy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/12/mikheil-saakashvili-georgia-former-president-seized-by-armed-men-in-kiev","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T18:13:10Z","webTitle":"Georgia's former president deported from Ukraine to Poland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/12/mikheil-saakashvili-georgia-former-president-seized-by-armed-men-in-kiev","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/12/mikheil-saakashvili-georgia-former-president-seized-by-armed-men-in-kiev","fields":{"headline":"Georgia's former president deported from Ukraine to Poland","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Georgia’s former president Mikheil Saakashvili has been deported from Ukraine to Poland after he was seized by armed border service officers in Kiev. Poland’s border service confirmed that Saakashvili, who has emerged as a bitter critic of Ukraine’s government, had arrived and that Warsaw had agreed to let him enter. “This person was on Ukrainian territory illegally and therefore, in compliance with all legal procedures, he was returned to the country from where he arrived,” the Ukrainian border service spokesman Oleh Slobodyan said in a post on Facebook. The development marks another twist in Saakashvili’s ongoing political confrontation with Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko. “[Poroshenko] is neither a president nor a man,” Saakashvili told supporters by telephone from Warsaw. “He is a wheeler-dealer who wants to ruin Ukraine. This shows how weak they are. We will triumph for sure.” Video footage posted to Saakashvili’s Facebook page appeared to show the politician being dragged from a restaurant in central Kiev by a group of men in green uniforms on Monday. “He was kidnapped by men in camouflage gear in a restaurant near our party offices. They pushed him into a white van and drove off,” said Tatiana Bahranovska, Saakashvili’s press secretary. “They didn’t show any identification.” Saakashvili, an enthusiastic supporter of Ukraine’s 2013-2014 Maidan revolution, was appointed governor of Ukraine’s Odessa region in 2015 by Poroshenko, an acquaintance from his student days in Soviet-era Kiev. But he resigned his post in November 2016 in protest at what he said was ingrained high-level corruption and launched a campaign to oust his former ally. Poroshenko responded by stripping Saakashvili of his Ukrainian citizenship while the Georgian-born politician was in the United States. He had previously been deprived of his Georgian citizenship. Saakashvili’s deportation on Monday came a week after a court in Kiev rejected his appeal against extradition to Georgia, where he faces three years behind bars on charges of illegally pardoning police officers accused of murder. Saakashvili, who ruled Georgia for nine years until 2013, denies the charges, which he says are politically motivated. He has also been charged by Kiev with involvement in a Russian-led plot to destabilise Ukraine, an accusation he describes as “lies”. There were angry scenes at Kiev’s Borispyol international airport after Saakashvili’s deportation as the opposition politician’s supporters confronted border service officers. “Poroshenko will answer for this!” shouted supporters, according to an online stream of the protest. Saakashvili told the Guardian during an interview in Kiev earlier this month that Ukraine had “begged” Warsaw to take him. He also alleged that his Georgian bodyguards, friends and supporters had been kidnapped by Ukrainian security services, tortured and deported to Georgia in recent months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/18/police-spy-christine-greening-long-term-relationship-activist-tom-frampton-after-quitting-covert-role","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-18T15:18:09Z","webTitle":"Met police spy has long-term relationship with activist after quitting covert role","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/18/police-spy-christine-greening-long-term-relationship-activist-tom-frampton-after-quitting-covert-role","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/18/police-spy-christine-greening-long-term-relationship-activist-tom-frampton-after-quitting-covert-role","fields":{"headline":"Met police spy has long-term relationship with activist after quitting covert role","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A police spy quit her undercover deployment and has had a romantic relationship, lasting more than a decade, with one of the prominent political activists she had been sent to monitor. The spy, who used the fake identity of Christine Green, met the activist while she spent five years undercover infiltrating the animal rights movement. Since the end of her covert deployment, more than 15 years ago, she has been living with the activist Tom Frampton in remote cottages in Cornwall and Scotland. Frampton had been a leading anti-foxhunting campaigner and had a criminal record over his conduct at protests. He was jailed for three months in 1993 for headbutting a foxhunter, according to court reports. It is unclear at what point Green disclosed to her boyfriend that she had been sent to spy on animal rights activists. Recently the couple lived in a secluded cottage in a forest in Scotland. Frampton made no comment when the Guardian visited last year. A public inquiry led by a judge, Sir John Mitting, is examining how undercover officers tasked with infiltrating political groups frequently started long-term relationships with activists. Green is unusual because she is the first female undercover officer who has been revealed as having begun a long-term intimate relationship with a campaigner. The inquiry was set up following a series of disclosures about the activities of undercover officers, including the collection of information about grieving families and concealment of evidence in trials. Green was unmasked following investigations by the Guardian and campaigners. Donal O’Driscoll, of the Undercover Research Group, a network of activists who have investigated Green, said campaigners sought an honest explanation from the couple about what had happened. Green started her undercover deployment in 1995 after she joined the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), a secret Metropolitan police unit. Undercover SDS officers adopted fake identities and infiltrated hundreds of political groups during the unit’s 40-year existence, usually spending several years pretending to be dedicated political activists. Green concealed her covert role from the activists she was sent to infiltrate. According to campaigners, she said she worked for a courier company. She had a van and often used to drive campaigners to meetings and demonstrations. Paul Gravett, an animal rights campaigner, said: “She had quite a serious and aloof personality although she could be friendly to people she wanted to know.” Robin Lane, another campaigner, said he went to her flat in Streatham, south London, because she was helping to post newsletters to protesters. Activists say Green joined groups campaigning for animal rights and helped manage the finances of one of the groups, London Animal Action. She was also involved in protests that sought to disrupt foxhunting across south-east England. The hunters and protesters, known as saboteurs, or sabs, were often involved in unruly confrontations. One activist who did not wish to be identified said he regularly went hunt sabbing with Green. “She was very active on a regular basis, at least weekly for several years. She was definitely considered one of us. I thought of her as someone committed to our aims.” She could be fiery in confrontations with the foxhunters, he said. During Green’s deployment, she became close friends with Frampton, a well-known hunt sab, then in his 30s, who had been an active protester since the early 1980s. The court heard that Frampton broke a hunter’s nose during the confrontation that led to his imprisonment in 1993. He claimed that he had acted in self-defence. According to press reports, he told the court he had lodged an appeal against his conviction, but the outcome is not known. Green appears to have disappeared from the animal rights movement around 2000. According to Gravett, she said she was going to Australia for a friend’s funeral and then going travelling. In reality, her covert mission was coming to an end – a typical SDS undercover deployment lasted about five years – and soon afterwards she left the police and began living with Frampton in Cornwall. The couple have remained friendly with animal rights activists, who, although there had been suspicions, were unaware of Green’s covert past. An activist said he visited the pair socially at their Cornish cottage in the mid-2000s and did not know she had been in the police. Another activist said that rumours of her undercover role came up about five years ago in a conversation with Frampton, who told him he did not wish to discuss them. Frampton said at that time that he and Green were living happily as a couple, he added. Frampton was still involved in animal rights protests in the early 2000s. He travelled to the Outer Hebrides with other activists in 2003 and was convicted of breaching the peace during a demonstration to save threatened hedgehogs. Now in his 50s, he is also understood to have worked as an undercover investigator for the animal rights campaign Animal Aid. It covertly installed secret cameras in abattoirs in 2010 to record footage that it said showed pigs being kicked, stamped on and inappropriately stunned. Lawyers for the abattoirs alleged Frampton had installed the cameras and that he had trespassed in doing so, but Animal Aid declined to identify the investigator. Frampton and Green later left Cornwall and lived in Scotland until last year. Their current whereabouts are unknown. O’Driscoll, of the Undercover Research Group, said: “Speaking to people who knew them, there is a sense of sadness rather than anger. These two were good friends to campaigners who, I think more than anything, just want honesty and answers, an explanation of why this happened.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/13/worlds-lost-forests-returning-trees","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-13T06:00:54Z","webTitle":"A eureka moment for the planet: we’re finally planting trees again | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/13/worlds-lost-forests-returning-trees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/13/worlds-lost-forests-returning-trees","fields":{"headline":"A eureka moment for the planet: we’re finally planting trees again","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"China plans to plant forests the size of Ireland. Latin American countries have pledged to restore 20m hectares of degraded forest and African countries more than 100m hectares. India is to plant 13m hectares, and on a single day last year 1.5 million people planted 66m trees in Madhya Pradesh alone. Much of Europe is physically greener than it was just a few years ago. England is to plant 50m trees in a new coast-to-coast forest and newly planted saplings now cover tens of thousands of hectares of former farmland in Ireland, Norway and France. From Costa Rica to Nepal and Peru to Mongolia, tree planting has become a political, economic and ecological cause, and a universal symbol of restoration, regrowth and faith in the future. More than 120 countries promised in 2015 to plant and restore large areas of forest as a response to the climate crisis, and the UN has set a target to restore 350m hectares by 2030 – an area bigger than India. This enthusiasm for a greener world, expressed in trees, is inspiring and overdue. For 200 years forested countries barely knew what to do with their trees. They were treated as expendable and a waste of space. But in a great cultural shift, they have changed from being dark and fearsome places to semi-sacred and untouchable. And why not? In this new ecological age, we have learned that trees have far more value than providing timber: they keep soils moist, prevent floods and provide shelter, store carbon, beautify landscapes, protect water sources, increase biodiversity, improve conservation and induce human wellbeing. So woe betide councils such as Sheffield that want to cut down trees. From the Newbury bypass protests 20 years ago to today’s battles to save the ancient woodlands along the route of the HS2 rail link, there are few surer ways of angering people than cutting down their trees. We are seeing a great global attempt to plant and restore forest land but paradoxically we are still losing tree cover. The rate of global deforestation has slowed by more than half in 25 years but tree loss jumped 50% in 2016, and 2017 is likely to have been worse. The greatest threat to trees used to be loggers and the expansion of farming. These are still a threat, but human-caused deforestation and degradation make forests more fire-prone, and disease, droughts linked to climate change and harmful beetles are likely to kill trees in greater numbers. In two years, many millions of hectares of forest have burned across North America, South America, Australia and Europe. Some of the wild fires were deliberately set, but the spike reflects the warming of the land and is just one of the many consequences of climate change. Equally, tree diseases are now rampant and forests are succumbing to drought, disease and insects – much of it driven by climate change. We must keep planting trees but think differently. Mass, state-sponsored tree-planting has a reputation for being expensive and badly managed. When forests are planted on an industrial scale, up to 20% of the trees may die within a few years. It costs around £720 a hectare to plant a forest, so it would cost around £250bn to plant the 350m hectares that countries have signed up to. That money is just not available to developing countries. But there is a solution. Increasingly a system known as agro-forestry is proving itself. Here, trees and shrubs are being grown around or among crops, often on degraded forest land. There are around 2bn hectares of this land around the world and restoring it with agro-forestry can not only put food on tables, but create hundreds of thousands of jobs and address climate change. There have been remarkable successes. Just 30 years ago Niger was an impoverished, drought-prone country. It had been persuaded by development experts from rich countries to intensify its farming by clearing large areas of land and planting huge fields of wheat and maize. It largely failed and the soil blew away. The story, recounted by the author Fred Pearce, goes that, to save time, young men returning from working abroad in the 1980s planted their crops without first clearing the land. To their surprise, their grain yields were much better than in neighbouring fields that had been cleared of all woody plants. When the same thing happened the next year, the villages got the message: trees were good for their crops. Since then, something like 200m trees in Niger have been planted or encouraged to naturally regenerate on 5m hectares. Food production has increased by 600,000 tonnes a year in the places where the trees have returned. The government’s part in this success story has been minimal. Agro-forestry spreads spontaneously as farmers and landowners see the benefit of combining crops with trees. The trees provide fodder for livestock, fuel, medicines, fruits and cooking oil and regenerating the land has cost perhaps $20 a hectare. The Niger government helped mainly by changing the law to allow farmers who plant trees to profit more. Pakistan, too, has shown spectacularly how to combat climate change and reduce instances of flooding and natural disasters. Thousands of nurseries have been set up in the past three years in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, communities have distributed for free more than 150m trees from the nurseries, existing forests have been densely planted and expanded, and large areas of degraded land have been allowed to regenerate naturally. The result will not be seen for many years, but more than one billion trees have been planted, and 350,000 hectares of forest and farmland regenerated for not much more than £100m – roughly what it would cost to build two miles of dual carriageway road in Britain. Similarly, in Malawi, Mali, Ethiopia and elsewhere, farmers are now planting, protecting and managing many more trees on their farms. The Seno plains of Mali are unrecognisable from 30 years ago and in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, nearly 1m hectares of unused land have been regreened and transformed. Crop yields are increasing, and fewer young people are leaving their villages. And in India, the Araku project has seen local communities plant millions of fruit trees and coffee bushes. Nearly 15,000 acres have been revitalised. Agro-forestry is changing farming and addressing climate change in many countries as surely as the “green revolution” swept through the world promising higher yields with chemicals in the 1960s and 70s. It depends for its success on changes in attitudes, shifts in behaviour and improved management practices. It requires communities to work together, local knowledge and governments to reform land laws and help to educate. But it does not need large amounts of money. Great areas of Indonesian, Congolese and Latin American forests are still being lost to the loggers and the palm oil companies, but we are seeing a heartening response to the linked climate and food crises. It is too early to think that we are ecologically more literate, but there is a real sense that governments are beginning to understand that change best comes from the grassroots and is both needed and possible. • John Vidal is the Guardian’s former environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/12/facebook-personal-data-privacy-settings-ruled-illegal-german-court","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T15:28:49Z","webTitle":"Facebook personal data use and privacy settings ruled illegal by German court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/12/facebook-personal-data-privacy-settings-ruled-illegal-german-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/12/facebook-personal-data-privacy-settings-ruled-illegal-german-court","fields":{"headline":"Facebook personal data use and privacy settings ruled illegal by German court","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Facebook’s default privacy settings and use of personal data are against German consumer law, according to a judgement handed down by a Berlin regional court. The court found that Facebook collects and uses personal data without providing enough information to its members for them to render meaningful consent. The federation of German consumer organisations (VZBV), which brought the suit, argued that Facebook opted users in to features which it should not have. Heiko Duenkel, litigation policy officer at the VZBV, said: “Facebook hides default settings that are not privacy friendly in its privacy centre and does not provide sufficient information about it when users register. This does not meet the requirement for informed consent.” In a statement, VZBV elaborated on some of its issues: “In the Facebook app for smartphones, for example, a location service was pre-activated that reveals a user’s location to people they are chatting to. “In the privacy settings, ticks were already placed in boxes that allowed search engines to link to the user’s timeline. This meant that anyone could quickly and easily find personal Facebook profiles.” The Berlin court agreed with VZBV that the five default settings the group had complained about were invalid as declarations of consent. The German language judgment was handed down in mid-January, but only publicly revealed on Monday. The court also ruled eight clauses in Facebook’s terms of service to be invalid, including terms that allow Facebook to transmit data to the US and use personal data for commercial purposes. The company’s “authentic name” policy – a revision of a rule that once required users to use their “real names” on the site, but which now allows them to use any names they are widely known by – was also ruled unlawful. In a statement, Facebook said it would appeal, adding: “We are working hard to ensure that our guidelines are clear and easy to understand, and that the services offered by Facebook are in full accordance with the law.” A week after the Berlin court ruled against Facebook, the social network promised to radically overhaul its privacy settings, saying the work would prepare it for the introduction in Europe of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a sweeping set of laws governing data use across the EU. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, announced the changes, saying they would “put the core privacy settings for Facebook in one place and make it much easier for people to manage their data”. Facebook has faced repeated attacks from European regulators, particularly those in Germany, over issues ranging from perceived anti-competitive practices to alleged misuse of customer data. Since March 2016, the company has been investigated by the German Federal Cartel Office over allegations it breaches data protection law in order to support an unfair monopoly. In an interim update in December last year, the office said that it objected to the way Facebook gains access to third-party data when an account is opened. This includes transferring information from its own WhatsApp and Instagram products – as well as how it tracks which sites its users access. In October, Facebook was the target of an EU-wide investigation over a similar issue. The Article 29 Working Party (WP29), which oversees data regulation issues across the European Union, launched a taskforce to examine the sharing of user data between WhatsApp and Facebook, which it says does not have sufficient user consent. When the data sharing feature was first announced in 2016, the group warned Facebook that it may not be legal under European law, prompting the company to pause the data transfer until a resolution was found. “Whilst the WP29 notes there is a balance to be struck between presenting the user with too much information and not enough, the initial screen made no mention at all of the key information users needed to make an informed choice, namely that clicking the agree button would result in their personal data being shared with the Facebook family of companies,” the group told WhatsApp in October.

The research has shown major discrepancies remain in the ways many universities record incidents, which range from verbal harassment to rape, more than a year after a Universities UK (UUK) taskforce made recommendations for improvement. On Wednesday, UUK published a report saying there had been “significant but variable” progress across the sector in dealing with student-on-student misconduct in the past 18 months, resulting in an increased number of disclosures from those affected. Though this was considered a mark of success, some universities who took part in the small sample survey expressed concern about their ability to deal with the high volume of disclosures. The report also found that a fifth of institutions included in the survey had made very limited progress, and overall there was far less evidence of new measures to address staff-to-student misconduct. It also called for a greater focus on hate crime and hate-based harassment. Freedom of information (FoI) requests sent to 132 universities found there were at least 1,953 reports of sexual misconduct committed by students and staff at UK universities in the past seven years. There were another 213 incidents over this period where the alleged perpetrator’s identity was not recorded, which universities noted might include further allegations against students and staff. Many universities only disclosed formal complaints, with 14 acknowledging that individual academic departments could hold additional allegations and informal complaints. Another 10 universities said they did not have figures for all of the years requested. Several only disclosed complaints against staff because cases against students were not centrally collated, and others only disclosed complaints against students. Dame Janet Beer, the UUK president and vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool, said the results of the report were encouraging but that more needed to be done. The Labour MP Lucy Powell, a member of the Commons education select committee, said the Guardian’s findings showed universities’ reporting of sexual misconduct was “woefully inconsistent”. She said: “Given all the exposure and the UUK taskforce, you would have thought it would have been a higher priority to get an exact picture of what’s happening across campuses. “It’s very disappointing that very little progress seems to have been made. Clearly the requirements on universities need strengthening. The government does need to provide clear signals on its expectations.” Maria Miller, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons women and equalities committee, said it was concerning that universities were still finding it difficult to provide accurate data on the scale of the problem. “If universities are not effectively tackling the problem of sexual harassment then the government needs to go back and consider how more transparency and better reporting could be enforced,” she said. The University of Cambridge recorded the most incidents between 2011-12 and 2017-18, with at least 215 reports of student and staff misconduct. This high number is due to the university introducing a new system last year allowing students and staff to disclose incidents anonymously, leading to 128 reports in nine months. In contrast, only three complaints were recorded between 2011-12 and 2015-16. Durham University recorded the second highest number of cases over seven years, with 88. It introduced a new sexual violence and misconduct policy in the current academic year, and has a full-time officer dedicated to tackling the issue who keeps a record of all reported incidents. Not all universities provided a breakdown of complaints against students and staff. But it is clear from those that did that the vast majority of allegations – at least 1,133 – were made against students, compared with 264 against staff. UUK published recommendations in October 2016 on tackling sexual misconduct, which included “an effective, centralised process for recording incidents”. Sarah Green, the co-director of the End Violence Against Women coalition, said: “It’s disappointing that the reporting is so inconsistent. The UUK taskforce made some strong recommendations but we are worried that momentum is being lost.” The FoI survey also found there were at least 732 investigations into sexual misconduct by students and staff. At least 54 staff were suspended, usually on a temporary basis during an investigation. Only 20 staff were banned from teaching, which was also usually a temporary measure. Less than half (62) of the universities surveyed offered training on sexual consent to students, and this was only mandatory at six institutions. Hareem Ghani, the women’s officer at the National Union of Students, said the number of reported incidents that were investigated was “woefully low”. She added: “The confusion in the figures reflects the continued murkiness in how institutions record incidents, and the clear failings in their response. Universities can no longer plead ignorance: sexual violence on campuses is still at crisis point and they must act now.” The universities minister, Sam Gyimah, said: “We encourage institutions to take a proactive response to tackle sexual harassment, including ensuring that students feel confident and able to report any issues.” A UUK spokeswoman said follow-up work from its taskforce showed that universities and student unions had developed a range of strategies, including centralised reporting systems. But she added: “There is clearly further work to do. University leaders should ensure that policies bring about real change. All students and staff are entitled to a safe and positive experience and all universities have a duty to provide that outcome.” Additional data reporting by Caelainn Barr"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/12/children-alcoholic-parents-services-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T15:14:13Z","webTitle":"The children of alcoholic parents need help.

Warm, funny and a 60s radical, he was the son of Irish immigrants who was inspired into a life of public service by John F Kennedy’s quote that you should “ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country”. He paid my Labour party subs when I joined at the age of 15. But he struggled with alcohol for much of his life and, nearly two years ago, that chronic dependency killed him. In a heartbreaking moment on a cold, grey dawn on St Joseph’s day – the patron saint of fathers – the nurses folded down his blankets so I could hold his hand as he slipped away. In the weeks that followed, I knew I had to start speaking out about the plight of children of alcoholics. All two million of them. For a long time I wrestled with the inner turmoil of speaking out. Was I breaking the commandment to honour my mother and father? What about the shame? The stigma? But my dad was also the child of an alcoholic. And there was nothing to help that little boy who became the man who was my dad. And so I spoke, and was knocked backwards by the avalanche of messages I got. This week is international Children of Alcoholics week, and our All-Party Group for Children of Alcoholics in parliament, which includes courageous MPs such as Caroline Flint and Jon Ashworth, has published some shocking insights. The research that we requested from the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology revealed that 37% of child deaths and serious injuries through neglect were linked to parental alcohol misuse. More than 60% of care applications in England involved misuse of alcohol and/or drugs, and nearly a fifth of children reported feeling embarrassed by seeing their parent drunk. Also, 15% said their bedtime routine had been disrupted as a result of their parents’ drinking. Children living with alcohol-dependent parents reported feeling socially isolated and, just as bad, they were reluctant to seek help due to feelings of stigma, shame and guilt about not wanting to betray parents. I found the strength to speak out by listening to Flint tell the harrowing story of life with her mum, Wendy. And since our campaign in parliament kicked off two years ago, some progress has been made. The government has admitted that action is needed. Money has been found to support helplines. Nearly 48% of councils now have a plan to help children of alcoholics – up from zero two years ago. Ashworth, whose story of his alcoholic father transfixed the Commons last year, has made campaigning for change a major Labour issue. But our research – a freedom of information request to every council in England – also found cause for alarm. Almost all local authorities have cut their budgets for alcohol and drug treatment services. And in more than half of councils, referrals to alcohol treatment services are falling. In other words, when parents reach out for help with their drinking, there is less help available. That is not good enough. Children of alcoholics are more likely to develop eating disorders, struggle with mental health and attempt suicide. They are also more likely to become alcoholics themselves. And so this terrible disease cascades down the generations. It’s time we broke the silence, the stigma and the shame, and ended the cycle of this vicious disease. For more than 20 years, brilliant charities such as the National Association for Children of Alcoholics have been campaigning for change, and I hope we’re on the cusp of a breakthrough. Last year, I called for children of alcoholics to help us write our first manifesto for change. Hundreds helped out. In a few weeks’ time, we will take our 10-point plan to the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as our agenda for action. I pray that he listens. Many children of alcoholics move on in life by blocking out the pain of the past. That’s what I did: I filtered out so many memories of childhood – the good along with the bad. Sifting through the shards now to make sense of them is painful. I wanted to create a picture of the past but it felt like piecing back together splinters of glass that kept cutting. For the first time, though, I feel change is coming. And for me, that’s how I honour the father I loved so much and lost. • Liam Byrne MP is shadow digital minister"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/12/the-fiver-chelsea-antonio-conte-west-brom","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T15:56:50Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | A man complaining about his diamond shoes being too tight?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/12/the-fiver-chelsea-antonio-conte-west-brom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/12/the-fiver-chelsea-antonio-conte-west-brom","fields":{"headline":"A man complaining about his diamond shoes being too tight?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"BLUES AND LOSE? In 16 matches against Chelsea in all competitions, teams managed by Alan Pardew have won a respectable five times. Bottom of the table and seven points from what passes for the “safety” currently being enjoyed by Huddersfield, West Brom could certainly do with their manager increasing that record by one on Monday night, when his team visits Stamford Bridge. While Chelsea might normally be expected to swat the Baggies aside with a minimum of fuss, these are strange times for the Premier League champions. In their past two matches they have not just been beaten, but torn apart by Bournemouth and Watford under the stewardship of a weary Italian who could scarcely make his wish to get fired more clear if he spent 90 minutes standing motionless in his technical area, holding a placard bearing the slogan “ROMAN ABRAMOVICH SMELLS OF BOILED CABBAGES”. Antonio Conte’s latest effort to earn his P45 and be escorted to the door marked “Do One” by goons with suspicious bulges under their suit jackets came in the form of a monologue about how terrible he is at convincing Chelsea’s hierarchy to sign players he wants, rather than those foisted upon him. “I think I’m a bit of a disaster [trying] to convince the club to buy the players,” he parped. “In this aspect I can improve a lot. I have to learn a lot from the other coaches, the other managers. I have to speak more with the managers who are very, very good to persuade their clubs to spend money and buy top players.” While it is easy to dismiss Conte’s gripes as those of a man complaining about his diamond shoes being too tight, and that his wallet isn’t big enough for his £100 notes, the Italian has been forced to make do with pale imitations of the signings he hoped to get and Chelsea’s title defence has suffered accordingly. As good as they are in their own special way, Álvaro Morata, Danny Drinkwater and Tiémoué Bakoyoko aren’t exactly the kind of guys who help teams with genuine title aspirati … oh. Much has been made of the habit assorted clubs have of sacking their managers following failure to beat West Brom, with Leicester City’s Craig Shakespeare having been the most recent. André Villas-Boas and Bobby Di Matteo have both been sacked by Abramovich after unsatisfactory results against the Baggies. Quite why the Russian, among other owners, sees failure to beat the men from the Hawthorns as such a badge of shame is something of a mystery, but Pardew, his team, several thousand travelling fans and one blue-eyed 48-year-old from Lecce will be hoping the Chelsea owner’s patience will be tested again.

I remember meeting ‘Big Lol’ in the buildup to Christmas in the mid-90s at the town’s Peac0cks shopping centre, where children were invited to take penalties against him in a five-a-side goal on the ground floor, just next to Spud-U-Like. They say never meet your heroes but Laurence was a joy and spent several hours letting local kids smash footballs at him while he dived around on a mat like his life depended on it. I think I scored one out of five and was genuinely delighted. I can’t imagine Thibaut Courtois doing that at the Putney Exchange. Great days” – Ben Williams. “My heroes to this day remain the 1970 NASL champions Rochester Lancers.

I tried to impress him with my keeping skills but he, astute as they come, immediately informed me I was rubbish.

Purdue Pharma said its remaining 200 sales representatives would no longer visit doctors’ offices to promote its opioid drugs. OxyContin is Purdue’s biggest-selling drug and is estimated to have generated $1.8bn of sales last year, down from $2.8bn five years earlier. The Connecticut-based company is owned by the Sackler family, whose wealth exceeds $13bn. Purdue said: “We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers.” Opioid overdoses have become the leading cause of death among the under-50s in the US. Opioids, including methadone and fentanyl, heroin and other opiates, were responsible for about 53,000 US deaths in 2016; an average of 146 a day, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the root of the deadly drug epidemic are the overprescribing of opioid painkillers for conditions ranging from severe back pain and arthritis to sports injuries. The crisis, which Donald Trump declared a “public health emergency” last year – dates back to the 1990s when healthcare organisations encouraged doctors to treat postoperative pain more aggressively. Soon afterwards drug companies, led by Purdue, started marketing opioids for all kinds of chronic pain, enticing doctors with incentives and all-expenses-paid trips. Another drugmaker, Endo International, pulled its Opana ER painkiller off the market in July after the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, requested the withdrawal. Purdue and other drugmakers have been fighting a barrage of litigation by states, counties and cities that have accused them of aggressively pushing addictive painkillers. The lawsuits have accused Purdue of playing down OxyContin’s addiction risk and of misleading marketing that overstated the benefits of opioids for treating chronic, rather than short-term, pain. At least 14 states are suing the company. Steve Marshall, the attorney general for Alabama, filed a lawsuit on behalf of the state last week. Purdue is also facing a federal investigation by the US attorney’s office in Connecticut. Purdue has denied the allegations. It has said its drugs were approved by the FDA and account for only 2% of all opioid prescriptions. In 2007, the company and three executives pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay $634.5m to resolve a US Justice Department investigation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/mar/02/lets-move-to-exeter-devon-beaches-hills-wilderness-old-pubs","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T16:30:12Z","webTitle":"Let’s move to Exeter, Devon: a city whose time has finally come","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/02/lets-move-to-exeter-devon-beaches-hills-wilderness-old-pubs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/mar/02/lets-move-to-exeter-devon-beaches-hills-wilderness-old-pubs","fields":{"headline":"Let’s move to Exeter, Devon: a city whose time has finally come","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What’s going for it? Exeter’s had a rum old 75 years. First it was the Nazis, raining bombs. Then the town planners and property developers, rebuilding it in the most magnolia of modernisms, unwonking its wonky lines. The next misfortune arrived in the avuncular guise of Bill Bryson who, in his 1995 bestseller Notes From A Small Island, damned Exeter with the faintest of praise: “not an easy place to love” (Bill could make or break a place back then). A decade later, the city won Clone Town of the Year. Hold up, isn’t this the part where I’m meant to tell you the good bits? Well, the happy ending is that Exeter is beginning to wise up. So it should. What gifts this city has: surrounded by beaches, hills, wilderness, astonishing food producers and hobbity old country pubs; a cityscape of medieval gothic and Georgian townhouses; the Exeter Chiefs; proper coffee at last! It’s not suddenly turned into Devon’s Berlin or Brooklyn, but it is getting an air of confidence. And a branch of Ikea. The case against Great progress, but still a way to go. It needs to capitalise further on its distinctive identity and the riches around and within it. Well connected? Trains: to Taunton (28 minutes), Exmouth (30 minutes), Bristol, Plymouth and Yeovil (all one hour).

He tried to negotiate smaller ears but “struck out on that as well”. There was one area of concession, however: Wiley’s impulse to depict Obama on a throne, holding a sceptre or perhaps even riding a horse. “I had to explain that I’ve got enough political problems without you making me look like Napoleon!” The result was a vivid official portrait that shows the 44th president sitting in a suit, without a tie, floating in vegetation and flowers. Obama was on hand to unveil it on Monday at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, where the America’s presidents section was previously an exclusive club for white people painted by white people. “How about that?” said Obama, after he and Wiley pulled down a black cloth to reveal the 84in-high canvas, watched by an audience that included former vice-president Joe Biden and donor Steven Spielberg, the Hollywood director. “That’s pretty sharp.” The ceremony also witnessed the unveiling of a portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama, by Amy Sherald, whom the former president praised for capturing his wife’s “hotness”. Both portraits – produced after two sittings each – have sombre expressions, perhaps not entirely inappropriate in the era of Donald Trump. The National Portrait Gallery began commissioning portraits of the president with George H W Bush in 1994 and added commissions of the first lady, beginning with Hillary Clinton, in 2006. Wiley and Sherald are the first African American artists selected. They were chosen from candidates interviewed by the Obamas at the White House, where the first couple often hung works by African American artists. Wiley is a Los Angeles-born (in 1977), New York-based artist best known for his vibrant, large-scale paintings of African Americans. He typically portrays people of colour posing as famous figures in western art, challenging the white-dominated western canon. Some of the flowers in the background of his Obama portrait carry special meaning: the chrysanthemums reference the official flower of Chicago; the jasmine evokes Hawaii, where he spent the majority of his childhood; the African blue lilies stand in for his late Kenyan father. Wiley said: “In a very symbolic way, what I’m doing is charting his path on earth through those plants that weave their way. There’s a fight going on between he in the foreground and the plants that are trying to announce themselves underneath his feet. Who gets to be the star of the show? The story or the man who inhabits that story?” Obama noted that he had never had his portrait done before. The celebrated “Hope” election campaign poster was “cool”, he said, but he did not sit for it. “I don’t like posing, I look at my watch,” he admitted. “It’s pretty tortuous trying to take a photograph of me, never mind a portrait.” Both Obama and Wiley were raised by American mothers and had African fathers who were absent, the former president noted. “But what I was always struck by whenever I saw his portraits was the degree to which they challenged our conventional views of power and privilege and the way that he would take extraordinary care and precision and vision in recognising the beauty and the grace and the dignity of people who are so often invisible in our lives and put them on a grand stage, on a grand scale, and force us to look and see them in ways that so often they were not. “People in our families, people that helped to build this country, people who helped to build this capital, people who to this day are making sure that this place is clean at night, and serving food, and taking out the garbage and doing all the other stuff that makes this country work, so often out of sight and out of mind. Kehinde lifted them up and gave them a platform and said they belonged at the centre of American life and that was something that moved me deeply because in my small way that’s what I believe politics should be about: is not simply celebrating the high and the mighty and expecting that the country unfolds from the top down, but rather that it comes from the bottom up.” Sherald’s portrait shows an unsmiling Michelle Obama with chin resting on right hand and an expansive white patternered dress by designer Michelle Smith’s label Milly. The final composition, based on photos that Sherald took during her sittings with the former first lady, includes the distinctive grey skin tones that mark the majority of her paintings. Obama turned to Sherald and said: “Amy, I want to thank you for so spectacularly capturing the grace and the beauty and the intelligence and charm and hotness of the woman that I love.” Michelle Obama, Sherald and the audience laughed. The president continued: “Special shout out to my man Joe Biden. An even more special shout out to my mother-in-law who, in addition to providing the hotness genes, also has been such an extraordinary rock and foundation stone for our family.” Baltimore-based artist Sherald was the first woman to win the Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. Soon after earning a college qualification in 2004, she was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. She underwent a transplant eight years later and continued to make art during her recovery. Michelle Obama praised the work – “Wow!” – and told the audience she was thinking of her family and young people, particularly girls and girls of colour, “who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and they will see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution. And I know the kind of impact that will have on their lives because I was one of those girls, and when I think about those future generations and generations past, I think wow, what an incredible journey we are on together in this country. “We have come so far and yes, as we see today, we still have a lot more work to do, but we have every reason to be hopeful and proud.” The gallery has one of two official national collections of presidential portraits (the other belongs to the White House) with star exhibits including George Washington (the “Lansdowne” portrait by Gilbert Stuart) and Abraham Lincoln, born 209 years ago on Monday. Guests at the event included Obama’s former attorney general Eric Holder. Michelle Obama’s mother Marian Robinson was also present."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/sep/10/d-double-e-grimes-nearly-man-i-havent-been-able-to-prove-myself","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-10T09:27:20Z","webTitle":"D Double E, grime's nearly man: 'I haven’t been able to prove myself'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/10/d-double-e-grimes-nearly-man-i-havent-been-able-to-prove-myself","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/sep/10/d-double-e-grimes-nearly-man-i-havent-been-able-to-prove-myself","fields":{"headline":"D Double E, grime's nearly man: 'I haven’t been able to prove myself'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“I’ve wasted too much time,” says D Double E, in an uncharacteristically sombre moment, between mouthfuls of sausage and mash in his local pub in east London. It’s 14 years since the self-professed Newham General – the MCs’ MC, the fans’ favourite – was first (and last) interviewed in the Guardian, and his impatience is understandable. Back then, in grime’s breakout period, when the genre was only just acquiring the name, there was a tumult of hype, expectation and raw talent drawing mainstream interest. Even at that early stage, D Double E was seen as something of a veteran – like Wiley, he was a vital few years older than teenage crews like Ruff Sqwad and Meridian, from which Tinchy Stryder and Skepta would emerge respectively. After leaving the legendary Nasty Crew, following a falling-out with Marcus Nasty, he was ready to graduate from a thriving if chaotic underground scene. “I’m not a little kid any more,” he said in that 2004 interview, “I wanna be an artist, man.” He has not stopped making music, or performing, in the intervening decade and a half – which makes it pretty extraordinary that D Double is only now releasing a debut album. Born Darren Dixon, his status on the grime scene is difficult to overstate. He is the one who inspired Dizzee Rascal, originally a DJ, to pick up the mic. In 2015 Skepta called him, without hesitating, “the greatest grime MC of all time”. Wiley recently recalled that “the root of all this grime business” was him and D Double performing at house parties in east London in the 90s. Chipmunk referenced D Double’s classic early material on his first single, Fire Alie (“back in the day I’d lock into Deja, hear D Double spit birds in the Sky”). The 38-year-old MC personifies grime’s evolution as a genre born of pirate radio and rave culture – where the MC is a host in the Jamaican sound-system tradition, responding spontaneously to the DJ’s live selections, rather than a polished, managed artist laying down pre-written pop songs in a studio, playing the (white) industry game. In those early days, grime was not a visible genre, and to distinguish themselves from the clamour on a multi-MC pirate radio show, an idiosyncratic vocal style, memorable ad-libs and a verbal audio-logo were invaluable parts of the MCs’ armoury. On these terms, D Double’s charisma soon made him a pirate legend. The “D Double signal” was an immediately recognisable announcement of his arrival at a rave or on a radio set, like a music-hall performer peering his head around the side of the curtain, before stepping out on to the stage. Written non-phonetically, in standard English, it looks comical – “Ooh, ooh! It’s me, me!” – but it’s spread out over about nine or 10 syllables, a visceral vocal exorcism from somewhere deep in the lungs. (“That’s very original: never heard that from another individual,” runs an old school D Double lyric, commentating on his own style.) D Double grew up in Forest Gate in the 80s and 90s, surrounded by reggae and American hip-hop. He would write out Snoop Dogg lyrics while simultaneously falling in love with pop music: classics by the likes of Neneh Cherry and Dawn Penn – he sings the latter’s No, No, No to me, screwing up his face in mock-emotional tribute. He clearly loves making people laugh, an entertainer whether the mic is in his hand or not: doing silly voices, impersonating a subwoofer, and doing theatrical renditions of everything from jungle MCs to CeCe Peniston. He gets that gregarious “dapper Dan” style from his father, he says: “You look at photos of him from back in the day, it’s like Eddie Murphy in Raw: full leathers, V-neck with the hairy chest – when my dad walks down the road, everyone knows him, you know?” There was a lot of togetherness in the early grime scene, he recalls – they’d travel from Newham to Bow to meet Wiley, or to south London or Hackney for raves and pirate radio sets. “It felt more like a community, it felt a bit closer,” he says. “We had to work our way out of certain conditions – it used to be quite racist back in the day in east London.” That spirit was forged by “guys linking to make music in bedrooms and youth centres, and most of all in radio stations. That gave us the platform, it helped so much.” After a decade in which grime has come to dominate pop culture, and where the illegal stations have been largely replaced by the likes of BBC Radio 1Xtra and Rinse FM, the pirate era seems like a lost world. “The stations felt like traps man,” he laughs. “Some of them never had proper doors, they were just abandoned houses, you could just push the door open and walk in, and so then when you’re on air spitting, you’re looking around thinking, ‘Who’s going to come in?’ Or sometimes it would be in a normal household, so you walk in, see the kids playing, mum’s cooking dinner, you say hello to the uncles and then you go upstairs to the bedroom, and it’s a radio station! It wasn’t always about recording what you were doing, sometimes it was just that your mate’s got some decks in his bedroom, so let’s all have a mix.” Those teenage experiments are where his hilarious ad-libs come from: the D Double signal, but also other catchphrases like “bi-di-bup-bup” or “bluku bluku”, lyrical idiosyncrasies traceable back to both his and grime’s origins in jungle and drum’n’bass in the 90s. “Those echoes come from spraying in that freestyle way – that spur-of-the-moment energy, that’s where the magic is. We had to create grime, because we needed it for our spirits, as spitters – because we’re coming from drum’n’bass, which is so open, like, ‘Spray your heart out G, spray your lungs out!’” After Dizzee was signed and won the Mercury prize, he wanted to bring through his teenage hero, and approached D Double about joining his new label, Dirtee Stank. D Double agreed, on the condition he signed his new crew, Newham Generals, which he had formed with fellow local MCs’ Footsie and Monkstar. Touring as Dizzee’s support act in front of new audiences unfamiliar with their pirate fame was a learning curve, he says. “It was an eye opener, it was the first time I got to see what living the real life would be, outside of the clubs, sweating in the small raves. It put us in a spot where we had to learn how to entertain differently.” In the best part of a decade signed to Dirtee Stank, the crew only released one album, Generally Speaking, in 2009, and a smattering of classic solo singles, like D Double’s Streetfighter Riddim – there was a sense among fans of constant postponements, and that the releases weren’t capturing the brilliance of the MCs’ live performances. “That whole period was just frustrating,” he says now, adding that there is another Newham Generals album “in the tank”, which will see a release at some point. “I had too many people telling me different things. But I think it had to happen – and the freedom I have now, with my independent label, Bluku Music: I run the label myself, and I handle the artists myself. It’s all coming from the right organic corners … and I’m in control of what’s happening. It’s like grabbing a hold of the horses yourself. I’ve always just been sitting there, waiting for somebody to tell me when, but I want to tell myself when. I don’t want anyone telling me what to do, that’s the way forward.” His debut solo album, Jackuum!, features guest spots from fellow grime originals Wiley, Skepta and younger MCs AJ Tracey and Littlez, but the sound is distinctively D Double – the skippy flow and cheeky persona shines through. He’s so taken with his newfound independence, he’s already making his next one. It feels like an overdue epiphany, and an opportunity to take two decades of free-flowing lyrical brilliance and spontaneity, and canalise it into something widely accessible, and lasting.

But it is safe to say that there will never be another jockey who connects as thoroughly and deeply with the racing and betting public as Lester Piggott during the three decades when he was the dominant force in British Flat racing. The reason is Piggott’s timing. Not just the split-second judgment that so often put him on the right side of a head-bobbing photo-finish, or allowed him to deliver Royal Academy on the line in the 1990 Breeders’ Cup Mile, at the age of 55 and less than a fortnight after coming out of retirement. He also emerged as the most talented jockey of his, and arguably any, generation at the ideal moment to leave a permanent mark on an audience of millions. Piggott, who has died aged 86, did not win the first of his 11 Flat championships until 1960, but by then the seeds of his celebrity among racegoers and backers had already been sown. In the 1950s, off-course cash betting was technically illegal but still a hugely popular thread in the fabric of everyday working-class life. Racing accounted for the overwhelming majority of bets and in one sense Piggott was just the latest in a line of jockeys, from Fred Archer in the mid-19th century onwards, whose name against a horse in the Derby or the Gold Cup at Ascot could set the odds tumbling. But Piggott was different. He was the first great jockey of the television age, in a two- and three-channel era when Britain’s most historic sporting events were becoming a widely shared experience. For two centuries, off-course punters had followed the action through newspapers and occasional newsreels, without ever seeing a live race. Suddenly, it was possible to form an immediate connection with events such as Royal Ascot and the Derby, and the mesmerising, stern-faced teenager who always seemed to be in the thick of it. In a black-and-white era, Piggott’s 5ft 8in frame and backside-up riding style made it easy to pick him out as the field galloped down the hill towards Tattenham Corner. And it was another happy accident of timing that the age of Lester Piggott began as another great career in the saddle was drawing to a close. Sir Gordon Richards had won the Flat jockeys’ championship an extraordinary 26 times between 1925 and 1953 when he finally managed to win the Derby, at the 28th attempt, in Coronation week. Richards retired just over a year later – a few weeks after Piggott’s first Derby winner, as an 18-year-old aboard the 33-1 shot, Never Say Die. Never Say Die was, by a long way, the biggest outsider among Piggott’s record total of nine Derby winners. He won the turf’s most famous race – and yet the punters missed out. But it was also the win that secured his reputation with the betting public. He had announced himself already, having taken his first ride in public at the age of 12 and then riding his first winner in the same year. Just a year later, at an age when he would now be ineligible for a jockeys’ licence, he rode in the Derby for the first time, and the season after that, he rode his first winner at Royal Ascot, in the Wokingham Handicap. But it was Never Say Die’s unexpected success that made Piggott the anointed heir to Fred Archer, Steve Donoghue and Richards, as the jockey that backers would always seize upon in search of reward or salvation. Even in the early days of his career, the denial necessary to keep his body at a racing weight was already becoming apparent in the wasting lines on his face. His single-minded determination to get the line in front was also very plain. The punters loved him for his fearlessness, but many of the sport’s rulers and regulators held a different opinion. Piggott received a long ban for what was seen as his role in a fall that ended Richards’s career, which cost him the winning ride on Never Say Die in the St Leger, but jubilant racegoers made it plain where their sympathies lay when Piggott returned with a winner at Newmarket three months later. Throughout his career Piggott rarely gave interviews, and offered little to interviewers when he did. A speech impediment which muffled his voice and a deafness in one ear from childhood contributed to his reluctance to engage with reporters, but it reflected a natural reticence too. Piggott did not court celebrity, living instead for the two minutes in every half an hour at the track when he was using his extraordinary talent. For Piggott, it seemed that fame was not something to seek and defend. It was more of an occupational hazard. Some said that he existed on lettuce and champagne, others that it was cigars and black coffee – just two among the dozens of tales that attached themselves to “the Long Fellow” to fill the void left by his low profile in the media. Every story, apocryphal or not, embellished the Lester legend. His love of money – and the reluctance to part with it which would eventually cost him his liberty, his OBE and any chance of a knighthood – were soon part of the legend, too. “Lester,” his former weighing-room colleague Bill Rickaby once said, “relishes every crisp fiver like some rare jewel, for money is his staff of life and he ekes it out as sparingly as a man faced with 50 years of unpensionable retirement.” There were countless rumours too about the ruthlessness with which he would pursue the ride on a big-race favourite, and the quiet word with the owner to plant the idea that his presence in the saddle could make all the difference. In the run-up to the Derby, speculation about which horse Piggott would ride, and also which horse he wanted to ride, was fevered. More often than not, Piggott got his way. His self-assurance was unshakeable. The backers knew that Piggott’s faith in himself was as strong as theirs in him. He backed himself against any other rider in the game, and at a time when racing accounted for the overwhelming majority of betting turnover, the punters felt the same way. His success over the course of a major meeting such as Royal Ascot could be the difference between a winning or losing week for the bookmakers. Piggott rode 116 winners at the Royal meeting, at a time when what is now a five-day meeting was staged over just four, a record that is sure to remain intact for decades to come. So too will his extraordinary total of nine Derby victories, three more than any other rider in its 240-year history and at least two of which would have been losers for any other jockey before or since. For generations of backers on and off the track, it was “Come on, Lester” if you were with him, and an exasperated “Bloody Piggott” if he beat you on the nod. But win or lose, for more than a quarter of a century, Lester Piggott was always centre stage, in a fashion that none of those who followed him could ever hope to match."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/16/seasonal-jobs-athletes-competing-at-summer-and-winter-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-16T20:00:55Z","webTitle":"Seasonal jobs: athletes competing at Summer and Winter Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/16/seasonal-jobs-athletes-competing-at-summer-and-winter-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/16/seasonal-jobs-athletes-competing-at-summer-and-winter-olympics","fields":{"headline":"Seasonal jobs: athletes competing at Summer and Winter Olympics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With his shirtless appearances at the opening ceremonies in Rio and Pyeongchang, Tonga’s Pita Taufatofua has become the very public face of athletes who have competed at both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Taufatofua switched his discipline from taekwondo in Brazil in 2016, to cross-country skiing in South Korea this year, joining the rare breed of athletes who have been able to take part in both types of Olympic games. There are just 161 of them in total. The most dual games appearances Japanese politician Seiko Hashimoto holds the record for most appearances among athletes who have competed in both summer and winter. Over a twelve year period she competed in both speed skating and cycling at seven Games. She made her debut in the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics, and bowed out in Atlanta’s 1996 summer games, earning the bronze medal in the 1500 metres speed skating in Albertville in 1992 along the way. After retiring from sport, she was elected to the Japanese upper chamber, the House of Councillors, in 1995. She is chairman of the Japanese skating federation and was Japan’s Chef de Mission at the Rio Olympics, the first woman to hold the role. The most successful dual discipline athlete Pita Taufatofua will be remembered more for his bare-chested ceremony appearances than his actual Olympic results. He only just scraped above the qualifying level required to reach the skiing in Pyeongchang this year, and was eliminated in his first Twaekwondo bout back in 2016. You have to go back to the 1920s and 1930s to find the most successful dual competitor. The USA’s Edward Eagan is, to date, the only person to win a gold medal in both summer and winter in different sports. Having been a lieutenant in the US army during the First World War, he won gold in the light-heavyweight boxing in Antwerp in 1920. Then in 1932 in Lake Placid he formed part of the USA four-man bobsleigh team that claimed victory. British athletes who appeared in both Olympics Over the years six British athletes have represented their nation at both a summer and a winter games. The most recent was Allyn Condon. Part of the men’s 4 × 100m relay team in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Condon switched his attention to to bobsleigh and competed in Vancouver ten years later. Nearly all of the British competitors took this same route - representing their country in athletics, then moving into bobsleigh. Phil Harries, Marcus Adam, John Herbert and Colin Campbell all did the same thing. The first Briton to compete in both a Summer and a Winter Olympics did it differently - he was Percy Legard. An all-round athlete, he took part in the 1932 and 1936 Summer Games in the modern pentathlon. He also participated in the 1936 Winter Olympics, where he took part in the Nordic combined event in Bavaria’s Garmisch-Partenkirchen. After the Second World War, during which he served as a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Commandos, Legard resumed his Olympic career. At the 1948 St. Moritz Winter Olympics, he took part in the demonstration sport of a “winter pentathlon” included in the programme. Common combinations Converting from a summer discipline to taking part in bobsleigh is one of the most well-worn routes to taking part in both games. Of the 132 athletes to have appeared in both since the winter and summer Olympics were split into separate occasions, 45 of them have combined bobsleigh with athletics. Speed-skating and cycling is also a popular combination. This is due to how the muscles and body shape required to excel at these differing sports are similar. How it used to be Prior to the inaugural Winter Games being held in France’s Chamonix in 1924, some winter sports, including ice hockey, had been included in the summer games. That means there are select band of athletes who competed in both the 1920 Summer Olympics and the 1924 Winter Olympics - but at the same sport. Swedish figure skater Gillis Grafström uniquely won a gold medal in the 1920 Summer Games, and then retained his figure skating title in both the 1924 and 1928 Winter Olympics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/13/from-a-very-british-coup-to-collateral-the-best-state-of-the-nation-dramas","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-13T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"From A Very British Coup to Collateral: the best state-of-the-nation dramas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/13/from-a-very-british-coup-to-collateral-the-best-state-of-the-nation-dramas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/13/from-a-very-british-coup-to-collateral-the-best-state-of-the-nation-dramas","fields":{"headline":"From A Very British Coup to Collateral: the best state-of-the-nation dramas","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"From its earnest conversations about immigration to the complicated plot involving cover-up and conspiracy at the highest level, it’s clear that Collateral, David Hare’s latest drama which began on BBC Two last night, has pretensions above your average crime thriller. Set in a world fuelled by the gig economy, Collateral’s central plot follows detective Kip Glaspie’s (Carey Mulligan) as she investigates the murder of a Syrian pizza delivery man. It’s a case which swiftly turns out to have a far wider impact than might initially appear. There are hints of government corruption, a military cover-up, possible media foul play – it can only mean one thing: this is a state-of-the-nation drama, and, according to Hare, the state of our nation is looking very sickly indeed. He’s not alone in feeling this way. From Boys from the Blackstuff to last year’s Broken, British television has a distinguished history of producing dramas that tell us about contemporary Britain. Here’s our look at what they said about the nation at the time. Boys from the Blackstuff (1982) The plot: Spun off from his original teleplay, this Alan Bleasdale series follows five unemployed men in Liverpool with each episode featuring on a different member of the group. Episode Four, Yosser’s Story, following Bernard Hill’s Yosser Hughes as his life entirely disintegrates along with his sense of self-worth, remains one of British TV’s most powerful hours. What it told us: A blistering condemnation of then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s policies, in particular the notion of ‘managed decline’, Boys from the Blackstuff gave a human face to the rising unemployment figures and in doing so hit a chord in homes throughout the UK. It was described as being “TV’s most complete dramatic response to the Thatcher era and as a lament to the end of a male, working-class British culture”. Edge of Darkness (1985) The plot: After Boys from the Black Stuff, producer Michael Wearing worked on the story of Bob Peck’s police officer and his attempts to uncover the truth behind the murder of his activist daughter (Joanna Whalley). He’s soon drawn into a complicated story of cover-up, conspiracy and nuclear espionage. What it told us: It’s easy to forget now just how paranoid life was in the mid-80s was. Nuclear war and the destruction of all human life seemed a very real threat and the bleak Edge of Darkness is the ultimate conspiracy drama for the age, a dark tale of cold war and nuclear fear in Thatcher’s Britain. A Very British Coup (1988) The plot: Chris Mullin’s 1982 novel about the rise to power of an unassuming and left-wing Labour leader and the subsequent political, military and media conspiracy against him was adapted for TV by Alan Plater and starred Ray McAnally. The TV series was set a few years in the future in 1991. What it told us: Mullin’s book was written during a time when the left-wing Tony Benn was thought likely to become deputy leader of the Labour party and imagined establishment reaction to an anti-NATO government keen on unilateral nuclear disarmament. Surely some enterprising TV exec will commission a modern-day version? GBH (1991) The plot: Michael Murray (Robert Lindsay) a charismatic Labour councillor with links to a hard-left political organisation not a million miles from Militant is elected City Council Leader in an unnamed city in the Northwest of England not a million miles from Liverpool. His rise to power brings him into conflict with modern Labour member and local headmaster Jim Nelson (Michael Palin). What it told us: Alan Bleasdale’s series made headlines for the similarities between Lindsay’s bombastic Murray and the former Deputy Leader of Liverpool City Council Derek Hatton. It now it seems like a prophetic warning as to what was to come with Murray’s superficial charm and media nous heralding the beginning of New Labour as much as the fall of Militant. Our Friends in the North (1996) The plot: Peter Flannery’s superlative drama followed four friends (played by Gina McKee, Christopher Eccleston, Daniel Craig and Mark Strong) from Newcastle over the course of 31 years from 1964 to 1995. What it told us: As much a history of the Labour movement as the story of four friends, Our Friends in the North told an ambitious story of youthful idealism gone astray and the compromise of middle age. A large part of the focus was on Ecclestone’s idealistic Nicky and his struggle to find his place in the party, although it was McKee’s pragmatic Mary who eventually became a New Labour politician, at a time when the hope and promise of 1997 election was still to come. State of Play (2003) The plot: Paul Abbott’s conspiracy thriller is perhaps the nearest show to Collateral on this list and not just because of the presence of John Simm. It tells the story of journalists Cal McCaffrey (Simm) and Della Smith (Kelly McDonald) who find themselves caught up in that old favourite a wide-ranging government conspiracy with links to MP Stephen Collins (David Morrissey), an old friend of Cal’s. What it told us: Slick, clever and fantastically cynical about the machinations of government, Abbott’s taut drama, which was aired in 2003 at the height of Blair’s Britain, was the perfect series for those image-obsessed times. Capital (2015) The Plot: Adapted by Peter Bowker from John Lanchester’s best-selling novel, this three-part series focused on the residents of a seemingly ordinary street in south London to comment on how the property boom has transformed lives in London, not always for the better. What it told us: A state-of-the-nation drama for the Cameron era, Capital both highlighted the growing disparity between the haves and have nots while suggesting that if we don’t make the effort to understand those whose lives are different from ours then we will all be lost. Broken (2016) The Plot: Jimmy McGovern’s six-part drama followed local parish priest Father Michael Kerrigan (Sean Bean) as he attempted to come to terms with his past while providing succour for his impoverished and beleaguered community. What it told us: The focus might have been on Father Michael’s journey to redemption but McGovern was unsparing in his depiction of a community destroyed by zero hours contracts and unstable housing, ignored by the current government and let down by local politicians, health workers and police officers alike. As state of the nation dramas go they don’t get much bleaker than this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/12/carillion-jobs-prison-defence-staff","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T18:32:08Z","webTitle":"Carillion: 11,800 wait to learn their fate as 4,400 more jobs are saved","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/12/carillion-jobs-prison-defence-staff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/12/carillion-jobs-prison-defence-staff","fields":{"headline":"Carillion: 11,800 wait to learn their fate as 4,400 more jobs are saved","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"More than 4,400 staff who worked for collapsed government contractor Carillion will keep their jobs, the Insolvency Service has said, after new companies were found to provide prison maintenance and services for military bases. The latest update takes the total number of Carillion jobs that have been saved since the company’s failure last month to 6,668, more than a third of its 19,500-strong workforce. The official receiver, the office sifting through Carillion’s contracts for the government’s Insolvency Service, raised hopes for the 11,800 staff who have yet to learn their fate, saying there was a “lot of interest” from companies keen to take on more of the collapsed company’s public and private sector work. But a further 59 people who were working on construction projects have been made redundant, taking the running total of job losses to 1,048. The official receiver said: “Arrangements have now been finalised to transfer prison facilities management and defence bases catering and cleaning contracts to new providers and as a result we have been able to safeguard employment for a further 4,418 employees. “Ongoing employment has been confirmed for more than a third of Carillion’s workforce so far as part of the liquidation.” The official receiver advised those who have lost their jobs to seek support through the government’s Jobcentre Plus rapid response service and to make a claim for redundancy payments. “Most employees who have transferred so far have done so on existing or similar terms and I will continue to facilitate this wherever possible as we work to find new providers for Carillion’s other contracts,” the spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/12/collateral-review-carey-mulligan-shines-in-a-damaging-political-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T22:00:25Z","webTitle":"Collateral review – Carey Mulligan shines in a damaging political drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/12/collateral-review-carey-mulligan-shines-in-a-damaging-political-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/12/collateral-review-carey-mulligan-shines-in-a-damaging-political-drama","fields":{"headline":"Collateral review – Carey Mulligan shines in a damaging political drama","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At first sight, it could be Law &amp; Order: Southwark Victims Unit. Delivery drivers jostle each other at the local takeaway’s counter, awaiting the next job. One of them, Abdullah, gets a quattro formaggi to take to an unpleasant woman in a posh flat and is quickly, cleanly shot dead as he leaves. But instead of Benson and Stabler bowling along to wrap things up in 47 minutes, what follows is resolutely non-procedural. Collateral – a co-production between BBC2 and Netflix – is the first original TV series by pre-eminent state-of-the-nation playwright Sir David Hare, and quickly stretches out its narrative fingers to poke about in the institutions we once could at least pretend to be able to rely on. Our introduction to the world of politics comes via David Mars (John Simm, first among equals in a cast that includes Oscar-nominee Carey Mulligan as the investigating officer Kip, the ever-extraordinary Nicola Walker, Saskia Reeves, Ben Miles and Billie Piper doing her best work yet), Abdullah’s MP, ex-husband of the woman in the flats (Piper), and a member of the shadow cabinet frustrated by his party’s increasing list to the right on immigration. The fault lines of the church as a place of succour look set to be examined through Walker’s character, Jane. Jane is a gay vicar whose lover Han Yang (who is in the country illegally – Jane got her old friend David unwittingly to help her stay) is the only witness to Abdullah’s murder. She has not told the police her real name or that she thinks the assassin was female. I’m not sure what protection she thinks the latter decision affords her, but as she was in a k-hole at the time I guess we must cut her some slack. Abdullah himself is – was – a Syrian refugee. In the garage he was using as a home Kip finds his two sisters, who remain tight-lipped. The assassin, it becomes clear, is part of the military establishment. Further wrinkles and lacunae abound. The girl who gave the delivery jobs out is the carer for her disabled mother and – the suggestion is – vulnerable to anyone who can either save or threaten her job. The man she passed over for the fateful delivery returns to his old nightclub post to warn that police attention has turned towards him and is promptly beaten half to death. This four-parter will cover the four days and nights after Abdullah’s death and feels like it has given itself plenty of scope but carries no threat of becoming overwhelmed. Collateral has something of the feel of Paul Abbott’s magisterial State of Play but you can’t help but think of JB Priestley’s An Inspector Calls, as characters link and interlink, the web tangles and the responsibilities of society become an every knottier mass around Abdullah and those who have – so far – survived him. • This article was amended on 19 February 2018.

Manville, a familiar face on TV, film and stage, said it was now OK to be 60 on screen. “You can have a lover at 60. You don’t have to be shoved in a corner in a cardigan doing knitting,” she said in an interview with the Radio Times. “That’s because film and television-makers realise that there is a huge audience of women who want to go to the cinema or turn on the telly and see stuff that doesn’t alienate them, that embraces them, that isn’t just about gorgeous 20- or 30-somethings, that represents their lives.” Manville’s comments were echoed by Anna Friel who, in a separate Radio Times interview, said there were finally a reasonable number of strong roles for women in their 40s. “I did wonder about turning 40 and being thrown on the scrapheap,” said Friel, 41, soon to be seen in the second series of the ITV crime drama Marcella. “Apart from the shell changing, everything else changes in a much more positive way. Wisdom, compassion, empathy, values, being parents – we’re learning that people want to watch people they can relate to, not just the unachievable. We’ve got enough of that with the superhero movies.” Manville is nominated for best supporting actress at this weekend’s Baftas and at next month’s Oscars for her role alongside Daniel Day Lewis in the Paul Thomas Anderson film Phantom Thread. Strikingly, none of the women nominated in the category at the Oscars – Manville, Laurie Metcalf, Allison Janney, Octavia Spencer and Mary J Blige – are under the age of 40. “Isn’t that good? To be alongside those women!” Manville was nominated for a Bafta in 2011 for the Mike Leigh film Another Year, but this is her first Oscar nomination and she admitted feeling giddy. The ceremony will be something of a family affair in that Gary Oldman, her ex-husband, is nominated in the best actor category for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in The Darkest Hour. Manville is currently reprising her role in Long Day’s Journey Into Night alongside Jeremy Irons in London’s West End and next week she will be seen in the BBC Two sitcom Mum. In a separate interview with the Press Association, Manville said the sitcom, about a suburban woman who attempts to move on after her husband’s death, was evidence of how things were improving. “I think there is a feeling now, and I have been saying it for about five years – and sometimes people think I’m just saying it because things are alright for me and my career – but I think it’s getting better for older women. “I think there is a shift: the distributors of films, they realise there’s a huge market for an audience of women over 40 who want to go and see things that deal with their lives, that don’t distance them from it because they’re looking at some svelte 22-year-old in a Wonder Woman outfit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/12/apple-goes-to-court-to-ban-tax-campaigners-from-its-french-stores","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T14:50:52Z","webTitle":"Apple asks court to ban tax campaigners from its French stores","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/12/apple-goes-to-court-to-ban-tax-campaigners-from-its-french-stores","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/12/apple-goes-to-court-to-ban-tax-campaigners-from-its-french-stores","fields":{"headline":"Apple asks court to ban tax campaigners from its French stores","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Apple has gone to court in Paris to prevent French tax campaigners from staging stunts at its French stores. A French court will rule later this month on an unusual case brought by the tech firm, which aims to ban the French NGO Attac from its premises. Attac regularly stages what it insists on calling “good-natured” stunts at French Apple stores to criticise the company’s tax affairs. At the height of the Christmas shopping period last December, about 100 Attac volunteers arrived at Apple’s Paris store at Place de l’Opéra. Some danced the conga, others unfurled a huge banner saying “We’ll stop when Apple pays” and some brandished huge cardboard cheques in reference to the European commission ruling in August 2016 that the iPhone maker must reimburse the Irish state a record €13bn (£11.5bn) to make up for what it considered to be unpaid taxes over a number of years. When Apple launched the iPhone X last year, Attac activists in Aix-en-Provence whitewashed the windows of an Apple store to allude to what it called the company’s “opaque” tax affairs. The activists did not cover their faces and described their actions as taking place in a kind of party atmosphere. Monday’s Paris court standoff has been billed as David v Goliath. Apple submitted court papers insisting that it has “a long tradition of supporting individuals and groups that peacefully express their opinions” but it accuses Attac activists of “vandalising [Apple] shops and endangering the security of staff and customers”. The company also said its sales had been affected. Apple France has asked the court to ban Attac from its stores and to fine the activists €150,000 and €3,000 in commercial damages if they break the ban. Attac has denied vandalism, with its spokesman saying: “We simply went into Apple shops in a festive and good-natured way with music and theatre.” Attac’s lawyer Julien Pignon told France Info: “These demands are totally out of proportion with regard to the superior principle of freedom of expression and freedom to demonstrate which is guaranteed by French law and the European convention on human rights.” The court had been expected to announce its decision on Monday, but later said it will announce it on 23 February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/12/hurtful-harper-lee-mark-twain-dropped-from-minnesota-curriculum-to-kill-a-mockingbird-duluth","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T10:33:55Z","webTitle":"'Hurtful' Harper Lee and Mark Twain dropped from Minnesota curriculum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/12/hurtful-harper-lee-mark-twain-dropped-from-minnesota-curriculum-to-kill-a-mockingbird-duluth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/12/hurtful-harper-lee-mark-twain-dropped-from-minnesota-curriculum-to-kill-a-mockingbird-duluth","fields":{"headline":"'Hurtful' Harper Lee and Mark Twain dropped from Minnesota curriculum","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A school district in Minnesota has pulled To Kill a Mockingbird and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn from its curriculum, arguing that the classic novels’ use of racial slurs risked students being “humiliated or marginalised”. The Duluth school district will keep the titles in its libraries, but from the next school year, they will be replaced on the curriculum for ninth and 11th-grade English classes, according to local newspaper the Bemidji Pioneer. Duluth’s director of curriculum and instruction Michael Cary told the Pioneer that his department wanted to be considerate of all its students, and that there were other literary options that “teach the same lessons” as To Kill a Mockingbird and Huckleberry Finn without containing racial slurs. The N-word is used frequently in both titles – more than 200 times in Mark Twain’s 19th-century novel – but both are widely considered anti-racist texts. “We felt that we could still teach the same standards and expectations through other novels that didn’t require students to feel humiliated or marginalised by the use of racial slurs,” said Carey. According to the Bemidji Pioneer, there was no specific complaint from students about the titles, but their use “created an uncomfortable atmosphere” in the classroom. The Duluth move was supported by the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, with president of the local chapter Stephan Witherspoon saying the books were “just hurtful” and use “hurtful language that has oppressed the people for over 200 years”. “It’s wrong. There are a lot more authors out there with better literature that can do the same thing that does not degrade our people. I’m glad that they’re making the decision and it’s long overdue, like 20 years overdue,” he said. “Let’s move forward and work together to make school work for all of our kids, not just some, all of them.” But the move was strongly criticised by the National Coalition Against Censorship, which said it was “deeply disturbed” by the decision, and urged the district to reconsider. While the NCAC said it was “understandable that a novel that repeatedly uses a highly offensive racial slur would generate discomfort among some parents and students”, the anti-censorship organisation argued that “the problems of living in a society where racial tensions persist will not be resolved by banishing literary classics from the classroom. “On the contrary, the classroom is where the history, use and destructiveness of this language should be examined and discussed. It is there that the books’ complexities can be contextualised and their anti-racist message can be understood,” it said. “Rather than ignore difficult speech, educators should create spaces for open dialogue that teaches students to confront the vestiges of racism and the oppression of people of colour.” The decision in Duluth is not the first time that US schools have wrestled with how to teach two classic novels that nonetheless regularly feature on the American Library Association’s list of most challenged titles. Following a complaint from a parent in 2016, schools in Virginia pulled both novels from their curriculum, although they were later reinstated. And in 2017, schools in Mississippi removed Harper Lee’s novel over its “uncomfortable” and racially sensitive subject matter, although it was later returned to an “optional” reading list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/12/haiti-demands-oxfam-identify-workers-who-used-prostitutes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T19:33:31Z","webTitle":"Oxfam warned it could lose European funding over scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/12/haiti-demands-oxfam-identify-workers-who-used-prostitutes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/12/haiti-demands-oxfam-identify-workers-who-used-prostitutes","fields":{"headline":"Oxfam warned it could lose European funding over scandal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Oxfam could lose £29m in European funding because of its handling of sexual misconduct by senior staff in Haiti and Chad, officials in Brussels have said. The warning on Monday evening came as the UK’s Charity Commission launched a statutory inquiry into Oxfam amid concerns it might not have “fully and frankly disclosed” all details about the Haiti allegations. The charity’s deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, has resigned, saying was “desperately sorry”. A former senior official at the charity also said she had repeatedly warned senior management of a culture of sexual abuse in some offices around the world, and asked for more resources to tackle the issue. Helen Evans, the head of global safeguarding at Oxfam from 2012 to 2015, told Channel 4 News that in a single day she received allegations about a woman being coerced to have sex in a humanitarian response by an aid worker, a woman being coerced in exchange for aid and another case where a staff member had been struck off for sexual abuse and hadn’t disclosed that. She also claimed that volunteers as young as 14 in Oxfam shops in the UK had alleged abuse. In at least one case an adult volunteer had allegedly assaulted a child volunteer. In 2012-14 there were 12 allegations, she said. The European commission, which provided almost as much funding as the UK government last year, said: “We are ready to review and if needed cease funding any partner who is not living up to the required high ethical standards.” A spokeswoman said it expects Oxfam to “fully clarify the allegations with maximum transparency as a matter of urgency”. The potential threat to humanitarian funds came as Penny Lawrence, who was international programmes director when concerns about sexual misconduct were first reported, quit saying she was “ashamed” at what had happened. She admitted that allegations about paying for sex relating to Roland van Hauwermeiren, the country director for Chad, and members of his team there had been raised internally before he moved to Haiti, but not handled properly. “I am desperately sorry for the harm and distress that this has caused to Oxfam’s supporters, the wider development sector, and most of all, the vulnerable people who trusted us,” she said. Her resignation coincided with a meeting between the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, and Oxfam’s chief executive, Mark Goldring, and chair of trustees, Caroline Thomson. Mordaunt stopped short of stripping Oxfam of its British government funding as she threatened to on Sunday, but insisted it provide full details of those involved in the misconduct to authorities in the UK and abroad to allow legal action to begin. Haiti had earlier demanded Oxfam identify the aid workers who paid for sex in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, calling for the person to be prosecuted “in the international system”. Its ambassador to the UK, Bocchit Edmond, said the country is also considering legal action against the charity. Mordaunt said: “Oxfam made a full and unqualified apology; to me, and to the people of Britain and Haiti, for the appalling behaviour of some of their staff in Haiti in 2011, and for the wider failings of their organisation’s response to it. “They spoke of the deep sense of disgrace and shame that they and their organisation feel about what has happened.” It has been reported that Oxfam identified weaknesses in Van Hauwermeiren’s management approach to “gender issues” and that he handled complaints of sexual harassment or misconduct against another worker, but allowed him to stay in his job. Both men were later involved in the Haiti scandal. The Haitian government said it was “shocked and appalled” by the way Oxfam allowed the staff members involved in the scandal to leave the country without reporting their behaviour. Edmond said Oxfam’s claim that it feared reporting the incident to Haitian police would endanger the women involved was “really insulting”. “For the executive to know these crimes were committed and to allow those people to leave without informing the authorities is wrong,” he said. “We might be dealing with a paedophile ring. Prostitution is illegal and we believe they may have been underage kids.” Oxfam said it had received legal advice “that given the nature of the allegations, especially with the continued upheaval and chaos post the earthquake, it was extremely unlikely that any action would be taken”. There were also signs that corporate funding may be threatened. The Co-operative Bank, Heathrow airport and Visa said that they were in urgent discussions with the charity, with the latter describing the revelations as “deeply concerning”. Goldring spent the day fighting for the charity’s future on several fronts. The Charity Commission, which is due to meet Oxfam on Wednesday, said it was not told the full story at the time the charity first investigated allegations of misconduct in 2011. “We were categorically told there was no abuse of beneficiaries involved in the allegations,” said Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the regulator. Oxfam’s head of safeguarding also resigned. Goldring said the pressure of public scrutiny had been intense and she had decided to take another job, but he did not believe it was in protest at a lack of resources. He added that in recent days the number of reports about incidents had increased. Mordaunt told the charity it must change the way it handles allegations to include independent scrutiny and hinted that more resignations may be needed, saying “moral leadership comes from individuals taking responsibility for their actions”. Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted the issue dealt with “firmly, severely and very very quickly”. “I’m shocked and horrified at what apparently Oxfam staff were doing in Haiti, exploiting some of the most vulnerable people, who were victims of unbelievable levels of poverty. It should never be covered up,” the Labour leader said. He said he wanted Oxfam to recover and “go on doing the great work it does both in this country and around the world in exposing the issues of global inequality and injustice”. The former international development secretary Priti Patel claimed the Oxfam scandal was the “tip of the iceberg”. She said people in the Department for International Development knew about wider problems of sexual abuse in the aid sector. All UK charities working overseas will be asked to confirm that they have referred all concerns they have about individuals and safeguarding cases to the relevant authorities, the government announced. Oxfam has already proposed changes to its systems including a new whistleblowing procedure and stronger vetting for staff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/23/thomasina-miers-smoked-haddock-souffle-with-sheeps-cheese-recipe","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-23T14:00:05Z","webTitle":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for smoked haddock souffle with sheep’s cheese","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/23/thomasina-miers-smoked-haddock-souffle-with-sheeps-cheese-recipe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/23/thomasina-miers-smoked-haddock-souffle-with-sheeps-cheese-recipe","fields":{"headline":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for smoked haddock souffle with sheep’s cheese","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is something inherently thrilling about pulling a light, barely quivering souffle from the oven: on the one hand so pure, on the other so wanton. Souffles are ingeniously versatile, and make all sorts the stars of the show, from healthy greens to fruit and ground nuts. And the results always look fabulous. Most of all, a souffle is a brilliant bet for a low-cost, delicious dinner, as here, where smoky fish is offset by the acidity of cheese and creme fraiche. Perfect. Smoked haddock souffle with sheep’s cheese The rumour that souffle is tricky is a lie: provided the egg whites are properly whisked, it will always rise. You need a one-litre, ovenproof dish, preferably a souffle dish. Prep 10 min Cook 45-50 min Serves 4 45g plain flour Salt and freshly ground black pepper 30g butter, plus extra, to grease 175g Berkswell or sheep’s gouda (or other hard sheep’s cheese), finely grated 200g smoked haddock 1 bay leaf 400ml whole milk ½ tsp mustard powder 4 tbsp creme fraiche 2 pinches cayenne pepper 6 eggs, separated Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Season the flour with salt and pepper. Grease the sides of the souffle dish with butter, then toss in a third of the flour and a few tablespoons of cheese, and swirl to coat the sides and base. Put the fish, bay and milk in a wide, shallow pan, bring to a simmer, cook for a minute, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for at least 10 minutes. While the fish is infusing, melt the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat and stir in the rest of the flour, the mustard and cayenne. Fry for three minutes, so the flour browns a little, then whisk in the creme fraiche. Lift the fish out of its milky bath and discard the bay, then slowly add the milk to the flour mix in four phases, beating it in between additions, until you have a smooth sauce. Off the heat, beat in the egg yolks one at a time, then stir in the rest of the cheese until melted. Season to taste and leave to cool. In a large, squeaky-clean bowl, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks. Stir a third of these into the sauce, then gently fold the sauce into the egg white bowl, taking care not to knock out the air. Flake the fish into the souffle dish, removing any skin and bones, then pour the souffle mix on top. Run a finger all around the edge of the top of the dish, to make a little groove: this will help the souffle rise. Stand the dish in a roasting tray, and pour boiling water into the tray to come halfway up the sides of the souffle. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden and risen; if the top threatens to darken too much, cover with foil. Serve straight from the oven with a crisp, green salad. And for the rest of the week… The souffle is delicious reheated: cover and refrigerate any leftovers, drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the top to moisten (or some reduced double cream, as in a souffle suissesse) and reheat in a hot oven. Excess sheep’s cheese goes wonderfully with roast pumpkin. Bash together sage, garlic and olive oil, strew over the pumpkin, and roast. Dollop a mixture of ricotta, grated sheep’s cheese, extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice on to the cooked pumpkin for a fantastically delicious and easy supper.

I have been asked that question regularly for more than 30 years. This may be a reflection of the general population’s scientific illiteracy, but most people remain hazy about the composition of Quorn – even those who eat it regularly. However, many of us are prepared to accept this understanding gap because Quorn seems to be on the right side of the prevailing food paradigm, which holds that eating meat, fish, dairy and eggs is a redneck habit that has had its day, one that amounts to propagating cruelty and environmental ruin and will lead to dire consequences for human health. On the other hand, “plant food” – an appealing neologism for vegetarian and vegan that owes its intellectual heft to US food writer Michael Pollan’s maxim “Eat food, not too much, mostly plants” – is riding high on a wave of moral purity and an extravagant “feed the world and save the planet” promise. The short explanation is that Quorn is a “mycoprotein” fermented in vats from a fungus found in soil. A fuller – but still heavily truncated – one is that it is made from a strain of the soil mould Fusarium venenatum by fermenting it, then adding glucose, fixed nitrogen, vitamins and minerals and heat-treating it to remove excess levels of ribonucleic acid. (In other words, it is a long way from what the phrase “plant food” may seem to denote.) Quorn’s sales have steadily increased, but it was reported last week that they leapt globally by 16% last year, with growth in Europe and the US running at 27% and 35% respectively. The company’s bosses expect it to become a billion-dollar business by 2027. The brand was launched in 1985 by Marlow Foods as a joint venture between the bakery giant Rank Hovis McDougall (since acquired by Premier Foods) and the chemical corporation ICI (now part of AkzoNobel). The search for artificial protein sources in the 1960s was prompted by fears that food supplies for humans would be rapidly exceeded by global population growth. Petroleum and chemical companies, including BP and ICI, funded projects to coax edible yeasts, moulds and bacterium to grow. A team from ICI eventually found F venenatum, but it was not until 1985 that the government approved the sale of Quorn. The company is now owned by the Philippine food conglomerate Monde Nissin, which includes other popular ultra-processed food brands in its portfolio. Quorn has built up a range of more than 100 products, from mince and sausages to goat’s cheese and cranberry escalopes and toad in the hole, and it is beefing up – excuse the pun – its vegan range; most Quorn products contain egg (free-range egg in the UK), but its vegan equivalents use potato protein instead. With artful use of additives and hi-tech ingredients in the food manufacturer’s cabinet – factory flavourings and colourings, milk proteins, tapioca starch, palm oil, pea fibre, firming and gelling agents and so on – it seems that many of us will take chameleonic Quorn at face value as a dead ringer for everything from steak and bacon to gammon, chicken supreme and hot dogs. Quorn has earned the patronage of the Olympian Mo Farah, the footballer Jermain Defoe and the broadcaster Ben Fogle. It gets a gastronomic thumbs-up from environmentalist and Guardian columnist George Monbiot, who says that “Quorn seems almost indistinguishable from chicken or mince to me”. My impression could not be more different. While it is true that Quorn shows some of the bouncy, muscular resistance of lean meat, in every other respect – taste, smell, consistency, cooking properties, digestibility – it is nothing like meat. But I am an omnivore. To my knowledge, Quorn has never featured on the menu of any serious restaurant of note; it is more a supermarket midweek-meal proposition. Although sales are shooting up in the US, Quorn got off to a poor start there, in 2002, when the American Mushroom Institute complained that fusarium was not a mushroom. Then it locked horns with the Centre For Science in the Public Interest. This food-advocacy group has since collected more than 2,000 “adverse reaction reports” on Quorn and claims it has caused dangerous allergic reactions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and occasionally hives and difficulty breathing. Quorn refutes this. “We have sold about 4bn Quorn products over 30 years and we know the safety record of the product is exceptional,” says CEO Kevin Brennan. “Any form of reaction is exceptionally rare, perhaps one in 150,000.” He says Quorn is “as benign as a potato”. Although Quorn reached a class-action settlement agreement recently in California over whether it misled consumers who thought they were buying a mushroom-based product, it stresses that this settlement “does not acknowledge wrongdoing or liability in any way”. It has since agreed to change the wording of its labels in the US to clarify the mould versus mushroom issue. They now read: “Mycoprotein is a mold [sic] (member of the fungi family). There have been rare cases of allergic reactions to products that contain mycoprotein.” In the UK, Quorn packaging reads: “There have been rare cases of allergic reactions to Quorn products, which contain Mycoprotein. Mycoprotein is made with a member of the fungi/mould family. Mycoprotein is high in protein and fibre which may cause intolerance in some people.” Despite these allergy concerns, there is an awful lot of money to be made from faking meat. But a couple of clouds on the horizon could yet upset Quorn’s anticipated trajectory towards becoming a billion-dollar business. While Marlow Foods maintains ownership of the brand name, the mycoprotein patents for the core technological process have expired in the EU. Any company can manufacture mycoprotein legally using the previously patented processes, providing they do not call it by the Q word. While Quorn can claim with justification that it more or less invented fake meat, it must now contend with the technologically sophisticated faux meat rival concepts emerging in the US’s Silicon Valley, the hub of the world’s “plant meat” gold rush. One company, Beyond Meat, is bringing its eponymous plant burger to the UK this year. Its ingredients are pea protein isolate, expeller-pressed canola oil, refined coconut oil, water, yeast extract, maltodextrin, “natural” flavourings, gum arabic, sunflower oil, salt, succinic acid, acetic acid, modified food starch, cellulose from bamboo, methylcellulose, potato starch, ascorbic acid, annatto extract, citrus fruit extract and glycerin. In addition, it contains beetroot juice extract to ape a meaty red colour. It is certainly not everyone’s idea of “clean eating”. The Impossible Burger has further upped the “no-death meat” stakes. It stretches the limits of our scientific comprehension far beyond Quorn. The composition of this plant burger is in many respects similar to other meat lookalikes – water, protein powders, edible glues, factory flavourings, synthetic vitamins – but it is distinguished by its trailblazing use of soy leghemoglobin (SLH), a vat-grown, genetically engineered form of the heme iron found in the root nodules of soya bean plants. Impossible Foods says this novel ingredient gives the Impossible Burger its “bloody”, meat-like taste and colour. The US Food and Drug Administration’s view in August 2015 was that “the current arguments at hand, individually and collectively, were not enough to establish the safety of SLH for consumption”. Nevertheless, since it was not explicitly ruled unsafe, the Impossible Burger is on sale in restaurants all over the US. In response to its US rivals, Quorn is keen to exploit its image as the plucky British company that discovered the world’s no-meat future in a soil sample from a Yorkshire field. “What is exciting for us is that Silicon Valley firms keep talking about what they are going to do, while we, a great British innovation, are already delivering it, having now served over 4bn meals since launching,” says Brennan. But the highly processed nature of Quorn and other plant “meats” may yet be a stumbling block. Britons have the worst diet in Europe. Earlier this month, it was reported that more than half of all food bought by families in the UK is “ultra-processed”: manufactured by opaque, hi-tech methods using industrial additives and food-derived component parts that are transformed from the whole ingredients familiar to home cooks. Quorn, in common with other fake meats, is incontestably ultra-processed. Evidently, this is not an issue for the animal welfare, vegetarian and vegan groups that hail such confections as a potential end to animal slaughter and the misery of factory farming. Some people will eat almost anything as long as no animals were involved in its creation. But that proposition appeals less to those who prefer to base their meals on natural, minimally processed ingredients that they can easily recognise as food. There is a yawning lifestyle gap between long-term vegans and vegetarians – many of whom feel happier in the whole-food shop than in supermarket ready-meal aisles – and fashionable, fickle “flexitarians” – the floating voters of the food world. Public suspicion of ultra-processed foods with inscrutable ingredients, brought to us by Big Food Inc, is running high in Britain and more of us are up for eating only food that we truly understand. That is a powerful sentiment with the potential to unite omnivore, vegetarian, and vegan alike. If you decide to serve Quorn to family and friends for dinner, expect a mixed reaction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/feb/12/napoli-show-finesse-and-fortitude-to-strengthen-scudetto-credentials","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T13:24:23Z","webTitle":"Napoli show finesse and fortitude to strengthen Scudetto credentials | Blair Newman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/feb/12/napoli-show-finesse-and-fortitude-to-strengthen-scudetto-credentials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/feb/12/napoli-show-finesse-and-fortitude-to-strengthen-scudetto-credentials","fields":{"headline":"Napoli show finesse and fortitude to strengthen Scudetto credentials","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Napoli went into their Saturday night meeting with Lazio under real pressure. For a club with a recent history of implosions, this did not bode well. The last time they were involved in a serious Scudetto push, in 2015-16, they self-destructed at Udinese. Defeat that day meant they ceded crucial ground to eventual champions Juventus. Almost two years on, a similarly fateful performance seemed to be on the cards. All the warning signs were there. Juve had taken top spot with a win over Fiorentina on Friday, meaning Napoli had to beat third-placed Lazio in order to reclaim the initiative. They proceeded to go 1-0 down within three minutes, before Maurizio Sarri was dismissed for dissent. Marek Hamsik’s pre-match reassurance that he and his team-mates were “accustomed to pressure” looked suspect. However, rather than imploding, this time Napoli showed the fortitude of genuine contenders. By the time Sarri had been instructed to leave the touchline, the Stadio San Paolo had been sent into raptures by a calm José Callejón finish. That equaliser, which came shortly before half-time after a long ball over the top and a well-timed Callejón run, essentially told the story of a tense opening 45 minutes. Lazio, copying a strategy Juventus and Inter both successfully deployed earlier this season, compressed the space between their defence and midfield. Their back five was positioned roughly halfway between the edge of their penalty area and the halfway line, while their midfield comprised two layers: Lucas Leiva and Marco Parolo operating behind Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Luis Alberto. This structure made it difficult for Napoli to play their usual high-speed, vertical passing game through the centre; even when they managed to penetrate Lazio’s midfield, their front three had little time on the ball once it reached them. Unable to go through their opposition, Napoli went over the top. They played more directly than usual, mostly aiming for the spaces between Lazio’s outer centre-backs and wing-backs. But, while one of these balls led to the equaliser, it also created a sense of unease. A team at times accused of playing too many passes were now skipping ahead in moves, attempting to exploit gaps in the Lazio defence that didn’t exist, and giving up control in the process. It’s anyone’s guess exactly what was said in the Napoli dressing room at half-time, but every player and staff member must have known the importance of that break. The way they approached the second half had the potential to define their campaign – either they would be paralysed by pressure or regain control of the contest, and the Scudetto race. Not long after the restart, their choice was clear. Napoli attacked with devastating simplicity, blowing Lazio away with sumptuous football. Sarri stated post-match that “the objective coming out for the second [half] was to pass the ball in our usual style.” That objective was achieved emphatically thanks to a higher tempo with and without possession. Napoli re-appeared a more compact outfit, with shorter distances between players enabling their customary quick passing. A beneficial side-effect was that it facilitated pressing immediately after losing possession. So, when Senad Lulic received the ball after a turnover inside his own half, he was instantly surrounded by three Napoli players and easily dispossessed. From there the ball was worked to Callejón, whose cross was diverted in by Lazio centre-back Wallace. Another tenet clearly reinforced by the home side at the break was: one touch is better than two. Lazio were left chasing shadows, and Napoli’s third came two minutes after their second. Mario Rui and Piotr Zielinski combined for the goal the latter deflecting in the former’s left-footed drive. Poor Lazio didn’t really deserve this. For the best part of an hour they had put forth a fine effort. Milinkovic-Savic, their star midfielder who combines the physique of a classically trained English centre-half with the poise and grace of a ballerina, had been at his roaming best. Stefan de Vrij, after scoring the opener, had defended imperiously. Ciro Immobile, Serie A’s top scorer, had made a number of dangerous runs. But they simply couldn’t get near their hosts at the start of the second period, and the shadow-chasing would only get worse. Napoli relaxed into their dominance, even, occasionally, flaunting it. At one point, Zielinksi, Rui and Lorenzo Insigne combined in a left-sided triangle around two despairing Lazio players. The intent was not to progress the attack, but to humiliate the opposition. In what was an act of footballing cruelty, they passed for the sake of passing. Their next piece of brilliant combination play proved more decisive. Jorginho won possession inside his own half and passed to Insigne. Insigne played it inside to Zielinski, who completed the triangle with a backheel to Jorginho, who accelerated forward and lofted a ball over the top for Zielinski to run on to. Zielinski took a couple of touches, performed a couple of step-overs, and then dinked the ball into the path of the onrushing Dries Mertens. The Belgian, as if attempting primarily not to ruin the delicate and precise nature of the move, rolled a whisper of a finish beyond Thomas Strakosha. With that, the game was over as a contest. Every now and then they would try to score another, such as when a move involving all but one of their 11 players and 37 consecutive passes led to another cheeky lob from Insigne. But Sarri’s side had already rammed home their point. Lorenzo Tonelli was the only Napoli player not involved in that 37-pass move, but his mere appearance on the pitch answered another important question regarding the team’s title credentials. The rugged centre-back, once considered one of the finest Italians in his position, hadn’t played since January. That he didn’t look out of place on his return challenged the notion that Napoli’s squad lacks depth, a notion further undermined by the integral performances of stand-in left-back Rui and substitute Zielinski. Sunday’s Italian sports dailies were united in praise of Napoli’s show of strength. Words such as “enchanting” and “festival” were used, though Tuttosport, who went with “unleashed”, best captured the general feeling. Napoli remain top and look increasingly capable of staying there. Talking points • Cengiz Under enjoyed his best game for Roma since joining last summer, playing a decisive role in the 5-2 win over Benevento. The 20-year-old set up Edin Dzeko before scoring twice, his second a beautiful curled effort.

Outgoing Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz, who last Friday surprised many by abandoning his ambition to become foreign minister, is set to hand over the party leadership on Tuesday to 47-year-old Andrea Nahles – the second-youngest person and first-ever female head in the 155-year history of the German centre-left. If Nahles, a former leader of the JuSos youth wing with a talent for powerful and at times brash political oratory, is installed at the helm of the SPD in a caretaker role, five out of six party groups in the German parliament will have female leaders. Germany’s most prominent female politician, meanwhile, is herself under pressure to reshuffle her party’s ageing personnel in coming weeks. In a TV interview on Sunday evening Angela Merkel vowed to stay on as chancellor for the full four-year term and defended herself against criticism for conceding the influential finance ministry to the Social Democrats. But Merkel also announced that she would confirm the names of new CDU ministers before a party summit on 26 February, and hinted that the provisional distribution of portfolios could be revised to pave a career path for her eventual successor. “Of course the list will draw from party’s entire spectrum,” Merkel told public broadcaster ZDF in the interview. “That includes youth and experience. We don’t want to consider only the over-60s.” Since reaching a coalition agreement with Schulz’s team last Wednesday, Merkel has faced increasingly vocal criticism from the ranks of a Christian Democratic Union previously famed for its message discipline. Former deputy finance minister Jens Spahn, a leading figure on the rightwing of the CDU, who was not included in a leaked list of designated future ministers, told Austrian newspaper Die Presse am Sonntag that he knew “plenty of good people” who could take over when the Merkel era came to an end. “We don’t live in a monarchy where you can arrange your own successor,” the 37-year-old said. “When the time comes, candidates will have to assert themselves.” CDU politician Roland Koch, a former premier for the state of Hesse, also appealed to Merkel to pave the way for a new generation of conservative politicians, naming Spahn and the more liberal-leaning Schleswig-Holstein state premier Daniel Günther as candidates. In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Koch openly questioned the longevity of the next government: “I don’t see or hear anyone voicing the hope that this coalition deal formulates a future-facing political agenda. It expresses the commonalities of two partners without a joint agenda.” Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats managed to reach a coalition agreement after the chancellor’s attempt to forge an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats and the Green party collapsed last December. The coalition deal has yet to be approved by the SPD’s approximately 460,000 members, whose verdict will be announced on 4 March. After the Social Democrats’ worst result in the postwar era at last September’s national poll, many members believe that the party should reinvent itself in opposition rather than seek a new term in government as Merkel’s junior coalition partner. There are also concerns that a renewed grand coalition could provide a further boost to the German far right, with rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland set to become the biggest opposition group in the next Bundestag. Unlike Merkel’s party, senior figures in the SPD want to hold off any further debate about the next cabinet’s personnel until after their membership vote. “For now we want to convince the SPD’s members to vote in favour of accepting the coalition agreement,” said Hamburg’s mayor, Olaf Scholz, who has been mooted as a contender for the finance ministry post."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/feb/13/venom-trailer-tom-hardy-sony-spider-man","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-13T09:26:47Z","webTitle":"Does Venom's weak trailer spell box-office ruin for the Spider-Man spin-off?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/13/venom-trailer-tom-hardy-sony-spider-man","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/feb/13/venom-trailer-tom-hardy-sony-spider-man","fields":{"headline":"Does Venom's weak trailer spell box-office ruin for the Spider-Man spin-off?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What’s the toughest job in film? Some might argue that actors face the most Sisyphean of tasks in Hollywood, doomed forever to give their all only for directors to leave their best work on the cutting room floor. Others might suggest that the work of the producer – forced to unite scores of competing egos in the vain hope that creative lightning will strike – is equally thankless. Yet spare a thought for the poor trailer maker. In recent years we’ve seen examples of movies that have triumphed at the box office almost entirely on the basis of snazzy advance publicity – here’s looking at you, Suicide Squad – and others that have had to be almost entirely reshot when fans failed to warm to their first glimpses of footage. Trailers now play a huge part in setting the tone for a project, which is why Sony ought to be quaking in its boots following the negative reaction to the first look at Tom Hardy in Venom. Likely rushed out to compete for YouTube likes with new trailers for Solo: A Star Wars Story and Deadpool 2, the teaser for the Spider-Man spin-off doesn’t at first glance seem all that controversial. Hardy is front and centre, making crazy faces and delivering a sombre voiceover, just as we’ve seen him do a dozen times before in arthouse fare. But perhaps that’s part of the problem. The British actor has carved a career out of playing offbeat, larger than life figures, from maniacal prisoner Charles Bronson in Nicolas Winding Refn’s Bronson to both Kray Twins in Brian Helgeland’s Legend. If you’re looking to cast an actor who can hold the camera’s gaze for two hours while delivering unwavering commitment to the part (with potential for the odd amusing segue into impenetrable broguery along the way), Hardy is the man for the job. Unfortunately, fans were more interested in finding out what the new big screen version of Venom looks like than charting the next stage in Hardy’s career-long mission to channel the most eccentric human beings on the planet. And, on that count, they were left profoundly disappointed. You can hardly blame Sony here, for there is little point in casting an actor as fiendishly determined to deliver the goods as Hardy if you aren’t prepared to let them do their thing. And yet the absence of much actual Venom – the alien symbiote that we know will eventually bond with Hardy’s Eddie Brock – has left fans wondering what the studio is so frightened of. A similar hullaballoo erupted recently with the debut of Solo’s Han Solo-less teaser trailer, which immediately led Star Wars acolytes to ponder why Disney hadn’t offered up a proper look at Alden Ehrenreich’s take on the wily space scoundrel. Fast forward a week and the release of the first trailer proper inevitably led those same fans to wish they were able to put Aldenreich-Solo back in his box, largely for being absolutely nothing like the beloved Harrison Ford take. Sony, of course, is facing a very different problem, in that its previous big screen incarnation of Venom was not beloved at all. In fact, the symbiote’s hamfisted inclusion in 2007’s Spider-Man 3 symbolised almost everything that was wrong with that film. The other problem with the teaser is that it failed to even hint at how Tom Holland’s Spider-Man might play his part in this story – we know it’s very likely he will, as part of the pact Sony made with Marvel to allow the wall-crawler to join the latter studio’s wildly successful cinematic universe in last year’s Spider-Man: Homecoming. Will Venom director Ruben Fleischer choose to avoid the symbiote’s comic-book origin story, which was borrowed almost wholesale for Spider-Man 3? If so, how will the wisecracking webslinger feature, given the loss of his natural place in the story as the first owner of the “alternate” spider-suit that turns out to be a devious alien creature, and later transfers its affections to Brock? Perhaps difficulties in including Holland, as well as the Spidey 3 debacle, explain why Sony has chosen to play so heavily on its signing of Hardy to the role, rather than feed fans’ affection for Venom itself. Yet this is a dangerous game to play, not least because it runs contrary to the very rubric that Sony is so desperate to mimic. For Marvel has triumphed largely due to its commitment to ensuring it is always the characters themselves, rather than the actors who inhabit the suit, who are the true stars of these pictures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/12/czech-phil-netopil-review-characteristic-warmth-and-vigour","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-12T13:27:07Z","webTitle":"Czech Phil/Netopil review – characteristic warmth and vigour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/12/czech-phil-netopil-review-characteristic-warmth-and-vigour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/12/czech-phil-netopil-review-characteristic-warmth-and-vigour","fields":{"headline":"Czech Phil/Netopil review – characteristic warmth and vigour","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For those who admired the musicianship of the late Jiří Bělohlávek, who had been scheduled to bring his Czech Philharmonic on their current UK and Ireland tour, this concert was tinged with sadness. But it was also tribute to Bělohlávek’s legacy that his pupil Tomáš Netopil – recently named the orchestra’s joint principal guest conductor with Jakub Hrůša – should uphold its characteristic warmth and vigour so confidently. Perhaps the biggest test of how Netopil matches up will come in the tour concerts featuring Smetana’s Má Vlast, but in the two works by Dvořák, his Symphonic Variations and the New World Ninth Symphony, he showed his mettle in dextrous control of rhythmic discipline and the give-and-take of rubato. Let’s not pretend the Symphonic Variations constitute a masterpiece. Yet this earnest demonstration of the composer’s orchestral palette pointed up the unusual expressive detail in the instrumentation of the Ninth, written 16 years later. In this, homeland nostalgia was implicit in woodwind timbre, notably the Largo’s cor anglais, even if Netopil’s overall approach was often unsentimental and brisk. The strings, muted and hushed, or gleaming as in the stirring finale, had the authentic Czech tone. Alisa Weilerstein was the soloist in Shostakovich’s First Cello Concerto. Her robust sound brought an insistent edge to the outer movements, yet it was in the solo cadenza – constituting the whole of the central third movement – that her tracing of its vast emotional span achieved a memorable intensity. • At Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, 12 February.

Since this government can’t govern, parliament must take charge of Brexit Conversation is still flowing under this piece from Andrew Rawnsley published over the weekend. ‘Parliament very definitely has a role to play in voting down a bad deal’ The alternative is no deal? No, the alternative is the threat of leaving with no deal. If parliament has the courage to vote down a bad deal and therefore makes real that threat, the impact in terms of a crashing pound and companies like Nissan cancelling plans to build their new models in Sunderland would rapidly lead to a clamour for a change in course. I suspect there will be a second referendum, or a desperate plea from the UK for an extension to the A50 deadline. Either way it will probably take a constitutional crisis and a collapsing Tory government. Parliament very definitely has a role to play in voting down a bad deal – it’s going to be a bumpy ride. eyebrow ‘The task now is to pick the least damaging crisis and aim for that’ The whole Brexit nonesense was sold to ordinary Brits on the basis that there are countries all over the world “queuing up to do trade deals” with us. If this turns out to be undeliverable, we must be looking at a huge crisis for the government. In fact I’m coming to the view that the task now is to pick the least damaging crisis and aim for that. What an utter shambles. MoreTeaVicar Is Facebook for old people? Over-55s flock in as the young leave A new study into Facebook’s millions of users suggests 700,000 UK teenagers and young adults will leave the social media site in 2018, while 500,000 new over-55s are expected to join. You’ve been discussing this changing demographic. ‘We oldies have a right to an online space that suits the way we use the internet’ I seriously don’t get why the demographic change to the age of Facebook users is any sort of “problem” at all. Older folk like myself like that it encompasses ideas and content that is not just selfies and cat pictures and that its a great medium for keeping in contact with family and friends. Young people intent on self promotion or seeking sex partners may well go to other platforms for such ephemeral content, and good luck too them, but we oldies have a right to an online space that suits the way we like to use the internet – if Facebook fits the bill then its creators should be thankful instead of eternally complaining about it. baselinebob ‘The Guardian comments section is where it’s really going on’ I said this a while ago, but Facebook is not the social media powerhouse people think it is. The kids thinks it’s deeply uncool, the 25-45s use it to organise events and the over 50s use it as an online photo album. Of course there’s the FB denizens who post their every move, but it’s just not cool. Twitter has come of age, and Snap/Insta/WA does the rest. The Guardian comments section is, naturally, where it’s really going on. Isambardkingdom Profiteers make a killing on Airbnb – and erode communities John Harris has written about the room-sharing platform’s impact on the places its users offer stays. Here’s some of your reaction to the story: ‘How about banning all such companies and all such advertising?’ I was sitting on the Tube this morning and there was an advert above the map of the Northern line for a new company that will manage short lets for landlords. The text of the advert was, basically, that yields from long-term lets are falling, there’s too much regulation and tax now, so kick out your tenants or make them pay you by the week, because the short lets business is unregulated and you can get away with fleecing anyone. How about banning all such companies and all such advertising? There’s so much of it in London, a city where hundreds of thousands of people are already struggling, and don’t want to hear about poor landlords now being unable to earn £100,000 a year tax-free. jae426 ‘[Customers] would be up in arms if government actually implemented solutions proposed’ Haven’t holiday rentals been around for years, though?

With regards to regulation, it’s a tricky one – I imagine the mostly young, metropolitan crowd that make up most of Airbnb’s customers will ostensibly agree with much of the article’s points in a vague, social media-leftism sort of way, but will be up in arms if the government actually attempts to implement the solutions proposed.

Terrorists come and go: who could tell a Bibi Hamed from a Saad Massoud in the long game? But inconsistency remains. So as the show resumes later this month, when you look at it across six seasons, is Homeland actually any good? The question has never quite been resolved. Until now. Six seasons, one metric. Goodness. Season one UPSIDE What’s striking now about Homeland’s debut is how slow it is. Rather than what it became – a frantic hail of bullets falling amid a fog of sarin gas – this is a psychological turn about the alienation of a returning PoW. DOWNSIDE A climax that’s a touch random. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) attempts to turn the vice president into strawberry jam with his suicide vest, before mammalian evolutionary programming saves the day, via a last-minute phone call from his teenage daughter – as if The Godfather climaxed with the Monty Python foot coming down on Michael Corleone. Verdict: 57% good Season two UPSIDE A smooth tension between plot and action. For instance, hapless killing machine Brody nips out to stab his bomb-suit tailor in the woods while still on the phone to his wife. In the pivotal interrogation scene, dark arts master Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend) stabs Brody in the hand. DOWNSIDE The love arc. The grindingly inevitable grinding scene. The closer the pair get, the more you realise they are both ghastly narcissists who should get the chair just on a precautionary principle. Verdict: 57% good Season three UPSIDE The blood is up, the gore is coming thick and fast. Opens promisingly with Quinn killing a child instead of the Langley bombing mastermind. This horror is quickly superseded when new baddie General Akbari (Houshang Touzi) bashes his ex-wife’s throat with a broken bottle. We are introduced to F Murray Abraham’s deliciously amoral Dar Adal, and, in one of TV’s greatest public hanging love stories, Brody is sentenced to death in Tehran, as a pregnant Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) does her best wobbly-face. DOWNSIDE Iranians? Nukes? The sense of a knock-off 24 is starting to grate, and suddenly we are a long way from the pathos of a returning PoW. Brody is packed off to Iran to do some Seal stuff not long after he has been held hostage for a second time, because he is definitely not volatile or anything. Meanwhile, the scriptwriters have doltishly placed Carrie in Iran like a Sim, where she idles uselessly until her big hanging scene. Verdict: 12% good Season four UPSIDE As an exporation of the tribal zones between Afghanistan and Pakistan, season four sheds light on one of the most knotty and underlit corners of US foreign policy. DOWNSIDE The internal logic of every character is now visibly flaking. New mum Carrie does what most new mums do when they go back to work – eases herself back with a posting as a CIA bureau chief in Kabul. Saul Berenson ( Mandy Patinkin) turns up in Islamabad to help Carrie, but, as a highly experienced CIA veteran, is immediately captured by a band of terrorist yahoos. He ends up as part of a humiliating prisoner exchange, which he theatrically flounces out on, only to be saved by a stale Hollywood pep talk about believing in yourself. Verdict: 16% bad Season five UPSIDE Given that it was released in September 2015, season five’s theme of Isis attacks in Europe would become sickeningly relevant by the year’s end. Berlin provides a refreshing series base after such a sustained period of sand and muezzin wails. Plus, the incidental characters – from Russian double-agent Allison Carr (Miranda Otto) to enigmatic billionare Otto Düring (Sebastian Koch) – are subtly played, grownup. DOWNSIDE A series in which Quinn is executed in the terrorist gas chamber, before being revived with the injection of an antidote is never going to be overly sensible. And, in that vein, the final cliffhanger over his mortality has hammy airs of Who Shot JR? Verdict: 42% bad Season six UPSIDE This was the first season in which Danes wasn’t nominated for an Emmy. But it wasn’t for lack of pouting. The unravelling and long-awaited death of Quinn in a hail of bullets gives the series somewhere to go. DOWNSIDE In the annals of Dewey Defeats Truman, season six’s decision to cast a president clearly based on Hillary Clinton, and set itself between election day and inauguration day was quite a gaffe. Still, you work with what you have, and, here, what you have is a sprawling, often dreary plot about domestic terror, with lashings of presidential assassination that uncannily, some would say lazily, echo the Brody era. Verdict: 43% bad The result The final score – arrived at by a method as scientific as any CIA lab full of spinning DNA helixes matching on computers – is thus 126% good and 101% bad. If you exclude the first two seasons, the score for good falls to 12%. Can a seventh season about redneck militias stoking revolution change that? We are several garrottings and much wonkish realpolitik dialogue from finding out.

A candidate due to finish in a couple of months warned me emphatically: “It makes or breaks careers.” In my innocence, I didn’t think much about it and returned to concentrating on my research. A decade later, metrics such as these came to dominate my work and ultimately drove me to give up my permanent academic post and move into industry. Since leaving academia, I have found myself wondering about the effect of these metrics on the profession and practice of science. There is a well-known anecdote about British rule in India. In Delhi, officials were concerned that there were too many cobras. To reduce their population, people were paid for each cobra killed. When the administrators found out that some people had started to breed cobras to kill them and collect the reward, they stopped the scheme. The farmed cobras were set free, causing the population to explode. This is the so-called cobra effect, which describes how incentives in complex systems can have unintended consequences which exacerbate the problem they were trying to solve. Academia is a highly incentivised game, and there are great rewards for playing it well: comfortable salaries for those at the top, guaranteed employment for those in the faculty, high-profile appointments, press coverage, shiny medals named after dead scientists and opulent robes to dress up in at graduation. In other words: money, fame and prestige. There are many good scientists who are driven by the desire to produce meaningful work. But I have also witnessed many who are driven mostly by accolades. Unfortunately, they tend to be in positions of immense power. They are relatively easy to spot as they seldom speak about their research, only about the politics and strategy of research. They will discuss at great length the ins and outs of performance targets such as impact factor, grant income, invited talks, numbers of research students, editorial positions, board memberships and awards. In many institutions I have worked at, this thinking has won the day, and ticking boxes was strongly emphasised above everything else. For myself and others, it was made clear that, if we wanted to stay or progress, our sole focus had to be on collecting accolades at all costs. I think we came to this as a result of the Research Excellence Framework and now the Teaching Excellence Framework. The way these assessment exercises work means that university administrators are increasingly looking to metrics and key performance indicators to compare and be compared against other institutions, and ultimately to secure funding. But this KPI culture creates a moral danger for the sciences. Their first duty should be clear, objective elucidation of the facts. The effect is easy to see in academic publishing: I have seen co-authors linguistically puff up articles to get them published in prestigious journals, I have reviewed articles that have clearly been inflated, and I have steered research programmes on the basis that a new direction would be easier to publish in high-impact journals. This ultimately leads to showboat science that under-investigates less eye-catching – but ultimately more useful – areas. The hope is that, with peer review and a culture of professionalism in the sciences, the system is sufficiently self-correcting to inhibit the propagation of outright errors. I don’t believe this is enough. Many areas of research are so complex that it is difficult and time-consuming to verify or repeat results and – crucially – researchers are discouraged from doing so since it would not have sufficient impact. I worry that the KPI-driven impact culture increasingly means that careful, meticulous and incremental science is anathema in the academy, especially for those at the early stages of their careers. There are many who are so attracted by the prospect of success that they are willing to obfuscate, mystify and perhaps falsify research to game the system and reap the plentiful rewards. Most of all, I worry that instead of working towards an enlightened future, many are simply selling farmed cobras and calling it progress.

This was underlined on Monday by the declaration of a 15-day state of emergency. The contradictions hardly end there – the Maldives successfully trades as one of the world’s most romantic tourism hotspots, while simultaneously maintaining the punishment of flogging for the crime of extramarital sex. A honeymooners’ paradise, it also boasts the world’s highest divorce rate – by a factor of two. A million visitors flood its white sandy beaches every year (half of them European), while in the other direction, Maldives has likely contributed more fighters to Syria and Iraq on a per-capita basis than any other country not directly engaged in the conflict. The political situation has been tumultuous ever since the country’s autocratic leader of 30 years, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, lost free and fair elections in 2008 to a former political prisoner, Mohamed Nasheed. Liberal and progressive, many of Nasheed’s reforms would be thwarted by the intervention of an “independent” judiciary still loyal to Gayoom. Branded by Gayoom’s opposition as anti-Islamic and accused of meddling in judicial affairs, Nasheed was forced to resign amid a coup in February 2012. The supreme court repeatedly overturned the results of the 2013 elections at the regime’s behest, and Gayoom’s half-brother, Abdulla Yameen, was eventually declared president. Nasheed was thrown in prison, and grudgingly released into exile only following the intervention of human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. President Yameen has ruled with an authoritarian streak, and was accused of corruption, thuggery and international money laundering in an explosive al-Jazeera documentary, Stealing Paradise. All senior opposition figures have been jailed or forced into exile, joined by a stream of Yameen’s allies, accused of treason, corruption and myriad assassination plots. Islamic radicalism has thrived amid the government’s ambivalence, if not outright complicity. Foreign reporters have been barred from entering the country, while local journalists have disappeared or been murdered. Well-known local satirist Yameen Rasheed, the Maldives’ answer to Jon Stewart, was stabbed to death outside his door in April 2017. “I’m not particularly afraid of death … But I’d always wanted nature to get me. Not some idiot mullah foot-soldier with a knife,” he wrote, shortly before his murder. Until the supreme court’s sudden change in loyalty on Friday, the situation in the Maldives looked hopeless. Declaring its own prosecutors and judges “unduly influenced”, the court ordered release and retrials of nine of President Yameen’s most grievous adversaries. Those freed included Gayoom’s son, MP Faris Maumoon, former defence minister Mohamed Nazim (who took part in the 2012 coup against Nasheed), and former tourism minister Ahmed Adeeb, accused of plotting to blow up the presidential yacht and involvement in money laundering of $1.5bn. “It is slightly farcical,” one Maldives-based journalist said of the court’s abrupt decision, requesting anonymity for fear of deportation. “It’s like being paid to throw a football match. You’ve got to make it look realistic. You don’t just turn 180 degrees and blast the ball past your own keeper.” So integral are the courts to controlling the Maldives that Yameen reacted on Monday by sacking the police commissioner and declaring the 15-day state of emergency. The military stormed the supreme court building and took several judges into custody, including the chief justice. Gayoom and members of his family were also arrested. The situation is precarious. Gayoom still commands significant loyalty in the security forces – bizarrely, one of the arresting officers was filmed saluting the former dictator as he was taken into custody. Protesters are travelling to the capital from the outer islands to be tear-gassed while international actors, including the US, UK and India, have rounded on Yameen while pumping out travel advisories. The autocrat’s situation is now unsustainable, with both the tourism economy and stomach of the security forces unlikely to withstand the severe crackdown needed to end the stalemate. Early elections, already scheduled for later this year, seem the most likely next step for regaining a semblance of national legitimacy. However, Yameen has no incentive to hold these, having alienated or imprisoned the majority of his former allies, and possessing little democratic support base of his own. Mohamed Nasheed’s party retains the single largest voting majority, despite the odd alliance he has now formed with Gayoom – his long-time jailor and arch-nemesis. Ultimately the ongoing telenovela of Maldivian political intrigue is a distraction from the real crisis – the illegitimacy of the judiciary. Handpicked by Gayoom during his rule and illegally given life tenure under the new constitution in 2010, the judges have been at the centre of most of the Maldives’ recent ills; at least 50% of the 200-odd judges and magistrates have less than seventh-grade education, while a quarter had actual criminal records, including convictions for sexual misconduct, embezzlement, violence and disruption of public harmony. Resoundingly discredited by groups such as the International Committee of Jurists and the UN’s special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the institution demands wholesale reform, and likely the presence of foreign judges on the bench. However excited the opposition at their recent good fortune, current events are far from a triumph of judicial independence. • JJ Robinson is the author of Maldives: Islamic Republic, Tropical Autocracy.

Many parents feel acutely anxious, stressed and out of control when their child is in a newborn intensive care unit and there seems to be nothing they can do for her. Inspired by the example of a hospital in Estonia that brings in parents to help with basic care of their baby, doctors in Canada organised a major study in three countries – Canada, Australia and New Zealand – to see what the effect is on the baby. In their paper in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal, they say that feeling excluded in the premature baby unit could have long-term consequences for the parents. “These feelings of helplessness, anxiety, depression, and fear might contribute to their inability to assume normal parenting roles,” they write. The study involved 26 hospitals and nearly 1,800 babies, half of whom had basic care from their parents alongside the nursing staff, while the other half did not. Parents had to commit to spending six hours a day, five days a week, in the unit and were trained to help. They bathed, fed and dressed their babies, changed nappies, gave oral medication and took temperatures. They were encouraged to take part in decisions about the baby’s treatment, join ward rounds and chart their infant’s growth and progress. The babies on what was called FiCare – family integrated care – had put on more weight by 21 days, their parents were less stressed and once the baby went home, the mothers were more likely to breastfeed frequently than mothers who had been less involved in the hospital. “How care is provided to the family, not just the infant, has a positive effect on the wellbeing of both infant and family,” says Dr Karel O’Brien, of the department of paediatrics, Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada. “Weight gain, breastfeeding and reduced parental stress and anxiety are all associated with positive neurodevelopmental outcomes, suggesting that integrating parents into the care of infants at this early stage could potentially have longer-term benefits.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/07/redrow-chief-huge-persimmon-bonuses-very-very-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T18:39:23Z","webTitle":"Redrow chief: huge Persimmon bonuses ‘very, very wrong’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/07/redrow-chief-huge-persimmon-bonuses-very-very-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/07/redrow-chief-huge-persimmon-bonuses-very-very-wrong","fields":{"headline":"Redrow chief: huge Persimmon bonuses ‘very, very wrong’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The boss of housebuilder Redrow has described a £110m bonus being paid to the boss of rival Persimmon as “very, very wrong”. Steve Morgan, the self-made multimillionaire founder of Redrow, said property industry bosses were “peed off” with the vast amount of money being handed to Persimmon CEO Jeff Fairburn. Politicians, campaigners and City experts have described the vast payout as “obscene” and “corporate looting”. Morgan, who holds a £750m stake in Redrow, which he founded in the 70s, said the largesse at York-based Persimmon was “doing the whole of the industry a complete disservice”. “One company has got it very, very wrong. Everybody in the industry is as peed off with this Persimmon thing as the people outside it,” Morgan told the Evening Standard. “For somebody who has not taken a salary for 20 years, it sticks in the craw, being called a greedy housebuilder because of that one company. I’m sick to the teeth of seeing the headlines of greedy housebuilders.” Morgan’s comments came as Redrow announced a 26% jump in half-year pretax profits to £176m, and rewarded shareholders by increasing its interim dividend by 50% to 9p a share. The dividend increase will pay Morgan, who owns 32.5% of the company, just over £11m. Morgan, who used to own Wolverhampton Wanderers, has a net worth of £831m according to the Sunday Times rich list. The rich list compiler said Morgan would have been a new entry to the UK’s billionaires club, but has donated £226m worth of Redrow shares to charity. He also donates his annual salary to his Morgan Foundation charity, which helps disabled or disadvantaged people in north Wales and the north-west of England. The Persimmon bonus scheme is believed to be Britain’s most generous corporate payout ever and will hand more than £500m to 150 staff this year. Around 80 workers will get more than £1m. Morgan said it would never have happened if he were in charge, as he would have capped the maximum payout. Persimmon’s chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, and remuneration committee chairman, Jonathan Davie, resigned in December after acknowledging that they should have capped the maximum bonus. Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the “scale of this bonus is obscene” and built on a “government subsidy”, as housebuilders’ strong stock market performance has been fuelled by the help-to-buy scheme. Garry White, the chief investment commentator at the stockbroker Charles Stanley, said: “The size of the [Persimmon] bonuses means management could easily be accused of corporate looting, so shareholders have every right to be unimpressed.” Persimmon’s shareholders, including Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), have called on Fairburn to consider “taking a voluntary reduction, or donating some of the money”. The majority of shareholders, however, supported the scheme when it was set up. Fairburn has refused to hand back any of his award, saying he deserves the full payment – which is more than enough to end homelessness in York – because he “worked very hard”. Fairburn, 51, has refused to state whether he will donate any of the award to charity. “I consider my plans for any charitable giving to be a private matter and I do not wish to comment any further on that,” he said last month. “You’ve got to put this into context of what has been achieved. I do fully accept that the potential payouts under the scheme for top individuals are very significant.” Fairburn has already received part of his payout and will qualify for the remaining £60m worth of bonus shares, which are linked to the firm’s dividend payments, this summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/07/ian-bone-idol-shard-provocateur-anarchist-protester-qatari-royals","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T16:23:11Z","webTitle":"Bone idol: the Shard provocateur is my kind of anarchist | Suzanne Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/07/ian-bone-idol-shard-provocateur-anarchist-protester-qatari-royals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/07/ian-bone-idol-shard-provocateur-anarchist-protester-qatari-royals","fields":{"headline":"Bone idol: the Shard provocateur is my kind of anarchist","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This week the Qatari royal family is taking a pensioner who walks with a stick to court to stop him protesting outside the Shard. The Shard is owned by this family via funds held in Jersey. They also own Harrods, the Olympic village and half of One Hyde Park. They reportedly own more property in London than our own royal family. At the top of the Shard are 10 flats with the price tag of £50m each, and they are currently empty. This is partly what has upset the protester, who lives on his pension of £154.56 a week. The Qatar royals are taking him and “persons unknown” to the high court on Thursday and also asking him to pay costs. He was served with an injunction because of his intention to protest. He had encouraged supporters to “ask at the door to see the £50m flats”, or “make a reservation at one of the Shard restaurants and ask if you can bring your own food”. If any made it inside he suggested shouting about the injustices and the empty flats. And Grenfell. “We also want musicians to come down and play, sing, dance, rant,” he said. “Need yer own amps.” He, however, needs no amps. For the pensioner is Ian Bone of Class War who has been protesting about gentrification and social cleansing since the 80s. I adore the man. To me he is the best tabloid journalist this country has ever produced. Provocative, hilarious, scathing. His Class War slogans are full of bile and bite and angrily brilliant. Described by actual tabloids at times as a dangerous insurrectionary, Bone is full of life and fun, someone who monsters the pieties of the left and simply refuses to play any game that involves subservience to the right. The injunction that was served against him contains a statement about him from the Shard’s head of security who had contacted the Metropolitan police. They are worried about the inherent security flaws of the Shard but they are clearly more worried about Bone and his anarchy. He is described in the statement as “belligerent and uncooperative when interacting with persons of authority, such as police officers and security officers”. Amazing investigative work there! Who would have thought that the founder of Class War was a little awkward? Bone has since pointed out that he has never hit anyone with his stick and has Parkinson’s. Bone’s real stick is his words. His attitude. His joy at pointing to obvious wrongs and asking us which side we are on. “I hate dull lefties,” he tells me. “All the miserabilism.” He likes action and shock. And swearing. I loved all those posters that appalled all those who like to be appalled. “Eat the rich.” The one of Diana and Charles with baby William and “Another Fucking Royal Parasite”. He doesn’t do deference or respect. The banners on marches that referred to the Socialist Workers as Social Wankers. Bone’s stance has always been about having a laugh along the way to smashing it all up. His father was a butler. His family grew up “in service”. “So I grew up bitter and resentful with a chip on my shoulder,” he tells me gleefully. When he was 15 he wrote off to an address that he found in Punch to find out more about anarchism. “I believed in chaos,” he said. “I then panicked for weeks. I though they might send round a bearded person.” Since then, of course, he has realised that anarchists are just not that efficient. Underneath all the sloganeering though, Bone has been protesting about social cleansing all his life. He lived in Grenfell for two years. He knew people who were in the fire. He led “poor doors” protests in the East End in 2014. “If you grow up like I did, that gets you. The tradesman’s entrance.” He saw the developing ghost towers but he sees the working class being squeezed out everywhere. “Who wants another coffee shop or prep school?” he asks of Ladbroke Grove. Now that social housing is very much on the agenda, Bone as usual doesn’t want anything to do with Labour. He doesn’t see Corbyn as different to any other Labour leader. Everything for him is about people taking over and running things for themselves. Whether this means inciting people to march on Boris Johnson’s house or setting up the South Norwood Tourist Board, Bone is a provocateur, incredibly funny and mostly right. If all this pardoning of suffragettes’ civil disobedience by the political class made you feel as nauseous as it did me, Bone is the antidote. If you value politeness and respectability then Class War may not be for you. But on Thursday, I want this anarchist grandad to shake his stick at those Qatari billionaires. He wants, as always, to “push things further”. We should help him. All power to the inimitable Mr Bone. • Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/08/home-state-economy-austerity-family-life-social-care","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T06:00:28Z","webTitle":"What goes on in the home is the business of the state.

Here’s why","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When it comes to family, where does love stop and duty begin? Sometimes that’s easily answered: evolutionary instinct moulds a parent’s love for their children into something fierce and uncomplicated. Broaden out the focus to siblings, adult children, ageing parents, aunts and uncles, and the answer is less straightforward. Britain’s more individualistic approach to family is often contrasted with family cultures in southern Europe. There, young people tend to leave the parental home later, and it is much more common to find three or even four generations of the same family living under the one roof. But as the UK’s housing crisis has given way to a “boomerang generation” of young people in their 20s still living at home, and as the shrinking amount of state funding for older care leaves more families to fend for themselves, there are signs that we might be starting to embrace a more Mediterranean approach to family life. The question we’re not asking is: at what cost? Britain’s cultural approach to family has long been reinforced by its economy and its education system. In Victorian Britain, working-class young people left home in their early teens to enter domestic service, at one point the country’s biggest source of jobs. Half a century ago, baby boomers came of age in a world of cheap housing and plentiful jobs, which eased their route to independence. The number of young people going to university, many of them moving away from home, has ballooned from just 2% immediately after the second world war to over 40% today. At the other end of the lifespan, as people live longer – though often with protracted spells of poor health – we’ve developed a professional care sector so that adult children don’t have to give up work to look after ageing parents. By contrast, in countries such as Japan and Italy, where there is a greater expectation that families will step up, there has been less reliance on professional care: across much of Italy, fewer than one in 50 over-85s live in a care home, compared with one in six in the UK. But we’ve now reached the point where our cultural preferences for generational separation are being tested, rather than shored up, by economic realities. That generous baby-boomer deal is a thing of the past: one in five 25- to 29-year-olds now live with their parents. The eye-watering costs of childcare mean more parents are relying on grandparents helping out to enable them to go back to work. And the rising cost of elderly care means those who need it are often reluctant to fork out. Rather than dip into the value of their house to pay, they would prefer to pass the property on to their children. These financial shifts are being compounded by government policy. The tripling of tuition fees and the axing of maintenance grants have loaded further debt on to young graduates. Last year the government revived its plans to scrap support for the housing costs of low-income 18- to 21-year-olds. Cuts to social care have implicitly shifted the balance of responsibility for looking after ageing parents, and ministers have explicitly said families must pitch in more. The relationship between government policy and family life has always been sensitive. The notion that what goes on in the home is no business of the state has been fiercely guarded by the Conservatives. But the reality is, of course, that no such distinction exists. Day in, day out, government policy profoundly affects family life. The left has long seen social policy as a lever to level up, so that the benefits some get through their family don’t, as far as possible, operate to the detriment of others. For instance, one of the key thrusts of progressive education policy in recent decades has been to try to counter the fact that by the age of five, children from poor families will have heard 30 million fewer words than children from wealthier backgrounds. A state that is far too cautious about tackling the housing crisis, and that pulls back from providing financial support for young adults and care for older people, produces grim outcomes for those whose families cannot, or will not, bail them out. And much of this is happening by stealth, without any public debate about the profound consequences. Perhaps we think parents should do more for their adult children; perhaps we think it does come down to us to pick up more of the slack in caring for ageing parents. Perhaps we think it’s OK that a woman on an average income can’t afford to go back to work after having a baby unless she can rely on the child’s grandparents. But were we to enthusiastically embrace this worldview, there would be huge ramifications, not just for people’s lifestyles but for social inequality, people’s quality of life towards the end of their years, and – save nothing short of a gender revolution – for women’s role in the labour market. A member of the boomerang generation might find it frustrating living with parents near a city rich in jobs. But for those whose parents don’t have a spare room within commuting distance, getting a job with decent prospects might be nigh-on impossible. And it’s easy for politicians, despite the rising numbers of older people with conditions such as advanced dementia that require specialist care, to implore people to provide more care for their ageing parents – perhaps with countries such as Japan in mind. But Japan has had its own problems: a growing number of resentful relatives abusing the older people they felt forced to care for prompted its government to set up a new social care scheme back in 2000. If we were to carry on rolling back state-funded care in Britain, it would inevitably be women who’d feel obliged to give up work to care for older relatives, storing up financial problems for their own old age. Some ageing people without family members willing to care for them would simply fall through the cracks. Even those whose families could do this might find themselves physically taken care of but with their emotional health suffering as relationships break down under the strain. Duty might kick in, but we would be kidding ourselves if we thought we could reverse-engineer the evolutionary urge to make huge sacrifices for our children. That’s not to say that it’s not lovely when some opt for a more multi-generational family life. But it should be an active choice. Structuring the state in a way that forces people to embrace a Mediterranean approach is wrong. We can’t answer the question of how big we want the state to be without asking how much our families should feel obliged to do for us – and how much we care about the potential price in terms of growing social and gender inequality. • Sonia Sodha is the chief leader writer at the Observer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/07/donald-trump-says-stock-market-is-making-a-big-mistake-after-drop","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T15:32:12Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump says stock market is making a 'big mistake' after drop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/07/donald-trump-says-stock-market-is-making-a-big-mistake-after-drop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/07/donald-trump-says-stock-market-is-making-a-big-mistake-after-drop","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump says stock market is making a 'big mistake' after drop","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The stock market is making a “big mistake”, Donald Trump said on Thursday, days after a record-breaking sell-off on the US exchanges. “In the ‘old days,’ when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up.

Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!” Trump wrote on Twitter in his first public comment on the sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,175 points on Monday following another sharp fall last Friday. The drop appears to have been triggered by news of stronger than expected growth in wages, which fueled expectations of a higher rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Commenting on the markets on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the US economy was “incredibly strong” and “nothing that’s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that’s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago”. Since his election, US – and global – stock markets have hit record highs. Trump has consistently pointed to rising stock markets as proof his economic policies are working. While his corporate tax cuts and push for deregulation have pushed share prices higher, US markets have been on a record-breaking streak for nine years and have risen in large part thanks to economic strength around the world and unprecedentedly low interest rates.

Researchers are investigating whether a change in diet could help patients with breast tumours after studies in mice showed that asparagine, a compound first identified in asparagus but present in many other foods, drives the spread of the disease to other organs. When scientists reduced asparagine in animals with breast cancer, they found that the number of secondary tumours in other tissues fell dramatically. The spread of malignant cells, often to the bones, lungs and brain, is the main cause of death among patients who are diagnosed with breast cancer. “This is a very promising lead and one of the very few instances where there is a scientific rationale for a dietary modification influencing cancer,” said lead scientist Prof Greg Hannon, director of the Cancer Research UK Cancer Institute in Cambridge. Asparagine is an amino acid that is made naturally in the body as a building block for proteins. But it is also found in the diet, and in high levels in certain meats, vegetables and dairy products. The international team of cancer specialists from Britain, the US, and Canada studied mice with an aggressive form of breast cancer. The mice develop secondary tumours in a matter of weeks and tend to die from the disease within months. Writing in the journal Nature, the researchers describe how they reduced the ability of breast cancer to spread in the animals by blocking asparagine with a drug called L-asparaginase. To a lesser extent, by putting the animals on a low-asparagine diet worked too. Inspired by the results, the scientists examined records from human cancers and found that breast tumours that churned out the most asparagine were most likely to spread, leading patients to die sooner. The same was seen in cancers of the head, neck and kidney. Asparagine appears to help cancer cells change into a form that easily spreads from the breast, through the bloodstream, to other organs where they grow into secondary tumours, Hannon said. While suppressing levels of asparagine reduced the spread of breast cancer around the body, it did nothing to prevent breast tumours forming in the first place. If the findings hold in humans, breast cancer patients may be put on low asparagine diets while they have conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy, for the disease. But because asparagine is so ubiquitous in food, drugs that target the amino acid may be more effective. L-asparaginase breaks the amino acid down in the bloodstream, but more targeted drugs could block its production altogether. “This is one case where we can show at a deep biochemical level how a change in diet can impact properties of cells that are relevant to the progression of lethal disease,” said Hannon. “But of course, until human studies are done, this isn’t a DIY method to prevent cancer.” Prof Keqiang Ye, a cancer researcher at Emory University in Atlanta, said that lowering asparagine levels, either with drugs or dietary restriction, would help prevent cancer cells from spreading. But for patients, he said that drug treatments held more promise than changes to their diets. “Asparagine is frequently found in various animal sources including beef, poultry, eggs, fish and seafood. It is also found in many vegetables including asparagus, potatoes, nuts, legumes and soy. Since these foods are so common, it seems that diet restriction may not be the ideal approach,” Ye said. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said: “This early discovery could offer a long-awaited new way to help stop breast cancer spreading – but we first need to understand the true role of this nutrient in patients. With nearly 11,500 women still dying from breast cancer each year in the UK, we urgently need to stop the disease spreading around the body, where it becomes incurable. “On current evidence, we don’t recommend patients totally exclude any specific food group from their diet without speaking to their doctors. We’d also encourage all patients to follow a healthy and varied diet – rich in fruit, vegetables and pulses, and limited in processed meat and high fat or sugar foods – to help give them the best chance of survival.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/07/british-group-wins-right-to-take-brexit-case-to-european-court","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T15:27:42Z","webTitle":"British group wins right to take Brexit case to European court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/07/british-group-wins-right-to-take-brexit-case-to-european-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/07/british-group-wins-right-to-take-brexit-case-to-european-court","fields":{"headline":"British group wins right to take Brexit case to European court","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"British citizens seeking to retain their EU citizenship rights after Brexit have won a landmark legal ruling that will result in their case being heard in the European court of justice. Five British nationals settled in the Netherlands had asked the court in Amsterdam to refer their case to the ECJ last month on the grounds that their existing rights could not be removed because of the UK referendum to leave the EU. The judge ruled on Wednesday that the case could be referred. A spokesman for Brexpats – Hear Our Voice, which led the challenge, said: “We are grateful to the court and obviously delighted with the decision. However, this is just the first step in clarifying what Brexit could mean for our EU citizenship. “This case has always been about seeking clarification, not only for the 46,000 Brits living in the Netherlands, but also for all the 1.2 million Brits living in other EU countries. “As has been demonstrated in recent days, what Brexit means is still extremely unclear. You cannot play with the lives of 1.2 million people as if they are pieces on a chessboard.” The lobby group, the five Britons and the Commercial Anglo Dutch Society were the named claimants in the case that was funded and supported by Jolyon Maugham, the QC behind a series of Brexit legal challenges in Britain. The judge will issue two draft questions to be put before the ECJ within the next two weeks. The first question asks the ECJ panel of judges to determine whether Brexit means British nationals will automatically lose their EU citizenship and all the rights that flow from that, including freedom of movement. If the answer to that question is no, then the ECJ judges are asked to determine what, if any, conditions or limitations should apply to the maintenance of those rights once Britain leaves the EU. Floris Bakels, a judge at Amsterdam district court, said in his ruling that the rights of minorities should not be prejudiced by a referendum under the law. “The essence of a democratic constitutional state is that the rights and interests of minorities are protected as much as possible,” he added. The applicants’ lawyer, Christiaan Alberdingk Thijm, had argued that the Lisbon treaty gave British nationals the right to retain EU citizenship after Brexit because it stated, in article 20, that “citizenship of the union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship”. Thijm said: “This is a great victory because the questions are very important questions about the interpretation of law around EU citizenship. The judge is a former supreme court judge, so the arguments about the Lisbon treaty were followed by the judge. We need brave judges who are confident to refer questions like this to the ECJ.” Maugham said that the outcome of the case would be “profoundly important” for British people living in the EU. He said he was heartened by the attitude of the Dutch court. “The UK courts seem to find themselves cowed by the political dynamic,” he said. “I’m very pleased that judges elsewhere are able to separate out political and legal considerations.” Barristers for the authorities had argued there could not be a referral to the ECJ because there had been no dispute in a lower court. They also argued that the Brexpats were not a legally definable group and that there could not be a referral to the ECJ simply because someone asked for one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/07/video-assistant-referee-var-aves-boavista-giant-flag-goal-offside","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T15:06:03Z","webTitle":"VAR and the giant flag: how a match in Portugal became the scene of farce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/07/video-assistant-referee-var-aves-boavista-giant-flag-goal-offside","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/07/video-assistant-referee-var-aves-boavista-giant-flag-goal-offside","fields":{"headline":"VAR and the giant flag: how a match in Portugal became the scene of farce","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A match in Portugal’s Primeira Liga became the scene of a farcical incident involving a video assistant referee, a goal from a corner and a giant flag. Aves beat Boavista 3-0 on Tuesday and it was their third goal which was the centre of the controversy. Vítor Gomes scored from close range after reacting to a 70th-minute set-piece, but the midfielder appeared to be in an offside position when he struck. Because of that, the VAR – which is being trialled in Portugal’s top flight this season – was asked to review the incident. But he had difficulty doing so because a Boavista fan located in the away end was blocking the necessary camera with his flag. As a result of not having sufficient evidence to rule out the goal, the referee had no choice but to stick with his original decision. Thankfully for the Boavista fan in question, Gomes’s goal did not ultimately affect the final result, one that means the bottom-placed Aves are now only two points from safety. Boavista, meanwhile, are ninth having endured their 10th defeat of the season."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/08/uk-sold-spyware-to-honduras-just-before-crackdown-on-election-protesters","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"UK sold spyware to Honduras just before crackdown on election protesters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/08/uk-sold-spyware-to-honduras-just-before-crackdown-on-election-protesters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/08/uk-sold-spyware-to-honduras-just-before-crackdown-on-election-protesters","fields":{"headline":"UK sold spyware to Honduras just before crackdown on election protesters","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The British government sanctioned sales of spy equipment to Honduras shortly before a disputed general election led to a violent crackdown on opposition protesters and activists in the Central American country. Telecommunications interception equipment worth at least £300,000, sophisticated spy technology which can be used to intercept, monitor and track emails, mobile phones, and online messaging services such as WhatsApp was sold to Honduras for use by its law enforcement agencies which have a dismal human rights track record of kidnap, torture and extrajudicial killings. The government also approved two open export licences between December 2016 and September 2017, according to the latest available information from the Department of International Trade (DIT). These open licences permit recurrent exports of a wide range of military and telecoms parts such as cables and software systems “sensitive to eavesdropping”, but the DIT is not obliged to reveal what, if anything, is sold. Honduras, the second poorest and most unequal country in the Americas, has been plagued by a deadly mix of violence, impunity and corruption since a July 2009 coup ushered the National party into power, where it has remained despite allegations of state sponsored killings, electoral fraud and links to organised crime. The country has been shaken by a fresh wave of unrest since the election in November. Despite widespread allegations of fraud – and calls by international observers for a fresh vote – incumbent president Juan Orlando Hernández was eventually declared the winner. Amid massive daily street demonstrations, Hernández unleashed thousands of police, Swat teams, soldiers and military police to crack down on protesters. At least 40 people have been killed since the elections, and more than 2,000 detained, with many held under a controversial new terrorism law. High-profile activists say they have been harassed and intimidated by security forces. The 2008 British Export Control Act prohibits the sale of arms to countries where there is a clear risk that they will be used to repress their own people. Nevertheless, the government has sanctioned the sale of spyware to authoritarian states including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Turkey, Egypt and now Honduras, despite evidence of surveillance technology being used to target activists and opponents. “British law is unambiguous … [Yet] the government sold Honduras monitoring and decrypting technology expressly designed to eavesdrop on its citizens, months before the state rounded up thousands of people in a well-orchestrated surveillance operation,” said Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Labour MP and member of the Commons committee for arms export control. Russell-Moyle has tabled a written parliamentary question asking the government to name the company which sold the spy equipment, and how it deemed it safe to sanction the sale. The spyware industry is growing, worth at least £60m to the UK since 2008. More than a dozen companies have been granted licences to sell powerful telecommunications technology since 2015 including a subsidiary of the defence giant BAE Systems, but the DIT is not required to publish details of sales. Some of the export licences cover devices known as IMSI-catchers, which can monitor large numbers of mobile phones over broad areas. In Honduras, the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship has condemned what they believed to be illegal interception of emails and mobile phone data. WhatsApp messages sent by Manuel Zelaya – the Liberal party president ousted in the 2009 coup – were published on bogus online media outlets overseas and then shared on social networks. “Before, during and after the 2017 presidential campaign, leaders of Alliance and their teams were subject to state espionage,” said spokesman Rodolfo Pastor. “The information published was often manipulated to create confusion, distrust or division within the opposition.” The Campaign Against Arms Trade called for the licences to be revoked and an investigation to determine whether UK equipment has been used to repress civilians. “The British government has serious questions to answer. It is totally irresponsible to sell surveillance equipment to authoritarian regimes like the one in Honduras.” said the group’s spokesman, Andrew Smith. A DIT spokesman said it did not license exports which failed to meet strict criteria, “including where we assess there is a clear risk that the goods may be used for internal repression”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/feb/09/generous-maternity-leave-has-made-me-a-better-academic","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-09T07:30:33Z","webTitle":"Generous maternity leave has made me a better academic | Anonymous Academic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/09/generous-maternity-leave-has-made-me-a-better-academic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/09/generous-maternity-leave-has-made-me-a-better-academic","fields":{"headline":"Generous maternity leave has made me a better academic","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I always had the sense I was lucky with my maternity leave provision. When I read reports of just how wildly provisions vary at other universities, I knew it. Six months at full pay has been hugely beneficial for me – what a shame it is far from guaranteed for others. Some colleagues see it as an extended holiday; in reality it is anything but - looking after a child is hard work. In a job like academia, where you’re personally invested in your work, it can be hard to let go. I’ve revised and publicised several papers, corrected proofs, written a book review and submitted a grant application. I have also signed a book contract and started work on the manuscript. It was approved at an editorial meeting after my baby was born. I’ve also lightly worked on two more co-authored publications, although my colleagues have done the bulk of the work after I laid the groundwork last year. The difference for me is that all of this has been my choice, not coercion from my department. I’ve been surprised to find the space afforded by maternity leave – away from daily admin, teaching and meetings – immensely beneficial to the research side of my job. I’ve maintained some of the publication pipeline, but the real benefit has been the space to read widely and to think. I have read weird and wonderful things – and they have fed back into a connected and concrete vision of my next big research project. If there is one thing that 2am feeds are good for, it is letting the mind wander and gently worry away at things without any pressure to resolve them immediately. Part of the reason for this is an enforced slow pace. I am constantly interrupted, and I read only short sections at a time. This is a surprising advantage, in that I am left dwelling on those sections in a way I seldom have time to when reading at full tilt in preparation for an article or class, when the emphasis is on getting it done and finding a quick quotation. Reading outside my discipline has been a source of inspiration too. I would never have thought, for instance, that a culinary history of South America might give me ideas for a new book. In many ways I have found maternity leave to offer some of the valuable aspects of a sabbatical. Yet if I were really on sabbatical I would probably be too busily immersed in writing, revising and collecting data, since these are the activities required to justify research leave these days. Instead I have been offered freedom and space – bar a handful of emails that shouldn’t have been sent my way – and I have found it re-energising. I also think that continuing to do some academic work has made me better able to cope with the changes that motherhood brings. I take anti-depressants, so post-natal depression was a spectre that loomed large. Continuing to read and to write has enabled me to keep a sense of self separate from my baby. When they’re asleep in the pram on our daily constitutional, I have something to think about other than bowel movements. Thinking about my good fortune has reminded me how difficult other new mothers can have it. I’m grateful not to share that fear of losing my job or not getting my contract renewed, since I work in a department which, to its credit, has a number of women with children in permanent posts. It doesn’t surprise me, then, that recent research found that universities with the most generous maternity leave employ twice the number of women professors as those offering the least. Not only is maternity leave good for women’s personal lives, by giving them the time off they need it can benefit their professional careers too.

This might sound like a problem that confronts conservatives, but over the past 20 years or so it has become more of a riddle for progressives. One response is provided by the movement known as “new atheism”, which successfully assembled a band of science-loving devotees, but too often seemed to end up in a cul-de-sac of stale machismo and Islamophobia. More pertinently, the failed 2016 campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Remain demonstrated that, in the eyes of many people, “progress” simply meant more of the same. When people feel trapped and patronised by progress, then any alternative – even regress – will feel like freedom. Informing them that the policies of the past 40 years are still the best available starts to sound hopeless. Steven Pinker’s answer to this problem is to double down on progress: the policies of the past 300 years are still the best available. Enlightenment Now is a bold, wonderfully expansive and occasionally irate defence of scientific rationality and liberal humanism, of the sort that took root in Europe between the mid-17th and late 18th century. With Donald Trump in the Oval Office, populists on the march across Europe and US campuses at the centre of yet another culture skirmish, the timing of the book requires little explanation. Pinker is up for a fight, and his main weapon is quantitative data. Two thirds of the book, which is a kind of sequel to his bestselling The Better Angels of Our Nature, consists of chapter after chapter of evidence that life has been getting progressively better for most people. “How can we soundly appraise the state of the world?” he asks. “The answer is to count.” The litany of facts is awesome, covering health, wealth, inequality, the environment, peace, democracy and on and on, though one wonders if there is any possible tipping point within this deluge where a doubter might suddenly be convinced. Various foes are swatted away, for misreading the facts or using suspect moral reasoning. The confidence with which Pinker tears through the issues that cause such deep anxiety today, such as rising inequality and global warming, is a compelling spectacle, although he relies on some questionable political manoeuvres. Ultimately, economic inequality “is not itself a dimension of human wellbeing”, he tells us, and that’s that. As for climate, we all need to calm down and open our minds to geo-engineering. If it matters, we’ll solve it. Unlike his allies in the political sphere, he clearly isn’t troubled by the charge of elitism. Environmentalists “capitalise on primitive intuitions of essentialism and contamination among the scientifically illiterate public”, while research suggests that “most voters are ignorant not just of current policy options but of basic facts”. Pinker would no doubt argue that reason is not a popularity contest, and yet this is scarcely the way to win the public round to the progressive cause. He is well aware that facts don’t settle political and ethical arguments, as much as he might like them to, and he reviews plenty of evidence to confirm this. The book is really a polemic, albeit one with a vast number of footnotes. With some deft intellectual moves, he manages to position “enlightenment” and “science” on the right side of every argument or conflict, while every horror of the past 200 years is put down to ignorance, irrationality or “counter-enlightenment” trends. Take nuclear weapons, which on the face of it would suggest potentially catastrophic consequences of scientific “progress”. Pinker takes this challenge head on, but lapses into some fantastical arguments along the way. Scientists working on the first ever nuclear weapon only did so because they were each personally invested in beating Hitler, he informs us. “Quite possibly, had there been no Nazis, there would be no nukes.” What he won’t countenance, but which theorists such as Max Weber, Hannah Arendt and Zygmunt Bauman pondered at length, is the notion that modern science lacks any ethical logic of its own. Could it not be that “progress” is both liberating and threatening? That rationality is dangerous precisely because of how hugely it expands human power? Even the most pessimistic social theorists of the last 150 years were not against enlightenment, so much as the machinery that it made available to less enlightened political forces, including capital. This line of argument is rubbished as the obsession of “leftist intellectuals” and “postmodernists”, who are characterised in the most extraordinary terms as figures nostalgic for mills and mines “probably because they never worked in one”, who “poison voters” against progress, and believe “liberal democracy is the same as fascism” (the footnotes suddenly dry up at these points). The big reveal at the end of the book is of the single thinker whose ideas capture, and perhaps even cause, everything that is wrong with today’s world: Friedrich Nietzsche. This is Pinker at his bluntest and least imaginative, suggesting that he has allowed American campus politics to get to him. The penultimate page of the book implores us to “finally, drop the Nietzsche”, to which the simple answer is “don’t feed the troll, Steven”. He seems frustrated that people show so little “gratitude” for the benefits that enlightenment has delivered them, and uses tales of disease, death and foul workplaces to convince us that now is the best time to be alive. But is gratitude ever what progress depended on? Martin Luther King Jr could have been grateful not to be living in 1850s Louisiana, but where would that have got him? Surely it is an essential and welcome feature of modern societies that people are restless and dissatisfied, even as things improve. He argues that “notwithstanding the habitual self-flagellation by Western intellectuals about Western racism, it’s non-Western countries that are the least tolerant”, without considering that maybe some self-flagellation is therefore good. The vice-like grip of Pinker’s reasoning derives from his curious relationship to intellectual history. Just as US politics gets trapped by the assumption that all major political questions were dealt with in 1787, Pinker has no real need of any philosopher after Immanuel Kant. Enlightenment becomes like a wind-up toy that we should just let run, as long as pesky “critics” can be cleared out of the way. Despite his contempt for populists, theocrats and de-growth environmentalists, he ultimately dismisses them as having already lost. In which case, why the manifesto? Perhaps the answer lies in the occasional hints of existential angst. Pinker does identify three scientific theories that have arisen since the 18th century, and which form an indispensable part of the scientific imagination: evolution, entropy and information. Common to all is a sense of the tragic, that life lacks purpose, and will ultimately fall apart. The most stirring passages are those that reflect on what this means, on how unlikely progress is, rather than on its all-conquering logic. Unlike Kant and the other high priests of the Enlightenment, today’s rationalist somehow has to make do without God or unfolding historical logic. This (as Nietzsche noted) makes science harder, not easier. The heroic ethos of science, of progress, is to carry on regardless, even in the knowledge that entropy will eventually win. Perhaps making this argument makes me a “leftist intellectual”, but I couldn’t help finding it a more appealing – even affecting – ethical pitch than the triumphalism that announces that the good guys have already won. • Enlightenment Now: The Case for Science, Reason, Humanism and Progress is published by Allen Lane.

In addition to the ninth instalment of the saga proper in December 2019, this May’s Han Solo spinoff, Rian Johnson’s new trilogy, the rumoured Obi Wan Kenobi standalone movie and the clutch of TV shows Disney has in development, Lucasfilm has now announced that, once Game of Thrones is done and dusted, its showrunners, David Benioff and DB Weiss, will write and produce yet another trilogy of new films. It seems the galaxy far, far away is likely to never be that far away at all, from now until the end of time. Whether this full-frontal assault will result in audience Force-fatigue remains to be seen. An argument could be made that, if the quality of output remains as high as it has been since George Lucas handed over the keys, that point may not come for a long while yet. The more intriguing question, though, is what writers with Benioff and Weiss’s decidedly non-kid-friendly credentials might come up with, given a whole new space-opera sandbox to muck around in. With the inevitable box-office shortfall that results from a movie being lumbered with the cursed “R” rating, it seems doubtful Lucasfilm would ever let Benioff and Weiss indulge the sweary, violent, fornicatory tendencies that lent themselves so neatly to Westeros. It makes bad business sense. Preventing kids from seeing a film costs the studio money in ticket sales, and Star Wars movies are, let’s not forget, kids’ films made by Disney. But even with this taken into account, is the idea of a dark, brutal, Game of Thrones-y Star Wars-for-grownups really so far-fetched? For all its dragons, giants, magic and and castrations, Game of Thrones is, at heart, an intensely political character-based drama. Yes, it has spectacle, and Benioff and Weiss’s ability to deliver this will do their Star Wars prospects no harm whatsoever. But Game of Thrones has always been at its best when sculpting deep, flawed, believable characters, and then laughing as it throws them through the most savage emotional wringers it can concoct. Battles and explosions are merely the cherry on top. You could remove all of Game of Thrones’s fantastical elements entirely and it would still make for compelling TV, so flinging it into space is unlikely to lose any of what makes it great. A hard–R Goodfellas-on-spaceships swearathon isn’t what an “adult” Star Wars needs to be. The Dark Knight is still regarded as the paragon of what it’s possible to squeeze beneath the barrier of a PG-13/12A certificate. Anyone who still panics every time a pencil goes anywhere near their eye will know why. Rogue One was no Frozen, either – it’s a dark, mature war film in which literally everyone is killed to death. Benioff and Weiss could still make a nasty little political thrillogy here, should they wish to without troubling the censors and, ergo, the moneymen too much. Of course, the Star Wars prequels also tried to do political drama. They failed, hard. But, if you looked really, really closely, there was the kernel of something brilliant there: trade disputes, secret war preparations, the rise of a despot, the on-the-ground brutalities of realpolitik – all of these could have made for a complex narrative, played out on a truly epic galactic canvas. Instead, George Lucas delivered dialogue so wooden it gave you tetanus and a frankly disturbing “romance” between Padmé and that little snotbag Anakin, all while somehow turning the Jedi – psychokinetic badasses with laser-swords, remember – into a whimpering throng of goody-two-shoe space-prefect dullards. It was practically an achievement. But Benioff and Weiss know how to do intrigue, twists, character and high stakes. Their trilogy could be the sprawling political epic the prequels tried so ineptly to be – the one a universe as rich and detailed as this deserves. Wars fought in the corridors of power. Divided loyalties. Poisonous ambition. Death! Betrayal! Bloody laser-sword assassinations! Star Wars is ripe with possibilities for yarns on smaller, Machiavellian levels of cloak-and-dagger backstabbery, and Thrones had these in spades. One presumes this is the very reason Benioff and Weiss got the Star Wars job at all. Which, you have to admit, is quite exciting. If we are to receive a new Star Wars film every year for ever, they were always going to have to diversify. As a statement of intent as to what this might actually entail, Benioff and Weiss’s appointment is a bold one. It’s also, like almost every other decision Lucasfilm seems to be making at the moment, 100% the right choice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/07/ethnic-diversity-uk-childrens-books-arts-council-england-representation","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T16:29:26Z","webTitle":"Ethnic diversity in UK children's books to be examined","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/07/ethnic-diversity-uk-childrens-books-arts-council-england-representation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/07/ethnic-diversity-uk-childrens-books-arts-council-england-representation","fields":{"headline":"Ethnic diversity in UK children's books to be examined","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The “paucity” of UK children’s books featuring an ethnically diverse lineup of characters is set to be laid bare by two Arts Council England-backed studies into representation in children’s literature. The issue of ethnic representation has long been a subject of research in the US, where the University of Wisconsin-Madison has charted the relatively minuscule proportion of children’s books by and about people of colour for decades: in 2016, it found that of 3,400 US children’s books, just 287 were about Africans or African Americans, 240 were about Asians, 169 about Latinos and 55 about Native Americans. While experts in the UK have pointed to a similarly “huge problem” for some time, until now the relevant statistics have not been available to back up the widely held view that, as ACE director for literature Sarah Crown put it on Wednesday, there is a “paucity of high-quality books for children and young adults by and about people from all walks of life”. Now the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) is set to chart for the first time the extent and quality of ethnic representation among characters in UK children’s books, thanks to new funding from the ACE, while BookTrust is due to evaluate the number of children’s books created by authors and illustrators of colour. CLPE will publish its study, Reflecting Realities, in July, covering titles published in 2017, while BookTrust will report in September, looking back across recent years. Both intend the pieces of research to become annual events. “Under-representation, and a lack of quality of representation, has been an issue for a very long time,” said Farrah Serroukh, who is directing the CLPE project. Serroukh said that while there is “a creeping increase of representation evident, that is not necessarily indicative of quality”, with publishers and authors needing to reflect on whether characters reinforce stereotypes, and are well-developed. “It’s not just a case of creating ethnic minority characters, it’s a case of what proportion they represent, and what is the quality of that representation,” she said. CLPE has put out a call to publishers asking them to submit books aimed at children aged between three and 11 and published in 2017. “There is a strong moral, ethical and financial case for wider representation in children’s books,” it writes, calling on publishers to help it ensure that children’s literature “meaningfully reflects the realities of its readership”. Serroukh said she hopes to receive thousands of submissions. “We are not envisioning that [ethnic representation] is going to be particularly high,” she said. “All of us have a sense that it is not quite where it needs to be.” After revealing general figures about representation in July, CLPE will then invite individual publishers in to consult with its experts on specific findings. “Otherwise we’re just constantly going over the same ground,” said Serroukh. “We would hope this would inform their editorial processes and ultimately lead to better quality books being produced.” Serroukh said she hoped the research would also “lead to a more nuanced conversation about the value and impact of reflecting realities”. “We must invest our energies into normalising and making mainstream the breadth and range of realities that exist within our classrooms and society, and ensure that this translates to the pages of our books,” she said. “Books provide a gateway to worlds beyond the reality of this one for children, and also allow them to mirror their own reality. That allows us to validate who we are, and raises our sense of self. Children then sense that not only do they have the right to see themselves in books, but that they also have the right to occupy the literary space. They feel eligible to contribute to that space. Authors of colour talk about how they never saw themselves in books growing up – that books weren’t for them as readers, but also that they weren’t for them in terms of the ability to write.” BookTrust director of children’s books Jill Coleman was clear that “representation in children’s books is important for all children”. “A lack of diversity impacts on how young readers see themselves and the world around them, on their motivation to read, and on their aspirations to become the writers and illustrators of the future. We hope this research will give us an accurate picture of the present situation, help us to support and encourage a diverse range of talent and, ultimately, to encourage more children to develop a lifelong love of reading,” she said. Crown pointed to recent reports, including the Arts Council’s own, which she said have “shone a spotlight on the publishing sector’s alarming lack of diversity, in terms of staffing, artistic talent and output”. An ACE report published in December found that “over the past 15 years or so the position of BAME writers within British writing and publishing, never robust, has in fact gone backwards”. “Low pay, insider networks, unpaid internships, a perception that the industry caters to ‘white’ tastes and that it is not looking for writers and staff from a BAME background, all contribute,” said the report. Crown said that the CLPE research would “provide much-needed evidence that may help shape the decisions made by those working in the publishing industry and the subsidised sector that supports it”. Serroukh at the CLPE, a charity which works to support the teaching of literacy in primary schools, said that there was currently “a momentum across the industry calling for better representation”. “We want to contribute to that conversation and move it on,” she said. “It’s great that the industry has been reflecting on this, but that’s only effective if it ultimately leads to change. [The report] will help keep it in the forefront of our psyches, and will be a measure to detail how we’re moving forwards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2018/feb/28/child-friendly-city-indoors-playing-healthy-sociable-outdoors","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T07:30:11Z","webTitle":"What would the ultimate child-friendly city look like?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/28/child-friendly-city-indoors-playing-healthy-sociable-outdoors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/feb/28/child-friendly-city-indoors-playing-healthy-sociable-outdoors","fields":{"headline":"What would the ultimate child-friendly city look like?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Imagine you are 10 years old.

You ask your parents if you can walk, they say no, and they are too busy to take you there themselves. Perhaps you SnapChat your friend instead, perhaps you play a video game on the sofa. You’ve lost out on exercise and time outside, interacting with your neighbourhood and, of course, play time with your friend. This is the reality for many kids today – but it doesn’t have to be this way. Dangerous roads, dilapidated facilities and poor use of green space all help deter kids from playing outside, pushing them towards solitary, indoors activities Tim Gill, the author of No Fear: Growing Up in a Risk Averse Society, says a child-friendly city is one that allows “everyday freedoms”, so a child can spread their wings as they grow. “It’s not enough to just talk about playgrounds and nice, pretty public spaces,” says Gill. That, he says, creates “play ghettoes – places they have to be taken to by adults”. Society’s mistake, argues Gill, is that our planning systems are geared around cars, housebuilding and the economy – rather than the environment, health and quality of life. “You won’t find any urban planners who disagree with that,” says Gill. “It’s because our decision-makers are short-termist politicians who don’t need to look beyond the next two or three years.” A recent report from Arup identifies five challenges for urban children: traffic and pollution; high-rise living and urban sprawl; crime, social fears and risk aversion; isolation and intolerance; and inadequate and unequal access to the city. But in urban neighbourhoods around the world, child-friendly design is gaining momentum: from community-led projects, using paint and planters to tackle dangerous routes to schools and playgrounds, to citywide policy reimagining housing policies and neighbourhoods for children. Tirana: trust the silent majority “Don’t underestimate the power of children,” says Tirana’s young mayor, Erion Veliaj. After a survey showed the city’s parents spend more on their cars than their children, Veliaj has used this statistic as moral leverage to refocus priorities. In a city short on funds, businesses have sponsored the transformation of kindergartens and nurseries from run-down “prison cells” into beautiful spaces, with 10 new ones on the way via public-private partnerships. Repeated traffic closures on the huge Skanderbeg Square for play convinced residents to accept it as a permanent car-free space. Every three months the pedestrian zone expands by one more street, until the city centre eventually goes completely car-free. PM10 pollutants have already dropped by 15%. Children ride bikes on closed streets in Tirana Change isn’t always easy in a city where the car is a potent status symbol. The construction of a large playground at Tirana’s artificial lake attracted protests, some of them violent. “A vocal minority who are well-connected, with vested interests, will make a lot of noise,” says Veliaj. “You have to trust that the silent majority will turn up when it opens.” And they did. In his first year Veliaj took 40,000 sq m of land from illegal developments, making way for 31 new playgrounds. A new playground (left); families plant ‘birthday trees’ for children (right) A city forest ring is populated by kids’ “birthday trees”, which families plant at given locations. “When other countries are talking about walls, we are building a wall of trees, to oxygenate the city,” Veliaj says. About 60% of trees are provided by citizens and businesses, which plant two per company car. A further city ring for walking, cycling and public transport is on its way. Tirana also boasts a “city council for kids”, where young representatives meet the mayor, debate and take their findings back to school. The great thing about kids, Veliaj says, is they have no hidden agenda – and they are the best advocates to persuade their parents to recycle, walk and bike to school. Rotterdam: wild spaces for kids Voted the least attractive city to grow up in in 2006, Rotterdam has since spent €15m (£13.2m) on improvements to public spaces, housing and safe traffic routes in lower income neighbourhoods in an effort to build a child-friendly city. An open space in a city park forest has been converted into a nature playground – Natuurspeeltuin de Speeldernis – giving children the opportunity for unstructured play. Kids can enjoy the biodiversity of “wild” space, build dens, fires and rafts, and camp out. It now draws 35,000 visitors a year. Some school playgrounds have been turned into community squares – featuring high-quality playable spaces with anything from community gardening to sporting facilities, allowing kids to experience life within the wider community. A street picnic in Rotterdam Historically a city with high levels of social housing, Rotterdam has embarked on an unashamed programme of state-sponsored gentrification. The city’s Promising Places scheme builds on earlier work in a bid to retain wealthier, highly educated young families. Hundreds of new, detached family homes are being built in districts around the city centre – with plenty of green space, play areas and a target of two excellent-rated schools per district. Previously rented properties are being sold off in promising areas, and families given support for home improvements. Parents and children at a public gardening project A community Droomstraat (dream streets) programme, allows residents to bid for and design street improvements, swapping traffic and car parking for things such as vegetable patches or public seating. The improvements seem to be working: the city reports that people are now staying in Rotterdam with their families, and developers are keen to build new homes. Bogotá: mapping danger spots The former mayor of Bogotá, Enrique Peñalosa, once said: “Children are a kind of indicator species. If we can build a successful city for children, we will have a successful city for everyone.” Work to make the city’s public spaces more equitable started two decades ago with Peñalosa’s ambitious bus rapid transit scheme, bike lanes, and the introduction of 1,200 parks and play spaces. In one of the city’s poorest districts, Ciudad Bolívar, community members have been working with Urban 95, a Bernard van Leer Foundation initiative to improve public space for people under 95cm tall. In a district with high crime rates and little green space, a community walk-around identified danger spots and how residents would like to tackle them. Children help brighten up a street in Bogotá Street paintings and planters were used to mark a route between a kindergarten, school and park, to reduce traffic speeds and create new play space, while buildings were painted in bright colours. The idea is to use “tactical urbanism” to trial simple changes that will be made permanent if they work. The community that developed the plans is encouraged to own the changes and help keep the new facilities in use – if they don’t, the city won’t maintain them. The company which runs Bogotá’s cable car system is planning to replicate the ideas in the areas by the 24 columns of its four-stop mountainside route. Suggested improvements include breastfeeding areas, play spaces and centres for the elderly. The company in charge of the city’s BRT system, TransMilenio, is reportedly looking to adopt similar plans too. Lexington: pop-up water parks In Lexington, Kentucky, where summer temperatures exceed 27C for most of June, July and August, hot days are plentiful. Families had been breaking the rules by playing in the public fountains in Thoroughbred Park – but rather than penalising residents, the city council decided to listen to them. In 2015 Gehl Studio conducted a public space survey for city and discovered a latent demand for family-friendly outdoor space, in particular for play and water. The following summer a pop-up water fountain was installed on the grass of nearby Northeastern Park, and its impact was transformative. Dubbed SplashJAM, the temporary installation drew people from across the city. Along with a dancing water fountain there were picnic tables, beach umbrellas, and on-site changing rooms and toilets with accessibility ramps. SplashJAM in Lexington People flocked to the area: they walked and drove, brought coolers with food and drink, sat under umbrellas, and watched their kids play. People who had never visited the park found a reason to be there. People met their neighbours. Daytime visitor numbers to the park almost tripled, with 80% of visitors having never or rarely been there before. Before the experiment most park visitors came from within a five-block radius. The city is looking to replicate the project’s success in other parks. Vancouver: family-friendly housing Vancouver’s family-friendly housing policies, established in the 1990s, doubled the percentage of kids living in its downtown between 2001 and 2011. Guidance for high-density housing in the city typically specifies that a quarter be designed for families – with communal storage space for buggies, play areas and family homes on lower floors, natural light and “opportunities for water and sand play”. Developments should also be located within half a mile of schools, day-care centres and grocery stores, and have safe walking routes. Those policies recognise the importance of socialising opportunities for all ages, prescribing enough family units to give children peers to play with, and play space for preschool ages, elementary and teenage kids. Overlooking teenagers, it says, is a mistake – they should be provided with informal spaces for ball games. River District in Vancouver will feature playing fields, parkland, a community centre, daycare and schools Using these criteria Vancouver is building River District – also known as East Fraser Lands – on former industrial land. It will have 25 acres of planned parkland and more than a third of the overall development is intended for families. It features an elementary school, a community centre and four childcare centres. As well as the predictable luxe high-rise apartments are almost 250 affordable housing units at below market rental in five and six-storey blocks, and at least 60% of these will be targeted at families. Vancouver’s wider housing strategy is aimed at tackling the city’s acute affordability issues – proposing 72,000 new homes over 10 years, 40% for families and two thirds of those to be rentals. Half will serve households earning less than the median income (around $80,000). Last summer the popular Creekside Park playground on the waterfront got a $900,000 overhaul. Now Vancouver’s biggest playground, it has musical play instruments, a climbing tower, a giant tube slide and a zip line – as well as those highly regarded sand and water play opportunities.

It doesn’t bother me much.” Monaghan is one of hundreds of 16- and 17-year-olds being trained at the Army Foundation College in North Yorkshire. She rejected the description “child soldier”: the UN definition is anyone under 18. “We are not children,” she said. “Because of what we do, we mature earlier.” The UK is the only European country to recruit soldiers at 16. Other countries to take the same approach include Mauritania, Zambia, Bangladesh, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. In the US, the age limit is 17. For much of British history, there was no age limit, a point highlighted by images of the young drummer boys. The army has resisted raising the age from 16, the school leaving age, partly because, struggling to find recruits, it finds it easier to attract the young – the salary is a big incentive for many from deprived areas – and partly, critics say, because soldiers at that age tend to be more malleable, and easier to establish in a habit of obedience. Monaghan was speaking during a visit to the Harrogate college by journalists organised by the Ministry of Defence. It came before a court martial scheduled to begin on Monday of 10 instructors accused of physically abusing teenage recruits in 2014. Charges include holding junior soldiers’ heads underwater, forcing animal manure into their mouths and beating them. While unable to discuss the case for legal reasons, the college’s commanding officer, Lt Col Rich Hall, defended the way the college treated its young recruits in general. “Our young men and women who come through here seem relatively well prepared on arrival and extremely well prepared on departure,” he said. “They have very flexible terms of service that allows voluntary withdrawal from the course almost at any opportunity. It is a very fair, open system and the junior soldier genuinely thrives here.” He added that all the permanent staff were handpicked and underwent extensive training, including in pastoral and welfare support. “So it feels to me our staff are extremely well prepared and the environment that creates is absolutely fit for purpose for training the young 16- to 17-year-olds that come through.” Monaghan, from Huddersfield, is one of more than 1,000 16- to 17-year-olds who started in October. The MoD is adamant that none of those who graduate will be sent to a conflict zone until they are 18, though the MoD admitted in 2007 that 15 under-18s had been “inadvertently” sent to Iraq. Critics argue that the point is not that they might end up in combat zones but the long-term damage caused by military training at such a young age, including learning to kill. Monaghan said she had not seen any bullying, adding that there were lots of people involved in welfare, both military and civilian, she could go to if there was a problem. “I have never had an issue,” she said. Part of the reason she had joined was to travel to places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, the kind of experience she said ordinary people did not get the chance to have. Of the 40-odd who began in her company, six had left, five of them after the first week, she said, some because of homesickness. “I miss my family a little bit but I go home at weekends,” she said. Junior soldiers, who account for roughly a quarter of the army’s annual intake, are paid £1,244 a month for the first six months, rising to £1,540 for the second six months. They pay about £5 a day for food and £1 for accommodation. Another of the recruits, Jack Patrick, 17, from Hertfordshire, said he had not seen any bullying. “There have been one or two fights,” he said. “But there is zero tolerance of that. We are here to be disciplined soldiers.” Patrick left school with four GSCEs and hopes at the end of his training to pass selection for the Parachute Regiment. A parent of a child who has left the college, who requested anonymity, said the life there did not match the publicity material and their son, who joined three years ago, had phoned home after just three days asking to get out. “My son is still sensitive to this episode in his life,” the father said. Rachel Taylor, director of programmes at Child Soldiers International, said: “As a government department, the MoD shows a remarkable lack of concern for some of society’s most vulnerable young people.” The college does not meet the legal minimum education or safeguarding requirements of a sixth-form college, she said. Taylor disputes the college’s claim to have a pass rate of more than 75%. “Although the MoD highlights the handpicked testimony of successful recruits, it says nothing about the one in three Harrogate recruits who is thrown out or quits during training, or the 40% of minors who leave the army within four years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/10/kit-de-waal-where-are-all-the-working-class-writers-","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-10T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"Kit de Waal: 'Make room for working class writers'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/10/kit-de-waal-where-are-all-the-working-class-writers-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/feb/10/kit-de-waal-where-are-all-the-working-class-writers-","fields":{"headline":"Kit de Waal: 'Make room for working class writers'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Reading at school was agony. A slow, child by child rotation around the class, six pages each. Great Expectations. Vanity Fair. The Mill on the bloody Floss. The boys with their flatline monotones. The girls, careful not to stumble and be humiliated. English was my best subject, so this process was painful. I wanted to race ahead and get to the end of the story. Yet the idea of taking that book home to read later and finish, that never occurred to me. Not when we owned the ultimate big novel: the Bible. We were Jehovah’s Witnesses and three times a week we’d sit in a draughty hall on the backstreets of Sparkbrook in Birmingham, wrapped around a paraffin heater discussing the 66 books that made up the Old and the New Testaments. I’ve read it cover to cover at least five times. Leviticus and Numbers were hard going, all that counting and recounting, all those laws and exhortations, but there were very beautiful passages, too. The Song of Solomon, Psalms, Proverbs. The Gospels, too, four different takes on one big adventure. They had the ingredients of a good thriller with a hero, a call to arms, a savage tragedy. Without realising it, I was learning what you had to do to write well, how to characterise, how to keep your reader turning the page without the threat of eternal damnation as an incentive. But writing as a career? That never entered my head. The only writers I knew were dead. And apart from Enid Blyton, they were dead men. And white. And posh. Even when I began to read widely in my 20s, it was still a case of: if you can’t see it, you can’t be it. No one from my background – poor, black and Irish – wrote books. It just wasn’t an option. I left school at 16, in 1976. Since then we’ve had a range of social mobility initiatives, the policies by which bright children are better enabled to “reach the top”. I’ve always had a problem with the idea of cherry-picking the most able or the most driven rather than lifting whole communities out of poverty, providing better standards of education and better living conditions for all. Worse than that, the notion of social mobility has always smacked of: “How can we help you to be more like us?” It seems to say that to be working class is to be a failure. Nevertheless, I still wonder if any of these initiatives have made an impression on who gets to write, what they’re allowed to write, who gets published, and by whom. What’s life like, even today, if you’re a writer from the other side of the tracks? ¶ None of the big publishers were interested in Paul McVeigh’s 2015 novel The Good Son, about a working- class Catholic boy in Belfast during the Troubles. “The regional and working-class vernacular put them off,” he says. “I knew if I toned down the voice and made the book less honest and less representative of the lives of children growing up in poverty, it would have had a much easier and financially rewarding journey to publication.” McVeigh eventually found an independent publisher, Salt, willing to take his writing on, but it took months of hard work, and it didn’t stop there. Karl Parkinson, whose 2016 novel The Blocks is written in the dialect of the poorest part of Dublin, also struggled to find a publisher. And when he did get published, by small independent press New Binary, he “would find that the book hadn’t been stocked in the bookshops”. Parkinson, brought up in social housing rife with unemployment and heroin abuse, says: “I knew that big publishers would ask me to change the uncompromising use of dialect, phonetic spelling, idiosyncratic punctuation. But that’s what made it real.” A 2016 paper, published by Dr Dave O’Brien of Goldsmiths estimated that almost half – 47% – of all authors, writers and translators hail from professional, middle-class backgrounds, compared with just 10% of those with parents in routine or manual labour. This analysis, of the 2014 British Labour Force Survey, also identified that 43% of people working in publishing, including those in the influential editorial roles, were from middle-class origins, with only 12% from working-class backgrounds. As Chris McCrudden, a communications planner who dissects data on publishing trends, says: “Publishing is an upper-middle class industry whose output caters to upper-middle class tastes.” This all matters to writers. Why? Because these statistics show publishing to be the least socially diverse of all the UK’s creative industries, including film, television and advertising. If the majority of decision makers – gatekeepers – come from such a narrow social and cultural set (white, middle-class, good contacts, right accent and cultural references), then the question of who gets published and which stories get told is unlikely to change. ¶ When I began writing in my mid-40s, I had little expectation of being published. I knew no writers and little of the publishing world. I wrote as an antidote to being at home with young children. Heavily influenced by my fathers’ fascination with film noir, I had a stab at a screenplay, then a gangster novel, then something about a Norwegian madman. I was feeling my way but not finding my voice, nor did I really have an idea of what I wanted to say, despite having read hundreds of books by then. I only knew that I somehow wanted to tell the truth, to write something authentic, though authentically what I wasn’t sure. I began reading at 23, while working in a criminal defence legal firm in Handsworth, Birmingham. I asked one of the solicitors if he could recommend 10 good books. He was a military man and the list reflected his tastes: The Riddle of the Sands, The Siege of Krishnapur, The Red Badge of Courage. But he threw in a couple of wild cards: Flaubert and Zola. I followed up Emma Bovary with Thérèse Raquin, The Woman of the Pharisees, Anna of the Five Towns and Helen with a High Hand and began to find a seam of life that I could relate to: the domestic drama; the small world with the big stakes; the people at the edge of things, adrift somehow, out of sorts. I grew up in the Irish community of Birmingham and the Irish are nothing if not great storytellers. My grandmother from Wexford, a waspish woman with a vinegar tongue, had a mean repertoire of takedowns, and an uncle of mine could spin one throwaway line into a joke, a yarn, a whole evening of entertainment. So when I began writing I wanted to imitate my heroes, to take ordinary, everyday people and make them the centre of the story, as James Joyce does in Dubliners, or as Kevin Barry and Lisa McInerney do with their spot-on, lyrical descriptions of small city lives today. But there weren’t as many examples to draw from out there as I would have liked. Before the Chartists, in the early 19th century, the working-class voice was repressed by poverty, factory systems, child labour, slum housing and a lack of education. The six-point charter drawn up by the London Working Men’s Association, demanding changes to rights and access to the vote, may have been rejected, but the roots of working-class writing began there. Though Thomas Cooper’s full-length novel about Chartism was lost, early working-class fictions were usually subversions of bildungsroman – the hero not always overcoming poverty, but certainly tackling it head-on and more often with his fists. Then, in the 20th century, DH Lawrence gave us Sons and Lovers, a tale of sexual irregularity, foundering intellect and desire for class solidarity, told through Paul Morel – bound for the mines and not the middle-class bohemia he strives for. “I belong to the common people,” says Morel. “From the middle-classes one gets ideas, from the common people – life itself.” The late 1950s and 60s saw something of a heyday for working‑class fiction. Alan Sillitoe’s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning presented us with Arthur Seaton, the original angry young man, tethered to the factory line, cheating with his shop steward’s wife, and finally giving in to the idea of a nice little house on a respectable estate. Still, Arthur won’t be told, and like Sillitoe’s previous everyman, Smith, in “The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner”, these underdogs are tenaciously sticking it to the man by losing the race on purpose. But in A Kestrel for a Knave, published 50 years ago last month, Barry Hines showed exactly how humiliating it was to be a loser. A bleak coming-of-age tale, the book recounts a day in the life of an ostracised lower-class boy. Humiliated because of his poverty by his teachers, Billy Casper reeks of hopelessness, and finds solace in taming a young kestrel. He fears that life down a mine will turn him into his bitter, bullying brother, who ultimately kills Billy’s kestrel in revenge for his failure to put a bet on the horses. As Thatcherism closed the mines, and crushed the unions in the 1980s, a wave of new Scottish writers dealt with the fallout of unemployment and urban decay. Novels by James Kelman, Agnes Owens, Irvine Welsh and Alan Warner captured the alienation of the angry working man and woman and the rise of an urban underclass brought about by mass unemployment and the fracturing of communities that had previously stood shoulder to shoulder. Traditional working-class values of community, loyalty, family-centricity and pride, gave way in these stories to drugs, gangs and prostitution. But Welsh’s Trainspotting is no mouthpiece for junkie culture; it is clever, witty, raw, class-conscious and angry. The post-industrial decay of mining towns in Wales is explored today by Welsh writers such as Rachel Trezise, Thomas Morris and Cynan Jones. In The Dig, Jones’s intense novel about a farmer and an illegal badger baiter, the author does just that: he digs in the dirt of the blunt-speaking rural working-class and reveals what you can make from the land to survive. “They had both grown up on farms and knew what to expect,” he writes, “but often it was the modernisation that wearied them.” Similarly, in Morris’s debut short story collection, We Don’t Know What We’re Doing, the people of Caerphilly are desperately seeking employment. “Whenever a shop closes down, a poster advertising one always appears.” But what never appears is the security and self-improvement that paid work brings. Instead, Morris’s characters are defined by a rose-tinted history. ¶ These books represent, however, only a partial account of the depth and variety of the working-class experience, and one that is often tailored for a middle-class, metropolitan reader. As soon as I thought about getting published, I realised that everyone who seemed to matter was a couple of hours down the motorway. I bought the Writers and Artists Yearbook to look for agents: London. I spotted a reading by one of my favourite authors: London again. The importance of London to becoming a writer or working in publishing is well known. Recent research from the London School of Economics demonstrates that the clustering of creative businesses in the capital reinforces the inequalities in the cultural workforce, and therefore the gaps in what is represented within literary culture. There are developments happening outside the M25: the Northern Fiction Alliance, a coming together of several independent publishers headed up by Manchester-based Comma Press, has challenged the dominance of the major London houses. But none of the “big five” – Penguin Random House, Macmillan, Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster – has yet opened an office outside the capital. The publishing industry is, gradually, waking up to the need to find new writers and new voices. But the danger in calling for more working-class stories, without a fundamental change in both the workforce and the audience, is that these will end up being just another product for middle-class consumption. In his book, Race and the Cultural Industries, Dr Anamik Saha, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, demonstrates how British Asian authors are restricted to a narrow gap in the market; they are offered the opportunity to write a specific set of racially framed narratives, which publishers claim are the only ones they can sell, rather than being given true creative freedom. Similarly, working-class writers, it seems, must endlessly regurgitate their own life stories – or versions of them – whereas middle-class writers can explore the world, the universe and beyond. The assumption being that working-class writers and stories are marginal. They are not: more than a third of the population is from traditional working-class origins. And it is also assumed that in order for these stories to be commercial they have to be filtered through middle-class sensibilities or explained for an imagined middle-class reader. This squashes the multiplicity of working-class experience into a few standard tropes: the misery memoir, the escape, the clever boy or girl “done good”. As writer Natasha Carthew, who grew up in a single-parent family in a council house in rural Cornwall, says: “Protagonists don’t have to be addicts or alcoholics or victims in some way, they could just be working class and what that means to us all in its compassionate impulsive big-hearted ways.” ¶ This question of class takes yet another turn when a working-class writer gets published and has some degree of success. Over time, you may accumulate the stuff of the middle-class life: the house, the car, a nice handbag (I like handbags). Your Brummie accent might have the corners shaved off in certain company. Are you still working class? Or have you hopped over the tracks? Most published writers I speak to from a working-class background experience this anxiety. For Lisa Blower, creative writing lecturer at Bangor University and author of the novel Sitting Ducks, the question of whether she is still working-class enough to write working-class fiction makes her “blood red and boiling to boot”. “It’s like saying you shouldn’t write crime if you’re not a serial killer,” she says. “It’s one thing defending the book’s content if it’s controversial or inauthentic, but having to validate your authorial status suggests a homogenised culture of one true experience – and that’s some pre-imagined version from the outside looking in.” Blower grew up in Stoke-on-Trent in a working-class household with access to books, music and stories. “And those are the stories I still hear. People told them without realising they were stories. I never set out to specifically write ‘working-class fiction’; that’s a label I get given because there’s political tension in my writing, which I would argue is more to do with identity.” She continues: “All too often, popular culture, including literature, neglects to reflect working-class life in its diversity. It’s easy to depict rich and poor, north and south, while undermining those who exist in-between. Working-class writing is simply reflecting lives, to paraphrase Alan Bennett, that are generally happening elsewhere.” For all her social mobility, Blower’s novel Sitting Ducks still took two years to find a publisher. “I’d be told it was an inauthentic voice, that I should rewrite it from the point of view of the seven-year-old daughter to make the politics more palatable when it was too angry. But I believe in what I want to say. So I’m belligerent rather than frustrated, because there has never been a more essential time to get working-class stories heard.” ¶ Dead Ink has recently published the anthology Know Your Place which features a collection of essays from working-class writers. “This sense of unworthiness and hostility has stuck with me all my life,” writes Lee Rourke in his essay Hop-Picking: Forging a Path in the Edgelands of Fiction. Carmen Marcus, a writer from North Yorkshire, tells me that she “killed her accent” to be taken seriously, before realising that there are thousands of writers in the same position. She has now formed a collective to support other working-class writers like herself. Within the mainstream publishing industry, too, there is appetite for change. Penguin has launched Write Now, an initiative to find new writers from diverse backgrounds; it no longer requires its new job applicants to have degrees. Many other publishers now pay their interns and provide traineeships. I am editing an anthology of working-class memoirs called Common People, for the crowdfunding publisher Unbound, with contributions from Malorie Blackman, Damian Barr, Louise Doughty, Cathy Rentzenbrink, Stuart Maconie, Jill Dawson and Tony Walsh, people who might not immediately spring to mind when you think of the working-class writer. Sixteen unknown writers will be published alongside them. Working-class stories are not always tales of the underprivileged and dispossessed – these are narratives rich in barbed humour, their technique and vernacular reflecting the depth and texture of working-class life, the joy and sorrow, the solidarity and the differences, the everyday wisdom and poetry of the woman at the bus-stop, the waiter, the hairdresser. I couldn’t end this piece without talking about the upper- or middle-class white men and women who wrote the classics and some of the masterpieces of literature. I love their writing, respect – no, envy – their skill and craft, and cherish those books that tell us so much about the world and what it is to be human.

The study - published by WWF, the Swire Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and ADM Capital Foundation - urges swift action towards regulating an industry that’s decimating stocks of these species across the Coral Triangle, threatening poor communities that rely on the fishery for their livelihoods. The Live Reef Fish for Food Trade (LRFFT) is largely fuelled by consumers in Hong Kong, and mainland China, for whom reef species are a delicacy - dishes that must be served at formal dining occasions such as weddings. While campaigns against shark-finning have achieved some success, it is difficult to raise similar levels of awareness about these less iconic species, in spite of their crucial role in sustaining reef ecosystems. Though small in size compared to other fisheries, the LRFFT is disproportionately valuable, thanks to prestige driven demand. Napoleon Wrasse for example can fetch more than $600 per kilo, according to the report. And the estimated US$1 billion a year in revenue only accounts for the legal side of the business. “The real value of the trade is unknown, since much is traded illegally on the black market,” says Geoffrey Muldoon, Senior Manager of the WWF Coral Triangle Programme. The report estimates that the volume of LRFFT imports into Hong Kong are being underestimated by as much as 50%. “Traders, transport and logistics carriers are allowed to exploit a vacuum created by inadequate and outdated regulation, loopholes in the law and lax enforcement,” says Muldoon. The 15-20 reef species that make up the bulk of the trade - most of them types of grouper - are especially vulnerable since they are relatively slow to mature. The market’s unrelenting demand means that fishers are taking increasing numbers of juveniles before they’ve had a chance to spawn. “The rate at which we are taking reef fish from our oceans, including juveniles, is simply not sustainable,” says Dr Yvonne Sadovy, a professor of biological sciences and the study’s lead author. “It is critical Hong Kong takes steps to regulate before it is too late.” Some have touted mariculture as a potential solution, but while there is a growing market for farmed grouper, these operations don’t actually reduce pressure on wild populations. It’s difficult to hatchery-produce species like coral trout in commercial quantities, so juveniles are still taken from the wild for grow out. Also, consumers tend to believe that wild caught fish are superior in quality, which in turn makes them more valuable to traders. With Chinese New Year arriving on 16th February, dinner tables across southern China and southeast Asia will be laden with the obligatory plates of steamed grouper. But consumers will likely have little idea of where their fish came from, or how it was caught. Few will know that fishers often favour potassium cyanide as a means of stunning fish so they are easier to catch. Or that fishers use compressor engines to pump air through hose pipes, often going 40-metres and beyond in search of their ever-dwindling catch. Many are killed or crippled by decompression sickness. There are sustainable alternatives - consumers can download apps that offer guidance on sourcing fish that’s sustainably caught. The LRFFT offers virtually no sustainable options however, due to byzantine and secretive supply chains and aggressive monopolies. The study includes a number of recommendations for government to play its part by including stronger regulations to crack down on the rampant illegal trade. Traders and retailers meanwhile are encouraged to make traceability a priority. “We are not talking about not eating fish at all,” says Dr Sadovy. “What we are talking about is not eating so many wild fish that we destroy their populations. “We need to know where seafood comes from, that it’s legally sourced, safe to eat, and that it is sustainable”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/11/theresa-may-thinks-facebook-will-police-itself-some-hope","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"Theresa May thinks Facebook will police itself?

Some hope","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It has taken an age, but at last politicians seem to be waking up to the societal problems posed by the dominance of certain tech firms – notably Facebook, Twitter and Google – and in particular the way they are allowing their users to pollute the public sphere with extremist rhetoric, hate speech, trolling and multipurpose abusiveness. The latest occupant of the “techlash” bandwagon is Theresa May, who at the time of writing was still the UK’s prime minister. In her speech last Tuesday in Manchester celebrating the centenary of women’s suffrage, Mrs May fretted that “our public debate today is coarsening” and that “it is becoming harder to disagree, without also demeaning opposing viewpoints in the process”. This was, she said, a threat to democracy. The ideal “of a truly plural and open public debate in which everyone can take part is in danger. A tone of bitterness and aggression has entered into our public debate. Participants in local and national public life – from candidates and elected representatives to campaigners, journalists and commentators – have to contend with regular and sustained abuse.” Since much of that abuse is directed at women who dare to put their heads above the parapet on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, she heartily endorsed the recommendations from the committee on standards in public life of actions that social media companies can take to address this problem. “The companies,” she continued, “must now step up and set out how they will respond positively to those recommendations. So far, their response has been encouraging and I hope they will continue in that spirit.” This is typical Mayspeak: it mimes determination but is devoid of substance. It’s like hoping that the alcohol industry will help to stamp out binge drinking or that food manufacturers will desist from encouraging childhood obesity. Neither industry will comply for the simple reason that their continued prosperity depends on people drinking more alcohol and consuming more sugar and fat. Exactly the same goes for the social media companies: their prosperity depends on expanding “user engagement”, which means encouraging their users to like, share and post whatever it is that turns them on. And if the fact that some of what turns them on turns out to be vile becomes a PR problem, then it should be dealt with as such – much as the alcohol industry deals with binge drinking – because anything more serious would present an existential threat to the companies’ business models. So Mrs May’s hopes for co-operation from Facebook, Twitter, et al are just that – pious hopes. If she had a parliamentary majority and political backbone, she could transform those hopes into legal requirements. But she won’t and, instead, will just plead with the companies to behave more responsibly. On the continent, some of her counterparts have found the necessary resolve. The Germans now have a Network Enforcement Act, which requires social media firms to remove hate speech quickly or face fines of up to £44m. And some years ago the European court of justice bestowed on European citizens the “right to be forgotten”, which enables them to have links to objectionable web content concerning them removed from search results in European countries. At first sight, these measures look positive: elected governments and their institutions finally getting their acts together, using legal measures to stop social-media companies polluting the public sphere. But look a little deeper and you find the thin end of what looks like a disturbing wedge. What’s happening is that public authority is being ceded to private corporations. Or, as the American legal scholar Frank Pasquale put it in a remarkable lecture: territorial sovereignty (the power held by democratic institutions such as courts or parliaments) is being ceded to functional sovereigns (the companies that dominate digital technology). How come? Well, the new German law effectively outsources to social media companies decisions about what shall – and shall not – be published. And the “right to be forgotten” is administered not by a publicly legal institution but by the corporation whose search engine has a monopoly in Europe. It’s to Google that one makes a petition to have objectionable content delisted from search results and it’s Google that weighs the damage to the person making the request against any public interest in the information being available – and makes the decision accordingly. Note the direction of travel here: all this involves the outsourcing to private corporations of public-interest and free-speech decisions that we would normally expect to be made by democratically accountable institutions. This embodies the inferiority complex that has infected democratic states vis-a-vis the tech giants. And the result is the kind of servile cringe implicit in Theresa May’s fond hopes that Facebook will eventually play ball. Dream on, prime minister, dream on.

Calling for the creation of a Scotland-specific visa, the paper underlines the potentially devastating impact of a hard Brexit on immigration, especially in rural areas. Population decline in the Highlands and Islands region has been reversed in the past decade, with EU migrants in particular helping to spur growth. But Scotland is still facing a significant demographic challenge, with more deaths than births forecast every year for the next 25 years. According to current projections, migration will account for all of Scotland’s population growth up to 2041. The paper suggests that in a worst-case scenario where UK net immigration is reduced to the tens of thousands, the GDP impact for Scotland could be more than £10bn per year by 2040. Holyrood’s external affairs minister, Fiona Hyslop, who launched the paper on Wednesday, said: “There is now an overwhelmingly strong case for Scotland to have the power to tailor its own migration policy to reflect its own unique circumstances.” Westminster’s plans to reduce immigration via targets and by leaving the single market would not support Scotland’s economy or its population needs, she added. There are an estimated 219,000 EU citizens living in Scotland and an estimated 135,000 other international immigrants, accounting for 7% of Scotland’s population and playing a vital role in the country’s tourism, agriculture and healthcare sectors. Regardless of the final Brexit settlement, long-term international migration to the UK is forecast to decline after the withdrawal from the EU. The paper reiterates that the Scottish government believes Scotland’s best interests are served by the UK remaining within the single market and continuing to benefit from free movement of people. It goes on to argue for new powers to enable Holyrood to create Scotland-specific policy and systems on immigration. It calls for limited devolution within the current UK immigration system and suggests the development of Scottish visas. It argues that creating a new international migration route to Scotland could promote long-term settlement and support fragile communities. Devolved powers could make it easier for immigrants’ family members to join them in Scotland, the paper says. It notes that residence restrictions may be required to prevent migrants from entering Scotland with the intention of relocating elsewhere in the UK. The paper also calls for the reintroduction of the post-study work visa, which allowed international students to remain in Scotland and work after graduation but which was ended by the UK government in 2012, despite having cross-party support in the Scottish parliament. Last September a Welsh government paper called for reform of UK immigration policy to recognise the distinct needs of Wales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/11/loveless-review-andrey-zvyagintsev-oscar-lost-boy-toxic-world","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T09:00:42Z","webTitle":"Loveless review – a lost boy in a toxic world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/11/loveless-review-andrey-zvyagintsev-oscar-lost-boy-toxic-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/11/loveless-review-andrey-zvyagintsev-oscar-lost-boy-toxic-world","fields":{"headline":"Loveless review – a lost boy in a toxic world","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There is an early image in Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev’s Oscar-nominated Loveless that has haunted me since I first saw the film. A couple in the throes of a messy separation are arguing bitterly about which of them will have to care for their young son, an onerous burden neither wishes to shoulder. As they argue, a door is pulled shut and the camera spies the child, unseen by his parents, standing in the shadows, a white vest accentuating his fragile frame, his face contorted in a silent scream of unloved anguish. It’s a horrifying vision – a snapshot of desolation and despair that shrieks back to the days of pre-sound cinema, to the pure poetry of visual storytelling. It is also emblematic of a film that, with chilly precision, dissects the frozen corpse of a hollow society – personal, national and global. Zvyagintsev has compared Loveless to Ingmar Bergman’s Swedish masterpiece Scenes From a Marriage, but along with the inescapable ghosts of Michelangelo Antonioni’s L’Avventura, I found myself equally reminded of Let the Right One In, the heartbreaking chiller from Bergman’s fellow countryman Tomas Alfredson. Twelve-year-old Alyosha (Matvey Novikov) is the lost soul at the centre of this drama, which was co-written by Zvyagintsev and his regular collaborator, Oleg Negin. Alyosha’s journey home from school takes him through woods littered with discarded red-and-white cordon tape, suggesting a crime scene or danger zone with the hint of a Grimm fable. Alyosha’s father, Boris (Aleksey Rozin), has taken up with a younger woman who is pregnant with his child. Meanwhile his mother, Zhenya (Maryana Spivak), has embarked on a passionate affair with a wealthy older man who calls her “the most wonderful monster in the world”. “I never really loved anyone,” Zhenya announces blankly, confessing that she was “repulsed” by the sight of her own offspring. And then, like Ian McEwan’s child in time, Alyosha disappears – although his parents don’t notice until the school calls to report his absence. The police are uncaring and ineffectual (a recurrent theme of Zvyagintsev’s films), and it’s left to a volunteer group to lead the hunt for the boy, interviewing neighbours, scouring the woods, putting up “Missing” posters. The volunteers are decent and driven, their stoical mission at odds with the dehumanising cycle of suburban life. As for the parents, the disappearance of their child merely sharpens their seething resentment, heightening the state of “lovelessness” in which (we are told) one simply cannot live. In his first feature, The Return (2004), Zvyagintsev painted a powerful portrait of father-son estrangement, filmed in the slate-grey hues of a half-remembered dream. With Elena (2012), he turned a rotting domestic drama into an ice-cool study of deadly family ties in a disconnected society. And in 2014’s Leviathan (which, like Loveless, was nominated for the best foreign language film Oscar), Zvyagintsev offered a pointedly poisonous picture of Russia in which ordinary lives are crushed and torn apart by institutional corruption. All these threads come together in this pitiless parable that evokes a purgatorial state, ruled over by uncaring authorities and godless religion. In thrall to the empty aspirations of modern life (“To love and selfies!”), Boris and Zhenya are tellingly described by Zvyagintsev as “an average middle-class couple… devoid of any real self-awareness or doubt”. In this unfeeling, post-industrial environment, happiness is a commodity, just as family stability has become a status symbol. Absurdly, Boris’s boss rules his workplace with a strict Christian ethos; for him, domestic bliss is not a life goal but a job requirement, a facade to be preserved at all costs. Meanwhile, news stations spew stories of “apocalyptic sentiments” and encroaching wars, the background noise of a world in turmoil. As the domestic drama mutates into anxious investigation, so the sense of existential dread amplifies, leading us to the remote lair of an embittered grandparent, and to cavernous abandoned buildings in which lost boys (of which there are many) may take refuge from their toxic home lives. All the while, cinematographer Mikhail Krichman’s camera conducts an investigation of its own, lingering on a crawl space in the roots of a tree, gliding over lonely waters. It’s profoundly uncomfortable viewing: mournful, monstrous and weirdly mesmerising."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business-to-business/2018/feb/21/young-entrepreneurs-dont-need-the-additional-gamble-of-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business-to-business","sectionName":"Business to business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T16:33:40Z","webTitle":"Young entrepreneurs don't need the additional gamble of Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2018/feb/21/young-entrepreneurs-dont-need-the-additional-gamble-of-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business-to-business/2018/feb/21/young-entrepreneurs-dont-need-the-additional-gamble-of-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Young entrepreneurs don't need the additional gamble of Brexit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When it comes to young entrepreneurs and Brexit, there are upsides and downsides. On one hand, smaller businesses are probably the most equipped to navigate whatever is yet to come. SMEs are adaptable, innovative, and nimble in their mindset. Every day brings with it a new challenge that small business owners never thought they would have to deal with. So the unfamiliarity and uncertainty around Brexit is something SMEs can be better prepared for. On the other hand, young entrepreneurs often have the least amount of experience and resources. If you think about your average startup, the first hire is probably not a head of HR and it is unlikely to have in-house legal counsel. Yet those are the types of employees it is probably going to need as it navigates Brexit. Then there’s the emotional side of it. I have heard so many young entrepreneurs talking about the uncertainty of Brexit and saying they don’t need an additional gamble at the moment. If you’re starting out, you may feel you’d be better off moving to Berlin or Paris. Brexit is also often talked about in terms of a vacuum, as if it’s just about the UK. You have to look at what’s going on elsewhere. For example, banks in Germany are seeing this as a huge opportunity and making it as attractive as possible for young people to start their business in Berlin, and the same goes for Paris and New York. Statistics have shown that investment has not died down in the UK but we’re seeing more funding going to startups on the continent. Many people came to the UK to start a business because it was a booming tech hub for many years and a place where young entrepreneurs could thrive. But the Brexit vote has brought that feeling of not being welcome, and you don’t want to set up a business where you don’t feel wanted. So, you’re left with two options – to stay and fight or to go elsewhere. My message to any young entrepreneur is to plan for the worst, but don’t spend too much time on it. There’s no use worrying about worst-case scenarios because we genuinely don’t know what’s going to happen. Be open to all of the other opportunities and solutions out there, and also think about the rest of Europe.

Our writers discuss","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shaista Aziz: True feminism gives a voice to the most marginalised women Last year I was selected to stand as a candidate on an all-women shortlist in Oxford city council’s 2018 election in Rose Hill and Iffley ward. I put myself forward after taking part in a year-long political mentoring programme run by the Fabian Women’s Network to increase the representation of women in politics. This scheme totally demystified power and politics for me, and helped me understand even more clearly why women with intersectional identities are still missing from the hallways, corridors, rooms and chambers in the House of Commons. We are locked out from these spaces because of structural inequalities that exist in wider society. There is no level playing field for women with intersectional identities: for black women, lesbian women, trans women, disabled women, Muslim women, women of faith and working-class women. It doesn’t matter how talented we are or how much we know, we face reinforced concrete ceilings in politics based on discrimination. The inconvenient truth is that the so-called sisterhood doesn’t work for all women; it never has and it never will unless the gatekeepers understand they need to make way for the most marginalised women to step to the front and amplify their voices – this is what true feminism is. Many white cis women – the women with power and privilege – are just as likely as some white men to pull up the ladder behind them, and in so doing further reinforce the patriarchy. There should be absolutely no question of self-identifying trans women being accepted on all-women short lists. Of course our trans sisters should be in this space. These are the women on the margins of our society and most at risk of rape, sexual violence and abuse. • Shaista Aziz is a journalist and a member of the Fabian women’s executive committee Susanna Rustin: Of course all women are eligible, but female anatomy is not irrelevant All women must be eligible for all-women shortlists, and the current furore – which is not limited to the Labour party: this week also saw a confrontation on breakfast TV about whether trans women are entitled to work in women’s shelters – is partly the government’s fault. Last summer’s promise to consult on plans to adopt a non-medical system of gender “self-declaration” has not been followed through. The current, angst-ridden limbo is the result. Clearly those responsible for managing such sensitive single-sex settings as refuges, prisons or sports clubs must have some process of verification. It cannot simply be enough to say: “I am a woman”. Apart from anything else, such a non-system would be an invitation to cheats – or, as one Labour MP said of shortlists, male activists who object to women-only selections and wish to subvert them. Which is not to say that a new law will sort everything out. We are in the midst of a profound societal shift, and decisions about single-sex spaces will have to be made case by case. But until the expected self-declaration system – whereby a trans person can change their gender permanently without a quasi-legal examination – is properly worked out, we are stuck. And where we are stuck is awful. Most importantly, it is awful for transgender people, because their lives and futures have been left hanging. But as the debate surrounding gender identity has become more polarised, and the divergence of views between trans activists and some feminists has hardened into a standoff, others too have come under attack. Clearly some women are prejudiced against trans people. But the label “transphobic” should not be hurled at anyone who has the temerity to suggest that the interests of trans women and other vulnerable women might sometimes come into conflict. Meanwhile, and whatever gender theory says, many of us (myself included) are struggling to keep up. I understand that gender identity and biological sex are different, and that anyway biological sex is not so straightforward as was once thought. I believe in a non-binary future (the writers Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Virginia Woolf, two of my heroes, were pioneers of such ideas). But theory and life are not the same, and the fact is that for many women, our female bodies (periods, fertility, fear of female cancers, awareness of men’s greater physical strength) feel like an important part of our identities. Sexual violence, laws that force girls and women who have been raped to give birth, shoddy maternity services: the oppression of women can take brutally physical forms, and while female anatomy isn’t an essential characteristic of a “woman”, nor can it be dismissed as an irrelevance. Yes, trans people are arguably the most vulnerable and persecuted minority there is. But misogyny is real too, and the hatred and disgust aroused by female bodies is one of the reasons why we still need feminism. That there is no easy route out of this goes without saying. The risk to the wider progressive cause, of rival groups of activists getting stuck in a culture war cul-de-sac, are obvious. At least Labour, by addressing the question of all-women shortlists, is trying to find a way through. • Susanna Rustin is a Guardian writer and editor Shon Faye: How would a man benefit from posing as a trans woman? Trans women, like all women, have immensely different experiences from each other. Some begin living as their authentic selves before puberty, some in their teens, some at 40 and some even later. Trans women can be gay or straight, white women or women of colour, disabled or non-disabled, we can be Muslim or Christian or atheist. We can be anarcho-communists or home counties Tories. As a result, arguments to exclude trans women from all-women shortlists based on our natal sex alone become incoherent, given that they normally rest on reductive and totalising assumptions about how trans women are socialised, usually in contrast to other women. Our difference is highlighted and what we share with fellow women is erased. It’s why campaigns for blanket bans on trans women quickly descend into the same old dehumanising rhetoric about genitals – which is strange, given that I have never had cause to write to my MP inquiring about theirs. Many trans women will share the same setbacks as other women in life: sexual violence or its threat, the expectation we should fulfil feminised roles of caregiving and the pay gap. We also face the same obstacles all women in politics face: belittling and dismissive attitudes from men, media scrutiny based on our looks, social media abuse, being excluded from the old boys’ club of men’s social networks and so on. As a result, it is entirely just and appropriate that trans women be able to access support systems to boost women’s representation in parliament, such as all-women shortlists. “What if men pretend to be trans to get a seat?” is the last refuge of the desperate. Politics is already a game rigged for incompetent white men – how would such a man benefit from posing as a trans woman? Let’s be honest: if a trans woman gets on to a shortlist she still has to win the candidacy (against the other women) and then ultimately the seat to enter parliament – against the immense prejudices and scrutiny that comes from being an out trans woman in public life. The idea that self ID facilitates an easy route for men or anyone not deadly serious about their identity as a trans woman to sneak into parliament – or anywhere else for that matter – is a canard and a weak one at that. In 10 years we’ll all cringe that this was even a discussion. • Shon Faye is a writer, artist and standup comedian Sonia Sodha: Be wary of anybody claiming absolute moral certainty The trans rights debate has become deeply toxic, in part because of what people perceive there to be at stake, but also, I suspect, in part because of a lack of understanding of each other’s perspectives. It’s all-or-nothing: some trans advocates deny there may be legitimate questions about how to balance the rights of trans and cis women, and denounce those asking them as transphobic. Some cis feminists seem unwilling to give way on anything, fearing a slippery slope that ends with their hard-won rights being trampled. I support making it much less intrusive for people to register their gender as different from the one they were assigned at birth; it’s clearly demeaning for trans people to have to be diagnosed with a medical condition in order to change their gender. But I think it’s wrong for supporters of trans rights to say it’s transphobic for women to ask questions about spaces that exist to protect women from male violence. Of course some trans women have suffered male violence, and are no less deserving of protection. But if changing your gender is a matter of self-declaration, what safeguards are there to stop male criminals disingenuously declaring themselves female to get themselves out of a violent men’s prison and into a women’s prison? What would happen if a trans woman with a history of sexual violence against women – and who still has male sex organs – says it’s their right to be in a women’s prison? These are questions that need exploring, and risks that need mitigating. I don’t see the same clash of rights in all-women shortlists. Trans women face no less discrimination when it comes to politics than cis women; there are none in parliament. Trans women make up a tiny percentage of the population and I can’t see men faking being trans in order to get on to a women’s shortlist. This could represent an opportunity for two groups to come together and argue for Labour to expand its use of all-women shortlists – that are inclusive of trans women – even further; it’s a shame that this seems unlikely. At heart, these are fundamentally complex issues that involve competing rights, and are not easy to resolve. We should be wary of anyone claiming absolute moral certainty. • Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/07/death-dpd-courier-don-lane-tragedy-business-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T14:19:54Z","webTitle":"700,000 gig workers paid below national minimum wage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/07/death-dpd-courier-don-lane-tragedy-business-secretary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/07/death-dpd-courier-don-lane-tragedy-business-secretary","fields":{"headline":"700,000 gig workers paid below national minimum wage","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A quarter of people working in Britain’s fast-growing gig economy are being paid below the national minimum wage, government research has revealed.

The national minimum wage does not apply to self-employed workers. About 2.8 million people worked in the gig economy in the 12 months to August 2017, including freelancers and one-person businesses, the research estimated. Most used it to supplement other work. It found that 42% had worked for courier firms, 37% on apps or websites such as Task Rabbit and 28% for minicab apps such as Uber. Takeaway delivery gig workers accounted for 21%. The chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee, Frank Field, said the figures showed gig work was now “the single biggest force in the British economy undermining the national living wage”. He wants the minimum wage extended “to the small army of workers who are exposed to poverty pay because they are forced into forms of self-employment that are unrecognisable to most people”. The extent of low pay in the gig economy came amid growing concern at the government’s ability to tackle the negative consequences of a sector that has boomed following the advent of phone apps such as Uber and Deliveroo. The business secretary, Greg Clark, admitted on Wednesday that the death of a diabetic gig courier for DPD, Don Lane, was a “terrible tragedy” and faced claims that none of the long-awaited labour market reforms the government announced would have saved him. Lane, 53, collapsed and died from diabetes after being fined £150 by the courier company DPD for attending a hospital appointment to treat his disease. On Monday the Guardian revealed he had missed three other hospital appointments to treat kidney damage, partly because he was afraid of being fined. He collapsed at the wheel of his van while on deliveries a few months later before dying in January. Amid widespread anger at his treatment, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, told the House of Commons: “The tragic case of Don Lane, DPD gig worker, epitomised the precarious and unstable working life many people face and the failure of the government to protect workers.” She said: “They needed to do something bold today but it appears they are simply papering over these bleak realities with rhetoric. Launching four consultations, merely considering proposals and tweaking the law here and there is not good enough. How would any of this have actually helped Don Lane? It simply wouldn’t, that’s the fact of the matter.” The business minister Andrew Griffiths replied that the government was “acting to ensure good work for all” and said “millions of workers will get greater rights and the access to more protection”. He said: “The house should be clear. We are consulting in order to act.” Lane was treated by DPD as self-employed and there was anger from similar gig economy workers on Wednesday at the government’s planned labour market reforms. Clark said Lane’s death was “a terrible tragedy” and added: “Anyone who is performing work should be clear in a way that too often they are not at the moment whether they are an employee, whether they are a contractor, in which case they are entitled to sick pay. And if they are self-employed then the contractual terms that they operate under must not be so onerous that they should be abusive.” He added: “If they are self-employed then it is very important that those conditions should not be so onerous as to be unreasonable for example for a person who is sick to be able to take an appointment.” In a statement DPD said Lane should not have been fined but denied not accommodating his health needs. Employment lawyers on Wednesday called the government’s response to the review by Matthew Taylor of modern working practices “underwhelming” and “feeble”, amid widespread fears that significant reform could be slow in coming. The chief executive of the employment lawyer Thompsons, Stephen Cavalier, said: “It is a limp response to a limp report, which offers nothing but vague platitudes which don’t get to the heart of the issue. On the fundamental issue of defining whether someone is an employee, a worker or self-employed, all that is proposed in the report is yet more consultation.” Susannah Kintish at Mishcon de Reya , who is representing Pimlico Plumbers in a supreme court case about the employment status of its plumbers, said: “The proposals seem underwhelming. There seems to be a focus on transparency rather than any fundamental changes to the law on employment status.” A spokesperson for the business department said the Taylor review showed the majority of people in the gig economy enjoy the independence and flexibility of their work. “But we recognise that this is not always the case which is why we will be making it easier for all workers to understand their rights and have them enforced, as part of our major workplace reforms.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/11/dublin-carol-sherman-theatre-cardiff-review-conor-mcpherson","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T08:00:42Z","webTitle":"Dublin Carol review – an undertaker battles with the bottle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/11/dublin-carol-sherman-theatre-cardiff-review-conor-mcpherson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/11/dublin-carol-sherman-theatre-cardiff-review-conor-mcpherson","fields":{"headline":"Dublin Carol review – an undertaker battles with the bottle","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Decorations feebly festoon the back room of the funeral parlour. It’s Christmas Eve. John (Simon Wolfe) is an undertaker who has undertaken to avoid the chronic drunkenness of his past, but not to give up the drink. He sups whisky from a mug and talks. Conor McPherson’s 2000 play is a straight-through, 80-minute chamber piece in three scenes. A central encounter with Mary (Siwan Morris), the daughter John has not seen for 10 years, is flanked by two conversations with his young temporary helper, Mark (Julian Moore-Cook). Verbal vignettes paint vivid pictures of John’s destructively alcohol-fuelled life. His accounts of himself are sharp with self-pity, self-justification and misogyny. Mark’s account of failing to connect with the girlfriend he tries to dump suggests he may be setting out on the path of isolation and betrayal that John has taken. Mary exists only in relation to her father: an accuser, a potential agent of reconciliation and redemption; she shares her father’s misogyny. McPherson’s piece echoes Dickens’s A Christmas Carol, with chiming bells marking the passage of time and a pervading sense of the supernatural. Director Matthew Xia amplifies these intimations of something beyond. Naturalistic set and acting are layered by electronic hums, the wordless melodies of invisible voices, lights that brighten and dim according to mood. This heightened level of symbolism, rather than intensifying John’s psychodrama, exposes the contrivance of McPherson’s dialogue – a pretext for revelations that at times seem lifted from Victorian melodrama. Xia’s decision to challenge the naturalist form feels right, but doesn’t find its alternative. • Dublin Carol is at the Sherman theatre, Cardiff, until 17 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/07/theresa-may-press-inquiry-phone-hacking-journalism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T13:30:34Z","webTitle":"Is May’s press inquiry just a way of putting Leveson 2 on the back burner? | Roy Greenslade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/07/theresa-may-press-inquiry-phone-hacking-journalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/07/theresa-may-press-inquiry-phone-hacking-journalism","fields":{"headline":"Is May’s press inquiry just a way of putting Leveson 2 on the back burner?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The prime minister’s decision to hold an inquiry into “the sustainability of Britain’s printed press” received little more than a cautious welcome from newspaper publishers. Theresa May might have been expecting exultant editorials in praise of her initiative. Instead, aside from hugely supportive leading articles in the Daily Mail and the Sun, there was a resounding silence. Why? Because there is a deep suspicion about the efficacy of inquiries. As the Daily Telegraph remarked: “The danger with any state inquiry into the press is that it risks becoming a way of controlling or influencing it.” Doubtless, the paper had in mind the continuing threat of a second Leveson inquiry. But May, in coming up with this new “review”, has surely consigned that to the back burner. Her message: forget phone-hacking, forget press misbehaviour, let’s bring Silicon Valley to heel. Once the majority of publishers appreciate what she has done, they will applaud her, with the loudest cheers coming from those who oversee the beleaguered newspapers that serve Britain’s cities and towns. For years, they have been calling for something to be done about Google and Facebook, arguing that both steal their content while luring away their advertisers. The result has been falling profits for “old media” and consequent closures of regional and local titles accompanied by a sizeable reduction in the number of journalists, rightly described by May as “a hollowing-out of newsrooms”. This is hardly a new story, and there has been plenty of political lobbying from publishing organisations in order to persuade the government that their industry’s decline requires attention. These pleas for action have been couched in terms of a warning that the nation is in danger of losing its “free press”, which, to quote the Daily Mail, therefore represents an “insidious threat to British democracy”. A free press, eh? Would that be the press owned and controlled by rich men – yes, men – or profiteering conglomerates that have been propagandists for a “free market” and opposed all regulatory intervention? Would that be the free press that has traditionally championed business competition and praised the virtue of technological innovation in other industries where jobs have been wiped out? It was noticeable that May also ignored such ironies when contending that the decline of newspapers is “dangerous for our democracy” and that the loss of “trusted and credible news sources” makes us “vulnerable to news which is untrustworthy”. Given that untrustworthy news has been the stock in trade of national titles like the Mail for generations it was hard not to laugh at her disingenuousness. But let me put all that to one side for a moment and accept that May’s intentions are not all bad. There is an urgent need to create a new funding landscape for journalism, one that might benefit from a contribution from the overflowing coffers of Google and Facebook or, more controversially, from public subsidy. Although newspapers in their printed form have a limited life, most have attracted large online audiences. But it has been difficult to generate sufficient income from these “eyeballs”, to use the advertising jargon, to fund what May called “high-quality journalism”. An inquiry, which needs to act swiftly if the situation is not to worsen dramatically, must look at the way in which regional and local papers have retreated from public-service reporting. Judges and local authority politicians complain about the lack of journalists in courts, inquests and at council meetings. According to Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, the inquiry is to be led by “a panel of experts”, and it will be fascinating to see who is recruited. Much will depend on the composition of that panel and on its powers. Will it include the necessary range of opinion? Will it meet in public? Will it be able to compel people to give evidence? And what status will its eventual report, which is supposed to be compiled by early next year, command in parliament? I want to believe that May is sincere in her desire to save journalism. But if she thinks her cheerleading supporter, the Daily Mail, represents the best example of press freedom’s merits, it does not bode well for the outcome. • Roy Greenslade is professor of journalism at City University, and was editor of the Daily Mirror from 1990 to 1991"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/07/george-groves-chris-eubank-jr-boxing-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T12:51:49Z","webTitle":"George Groves: ‘I don’t want to be damaged, but I haven’t earned enough yet’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/07/george-groves-chris-eubank-jr-boxing-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/07/george-groves-chris-eubank-jr-boxing-interview","fields":{"headline":"George Groves: ‘I don’t want to be damaged, but I haven’t earned enough yet’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“They are a funny little team, the Eubanks,” George Groves says wryly at the back of a restaurant in Wandsworth. The WBA super-middleweight world champion rocks in his chair as he considers Chris Eubank Jr and his famously verbose father, Chris Sr, by taking an amusing diversion from a bout which is likely to be fought with grave seriousness a week on Saturday in Manchester. Groves and the Eubanks understand the terrible dangers – for they have all left rivals in an induced coma and damaged by boxing. The world championship fight between Groves and Eubank Jr, a semi-final in the World Boxing Super Series tournament that could see the winner meet Callum Smith in the final this summer, is likely to be another bitterly contested battle. But, in his last week of training, Groves is almost demob-happy as he contemplates the surreal Eubank double-act. “I don’t know whether it’s Monty Python, the Office or Alan Partridge,” he says with a grin. “Actually it’s the Office. The dad is Ricky Gervais and the son is Gareth. And I’m Tim – the fellow who looks around at the camera and thinks, ‘Can’t anybody see what’s going on here?’ “Talksport did a video of Junior sparring and the dad decided, ‘I need to make this about me.’ But he embarrasses himself because he says: ‘Just go to the body’ – and Junior hits the kid straight in the chin. The lad he’s sparring has had two fights – won one, drawn one. But Junior looks terrible. He doesn’t even want dad there. You can see him thinking: ‘They’ve come down to video me, Dad. It’s not about you.’ I can imagine they have a really difficult relationship.” Groves smiles when I ask what his wife, Sophie, whom he has known since they were at primary school, thinks of the Eubanks. “There is something about them that is a bit crazy – but Sophie had a soft spot for the dad because he’d said kind words about me once. After the fight against James DeGale [whom Groves beat in 2011] she took me out for a birthday lunch with my family to the Dorchester. I thought: ‘I know who I’m going to see today – Eubank Sr. Walking around. He’s always there, dressed as a waiter, and I don’t fancy a chat.’ Of course Eubank spotted me and he came over and said some lovely words. Sophie liked him and I felt he was all right.” All three fighting men have suffered in boxing, primarily through the tragic hurt they have caused others, and it does not take long for Groves to become pensive. He believes Eubank Sr has alluded too much to the harm his son did to Nick Blackwell in March 2016. Groves and Blackwell had sparred intensively before that fight – and his friend had struggled. But Blackwell was brave and, against Eubank Jr, he endured a savage beating before the bout was stopped in the 10th round. Blackwell spent the next nine days in an induced coma. He recovered – only to put his health back in jeopardy after some illicit sparring eight months later. That same month, in November 2016, Groves pummelled Eduard Gutknecht while outpointing him at Wembley Arena. The German refused to give in but he collapsed in his dressing room. Emergency surgery was carried out that night and when Gutknecht was brought back to consciousness five weeks later he could no longer function normally. He returned to Germany, mute and in a wheelchair. The horror echoes the trauma suffered by Michael Watson in 1991 against Eubank Sr. Watson ended up in a coma and, all these years later, he is still marked by the consequences. It is in the bleak and grainy light of this shared history that Groves takes offence. “The dad has been extremely boisterous, trying to pressure the referee. Talking about his son needing someone to protect his opponents is a miserable thing to say. Out of the three of us, his dad and myself were more implicated in how badly we hurt people. Obviously Junior hurt Nick but the dad is trying to exploit this situation because he knows I don’t want to go down that route. “The dad’s trying to keep himself relevant. And it’s also a ploy to aid his son. If Junior decides to pop me with a flurry of shots he’s hoping the referee will stop it prematurely. But from the evidence of the sparring there’s nothing to worry about. Even if there was, you would say such things behind closed doors. That’s what annoys me. He’s saying it every other tweet. Senior’s lost the plot, which often happens to people addicted to fame.” I like Groves and, just as I felt awkward when questioning Eubank about Watson in 1991, it’s not easy asking the 29-year-old Londoner if he considered abandoning boxing after visiting Gutknecht. “I don’t think Gutknecht’s family will mind me saying they were really supportive of me. They said: ‘It’s a sport. We totally understand.’ But it’s heartbreaking because he’s got three kids. His sister came over after the fight – and she’d just had twins – to see him. I’ve been in touch since and we’ve sent money and stuff as a way of trying to support them. “But there was a period where I thought: ‘I can’t wait until it’s over.’ I’ve got a family, a son, and I don’t want to be damaged. It happens but I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone else. But I’ve not got enough out of boxing yet. I haven’t earned enough money so I’ll keep boxing a while longer.” Groves lost painfully, twice, to Carl Froch and also to Badou Jack in Las Vegas. He finally became a world champion at his fourth attempt when defeating Fedor Chudinov last May – but just before his elation was confirmed he had looked to the referee in an attempt to avoid a similar catastrophe to Gutknecht. “Don’t get me wrong, I wanted the fight over because I wanted to become world champion. But in the sixth I was landing big shots and he falls into me and I’m holding him. I look to the ref as if to say, ‘What do you reckon?’ It was that feeling of, ‘How many times do you reckon I’ve got to hit this guy?’ “I would have kept throwing punches until the referee stopped me – but there was a relief afterwards. Chudinov is one of the toughest guys I fought. It was only the slump of his shoulders that made me think he’s hurt because there’s no grimace, or rolling eyes. He was never going down.” What does he see when he looks into Eubank Jr’s haughtily impassive face? “He wants to move on from his dad and step into the light. He’s well rehearsed and whenever he wins he’s decided: ‘I’m going to show no emotion because that looks strong.’ It’s an act. I’m sure he’s a big-night fighter but will he truly be able to relish the big stage against a guy who has done it before? I am much bigger and hit harder than him. “He’s got two ways to approach this fight. He could bounce around, be the showman and try to steal rounds. Or he’s going to try to fight fire with fire and walk through shots and hope he tires me. Neither will work and if he tries to fight me like Jamie Cox [stopped by a venomous Groves body shot last October] I can’t see how he’s going to handle me.” Groves fought Froch in front of 80,000 people at Wembley Stadium. He was knocked out that night, in May 2014, but six months earlier he had dropped Froch and nearly caused a huge upset. Does this build-up replicate such intensity? “Not in the slightest. With Froch everyone was questioning me and I was trying to prove a point. But I don’t think this fight is anywhere near that level of difficulty. I am a much better fighter now than against Froch. Callum Smith [who fights Jürgen Brähmer in the second semi-final on Saturday 24 February] will be much more of a test than Junior. Callum is big, strong and punches hard. But he blows hot and cold. We’ll see how good he is if he makes the final.” Groves will spend next week in Manchester – and face Eubank Jr and Sr as the hype goes into overdrive. He looks relaxed at the prospect. “Although you’re peaceful at home you might also be sorting out the bins. Sophie will come up for the weigh-in and we usually stay in the same room the night before the fight. Barry McGuigan [the former world champion whose son Shane trains Groves] is old school so he wouldn’t approve. But I want to hang out with Sophie. She knows the score and we can talk about anything but boxing – which is better than people asking, ‘How’re you feeling?’” The Groves might be less amusing and more homely than the Eubanks – with nothing resembling David Brent or the Office in their chatter – but ordinary calm must help before another fight where glory and danger loom. “The Eubanks are very different,” Groves agrees. “If you look at the promotional videos they’ve done it’s a bit Homes Under the Hammer.” Groves offers a detailed impersonation of Eubank Jr hamming it up for the camera and, as he laughs, it’s easy to forget the trouble they have all witnessed. In this pause before another serious fight breaks out, Groves smiles in the airy light. There will be time enough, next week, for gravity and darkness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/07/police-scotland-chief-phil-gormley-quits-misconduct-claims-investigated","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T13:47:21Z","webTitle":"Police Scotland chief quits as misconduct claims are investigated","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/07/police-scotland-chief-phil-gormley-quits-misconduct-claims-investigated","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/07/police-scotland-chief-phil-gormley-quits-misconduct-claims-investigated","fields":{"headline":"Police Scotland chief quits as misconduct claims are investigated","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The head of Police Scotland has resigned with immediate effect, saying it was impossible for him to resume his duties in a meaningful way. Phil Gormley, who was named chief constable of the UK’s second-largest police force in December 2015, has been on special leave since July pending an investigation into a string of misconduct allegations against him. He denies any wrongdoing. In a statement, Gormley said: “The past eight months have been difficult for me and my family. In particular, I would like to thank my wife for her love and loyalty. “The events since November 2017 have led me to the conclusion that it is impossible for me to resume my duties in a meaningful way prior to the end of my contract. I now need to prioritise the health and wellbeing of my family, on whom these events have taken a significant toll.” The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner is investigating four complaints of bullying, while three are being assessed internally. The latest complaint, which was lodged at the end of January, is understood to have been made to the Scottish Police Authority by the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. Susan Deacon, the chair of the SPA, thanked Gormley for his contribution to Scottish policing. “This has been a challenging period for all concerned, and in the interest of policing in Scotland, we now need to move on,” she said. His resignation marks the latest stage in a tumultuous period for the force. Four other senior officers have been suspended in recent months, two as part of a criminal inquiry into the unauthorised use of a police firing range. The saga took on a significant political dimension when Gormley’s lawyer accused the Scottish justice secretary, Michael Matheson, of acting unlawfully by intervening in a decision by the SPA to allow the chief constable to return to work in November. Subsequent revelations that Matheson had told the SPA it was “a bad decision” brought calls for the justice secretary to consider his position, which were reiterated on Wednesday following Gormley’s resignation. The shadow Scottish justice secretary, Liam Kerr, said: “Mr Gormley makes clear in his resignation statement that it was the events of November 2017, when Michael Matheson intervened to prevent his return to work, that made it impossible for him to carry on. “It suggests that, less than two years after his appointment, the SNP government intervened to force him out. Michael Matheson may hope that the stink hanging over this affair will clear with Mr Gormley’s departure. It won’t. That will only happen when Mr Matheson does the decent thing and follows the former chief constable out of the door.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/feb/10/the-surreal-success-of-mgmt-i-assumed-it-would-all-go-away-like-it-was-all-a-dream","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-10T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"The surreal success of MGMT: 'I assumed it would all go away.

Like it was all a dream'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"MGMT were huge. The duo graced 2008 with three festival classics: Time to Pretend provided them with a manifesto, Kids an anthem and Electric Feel a floorfiller. Their synth-swathed astral indie seemed a logical progression from nu-rave’s MDMA epiphanies to tuning into the cosmos on LSD. They were part of a group of acts, which included Yeasayer, Passion Pit and Santogold, who went from Brooklyn warehouse infamy to suddenly proper on-David-Letterman famous. Along the way, they inspired a Gucci runway show and made hippy headbands a thing. Behind the scenes, however, the relationship between the two members was of complementary opposites: the analytical Ben Goldwasser and the free-spirited Andrew VanWyngarden. “It’s strange,” Simon O’Connor of fellow Brooklynites Amazing Baby told Rolling Stone in 2010. “There would be weeks where they didn’t even speak to each other. Then they’d spend a whole day writing in Ben’s room, and then go their separate ways again. They’re like a married couple that has really good sex but that’s it.” Despite the critical and commercial success of their debut, Oracular Spectacular, this odd couple didn’t want to play the rock star game. They refused to play Kids at their shows and followed that culture-shifting debut LP with two albums of purposefully oblique acid rock: Congratulations from 2010 featured a five-minute prog jam called Lady Dada’s Nightmare, while 2013’s MGMT was swiftly forgotten about. Now, after years of being out of sync, the oscillations of culture are again lining up with MGMT. On their new album, Little Dark Age, they have returned to the electro tinge of their debut at the moment the 00s are being revived (Electric Feel has endured a second life, being sampled by Frank Ocean and Beyoncé and covered by Katy Perry). And, crucially, the frosty relationship between band and audience has thawed. “On the last album, there was much more of a sense of laughing at, rather than with,” VanWyngarden tells me about their self-titled 2013 album, filled with ear-splitting production and washed-out Syd Barrett-esque melodies. “But we even say it on this one: ‘I’ll be laughing with you when you die.’” Exactly 10 years and one day since the release of Oracular Spectacular, we are sitting at Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds, the band’s favourite pie shop, a few blocks up from their Prospect Park rehearsal space. Goldwasser, who has arrived 15 minutes before his bandmate, adds shruggingly: “It wasn’t like we were in a bad mood making the [last album].” He lives in LA now and has flown into New York for rehearsals; VanWyngarden still lives in a house in Rockaway Beach, a far-off, terminally uncool quarter of the city, out near JFK. The pair don’t really greet each other. The body language is not overly moist. VanWyngarden, hunched on his stool, occasionally chews on a cuticle as he mulls over a question. He recommends the lemon chess pie (“It’s about half lemon and half chess”). Do you two ever hang out? “We’ve gone through different phases of hanging out and being, like, normal friends, and that’s not easy these days because Ben lives in LA,” says VanWyngarden. “He’s got a dog with a backyard, and I’m in Rockaway and so we’re not like staying together and walking through parking lots like we were at college. We’ve gone through times where we had disagreements or it’s been tense. But we rode it out and it seems good now.” If there’s one thing that unites them, they say, it’s a surreal sense of humour, “like, realising that some inanimate object looks like a face; I don’t know, something like that,” Goldwasser suggests, slightly mystifyingly. Still, a decade on from their debut there has been a fundamental crack in their relationship: they’re living three time zones apart and making albums by email. “Which is why we call our band the Postal Service,” VanWyngarden quips. It’s left to Beyoncé and Solange collaborator and former Chairlift member Patrick Wimberly, who co-produced their new album, to decode their functional dysfunctionality. “They’re not attached to each other because of contracts or obligations,” he explains via email. “They’ve tapped into a connection that encourages them both to dig deep into their own ideas. At times it seems like they have their own language.” In one way, their creative journey could be read as an ongoing attempt to get back to the Eden they shared as friends at Wesleyan, the famously liberal Connecticut college for brainiac artsy degenerates (also home to Vampire Weekend). They were both studying music and taking classes on esoteric sound design when an EP that included Kids and Time to Pretend made it into the hands of a label exec at Columbia. A month later, they were toasting their new contract with $24 bellinis in midtown Manhattan and demanding fur coats from their new bosses, and puppies on their rider, because “puppies are awesome”. Apt, given that Time to Pretend was a satirical yet wistful rubbishing of the rock star ideal (“Let’s make some music, make some money, find some models for wives,” they sang in unison. “I’ll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars”). “That was the whole shtick of the band when we started,” Goldwasser says. “That we’d be playing in someone’s living room, wearing fur coats and drinking champagne in front of, like, 15 people.” (Not long after this piece of cosmic ordering, VanWyngarden dated two world-class models: Camille Rowe and Andreea Diaconu). The horizons were vast, but their success was so accidental that it seemed like one big mirage. “I was happy doing what we were doing,” Goldwasser recalls. “But I just … kind of, I didn’t think that it was going to turn into anything at that point. I kind of assumed it would all go away. Like it was all a dream.” Retreating to their own separate worlds on this new record seems to have helped creatively, carving a new comfort zone between pop and experimental. One song, TSLAMP, is a witty lament against “Time Spent Looking At My Phone”. VanWyngarden explains: “I’ve gotten so attached to my phone that it makes me really disappointed in myself. So it’s good to [not look at it].” Has he tried un-attaching himself? “I recently purchased a little coffin that fits a cellphone on eBay. I’ve tried to use that.” The state of the nation has also inspired their lyrics. “There’s a lot of stuff on the record relating to the last year,” VanWyngarden considers. “What Trump has done is just expose a whole lot of things that were there already. Like: is America bad? In When You Die, when we’re saying “I’m not that nice”, it’s owning up to existing in a modern United States of America: you’re kind of part of this evil whether you want to be or not.” The only question left is whether they can still include each other in their lives.

The announcement of Mark Carne’s retirement comes just over four years after he joined the rail infrastructure company, taking over an ambitious but poorly costed programme of works that Network Rail soon concluded it could not deliver in full. It also follows the collapse of the East Coast franchise where Stagecoach, the parent company of Virgin Trains East Coast, has argued that delays to Network Rail works made its £3.3bn contract untenable. The timing of Carne’s announcement means a new chief executive will be in place before Network Rail’s next five-year work programme begins in April 2019. The company is submitting a business plan this week, and Carne has pledged not to saddle the organisation with the kind of programme that left him facing parliamentary inquests after electrification schemes ran massively over budget. Carne, 58, a former Shell oil executive, came straight in at the top of the rail industry in January 2014. His tenure was shaped by the audit office’s decision to reclassify Network Rail as part of the public sector, a move that turned off the easy credit that had allowed the industry to absorb unexpected costs, and put its spending under scrutiny. Joining the public sector also placed his £820,000 salary under scrutiny. After facing criticism during his first Christmas in the job when engineering works overran and prompted chaotic scenes at London stations, Carne saw some of the biggest projects in the company’s history through to completion – notably London Bridge station, which opened on schedule at the start of 2018, and Birmingham New Street before. Carne was said by staff to have spent significant time with the frontline workforce and was a popular figure. The Network Rail chairman, Sir Peter Hendy, who will lead the search for a successor, paid tribute to Carne for delivering upgrades to the railway while personally championing better safety and working cultures. He said: “His leadership steadied the ship during the challenging transition to a public sector organisation and he has been the architect behind the huge positive changes in the company, driving transformation, devolution and efficiency, with an emphasis on equality and diversity too.” The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said Carne had done an excellent job, and had provided strong industry leadership on safety and a programme to speed up the overhaul of signalling in order to bring new capacity to the railway. Grayling also applauded Carne’s moves to devolve power within Network Rail to regional routes, which the minister said would “build the foundations for a more efficient and passenger-focused organisation”. Carne, who will remain in place during negotiations with the Treasury over Network Rail’s next budget, said: “Britain’s railways matter to the lives of millions of people. The men and women who run the railway are enormously committed and it has been a privilege to lead the organisation at a time of huge investment and transformational change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/henrys-bath-restaurant-review-a-thoroughly-lovely-expression-of-the-owner-jay-rayner","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T06:00:38Z","webTitle":"Henry’s, Bath: ‘A thoroughly lovely expression of the owner’ – restaurant review | Jay Rayner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/henrys-bath-restaurant-review-a-thoroughly-lovely-expression-of-the-owner-jay-rayner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/henrys-bath-restaurant-review-a-thoroughly-lovely-expression-of-the-owner-jay-rayner","fields":{"headline":"Henry’s, Bath: ‘A thoroughly lovely expression of the owner’ – restaurant review","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Henry’s, 4 Saville Row, Bath BA1 2QP (01225 780055). Meal for two, including wine and service: £90 to £110 Recently I took part in a conference event on the future of the dining experience. Or should I say “experience”? It felt like inverted commas were everywhere. It was all about “data capture” and “personalisation”. Us diners will trade gems of information for a meal that most closely matches our aspirations for it. Much of this was an extrapolation of what already happens. The request for information on allergies and dietary issues has become de rigueur. At best it saves people from going into anaphylactic shock over the grilled shrimp, which really can ruin dinner. At worst it’s a licence for picky eaters, trying to control the world around them through their dreary eating habits, just as they did when they were toddlers. At the top end of the business, restaurant managers freely admit they already stalk their customers in what they believe is an utterly benign manner. If someone is about to drop a few hundred quid on dinner, isn’t a quick Google search the least you can expect? (Oh, the misery of constantly discovering that the only people who can afford to eat in your restaurant are grisly oligarchs with their hands in the till and blokes mourning the passing of the Presidents Club dinner on Twitter.) The question is, how far can it go? Recently Just Eat were forced into crisis management when one of their drivers started harassing a woman he’d just dropped a meal to. Just Eat is a marketing operation, running a web interface linking to myriad independent restaurants. They can capture customer data until the cows come home. It turned out they couldn’t necessarily control what happened to it if it fell into the wrong hands. Back in the lofty bit of the trade, when Heston Blumenthal reopened the Fat Duck in 2015, he made a noise about personalising the diner experience by performing a pre-meal telephone interview with guests. As I discovered, this amounted to little more than being given a postcard of somewhere I’d been to on holiday, by waiting staff who weren’t quite with the project. (For me, personalisation really plumbed the depths when Facebook cheerily shared with me the memory of the moment a few years before when I told everyone my old dad had died, after an acutely painful illness. Nice algorithm; shame it’s so electronically gauche.) Listening to all this at the conference I made a prediction: that with the rise of data-friendly restaurants would come a counter-revolution; one which would ape the craft beer and artisan bread movements. Let’s call it the Craft Restaurant Movement: the small place that has no interest in data capture or personalisation, which does its own precisely delineated thing to its own eager, willing audience who are interested only in a table, a chair and a well thought-out plate of food. Of course, this already exists. It’s Henry’s in Bath. There’s a simple dining room, sympathetic to the classic Georgian townhouse it occupies. The floor is bare boards from back wall to door. The tables are clothless. The paintwork is a subtle blue-grey. The sign outside is the signature of the man who cooks here. Henry Scott’s food is idiosyncratic without being overwrought. Most notably it doesn’t fob off non-meat-eaters with something involving beetroot and goat’s cheese. There is an entire menu of equal length – three choices at each course – for those who prefer their lunch to have not once had a pulse. We ordered from both sides. The instinct with such an independent is simply to cheerlead, but that helps no one. Across six dishes, the score was four-two, with the good stuff on the winning side. A heap of glossy ratatouille, the vegetables chopped so finely that one is tempted to diagnose a compulsion, comes bound in an intense sauce. Every ingredient tastes both of itself, and of themselves combined. On top there are whorls of a truffle mayonnaise. Scattered over the top are crispy rings of shallot that Barbie could wear as jewellery. The meaty starter is a heap of crisp-fried then glazed sweetbreads, piled on a deep bed of sauerkraut which leans towards an umami sweetness. Tiny pickled capers prick the warmth with precise moments of acidity to save it all from slipping towards the cloying. A brilliant green herb risotto, made by a cook who has clearly stood stirring a pot of this many times, is a complete winner. On top is a fillet of brill, the flesh pearly, the surface a buttery golden. The skin has been turned into a deep-fried cracker. Around it all is a moat of a langoustine reduction that has you holding the tines of your fork between your lips for just a little longer than is strictly necessary. Its greatness is matched by an extremely clever warm chocolate tart, with a heart of pure liquid. It’s a chocolate fondant which, somehow, has been baked inside an individual tart shell of a delightful crispness. You break into its heart and molten chocolate flows out over the rim. On the side is a thick custard, flavoured with the high-altitude aromatics of Sichuan peppercorns. What doesn’t work? A main course of roasted salsify with chickpeas that are first crisped and then given a soft lemon glaze, must get damned with the faint praise of “interesting”. It is begging for a deep broth, both for lubrication and to blunt the acidity. At dessert, Scott serves a Jerusalem artichoke crème brûlée, topped with candied hazelnuts and a compote of finely diced persimmon. On the one hand it’s exactly what it says: a Jerusalem artichoke flavoured sweet crème brûlée. On the other, just because it can be done doesn’t mean it should. All it made me think is, I wish he would take the vegetables out of this otherwise lovely crème brûlée. Put that dish in the column marked “noble failure”. Henry Scott can cook, and has created a thoroughly lovely restaurant that is an expression of himself. It’s also great value. At lunch two savoury courses are £19 which means the bill, with a couple of glasses of wine and coffee, came to £90. Expect to pay a little more for dinner. Expect not to resent it. I’m all for data capture. Technology can be brilliant. But there does always have to be space for a restaurant like Henry’s. Jay’s news bites Bristol is full of idiosyncratic ‘craft restaurants’. Try the smart but simple Wilson’s in the city’s Redland district. Start with the likes of soused herring with pickled turnip and dollops of cod’s roe. Follow that with venison with a faggot of its own offal, or their own butter-yellow pasta, liberally dressed with truffles. Finish with a tarte tatin. It’s lunch, not rocket science (wilsonsrestaurant.co.uk). The Roundhouse in Camden, north London, is to stage a new two-day food festival in which fruit and veg will take centre stage. Plant Life runs from 1 to 2 June, and will see the space turned into a series of restaurants and producer markets with talks, debates and workshops. Tickets cost £25, available from plantlifefestivals.com. From 1973 to 2003 the Chinese restaurant Poon’s, in London’s West End, was something of a cult, partly on account of rare dishes involving wind-dried meats. Now Amy Poon, daughter of founder Bill, is bringing it back for a three-month pop-up, in Clerkenwell, from 17 February (poonslondon.com).

She was repeatedly raped and tortured by her abductor. Her relatives reported Loaiza’s disappearance, but the Venezuelan authorities refused to investigate. After four months, she managed to escape. The abuse she suffered was horrific. Her jaw was dislocated, one of her nipples was ripped off, and both her ears were destroyed. As a consequence, she was hospitalised for a year, and underwent more than 12 operations to repair the physical damage. After more than 16 years of struggling for justice and after exhausting all avenues in Venezuela, Loaiza will have her case heard on Tuesday by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. It will be the first related to gender-based violence in Venezuela to be judged by the court. If the ruling is in her favour, it will be a milestone in the history of violence against women in the Latin American country. “It has been a long and tragic history. All the steps that have brought me here have been difficult,” said Loaiza, from San José in Costa Rica, where the hearing takes place. Loaiza said she had decided to take her case to the international body because of the failure of the Venezuelan justice system. Fifty-nine judges declined to hear her case and the hearings were deferred 38 times. In 2004, during the first trial, her abductor Luis Carrera Almoina – the son of a renowned writer – was acquitted of all charges. Six years after the event, Carrera was eventually convicted of “grievous bodily injuries and illegitimate deprivation of liberty”, but not of rape or attempted murder. After six years behind bars, Carrera is now free. “This shows the amount of impunity that we can find in cases of gender violence in Venezuela,” said Elsa Meany, a lawyer from the Center for Justice and International Law (Cejil), who will accompany Loaiza during the hearing, with her lawyers. Loaiza, now a lawyer and a human rights defender, said she hoped the court would find the Venezuelan state responsible for failing to ensure an effective investigation and punishment. “The state is responsible. In fact, it already acknowledged partial responsibility,” she said. “I’m not looking for revenge, but justice, and I hope that myself and other women will be compensated.” In November, Venezuela launched a campaign to tackle violence against women during 16 days of activism against gender-based abuse. At the launch, Rebeca Madriz, Venezuela’s vice-minister for the protection of women’s rights, declared that the country was “a leader on women’s rights in Latin America”. Yet figures on violence against women are not available and high levels of impunity exist. In a 2014 report, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women said it was “deeply concerned” that violence against women and girls was “widespread and on the rise” in Venezuela, and that not enough was being done to implement anti-violence laws. It noted that lack of effective access to justice for all women who had experienced violence was a particular concern. Human rights advocates say Venezuela has not yet created a climate of justice. Statistics from the the public ministry show that, of the 70,763 complaints it received of violence against women in 2014, just 0.7% have come to trial. As well as being historic, a ruling in Loaiza’s favour by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights could also promote structural changes in the legal system and the adequate prevention and punishment of perpetrators of violence against women in Venezuela. “A protocol to investigate sexual violence and the publication of reliable data are some of the changes that we are aiming for,” said Meany. Loaiza admited that she had wanted to throw in the towel several times. But her persistence has meant that years after the abduction, her case is still alive in the Venezuelan collective consciousness and has became a point of reference for other women. “I feel a great commitment to raise my voice for all the women in Latin America who have been victims of violence,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/feb/07/a-discussion-not-a-war-two-opposing-experts-talk-dinosaur-family-trees","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T07:26:08Z","webTitle":"A discussion, not a war: two opposing experts talk dinosaur family trees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/a-discussion-not-a-war-two-opposing-experts-talk-dinosaur-family-trees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/feb/07/a-discussion-not-a-war-two-opposing-experts-talk-dinosaur-family-trees","fields":{"headline":"A discussion, not a war: two opposing experts talk dinosaur family trees","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In 2017 a startling paper suggested that the conventional view of the fundamental relationships between different groups of dinosaurs was incorrect. A huge new analysis including many early dinosaurs and their nearest relatives suggested that a rearrangement of the dinosaurs was in order – two groups previously separated (the theropods and ornithischians) were brought together in a group now called Ornithoscleida. This naturally came as something of a shock in palaeontological circles and beyond as the established order had been in place for a century and was well supported by a lot of data. Various comments immediately sprang from various researchers and a formal response (and counter) has appeared in the literature. From the outside this may have seemed like – and has been reported as – a bitter war. This discussion is “tearing palaeontology in two” according to one site, but this is really a gross overstatement. First of all, let’s be honest, outside of the dinosaur researchers, few palaeontologists will have that much of an interest in the field and will hardly be taking sides. Secondly, scientific discourse, in the public forum of papers or online discussions is generally pretty polite and respectful, and that’s often the case too in private. Finally, in a small field like dinosaur palaeontology, all of the protagonists know each other and each other’s work and that means there can be a lot of additional dialogue behind the scenes which is friendly in nature. This doesn’t mean that disagreement cannot be profound, but it does mean that things don’t get vicious and there may be a great deal of respect for the position and ideas of your “opponent”. To prove a point and delve into the discussion a little more, I’ve asked Matthew Baron, who led the original paper rearranging the dinosaurs, and Max Langer who led the initial response, to comment on the ongoing exchanges. Matt, I assume you expected some initial reluctance in accepting your hypothesis and perhaps even some pushback. Did it go over better or worse than you expected? MB: We definitely expected a response, but we didn’t really know what kind. We knew our work was challenging over a century of thinking and so we had already accepted that such a proposal would never get accepted as the norm overnight. What’s been nice, though, is how open everyone seems to be to the idea that maybe the old model isn’t strictly correct and that we may need a fresh look at this. While not everyone thinks that our new model is definitely correct, many of our colleagues are excited by the idea that perhaps we do know less for sure than we always thought. In that sense I’d say that the response has been better than expected. Max, you and your team presumably think that Matt’s idea is not supported by the weight of evidence, but I imagine you’d concede that there’s a discussion here about the conflicting hypotheses? ML: Sure, in my opinion (not necessarily shared by all my co-authors in the reply) there is a reasonable possibility that theropods and ornithischians are grouped as Ornithoscelida. I found even more appealing, for instance, the possibility that ornithischians were not just related to, but were, theropods. Our quarrel is not with the hypothesis itself, but with the way it was put forward by Baron and colleagues. That said, an hypotheses is only as strong as the data it was built upon, which we found unconvincing in this case. Similarly, Matt, I imagine there’s areas that are unresolved in your own analyses that need work and that Max’s team brought up food for thought. MB: Oh, for sure there is so much left for us to do. What Max’s team have done is really delve into the data and to find the areas where different views, different interpretations of the characters and the anatomy of the specimens can exist. Now we need to communicate these differences of opinion and try and work to find a consensus for each individual data point that we have, so far, had a difference in opinion about. I think that only with collaboration and communication between teams will we ever start to move towards a “definitive” and accurate working dataset for these animals. Do you think, Max, that there will be a resolution on this one way or the other? I know there’s more data coming from new finds including, some that your own team is working on. ML: As always in palaeontology, the more fossils we have the better, and we do have several new findings from south Brazil that may help in solving this puzzle. Yet I believe that the key to better understanding early dinosaur evolution lies more in desks, computers, and museums than in quarries. Don’t get me wrong, I find my desk much less attractive than any fossil digging site, but what is missing in the moment is a good deal of detailed anatomical investigation of the fossils at hand, so that we input more reliable data into the analyses set to identify the more probable arrangements for the dinosaur family tree. And finally, to both of you, how well-natured has the whole process been? Have you and your co-authors been corresponding about this outside the formal papers? MB: Extremely well-natured. It’s all been remarkable collegial and friendly. Many of the authors of the reply congratulated us on the original paper when it first came out and have been very open and friendly throughout the process. We talk a lot at conferences and via email and the general sense I get is that, regardless of which side people are on, everyone is excited that there is something big and new for us all to work on right at the base of the dinosaur tree. ML: Sure, everything happened with collegiality. We shared raw data between the groups and kept the whole discussion in gentle terms. My true belief it is that the Cope vs Marsh ‘Bone Wars’ (http://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/05/08/the-bone-wars-the-heated-rivalry-between-two-paleontologists-that-led-to-great-fossil-discoveries-and-their-own-social-demise/) times are over. I have several scientific disagreements before with colleagues that I am currently working with, some are amongst authors of the reply to Matt’s work. Scientific disagreement only reaches the guts of people that do not understand how science works. It is all about “how”, never “by whom”, the argument is put forward.

In an escalation of continuing party infighting over Europe, the former minister said the prime minister was “in hock to these 35 hard Brexiteers” led by Rees-Mogg over negotiation with the EU. But in an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Soubry singled out his rightwing social views as a reason to abandon the party if, as some hope, he is chosen to replace Theresa May. She said: “Somebody like Jacob [Rees-Mogg], with his views on things like abortion, a man who says he’s had six children and never changed a nappy, somebody who says that even if you were to be raped by your father you wouldn’t have a right to choose to have a termination – I’m sorry, but I couldn’t stay in a party led by somebody like him.” Soubry also suggested the powerful pro-Brexit European Research Group of MPs, which Rees-Mogg leads, had undue influence in government, forcing May to rule out staying in some form of customs union. She said: “I’m really cheesed off about the way the whole Brexit thing is going. It feels like – and I think there’s evidence to support this – Theresa is in hock to these 35 hard Brexiteers. They don’t represent my party, but more importantly they don’t represent people who voted leave.” Souby’s comments come after she urged May to “sling out” arch-Brexiters from the party. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, she said: “If it comes to it, I am not going to stay in a party which has been taken over by the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson. They are not proper Conservatives. “Something is going to have to give, because if it doesn’t not only will we get Jacob Rees-Mogg as our prime minister, we will get a devastating hard Brexit which will cause huge damage to our economy for generations to come.” Soubry added: “Unless Theresa stands up and sees off these people she is in real danger of losing huge swathes of not just the parliamentary party but the Conservative party.” She expanded on the criticism to ITV on Tuesday, claiming the government had no electoral mandate for a hard Brexit. She said: “We know what people were saying to us on the doorsteps, and it was a rejection of what people perceived as a hard Brexit, and they don’t want that. There’s a way that we can deliver a Brexit that works for our country, and the really interesting thing is the amount of Tory MPs working with Labour MPs, forming that consensus. If we had a vote in parliament, the majority of MPs would not vote for a hard Brexit.” The former chancellor and prominent leave campaigner Lord Lamont said Soubry’s comments were “ridiculous”. He told the BBC: “I don’t want to be rude about Anna Soubry, but I think she does sometimes tend to go over the top.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14906","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-15T00:01:01Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,906","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14906","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14906","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,906","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/06/mathias-cormann-says-lifting-wages-in-return-for-tax-cut-would-undermine-free-market","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T08:51:51Z","webTitle":"Cormann says mandating wage rises in return for tax cuts would undermine free market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/mathias-cormann-says-lifting-wages-in-return-for-tax-cut-would-undermine-free-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/06/mathias-cormann-says-lifting-wages-in-return-for-tax-cut-would-undermine-free-market","fields":{"headline":"Cormann says mandating wage rises in return for tax cuts would undermine free market","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Coalition does not support requiring companies to lift wages in return for a corporate tax cut because such a plan would interfere with the free market, Mathias Cormann has said. The finance minister joins Bill Shorten and inequality experts in the labour movement in rejecting the idea, which has been proposed as a means to win public support for the Coalition’s proposed corporate tax cut and boost stagnating wages. On Tuesday the Commonwealth Bank chief economist, Michael Blythe, said the government needed to “think about wages policy more broadly in Australia”. “One interesting example here is what they appear to trying in Japan where [they] trade off company tax cuts in exchange for wage increases and more capital spending,” he said. Asked if the Turnbull government could adopt the policy, Cormann told Radio National: “We don’t support that sort of government intervention in the Australian market. “The way that everybody has the best possible way to get ahead … is by supporting the free market, free enterprise [and] reward for effort.” Forcing companies to increase wages risked the government getting the decision wrong and “increasing the level of unemployment”. Cormann said that when company tax cuts increased investment and unemployment declined, wage rises would follow “as sure as night follows day”. “That is the way it has always happened – anybody who argues against that argues against the existence of mountains in Switzerland.” Despite the improved profitability of companies in 2017 and the strong rise in employment, Australia has been struck by stagnant wage growth including pay rises in enterprise agreements at a record low of 2.2% in the September quarter. Per Capita research fellow Tim Lyons told Guardian Australia the proposed wages fix was “a pea and thimble trick” that would see “a wage increase eroded over time by inflation while granting a corporate tax cut that is forever”. Lyons suggested that employers could grant a 4% wage increase to qualify for a tax cut, then claw it back over years by granting less generous wage rises in future. “What guarantee is there if the companies just say ‘I’ll pay a wage increase’? If it’s not in a legally enforceable enterprise agreement, then it’s just a thought bubble.” Lyons said the government’s proposed tax cut for companies earning more than $50m was “a large unaffordable giveaway to large profitable companies ... and this is an attempt to present it as benefiting workers when the beneficiaries are shareholders”. Labor has started 2018 with an aggressive pitch on inequality and wage growth, including considering pegging the minimum wage to median earnings to boost average wages as much as $80 a week. Asked about the idea of a compact for businesses to give wage rises, Shorten said “pigs might fly”. “The idea that, when you see a large company getting tax windfalls from their friends in the Turnbull government, that they’re miraculously going to share this largesse with the workers of Australia, I’m sorry, but that fairytale doesn’t add up,” he told reporters in Canberra. The former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan said employers had to put a “firm proposal” on the table to show they would share their profits or else they would simply increase executive pay or engage in share buybacks that enrich shareholders. “Business has not used its increased profitability to increase wages,” he said. “Nobody is going to take vague words that we ‘might see it flow through’ – people will want a concrete set of arrangements that result in a better division wage/profit share.” Swan said that the corporate tax level had to be set at a rate to “pay for economic and social infrastructure that makes the growth and pays the wages”. “A race for the bottom in tax doesn’t deliver jobs and growth – it denudes the economy of the ability to pay for social goods.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/06/bitcoin-price-crackdown-bis-cryptocurrency","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T10:25:30Z","webTitle":"Bitcoin price falls below $6,000 as banker signals crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/06/bitcoin-price-crackdown-bis-cryptocurrency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/06/bitcoin-price-crackdown-bis-cryptocurrency","fields":{"headline":"Bitcoin price falls below $6,000 as banker signals crackdown","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The price of bitcoin yo-yoed wildly again on Tuesday, falling 14% to $5,920 (£4,250) before bouncing back to $7,265 – up nearly 6% on the previous day. The latest gyrations came as a leading central banker described the cryptocurrency as “a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster”. The new head of the Bank for International Settlements, Agustín Carstens, also said bitcoin threatened to undermine public trust in central banks and posed a threat to financial stability, and he signalled a global clampdown. “If authorities do not act pre-emptively, cryptocurrencies could become more interconnected with the main financial system and become a threat to financial stability,” he said, speaking at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. “There is a strong case for policy intervention. Appropriate authorities have a duty to educate and protect investors and consumers, and need to be prepared to act.” Carstens, a former governor of Mexico’s central bank, said that despite the meteoric rise of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies were merely pretending to be currencies and were unsafe, potentially facilitating tax evasion, money laundering and criminal finance. As the head of the body that represents the world’s central banks, his comments are the clearest sign yet that global regulators are preparing a crackdown on bitcoin, the price of which rose by 900% last year, making it the best-performing asset of 2017. It hit a peak of almost $20,000 in the week before Christmas. However, it has fallen by more than 50% since the beginning of 2018, as investors grow increasingly fearful of intervention by regulators. Bitcoin is not recognised by any central bank. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods to pay for goods and services. Carstens said central banks should in particular pay attention to the ties linking cryptocurrencies to real currencies, to ensure the relationship was “not parasitic”. His comments follow a string of warnings on bitcoin from authorities and economists around the world, including India, the US and South Korea. Facebook has banned bitcoin and other cryptocurrency adverts on its site. On Monday Lloyds Banking Group and Virgin Money banned customers from using its credit cards to buy bitcoin, amid fears the banks could be liable if the cryptocurrency’s value implodes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/feb/06/fa-cup-clockwatch-swansea-city-v-notts-county-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T22:17:01Z","webTitle":"FA Cup clockwatch: Swansea City 8-1 Notts County and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/feb/06/fa-cup-clockwatch-swansea-city-v-notts-county-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/feb/06/fa-cup-clockwatch-swansea-city-v-notts-county-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"FA Cup clockwatch: Swansea City 8-1 Notts County and more – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three games, 15 goals; yes, you’ve got to love the old FA Cup. A great night for Swansea City, Rochdale and Huddersfield Town, one to forget certainly for Notts County. Just the one fourth-round tie remains: can Newport County go to Wembley and knock the eight-time winners Tottenham Hotspur out? Join us tomorrow evening on the MBM to find out. And that’s that! The referee blows his whistle, a fountain of slush jets out of it, and Huddersfield will host Manchester United in the fifth round. I wonder if this will clear out Huddersfield’s pipes? They’d only scored two goals in their previous five matches. Now they’ve rediscovered their mojo, and in some style, just in time for the visit of Bournemouth at the weekend. They’ve set up a fifth-round tie with 12-time winners Manchester United, but this win could end up having just as much significance in their Premier League survival campaign. Tom Ince, whose speculative shot turned this tie around for Town, gets on the scoresheet by wheeching one into the bottom right. Meanwhile it’s half time in extra time at St Andrew’s. Huddersfield really turned on the gas in the first 15 of the 30 additional minutes. Now a home fifth-round tie against Manchester United is within touching distance. The biggest win in Swansea’s FA Cup history comes to an end. Eight goals, and not a scrappy one among them. They’re back, back, back. And the man who has inspired their revival, Carlos Carvalhal, is going back, back, back to Sheffield Wednesday in the fifth round! The sort of story only the FA Cup can provide. But spare a thought for poor old Notts County, who were ripped to shreds tonight. At least their goal was pretty damn good too. That’s something, right? Notts County stroke it around the back for a bit. Their fans indulge in a little of the old gallows humour, cheering every pass with a roof-rattling olé! Olé! Olé! Olé! Rajiv van La Parra smacks a shot into the bottom right, and all of a sudden this one looks over. Unless Blues have an Espana 82 West Germany-France style comeback in them. Steve Mounie plants Aaron Mooy’s cross into the net with his head. This is an astonishingly good goal by young sub Dan James. Routledge rolls a pass down the right for Narsingh, who fires a cross into the area. Abraham chests down on the penalty spot, a cushioned set-up for James, who shifts his feet and clinically dispatches the ball into the bottom right! As cool as you like by the 20-year-old winger! Nope! Ian Henderson’s goal is enough to separate the sides! The struggling League One side have knocked out Millwall of the Championship! Spotland will play host to either Tottenham Hotspur or Newport County in the fifth round. The Birmingham-Huddersfield tie has ended 1-1 and will go to extra time. Can Millwall force an extra 30 minutes at Rochdale? Swansea are playing keepball now. And no wonder: this now stands as their biggest victory in the FA Cup, beating their 7-2 thrashing of Folkestone in the first round of the 1966-67 competition. So is this a good omen for Tottenham Hotspur, who went on to win the final that season? A trophy for Mauricio Pochettino at last! You can’t say Spurs don’t deserve it. Carlos Carvalhal, though, huh? What a job he’s done at Swansea! They were a repressed mess when he turned up just over a month ago. Now look at them! Out of the Premier League relegation zone and running up a cricket score in the cup on national television! He wasn’t wrong when he talked of his team’s rising confidence before the match. This is a quite stunning performance, admittedly against a lower-ranked team who have imploded this evening in sorry fashion. Space for Carroll on the edge of the County D. He switches his feet, drops a shoulder, and whips a wonderful curler into the top left. Actually the BBC could be onto something if Swansea hit ten. Poor BBC One, who will have been hankering after a bit of FA Cup drama. But this was over before the half-hour. At least the Chelsea-Norwich replay in the third round, so dull for so long, climaxed with a comical Antonio Conte fume, a contentious VAR decision, a couple of red cards and some penalty drama. Still, at least this proves to a nation that Swansea have rediscovered their verve, and rather magnificently so, though after the recent wins over Liverpool and Arsenal we knew that already. This is now a rout. Dyer threatens to break into the box down the middle. Dickinson comes across to slide the ball away from the striker, a lovely tackle. But it’s just putting off the inevitable. The ball breaks to Routledge, who shimmies down the inside left and curls an unstoppable shot into the bottom right, comfortably out of Collin’s reach. It’s not been a good couple of minutes for the goalkeepers’ union. A corner for Swansea is flapped at by Collin. A weak punch lands at the feet of Naughton, who adjusts well and hammers the ball back into the net with some venom. Stead nicks the ball off van der Hoorn, and bursts into the Swansea area on the left. He’s one on one with Nordfeldt, albeit facing a tight angle. He attempts to curl it round the keeper and into the top right. The shot has no pace, but Nordfeldt still causes panic by parrying the ball into the middle of the area, a thicket of players. Swansea eventually clear, but no thanks to their very shaky reserve keeper. Everyone’s out and about at the Liberty again. Swansea are on the front foot in the early exchanges of the second half, as you’d expect given their three-goal advantage. Carlos Carvalhal can be forgiven for planning his return to Sheffield Wednesday in the fifth round already. It hasn’t taken long for Town to get back into this. Tom Ince pearled a shot from distance. Stockdale parried, but the ball ballooned up in a straight line. When it returned, Marc Roberts tried to hook the ball away from extreme danger but could only help it into the net. And like London buses ... Ian Henderson bundles home to give the League One strugglers the lead at Spotland, and put the 2004 finalists in a spot of bother. A couple of shocks on the cards here! Oh yes indeed! Che Adams breaks the deadlock at St Andrew’s with a shot from distance that whistles into the bottom left of Jonas Lossl’s net! The 1931 and 1956 finalists lead the 1922 winners! And that’s the end of the first half at Swansea. Will there be any goals elsewhere, while these two teams, who have served up five goals for a prime-time BBC One audience, enjoy a deserved glass of eggnog and a cigarette? There have been some fine goals in this game, and this could be the best of the lot. Bartley, deep in his own half down the left, caresses a stunning crossfield ball to the excellent Narsingh on the right. Narsingh races down the flank, looks up, spots Abraham rushing into the area, and delivers a ball that’s begging to be hit. Abraham obliges, skelping a first-time shot across Collin and into the left-hand side of the net! Routledge is this close from sending Abraham clear down the middle. He’s denied by a superb slide and hook from Duffy. And the ref’s about to blow for half-time, when... And County come again, Grant pearling a shot goalwards from 12 yards! Nordfeldt parries clear, not in a particularly convincing style it has to be said, but parry clear he does. Despite the scoreline, Swansea look like they need to hear the half-time whistle to rediscover their earlier poise. Notts County have their tails up again. Grant goes bombing down the middle of the park, and is cynically clipped by Clucas, who is booked for his sauce. The resulting free kick sees Brisley cause all manner of physical bother in the Swansea box. Under intense pressure, Bartley heads back to his keeper. Nordfeldt claims, but that header was really travelling! Bartley jogs back upfield, kidding on he knew exactly what he was doing, but you can tell by his eyes. He’s not kidding anyone. Lucky Swansea. So it’s been raining goals at the Liberty. Nowhere else, though! The games between Birmingham and Huddersfield, and Rochdale and Millwall, have reached the half-time stage without any scoreboard-bothering action. What a goal this is! County launch it long. Stead heads down on the edge of the box. Alessandra tees it up for Husin, who opens his body and curls an unstoppable shot into the top left! Nordfeldt had no chance! Though was Brisley, loitering in an offside position, in his eyeline? The ref checks with VAR, and the answer’s no. The goal’s correctly given. Not that there was any real need to consult VAR, but this is our life now. Corner for Swansea. Van der Hoorn meets it six yards out and heads over. He should have scored. Having said that, seconds before he palmed Duffy to the ground, a rugby-style hand off. Fortunately for the big Swansea defender, it was quite gentle really, so while the ref does his finger-to-lug VAR thing, there’s no retrospective punishment. Still, arms flailing where they shouldn’t be, and all that. On BBC1, commentary duo Jonathan Pearce and Martin Keown were discussing the promotion prospects of Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa. It was that kind of vibe. So thank goodness for Nathan Dyer, who suddenly shook up the sleepy atmosphere by buzzing down the middle, rolling a pass wide right to Narsingh, and meeting the low return with a first-time sweep across Collin and into the bottom left from 20 yards. That’s another glorious goal. Notts County have a chance to bounce back with a free kick just outside the Swansea area. They load the box. Dickinson wedges softly into the area. Nordfeldt comes off his line and should claim, but instead punches weakly, and very oddly, straight into the ground. That leads to a bit of pinball in the Swansea box. It’s eventually tidied up, but that’ll give the Magpies a little hope. That was dreadful keeping. Very shaky. The Swans really have taken flight! Abraham drops deep to quarterback. He slides a glorious pass down the inside-right channel for Dyer, who zips clear of the County back line. Dyer strides into the area and lashes coolly and calmly into the bottom right! One minute and 24 seconds between the goals, and all that sterile possession really did lull the visitors into a false sense of security! Wow! And with that, Swansea suddenly burst into life! It’s so simple, too, but stylishly so. Narsingh instigates a one-two down the right, and he scampers into space. He reaches the byline and whips a low ball towards the near post, where Abraham flicks home with nonchalant ease! Lovely stuff. Swansea are passing the ball around rather a lot. If Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez are watching on telly somewhere, they’ll surely approve. Mind you, they’re not really going anywhere right now. From left to right and back again, all in the middle of the park. Notts County are holding their shape very well. Collin hasn’t had a truly dangerous situation to deal with yet. Naughton channels his inner Garrincha, twisting and turning down the right. His eventual cross is way too long, but Swansea recycle the ball, Carroll teeing it up in the centre for Dyer, who smacks low and hard towards the bottom right from distance. That warms Collin’s hands, and on an evening like this the County keeper will surely be grateful. Notts County launch their first sortie of the evening, Alessandra and Grant exchanging crisp passes down the right. Grant is sent barrelling into acres, but his cross isn’t up to much. A chance to cause a bit of trouble in the Swansea box spurned, there. Still no goals at St Andrew’s or Spotland either. Welcome again to your super soaraway FA Cup Clocko! Dyer is looking very lively in the early exchanges at Swansea. He romps into an awful lot of space down the right, reaches the byline and hooks into the mixer. Abraham can’t plant his nut on it from six yards, and that’s a corner. Nothing comes of it. But it’s all Swansea at the moment. No snow in Swansea, incidentally. It’s still freezing cold, though. Dyer has a dribble down the centre of the park, a dangerous burst. But his shot is dreadful and easily swallowed by Collin. Still no goals in the other two matches. And they’re off at Swansea! The home team are quickly on the attack, Routledge, Abraham and Dyer combining well down the inside-right channel and winning a corner. The set piece is snaffled by Collin, but that’s a bright start by the hosts. The teams are out at the Liberty! Swansea are dressed in all white, Notts County in neon yellow. It’s a VAR game, so no doubt there’ll be some sort of controversy at some point. Ach. We’ll be off in a second. Carlos Carvalhal speaks! “We are doing better and better. We are not repeating mistakes. Our dynamic is better. Confidence is more high and players can perform better.” And so does Kevin Nolan! “We’ve just got to believe. We’re here on merit, we’ve got to enjoy it. I’ve told the lads to go out and express themselves. I’ve given them a gameplan, if they stick to it we’ve got a chance to cause a major upset. We’re pretty relaxed and looking forward to the game.” No early goals at St Andrew’s or Spotland. But here’s a weather report: it is COLD. Snow coming down in Birmingham. Tumbleweed rolling through this report. We’ll have some hot action from the Liberty coming up soon. Birmingham City make just one change to the team sent out at Huddersfield in the original tie. Craig Gardner comes in at the expense of Jota. Huddersfield however select seven different players: Jonas Lossl, Tom Smith, Scott Malone, Philip Billing, Aaron Mooy, Tom Ince and Zanka are in; Joel Coleman, Chris Lowe, Florent Hadergjonaj, Michael Hefele, Jonathan Hogg, Rajiv van La Parra and Daniel Williams are out. Rochdale switch just one player from the starting XI named at Millwall. In comes Harrison McGahey; out goes Donervon Daniels. Millwall make four swaps: in come Conor McLaughlin, James Meredith, Shaun Hutchinson and Shaun Williams, at the expense of Tony Craig, Mahlon Romeo, Jake Cooper and Jed Wallace. Swansea - who can swat aside the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal but couldn’t do for Notts County at Meadow Lane two Saturdays ago - make four changes to the team sent out for the first tie. Kyle Naughton, Sam Clucas, Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer step up; Alfie Mawson, Leroy Fer, Renato Sanches and Wilfried Bony stand down. County move aside Elloitt Hewitt and Shola Ameobi to make way for Matty Virtue and Lewis Alessandra. Birmingham City: Stockdale, Dean, Roberts, Morrison, Jenkinson, Lowe, Gardner, N’Doye, Bramall, Jutkiewicz, Adams. Subs: Colin, Boga, Dacres-Cogley, Jota, Trueman, Seddon, Lakin. Huddersfield Town: Lossl, Smith, Kongolo, Jorgensen, Malone, Sabiri, Billing, Mooy, Ince, Quaner, Mounie. Subs: Whitehead, Scannell, Coleman, Lowe, van La Parra, Hadergjonaj, Hefele.

Notts County: Collin, Hunt, Duffy, Brisley, Dickinson, Alessandra, Husin, Virtue, Hawkridge, Grant, Stead. Subs: Ameobi, Pindroch, Forte, Smith, Noble, Walker, Milsom. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire). Welcome to an evening of hot FA Cup fourth-round replay action. The fixtures are as follows ... Birmingham City v Huddersfield Town (7.45pm) Rochdale v Millwall (7.45pm) Swansea City v Notts County (8.05pm) ... and there are some big rewards to be claimed by tonight’s victors. The winner at St Andrew’s will host Manchester United in the fifth round. Whoever prevails at Spotland gets the opportunity to welcome Newport County or, most probably, Tottenham Hotspur. And the winner of the tie at the Liberty Stadium will travel to Sheffield Wednesday, which will be quite the big day out for Carlos Carvalhal should the Swans make it. Much to play for, then. You have got to love the FA Cup. It’s not up for debate! It’s non-negotiable! It’s on!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/07/carl-sargeants-son-wins-his-former-welsh-labour-seat","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T00:30:44Z","webTitle":"Carl Sargeant’s son wins his former Welsh Labour seat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/07/carl-sargeants-son-wins-his-former-welsh-labour-seat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/07/carl-sargeants-son-wins-his-former-welsh-labour-seat","fields":{"headline":"Carl Sargeant’s son wins his former Welsh Labour seat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The son of the senior Labour politician Carl Sargeant, who apparently took his own life after facing allegations of harassment against women, will take up his father’s seat at the Welsh assembly after winning the byelection triggered by the tragedy. Jack Sargeant was elected on Wednesday as assembly member for Alyn and Deeside, the largely industrial constituency in north Wales his father had held since 2003. He won 11,267 votes on a 34.6% turnout with the Conservative candidate, Sarah Atherton, coming second with 4,722 votes. The Lib Dems’ Donna Lalek came third with 1,176 votes. There was 5.2% swing from the Conservatives to Labour. Sargeant increased Labour’s vote share by nearly 15 percentage points on that achieved by his late father at the 2016 assembly election - up from 45.73% to 60.65%. His position at the assembly will be awkward at the very least for the Welsh Labour first minister, Carwyn Jones, who faces an inquiry into how he handled the sacking of Carl Sargeant from his government four days before he was found hanged at the family home in the constituency. In his acceptance speech Sargeant said he was proud that voters had trusted him to carry on the work his father had begun. But he said: “This is a by-election we shouldn’t be fighting in. There are questions still to be answered and there are inquires under way. Tonight is not the night for those questions to be answered. That will be done in due course.” Sargeant thanked those who had supported him and his family. “I want to say a big thank you to everyone in this room, everyone across Wales and across the world who stood by my family during the toughest time of our lives. It means so much to me. This special community has helped all of us. I don’t think we would get that anywhere else. We should all be proud of our community spirit. It’s been amazing. “We still are all devastated by dad’s death, not just the family. He was loved by so many people and he loved you all, Our grief will continue.” Sargeant called for a “kinder way”. He explained: “Despite the tragic circumstances, this is an opportunity for the people of Alyn and Deeside, our community, to start a movement in politics and in our general outlook in life, to go back to the traditional Labour values, look after each other especially those who can’t look after themselves. “Let’s go back to those values and push on. Let’s be kind to each other. That’s the lesson I learned from my dad and in the primary school up the road.” Asked later what his message for the first minister was, he replied only: “There are inquiries in place.” Aged only 23, Sargeant becomes the youngest member of the Welsh assembly by a decade and is determined to speak up for younger people struggling to make their way. Ken Skates, the Welsh cabinet secretary for economy and transport, said Sargeant’s youth would be a bonus for the assembly. “He’s going to bring unique attributes to the job,” he said. On how Sargeant would get on with the first minister, Skates said: “I think he recognises that in order to get the best for the people of Alyn and Deeside, we’ll be working as a strong Labour team.” In November Carl Sargeant was discovered dead at the family home in Connah’s Quay after being sacked as a Welsh government minister following allegations he had harassed women. Sargeant denied any wrongdoing and details of the allegations have not emerged. Those close to Sargeant are furious at how Jones allegedly handled his sacking, claiming he had died having no idea what was being claimed and felt left in limbo by senior members of the party he loved. As well as the inquiry into how he handled the sacking, the first minister faces a second investigation into claims of bullying. Though Jones has repeatedly described Carl Sargeant as a friend, he stayed away from his funeral after the family made clear he was not welcome. Jack Sargeant decided to stand in the byelection with the backing of his mother, Bernie, and sister Lucy. When he was selected as Labour’s candidate, Sargeant, whose background is in engineering, said he would be a powerful voice for local people – but would also be seeking justice for his father and seeking the truth about the chain of events that led to his death. While the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, his deputy, Tom Watson, and a string of Welsh ministers have visited the constituency during the campaign, Jones has not been visible. Asked by the Guardian last month why Jones had not been there, Sargeant said: “It’s a local campaign. We’re going to run it locally and get the local teams out as we always have here. I think that’s the best way to win this campaign. Get the local people out on the doorstep and win a local election.” However, as well as Corbyn and Watson, activists from more than 30 constituencies across Wales and England lent a hand. Jack Sargeant first went out on the campaign trail with his father as a boy. During his own campaign he visited touchstone places for his father, including the Nomads football club, which Carl loved, and the Shotton steelworks. On the eve of polling day, Jack said: “We’ve fought this byelection from the start as an opportunity to lead the way in encouraging a kinder, more compassionate politics and society.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/06/uk-rations-healthcare-on-who-needs-it-the-us-does-not-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T13:24:08Z","webTitle":"'UK rations healthcare on who needs it, the US does not': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/uk-rations-healthcare-on-who-needs-it-the-us-does-not-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/uk-rations-healthcare-on-who-needs-it-the-us-does-not-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'UK rations healthcare on who needs it, the US does not': your best comments today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s comments on the state of the UK’s health service, and the UK’s involvement in Europe’s offshore wind power, the global stock market plunge, and whether restaurant tips should go to the owners or workers have got readers talking today. To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We’ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. Restaurants have no right to take employees’ tips ‘Tips for good service should be a bonus, not a way to allow owners to starve workers’ As a former waitress, I’m outraged by this--and by the comments that show restaurant owners and managers are already stealing tips. As a former restaurant owner, I believe all the employees ought to be paid a living wage. I never paid wait staff less than the dishwashers. Tips for good service should be a bonus, not a way to allow owners to starve workers. I can also see the point that many workers contribute to the service provided, and so deserve a portion of the tip. But that policy has to be stated before hiring, the distribution has to be based on the actual tips earned, and it has to be done transparently. chrisfi In some state’s, like Texas, the employer is allowed to redistribute your tips based on how they classify your tips as when you first start working there. I work in a fine dining restaurant and I tip out 23.25% of my tips every day to busboys, food runners, bartenders, amd the hostess. As well as the 2.2% fee charged for using a credit card, comes out of my tips. On parties, an automatic 22% gratuity is added to the bill. Of that 22, I get 15. The other 7% goes to my manager and the party coordinator as part of his/her “commission”. So yes, this has been happening for a long time. collinmcc Here’s what Americans need to know about the UK’s health system ‘Screw which one is cheaper’ In the UK, we ration healthcare based on who needs it the most. In the US, healthcare is rationed based on who can afford it. Screw which one is cheaper. The question is, which is more moral? The answer should be obvious. Anthony Cooper ‘The UK threw a billion pounds at the DUP’ Americans also need to know that while the NHS is struggling, the UK has a “Conservative” government that threw a billion pounds at the DUP in a desperate attempt to cling to power. Andystar ‘It’s got nothing to do with healthcare and everything to do with race’ One American friend said something rather profound to me. He said (and I’m paraphrasing) - “stop thinking of this as a healthcare issue and start thinking of it as a race issue - white people just don’t want to pay for black people’s healthcare” boom, all of the sudden the missing piece of the puzzle dropped into place and it made sense why Americans fight so hard against it. UK built half of Europe’s offshore wind power in 2017 ‘It’s just playing catch up’ Not more misleading hype. It’s just playing catch up. Germany, with more than 7 times as much wind power as the UK, is not currently installing anymore because they have more than their grid can handle. France has twice as much, and so on. The only reason the UK installed more than half of Europe’s total is because the other countries have so much already, they are close to capacity. derekcolman ‘It makes way more sense to produce energy locally’ Er yeah. Blighty as usual is allowing multinational companies to build this needed infrastructure. Meaning we, as we do now, pay much of our energy bills to other countries. I’m no flag waving idiot, but it makes way more sense to produce energy locally - allow and incentivise local council to get involved, not EDF and the big companies who have pushed the cost of the trnasition onto the poorest. Also onshore wind is cheaper. lee towers Dow Jones suffers worst day in over six years as global stock markets plunge ‘Privatisation does not benefit us’ Rampant capitalism! What do we expect. Time for a socialist agenda. Setting priorities that benefit the people not corporate capital. Privatisation does not benefit us, only gamblers in profit. Nationalize utilities. Introduce a Robin Hood tax. Invest in health, schools, environmental projects....we don’t have to be hostages to their (mis)fortune, but act to protect our own future!

This play by Conor McPherson (The Weir) takes the form of three duologues in which Dublin undertaker John, a man who has given it all up in favour of the bottle, must decide on Christmas Eve in a rundown office whether he wants to start a new life. The dusty Christmas fairy lights wink at him in doleful reproach. This is a play haunted by regret and mired in quiet despair. John has been saved once before by an act of kindness from his employer who now lies dying in the hospital. Then Mary (Siwan Morris), the daughter he hasn’t seen for 10 years, arrives with news of his ex-wife’s terminal cancer. Will it be a spur to salvation? McPherson’s play had a muted response when it reopened the refurbished Royal Court in London in 2000, largely because it wasn’t The Weir 2. But the play has its own understated richness as, in a series of near-monologues, John (subtly played by Simon Wolfe) recounts how he poured his life away. It’s a devastating portrait of loneliness delivered in prose that glimmers and glows. It’s in a minor key, but Matthew Xia’s production grips even if it over-eggs key moments with falling leaves, a rising hum and the sudden appearance of a wreath, suspended over the stage, representing endurance and salvation. All this play requires is crystalline, unsentimental performances to match its sorrowful, redemptive tenderness. • At the Sherman, Cardiff, until 17 February.

Share any further thoughts/ comments: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The Royal Mail have issued a set of eight stamps celebrating campaigning in the decade before the right to vote was secured with the 1918 Representation of the People Act. We have a piece showcasing the stories of readers’ relatives as the nation marks a century since the act that paved the way for universal suffrage. Joanna Wickenden Ibarra, London – Granddaughter of Dora Spong It was my brother, Peter, and his wife, Zulma, who discovered our grandmother Dora’s magnificent Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) certificate, signed by Emmeline Pankhurst. It was a bit torn, lying at the bottom of a drawer. They had the certificate restored and framed – it measures 26 x 20 inches (60cm x 50cm) and commemorates Dora’s dedication to the cause “ever ready to obey the call of duty”. We know that Dora and her sister, my great aunt Florence Spong, joined the WSPU in 1908 to fight for the right to vote and spent some time in prison for their actions. All the women in their family attended WSPU demonstrations. Irene, another great aunt, gave concerts for the cause, and both Florence and Dora were arrested several times and sent to Holloway prison. Florence was charged with stone-throwing at the WSPU deputation of 29 June 1909, sentenced to a month’s imprisonment and went on hunger strike. This did not stop her from repeating the action in protest at the way suffragettes were treated in Parliament Square on “Black Friday” in November 1910, which got her another two months’ imprisonment. Florence embroidered her signature on the WSPU banner made in Holloway prison that is still on display at the Museum of London. Among the artefacts that have stayed in the family is a brooch, a portcullis with the symbolic broken chain which, we understood as children, celebrates victory in the fight for women’s suffrage. How the Guardian reported celebrations in Manchester, home of the suffrage movement, to mark the passing of the Representation of the People Act, 100 years ago Reaction to Theresa May’s speech on Twitter. Theresa May has announced a review of the sustainability of Britain’s printed press, looking into funding models to ensure the continuation of high-quality national and local journalism. Speaking in Manchester, the prime minister warned that losing hundreds of titles was “dangerous for our democracy”. She warned that “when trusted and credible news sources decline, we can become vulnerable to news which is untrustworthy”. May said that to address this challenge, the government will launch a review to examine press sustainability. “It will look at the different business models for high-quality journalism,” she said. She added: “It will consider whether the creators of content are getting their fair share of advertisement revenue. “And it will recommend whether industry or government-led solutions can help improve the sustainability of the sector for the future. A free press is one of the foundations on which our democracy is built, and it must be preserved.” The home secretary Amber Rudd has said she puts up with “hate” because “female voices matter in politics and in life”. Delivering a statement on the suffrage centenary in the Commons, she said she is often asked by people in her Hastings and Rye constituency: “‘How can you bear it, the hate?”’ Rudd told MPs: “And I’ll tell you: I bear it like other women in this chamber do because I know that female voices matter in politics and in life. “But we shouldn’t have to bear it: we need to call this sort of behaviour out and make clear that enough is enough.” The home secretary also announced the opening of a “large grant scheme” to allow local community groups to bid for suffrage projects worth up to 125,000. It’s part of a £5m fund to celebrate the centenary. She said: “Money will also go to projects specifically designed to increase the number of women in political office, including piloting a programme to inspire young women with opportunities to be leaders in their communities.” Prime minister Theresa May has announced a review of the sustainability of the printed press, looking at business models to support high-quality journalism. Speaking in Manchester to mark the women’s suffrage centenary, Theresa May talked abut the abuse women face in public life. She said: “Social media ... should be a force for good ... but it is being exploited and abused often anonymously.” May mentioned the fact Haringey Council leader to quit amid “bullying” claims. “One of most senior women in local governmnent was forced out,” she said. The Guardian’s political correspondent Jessica Elgot is in Manchester for Theresa May’s speech. We have now put a live feed of Theresa May’s Manchester speech in the main picture slot of the blog. The suffragette colours were flying over the British Library near the Guardian’s offices today. Today we are dedicating our Instagram feed to the women who fought for the right to vote, and to those who are continuing to fight for true equality. We are including the words of Emmeline Pankhurst and the photos of Christina Broom, one of the UK’s first press photographers whose pioneering photos of the suffragettes captured a pivotal time for the movement. Later we’ll look at how far we have to go before true parity is realised. Follow us here https://www.instagram.com/guardian We got a lovely comment in from a reader, who has been following the live blog. Katherine Buckingham: My two girls have been marching around today, singing ‘votes for women!’ Here’s a photo of my two girls before school this morning, wearing rosettes they made themselves. Erica, who is five, is on the right, and Sylvia, three, is on the left. She is named after Sylvia Pankhurst. We think it’s important to use days like today to teach our children about the bravery and sacrifice that has shaped the world they now live in. And my girls love it - they’ve been marching around singing ‘votes for women!’. More of you have been in touch about the biggest goals for women’s rights today - one of them being the perception of power. Ellen from North Wales said we need to change the attitude of some men who still perceive women to be objects. These men do not see us as their equals. Those with actual power and imagined power use it to try and belittle us. Only when we group together in a movement like #MeToo do we find out the inequality that still goes on to this day. Assuming many did not take part in this the staggering number suggests a larger problem. Divya from London, thinks economic and financial independence of women of all classes should be next. This will empower women to raise their voices and be a part of every decision-making dialogue. This will mean more investment in women’s health issues and research, more products that women can use (not pink pens that some male CEO thinks women need!), a shift in governmental policy - more child care support and benefits, more help for women to get back into the work force, and support for victims of sexual predators (from online harassment to rape). This will mean ensuring men are part of this movement, actively call out unequal behaviour and actively support women on a day to day basis. This tweet from journalist Jane Merrick is getting a lot of love. Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy has spoken about women’s rights today. It was a cold but clear morning that welcomed in the centenary of some women and all men getting the vote, as the mayor of London Sadiq Khan unveiled a pop-up tribute to those that campaigned to make it happen in Trafalgar Square today. Unveiling a screen of life-sized images of 59 campaigners – who will feature on the new statue of suffragist leader Millicent Fawcett, which will be erected in the spring – Khan said the image was a reminder of the breadth and diversity of the movement. He added that the centenary year had to be seized as an opportunity to further women’s rights. “When I campaigned to be mayor I said I wanted to be a proud feminist in City Hall, and hopefully people have seen that we mean what we say in relation to that,” he said. “On a personal level, I am the father of two girls and I love them and there is no reason why these talented, bright women should have every opportunity to do what they want, but because they are girls or women instead of boys or men their potential is limited. It’s a fact that life chances, career prospects, pay – these are all affected by your gender. That can’t be right in 2018 in the most progressive city in the world.” Historian Lucy Worsley, dressed in full suffragette regalia said it was a moment to honour and celebrate, but also commemorate. “A lot of these women paid a very heavy price, with their health, in their family life – this isn’t just a celebration it’s also about remembering the sacrifices they made,” she said. “I’m sure that some of these women would be looking at the world today and thinking there hasn’t been as much progress made as they would have hoped.” A collection of rare suffragette posters are being displayed to mark the anniversary of women winning the right to vote. The selection of posters, one of the largest surviving collections, were put on show to the public at Cambridge University Library. Here are a few of them. Amika George is an 18-year-old student from North London. She started the #FreePeriods campaign, which calls on the government to give free menstrual products to children from low-income families Today, I stand proud and strong as a woman. This week, I’ve shuddered as I read agonising accounts of the struggles, the violence and the pain that the suffragettes endured for a decade to allow women today the opportunity to stand equal with men in society. Last year, I started the #FreePeriods campaign because children are missing school in the UK because they can’t afford menstrual products. In many countries across the globe, the shame and stigma of menstruation forces girls to drop out of school altogether. It’s appalling that girls are being hindered in their academic progress and prevented from contributing fully to society because of a natural and perfectly normal biological process. Period poverty should not be an obstacle to learning, and should never be the reason that girls cannot achieve, excel and prosper in society. The government needs to take action. Today we celebrate what we can achieve when men and women together fight against injustice and inequality. A century on and there is still so much progress to be made. Our periods should not be the reason we are held back. An interesting article on the Guardian today from Fern Riddell about the suffragettes, highlighting the fact that the women’s movement was as fractured then as it is today. Theresa May has suggested that if she had been fighting for the right to vote 100 years ago she would have been a suffragist, rather than a more radical suffragette. The suffragists, a group led by Millicent Fawcett, believed in peaceful campaigning. In this respect they were different to the militant direct action favoured by suffragettes headed by Emmeline Pankhurst. Quizzed by BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour about which side she would have taken if she had been involved a century ago, May said: “I was, in a sense, asked this question when I was asked about the statue and who I would support, and I did say Millicent Fawcett.” Asked if she was a natural suffragist, the PM said: “Both of these had a role. That’s the point. So, to me it’s not an either/or. “Actually, both of them played their part in making sure that women could take their full role in public life.” May also pointed to her connection with people involved in the struggle, saying: “My late godmother’s mother was a suffragette. Her father was a doctor to the Pankhursts.” The prime minister also discussed the recent controversy over how hostesses were allegedly treated at a men only Presidents Club City charity event. She said it showed some attitudes still needed to change. We’ve been asking you what important issues still face women today, with gender disparity at work and advocacy for all regardless of background being mentioned. Emma Clancy from Dunstable is chief executive for the National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting. She said sexism is still a prevalent issue in the electrical and wider construction sectors. In the electrical industry alone women only make up around 1% of the total workforce. As an industry we need to broaden our approach to recruitment and the image we portray. We need to change the perception of the industry as one traditionally for boys and make it more inclusive and appealing to women. Young women need to see it as a viable, exciting career option from the very beginning. Too many young females are still pushed into careers such as hairdressing or childcare as it is the perceived norm. LS, 30, from New Delhi, India, said we must not forget to speak out for all women regardless of their income or sexual orientation. We’ve got to remember that 100 years ago only a small sub-section of women (property owners and so forth) got the right to vote. That pretty much encapsulates the biggest challenge facing women’s rights activists: embracing the need to advocate for all women, across race, sexual orientation, income, etc. Time and time again, we’ve seen how the biggest outcries have been over issues affecting the well-to-do set. It isn’t that issues that affect them aren’t important, just that they should not be the only issues that receive attention. Of course we need more female chief executives, STEM graduates and Google employees but we also have to speak up for women who are raped in conflict areas, black women who are likelier to die due to childbirth, and trans women who are overwhelmingly victims of assault. Today marks 100 years since some women won the right to vote in the UK. But how long did it take the UK and other countries around the world to grant universal suffrage? There was a dance performance in Victoria station this morning organised by various groups including the National Archives. The event took place where renowned suffragette Emily Davison took the now infamous journey to Epsom race course in 2013, when she walked onto the track during the race. In the central lobby of parliament, where female MPs and peers gathered for the group photo earlier, inside a glass case is not just the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which allowed some female votes for the first time. There are also two other significant acts in terms of female representation. Also on display is the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act, from 1918 as well, which for the first time allowed women to stand as MPs. Finally, there is the Life Peerages Act, which in ending the monopoly of hereditary peers in the Lords, meant women could join the upper house for the first time. This was only passed in 1958 – 40 years after the first women got the vote. Groups of schoolchildren on tours were being shown the acts, with their significance explained. One group which had just been shown around the House of Lords had their mind on other things. “That gold throne in there,” one boy asked their guide, “how much would it cost?” Another roundup from Twitter on today’s activities. We thought it would be fascinating to see how today’s streets were once the sites of political struggle. The difficulty of course lies in pinpointing the correct locations – often the old photographs are imprecisely captioned, and many of the buildings have disappeared! We had to make sure we included a couple of the key photos: Emmeline Pankhurst being carried away from Buckingham Palace. And Emily Davison at the Epsom racecourse. Jeremy Corbyn has pledged that the suffragettes who were given criminal records in their battle for equality would be pardoned under Labour Corbyn also promised to grant an official apology for the miscarriages of justice and persecution the campaigners suffered if he took power. Home secretary Amber Rudd has said she will look at calls to pardon suffragettes but suggested it would be a complicated to carry out. It comes as Labour launches a 12-month campaign to celebrate women’s suffrage and to look at what steps can be taken to end the “grotesque levels of inequality” in society as well as the gender pay gap. Corbyn said: “As a country, we must recognise and honour the enormous contribution and sacrifice made by women who campaigned for the right to vote. “Many of those women were treated appallingly by society and the state. Convictions of suffragettes were politically motivated and bore no relation to the acts committed.” He added: “Labour in government will both pardon the suffragettes and give an official apology for the miscarriages of justice and wider persecution they suffered.” A century on from this, we want to hear from you about the important issues facing women today, especially after a year that has brought the #metoo movement – a social media movement to show how widespread sexual assault and harassment are. Share your thoughts Tell us what you think and give views here. Theresa May is due to launch a year-long Vote 100 programme of events to celebrate a century of female suffrage today. Female MPs past and present have been invited to the reception in parliament. Speaking ahead of the event, which is expected to be the largest gathering of the UK’s women politicians ever organised, she said: “I’m proud to say we have more women and more ethnic minority MPs in government than ever before – proving that we are committed to looking more like the country we serve. She added: “As well as remembering and giving thanks to those who came before us, we must also look at what more we can do to ensure everyone in the UK, regardless of background, has the freedom to play a full and active role in public life.” Jordhi Nullatamby, 17, member of the Youth parliament for Thurrock who will compère the event, said: “The Representation of the People Act 1918 was a vital step towards the rights women have today, and the centenary of the Act is an incredibly important opportunity for us to reflect on how far we have come, thanks to the extreme bravery and sacrifice of the women who fought – and in some cases died – for equality. “Nevertheless, the job is not yet complete. The fight for equality continues, and we must continue to campaign for legislation which ensures equal opportunities for all people. Hopefully in the next 100 years we will again be able to look back and celebrate the amazing strides we have made towards an even more equal society.” A roundup of some of the events and thoughts of the day so far. Welcome to our live blog to mark the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act. We will be giving you information about the events taking place across England today and also calling for our readers to discuss the important issues facing women at the moment.

Sir Martin Narey, a government adviser on children’s social care and former chief executive of Barnardo’s, and Mark Owers, a children’s services adviser, have conducted a review for the Department for Education, and they are strikingly positive about what they have found. The care system has an undeservedly poor reputation, and fostering is a success story that rarely gets the credit it deserves, they say. Although they have strong views on how and why fostering could be improved, children in care are remarkably positive about fostering and their sense of wellbeing is “surprisingly high”, according to Narey and Owers. The review, conducted over the past six months and published on Tuesday, is based on interviews with and submissions from hundreds of people with an interest in fostering, including foster carers, care-experienced children and young people, fostering providers and social work leaders. It is eagerly awaited by the care sector, with many hoping it will bring about fundamental change. Last week Kevin Williams, chief executive of the Fostering Network, wrote about his hopes that the fostering review would recognise the need for urgent reforms. Those awaiting a rallying call for change may be disappointed. On the key issue of fostering allowances, widely criticised by carers, the review concludes that they are adequate – particularly once tax and benefit arrangements are taken into account – and are not an obstacle to recruiting high-quality carers at current levels. Despite claims of a shortage of fostering families, the review finds that, at any one time, there are about 16,000 fostering households without a child living with them. The review rejects the notion that foster carers should be defined as professionals with the same status as, for example, social workers. And it warns of the adverse consequences of extending employment rights to foster carers, as being sought in a claim against Hampshire county council. “This could negatively affect the heart of fostering,” write Narey and Owers. This is not to say that the review’s suggestions for change are not significant. Indeed, Narey and Owers recommend the creation of a permanence board, chaired by the most senior official in the department responsible for the care system. Its purpose would be to promote a whole system approach, including adoption and residential care, lasting well beyond the age of majority. They also call for an overhaul of the way local authorities plan and commission fostering, saying there is significant potential to reduce spending on fostering while securing better placements for children. They propose scrapping the role of the independent reviewing officer – saving £70m a year – and question the benefit of fostering panels. But the most profound change recommended by the review is a renewed focus on the parenting aspects of fostering, as opposed to caring. For example, it strongly recommends giving foster carers greater discretion over everyday decisions that would normally fall to parents, such as haircuts, clothes and friends. Needless bureaucratic barriers that prevent foster carers from treating foster children as they would treat their own children should be removed. It also urges the DfE to issue guidance to encourage foster carers to feel confident in showing physical affection and comfort to foster children, which is vital to a healthy childhood. “... A shifting philosophy of fostering which has seen ‘foster parents’ become ‘foster carers’, children discouraged from calling their long-term carer Mum or Dad, and sometimes a framing of carers as just another professional in a child’s life, needs to be arrested,” says the review. “Carers should be in no doubt that, unless it is unwelcome to the child, they should not curb the natural instinct to demonstrate personal and physical warmth.” In response to frequent concerns from foster carers, the review also makes robust recommendations around birth family contact, which often goes ahead against the advice of carers and despite clear evidence of distress to the child. The law was changed in 2011 to specify that contact arrangements should only be in place where they are in the interests of the child’s welfare. Yet evidence submitted to the review suggests that practice has not changed. “Professionals should not shirk from offering evidence to the courts about the potentially damaging consequences of contact,” say Narey and Owers. As a parent, if your gut instinct is that contact is wrong, then say so. The review makes realistic and affordable recommendations to improve foster care, but at its heart is a simple call for carers to be well-supported, well-trained, treated as the experts they are, and allowed to lead on decision-making for and with children. They want carers to be biased and tenacious in pursuing the interests of their foster child. This may not be the root-and-branch overhaul that many anticipated, but I believe the review’s positive impact will be felt for many years to come. Martin Barrow is a foster carer and writer.

Standing in the stadium’s east stand in gently falling snow, a 4,500-strong crowd sang hymns in remembrance of the 23 people killed when a plane carrying the United team crashed during takeoff from Munich-Riem airport on 6 February 1958. The players – nicknamed the “Busby Babes” after the team’s manager, Matt Busby – had been returning from a European Cup match in Yugoslavia in which they had drawn with Red Star Belgrade, taking them to the quarter-finals of the competition. After stopping to refuel, the plane skidded in slush on the runway during takeoff, crashed through a fence and hit a cottage. Eight players were killed along with three members of the team’s staff, eight journalists, two members of the cabin crew, a travel agent and a United supporter. Opening the ceremony on Tuesday, the club’s chaplain, the Rev John Boyers, said: “Some of us will have very vivid memories 60 years ago this afternoon, when news began to filter through via teleprinter, the BBC newsflash, the local papers, of that dreadful accident in Munich. Family, friends, colleagues, teammates and heroes were dead or injured near to that smashed BEA aircraft that should have flown to Manchester.” He later added: “When Munich happened a wave of grief and anguish swept this nation and in Manchester it impacted all. Here grief and anguish hit both United and City supporters alike. It mattered not whether you were red or blue; both sets of supporters stood together, wept together, mourned together. They all knew, together, that a remarkable team was no more.” Among the survivors were Bobby Charlton, who would win the World Cup eight years later, and Harry Gregg, who went on to become Northern Ireland manager, both of whom attended the ceremony. The current Manchester United manager, José Mourinho, and the club captain, Michael Carrick, laid wreaths on behalf of the club and players. Michael Edelson, a non-executive director at the club, read from Ecclesiastes 9 and 12: “No man knows when their hour will come: as fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare.” The club’s former manager Sir Alex Ferguson read from Psalm 103: “The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field; the wind blows over it and it is gone.” The crowd sang the Flowers of Manchester, a song written in tribute to those who died in the crash, containing the lines: “Oh, England’s finest football team its record truly great, its proud successes mocked by a cruel turn of fate. Eight men will never play again, who met destruction there, the flowers of English football, the flowers of Manchester.” Parallel ceremonies marking the tragedy were held in both Belgrade and Munich. United’s under-19 academy side, who were in Serbia for a match, visited Partizan stadium where the 1958 team played before the crash. Among those who died was Donny Davies, a football correspondent for the Manchester Guardian. His nephew Prof Norman Davies, a historian, said “Uncle Don” was a “a real Lancastrian character and an all-rounder if ever there was one”. As well as working as a headmaster, he played cricket for Lancashire for a decade, was a Scout commissioner, a lay preacher, a journalist and a broadcaster. He said his uncle had an infectious laugh: “He was brimming with good humour from morning till night, and the chuckles would grow into guffaws with the slightest provocation, till tears ran down his face. It was quite extraordinary.” Davies was 65 and was survived by his wife, Gertrude, and two daughters. “He only went on the Belgrade trip at the last moment,” his nephew said. “What we heard was that a young reporter rang him up on the Thursday saying that his wife was ill or having a baby – I can’t remember which. So Uncle Don volunteered to take his place and never came back.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2018/feb/06/stock-market-turmoil-europe-ftse100-heavy-losses-asia-us-dow-jones-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T22:36:34Z","webTitle":"Wall Street bounces back, but FTSE 100 suffers biggest fall since Brexit vote -  as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/feb/06/stock-market-turmoil-europe-ftse100-heavy-losses-asia-us-dow-jones-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/feb/06/stock-market-turmoil-europe-ftse100-heavy-losses-asia-us-dow-jones-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Wall Street bounces back, but FTSE 100 suffers biggest fall since Brexit vote -  as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Time for a recap, after another hectic day in the markets. The US stock market has roared back from its slump on Monday, in a highly volatile trading session. After initially sliding, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day with its biggest jump in over a year - up 567 points. Cue smiles on Wall Street between relieved traders. The rally came as several analysts argued that the markets were going through a correction, not embarking on a crash. The US government also tried to calm nerves, with Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin arguing that the markets were functioning well. European stock markets, though, suffered heavy falls. Britain’s FTSE 100 endured its biggest slump since the Brexit vote, falling by 193 points or 2.6% -- wiping £50bn off the index. Asian markets also tumbled on Tuesday -- but there are signs that they will recover in the upcoming trading session. Australia’s benchmark index is being called higher. But the bigger picture is that the markets look nervous, with investors worrying about potential US interest rate rises. With $4 trillion wiped off shares in the last week, further volatility seems highly likely in the days ahead. That’s probably all from us today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here’s our latest news story on the markets: Goodnight! What a difference a day makes. Traders on the floor of the New York stock exchange are grinning and sharing high fives, after seeing shares recover this afternoon. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, has commented on the US stock markets - and insisted that America’s economy is robust. Sanders says: “Look, the economy is incredibly strong right now. The president’s focus right now continues to be on the long term economic fundamentals which, like I just said, are very strong in this country. We’re infinitely better off today than we were before the president took office, particularly on the economy. We have historically low unemployment and we actually have increasing wages for American workers. There’s nothing that’s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that’s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago and we’re very comfortable with where we are right now.” Sanders added: “Does the president have second thoughts about taking credit for a booming economy? Absolutely not.” Today’s rally is the S&amp;P 500’s best one-day gain, in percentage terms, since November 2016. Quite a recovery, given it had its worst day in six years yesterday. Here’s Reuters’ closing market report: U.S. stocks posted sharp gains in another wild trading session on Tuesday, as indexes rebounded from the biggest one-day drops for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow in more than six years that stalled the market’s record run. Stocks swung from negative to positive after indexes started the session 2% lower, underscoring a return of volatility to a market that until recently was marked by an absence of major shifts. The Dow had a more than 1,100-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday. The sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback that had been long awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent. “Despite violent moves in the last couple days in the market, fundamentals in the economy are very strong and it’s not just the U.S., it’s throughout the global economy,” said Alicia Levine, head of global investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 567.02 points, or 2.33%, to 24,912.77, the S&amp;P 500 gained 46.2 points, or 1.74%, to 2,695.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 148.36 points, or 2.13%, to 7,115.88. Technology, materials and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors on Tuesday. Defensive sectors utilities and real estate were the only major S&amp;P groups to end negative. The Dow’s revival was led by chemicals firm Dow DuPont, retail chain Home Depot, tech giant Apple and oil producer Chevron, which all gained at least 4%. BREAKING: The US stock market has bounced from its worst day in six years. As the closing bell rings out across the New York stock exchange, the Dow Jones is up around 567 points, or 2.33%. It’s quite a swing, given the Dow fell over 500-points at the start of trading today. That means it has recovered around half Monday’s 1,175-point rout. The broader S&amp;P 500 also bounced back, as did the tech-focused Nasdaq. Investors will be relieved that shares haven’t suffered further losses today. But...there’s no argument that volatility is back, after a long period of calm in the financial markets. With just a few minutes trading left, Wall Street has managed to recover its poise. The Dow and the Nasdaq are both up over 2%. Fact of the day.... John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial of North Carolina sums up the day: “It’s been a crazy period and today the market is probably just trying to find some footing.” In a stark contrast to yesterday’s wobbles, the Dow just surged by 600 points -- suggesting we could recover half of Monday’s losses... Can the Dow hang on? With 30 minutes to go, the US stock market is up... but not so strongly that a late slump can be ruled out. Here’s our colleague Philip Inman on today’s market action: Shares in London plunged for a sixth day and by the largest amount since the Brexit vote, as concerns grew that febrile global stock markets, which have lost $4tn (£2.9tn) in value since Friday, were in the grip of panic-selling. The FTSE 100 slumped 2.6% to 7,141 to wipe all the gains from this year’s trading and set the index of Britain’s most valuable companies on course for a second week of losses. Investors took fright elsewhere in Europe, with markets in Germany, France and Spain all closing down by more than 2%. Stocks also tumbled across Asia earlier in the day. The Tokyo Nikkei 225 index was among the worst affected after shares fell by more than 4% to 21,620, leaving them 12% down on last month’s peak of 24,120. Wall Street, where the global stock market rout began on Monday, had a second day of volatile, high volume trading with wild swings in share prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 2.2% following the opening bell before recovering within half an hour to a gain of more than 1%, then see-sawing further through the session.... One reason the Australian market is set to bounce back is that another record half-yearly profit is expected from Commonwealth Bank, the country’s biggest company. It is forecast by analysts to announce six-month earnings of about A$5.2 billion – up 6% – despite its regulatory woes. The Australian banking sector is enormous and has benefited from the country’s extended house prices boom, although there are signs that is stalling. The big four retail banks - Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ and NAB – together with Macquarie Bank make up a whopping 25% of the ASX200. So, after shedding a record 1,175 points last night, the Dow is on track to recover a significant chunk of them...... The S&amp;P 500 is also putting on a late spurt. The Dow is continuing to rise in late trading - now up 504 points, or over 2%, at 24,850. There are signs that Asia-Pacific markets will rally on Wednesday. Australia’s ASX200 benchmark has lost A$85bn in value in two days but is set to bounce back on Wednesday, according to futures trading. It is expected to rise around 1.25% at the opening bell at 10am Sydney time, which is 11pm GMT (or two hours after Wall Street closes) The rally is back on again! As Wall Street enters its final hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is making a late charge. The Dow is now up 370 points, or 1.45% at 24,716. A lot of experts have argued today that the current selloff is just a much-needed correction, not the start of a crash. But our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn’t convinced by this breezy optimism. Instead, he highlights several reasons to be worried. For example: The past couple of days have shown one thing – that there was an awful lot of money betting on tranquillity via various financial products manufactured by investment banks. Did a wipeout of some of these low-volatility funds feed the selling pressures on Monday? Almost certainly. But is that “technical” factor a temporary sideshow that can be ignored? Not necessarily. It may be evidence that other risks have been packaged up and sold as “low risk” when they’re actually the reverse. When investors are fed cheap money for a decade, dumb bets can be made. Plus, the prelude to the drama was a rapid rise in the yield on 10-year US treasuries from 2.4% to 2.8%. This, we are told, happened because the strong news on jobs and wages means the US Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates three times this year. That explanation is entirely plausible. But a 10-year yield of 2.8% is still low by historical standards. What would something more normal – say, 4% – do? If the deflation dragon really has been slain and the Trump administration is dishing out tax cuts, isn’t 4% a possibility? On the evidence of the past week, the stock market may not adjust easily. More here: Wall Street continues to see-saw, and with 90 minutes trading left the main indices are in the red. The S&amp;P 500 has shed 0.5% (on top of Monday’s 4.1% fall), while the Dow remains pretty volatile - currently down 0.2%. Investors continue to blame the prospect of rising US interest rates, and signs that wages are finally picking up. As Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, puts it (via the FT): I still think this is a continued reaction to the very rapid rise in interest rates and inflation expectations over a short period of time. We are just seeing some continued selling after a very long period of a complacent environment.” Some of the world’s richest people are a little less rich today, thanks to yesterday’s market mayhem. Bloomberg has calculated that Warren Buffett, the veteran investor, lost $5.1bn on Monday. But that won’t stop him buying a can of his favourite cherry coke, as the Sage of Omaha is still worth $85bn. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg took the second-biggest hit - losing $3.6bn, with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos close behind. More here. Update: Dow now down 85 points. Back in London, traders are counting the damage after the FTSE 100 suffered its biggest one-day fall since the Brexit vote. Financial stocks had a bad day, with Standard Life and Schroders down over 5%. Utility stocks also suffered - National Grid and United Utilities lost over 4%. Healthcare and technology also brought up the rear. The Evening Standard has worked out that £50bn was wiped off the value of companies on the Footsie today, as the index shed 193 points or 2.6%. After Monday’s wild drama, and today’s losses in Asia and Europe, shares are finally looking calmer. The Dow is now bobbing around its opening levels, as traders take a breather and try to anticipate the market’s next move. But don’t relax! Wall Street has a habit of becoming more volatile towards the end of the day’s session. So with two hours to go, we could yet see big gains or losses. And.... the Dow has turned negative again  , down 35 points. Travelers Companies, the insurance group, is currently the biggest faller, down 2.6%. Oil giant Exxonis down 2.5%, followed by pharma group Merck (-2.15%) and Coca-Cola (-1.85%) Having been up, and down, and up, and down, the Dow Jones is currently 100 points higher today (+0.4) at 24,446. But trading remains jittery, so do not try this at home (or in the office!): Here’s investor and businessman Carl Icahn on the markets, courtesy CNBC: IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld has added his voice to those saying the economic fundamentals are strong despite the current market turmoil. If Wall Street seems incapable of deciding which direction to stick with, there was no such hesitation in Europe. With the global concerns about rising interest rates and a spate of catching up with Monday’s slump in the Dow, European markets have suffered deep declines. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 193.58 points or 2.64% to 7141.40, its biggest daily percentage decline since the Brexit vote Germany’s Dax dropped 2.32% to 12,392.66 France’s Cac closed down 2.35% at 5161.81 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 2.08% to 22,347.01 Spain’s Ibex ended 2.53% lower at 9810.0 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.74% to 838.80 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 201 points or 0.79% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.2 points or 0.08%. The sell-off in stock markets does not relate to economic fundamentals, agrees City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta: Whipsaw action is sending equity indices on a wild ride on Tuesday. As the bulls battle the bears US stocks have opened trading a wide range. The Dow had moved through 934 points early on as investors were keen to pick up bargains but fear that it is still too early to call the bottom.... The CBOE volatility Index, also known as the VIX, or fear gauge remains at elevated levels on Tuesday spiking to 50 before retracing back to 40, an increase of 7% on the day. Stepping back from the trading ranges and looking at the levels that Wall Street is trading at and suddenly it is possible to gain some perspective on the numbers. The Dow is at 24,423 (now up on the day) trading at a level that was last seen just two months ago. This sell off has been a technical phenomenon, there has not been a change in fundamentals. Right now, this is offering little comfort to traders looking to buy the dips and being wiped out by automated selling. Here, from our colleagues in New York, is a quick run through some of the reasons for the current stock market uncertainty: The stock market falls should have little impact on the overall global economy, say Capital Economics. Its chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said: The slump in equity markets would have to go a lot further to cause economic growth to slow significantly. That may yet happen, but for now prospects for global growth still look fairly bright. The fall in global equity prices over the past few days has been unusually sudden, but it is not yet exceptionally large. The MSCI World equity index has fallen by 6% from its peak last week. As a comparison, there have been four instances of double-digit percentage falls in the index since the financial crisis. These occurred in 2010 (-15%), 2011 (-20%), 2012 (-13%) and 2015/16 (-17%). It is of course quite possible that equities will fall much further in the coming days or weeks, or even hours! After all, valuations are high by past standards and the MSCI World index is still 17% above its level a year ago. But even if this happens, the fallout for the economy may still be quite small. ... Stock markets often send a false signal about the outlook for economic growth. And there has been only a small increase in corporate bond yields, which have a better track record in signalling slowdowns. The most reliable leading indicators of economic activity, such as the global PMIs and the US ISM non-manufacturing index published yesterday, suggest that the world economy is firing on all cylinders. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 2.64% or 193 points to its lowest level since last April. This is the biggest percentage drop since the day after the UK referendum on Europe, and marks the sixth successive trading day of declines. The Dow’s uncertainty continues, and it is now down 141 points. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 started the day very much offside, and then managed to drive into positive territory only to slip back again.... Traders don’t know which way to turn as uncertainty is running high. The colossal range on the US indices sum up how irrational equity traders are at the moment, and while some go bargain hunting, others are fearful we could see another leg lower. The S&amp;P 500 by the way is down 12 points or 0.44%. The current market sell off is just a correction, said Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, but he also told senators that algorithmic trading had an impact. He told the House Financial Services Committee that markets were functioning very well, although the administration was monitoring the situation. He said he was not overly concerned about the recent sell-off, and that market fundamentals were strong. There were no financial stability implications in the recent market moves, he added. Here’s a graph showing the volatility in the Dow Jones Industrial Average so far today: And there appears to be real trading out there. Volumes are around 250m compared to an average of about 139m, which appears to be the highest since the December Federal Reserve meeting (H/T Neil Wilson of ETX Capital). It’s been a chaotic start on Wall Street, says Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell. And with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 170 points, it is hard to disagree. Campbell says: The Dow was all over the place after the bell. With the futures promising the index was going to spill its guts, it was a welcome relief that the index instead quickly shifted into the green. The index is still pretty damn volatile, however.... It’s also worth noting that the Dow did something similar yesterday, ducking an immediate bloodbath only to completely lose its bottle by the end of the session. Elsewhere, the Vix volatility index has fallen back sharply (ironic, given how volatile the Dow is at the moment). After hitting a level of 50 earlier, the Vix is now down 33% on the day at 24.7. The Dow is all over the place. After the initial 550 point fall and the subsequent 350 point rise, the Dow is now up just 50 points or so. What it will close at is anyone’s guess, but the recent falls do seem to have attracted some buyers. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The valuations were certainly looking attractive on a forward earnings basis, providing attract entry points for a number of stocks. Some deep-pocketed funds may have stepped in to hoover up what they could – in this context it looks for the time being like the correction was exactly what the market needed – although we have a long way to go today still and sentiment is still fragile after two bruising sessions. The White House, and specifically the recent tax cuts, have played a part in the current market volatility, says Royal London Asset Management: US stock market volatility continues to spike higher as the strongest wage inflation in the US since 2009 triggered fears of faster than expected rises in interest rates. While Donald Trump’s White House has correctly pointed to strong economic fundamentals as a more important long term story and the role of the tax cuts in driving this, they’ve failed to appreciate the impact that their policies could have on inflation, and therefore the path of interest rates. Royal London’s head of multi asset Trevor Greetham added: Investors welcomed the announcements of tax cuts but are starting to get second thoughts as the consequences of adding stimulus late in the business cycle become clear. Unemployment is low and the potential for strong wage inflation once US tax cuts take effect has spooked markets, given what this means for US interest rate policy. Although rising interest rates pose a challenge to the stock market, this will only become a serious one once they are high enough to cause the economy to roll over. With the Fed Funds rate still below the level of core inflation in the US, that could take quite a while. We expect bouts of volatility like this to become more common now the Federal Reserve is in play, but expect stocks to recover over the coming weeks and months, making recent market moves look like an overreaction. The early recovery in US markets gives some credence to those who believe the recent falls were a much needed market correction rather than the precursor to a wider sell-off. One of those is Sven Balzer, head of investment strategy at Coutts: This week’s stock market falls show a much needed market correction after a long period of strong performance, and little more. Global economic growth remains strong and there are no signs of a US recession, which usually heralds a wider sell-off... In our view, this is a short-term correction driven by technical factors rather than concerns about the underlying economic picture or corporate health. While this can be unnerving for investors, we see a robust economic and corporate environment that should continue to support equities. Go Wall Street! Instead of sinking into the mire, the Dow is now up 350 points, or 1.4%. That means leading shares have recovered around a third of Monday’s tumble. Although the Dow Jones industrial average gets a lot of attention, serious stock market traders pay more attention to the S&amp;P 500. That’s because it contains more companies (500, instead of the Dow’s 30), so it’s a better measure of the actual US stock market. And after an early wobble, the S&amp;P 500 is now positive too -- up 1% or 27 points at 2,676 points. Wall Street is fighting back! After Monday’s wild swings, the Dow has clawed back its opening falls - and is now up 0.13%. That doesn’t make much of a dent in yesterday’s rout, but investors will be relieved that it’s not worse. Still early days though! After a rocky start, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has turned positive. Things are settling down on Wall Street. After six minutes trading, the Dow is now down 157 points -- perhaps traders are resisting the temptation to sell everything. DING DING goes the opening bell of Wall Street, triggering another wave of selling. The Dow Jones industrial average has swiftly shed 547 points, a fall of 2.25%, on top of Monday’s 1,175 slide. That takes the Dow into correction territory, down more than 10% from its peak. But...the index is swiftly rebounding from those lows, as traders get stuck in. More to follow! Right. Deep breath time. After its biggest sell-off in six years, Wall Street is about to reopen. The futures market is still jittery, as traders try to anticipate the market’s next move. Just seven minutes to go...... Veteran City analyst George Magnus has a deeply worrying take. He thinks markets are wobbling because the US government’s budget deficit is likely to spike over the next couple of years. That’s because the new Tax Cut and Jobs Act will force Washington to borrow much more to balance its books -- at a time when the economy should be strong (so borrowing should be low). Magnus writes: Trillion dollar deficits are just over the horizon, which will cause US government debt as a share of GDP to rise in the next several years to over 100 per cent. While debt levels alone cannot predict what will happen to bond yields, the markets fear that significant unfunded government borrowing—especially when the economy is doing well—will cause the Federal Reserve to carry on raising interest rates, in turn pushing bond yields higher. On current trends, this cyclical shift will eventually, maybe in 2019, puncture the stock market, corporate profits, and most likely the economy. More here: With 20 minutes until the Wall Street open, a chunky sell-off still looks likely.... Bears are running rampant through the global markets today, following Monday’s rout on Wall Street, says Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM. He questions whether the recent losses are merely a ‘healthy correction’, as some investors claim. A sense of anxiety amongst investors over central banks raising interest rates faster than expected, remains one of the likely culprits behind the global sell-off. In Asia, equities were a sea of red during early trade and the negative domino effect has already punished European markets. With Wall Street suffering its largest one-day decline in more than six years on Monday, US stocks could remain depressed this afternoon. Ongoing weakness across stock markets may prompt investors to start questioning if the global sell-off could be more than a correction but something greater. Take a deep breath, stock market traders. The opening of Wall Street is 50 minutes away, and heavy falls look likely: Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, says the financial markets are adjusting to a new world where central bankers aren’t propping assets up through loose monetary policy. He writes: Interest rates are rising at a time when the economy needs money for the increased corporate investment activity which is taking place. That means there won’t be the constant flow of money into the equity market which has been supporting prices over the last couple of years. As I said before the year ended, the real challenge for investors after an environment of very low volatility is that they may be unnerved as it “normalises”. More volatility means more opportunity for active investors with strong nerves. We see the recent sell off as validating rather than challenging that assessment” Newsflash: America’s trade deficit has widened to its highest level since the financial crisis. New figures from the Commerce Department show that the US imported $53.1bn more than it exported in December 2017, an increase of 5.3%. That’s the biggest monthly deficit since 2008. The data also show that America’s trade gap with China hit a new all-time high of over $375bn for 2017, despite Donald Trump’s efforts to cut it as part of his America First agenda. Traders on Wall Street are expecting fresh losses when the market opens in around 90 minutes time. Yesterday’s 1,175-point slump on the Dow has left many traders bruised and nervous, as the long run of calm market conditions comes to an abrupt halt. Volatility is continuing to rise today, to levels not seen since August 2015 -- adding to the anxiety in New Jork. Andre Bakhos, managing director of New Vines Capital, has told Reuters that fear is stalking the markets. “The one thing I could say with confidence is that volatility has suddenly come back into the market. “The declines in markets are steep and vicious and are fostering a feeling of fear which begets irrational behavior. So this market is now driven on fear of rates and [rising] wages. That basically means good news now is bad news. “The volatility has caused investors to be fast on their feet. It is a true traders’ atmosphere as opposed to the conditions we have been accustomed to - buy and go higher.” The turmoil in the markets today has disrupted Greece’s plans to issue a new government bond. That seven-year bond was an important stage in Athens’ escape from its bailout programme. Our correspondent Helena Smith in Athens explains: Barely 24 hours after the mandate was announced, it was decided not to push ahead with what would have been the debt-stricken country’s boldest market foray in almost eight years under international bailout programmes. It was assumed the seven-year issue would price today but one lead manager said: “we felt it would be prudent to wait for some stability. Greece doesn’t do deals very often and wants to make sure it works.” Athens had hoped to raise €3bn. The country is due to exit its current EU-IMF bailout programme – its third since May 2010 – in August and has pledged to make several market forays in order to build up a cash buffer of up to €19bn to cover debt repayments once the programme officially expires. It’s shaping up for a rough opening on Wall Street..... Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says we’re looking at a stock market correction - not a crash. He argues that America’s new top central banker, Jerome Powell, won’t stay on the sidelines for long. If the selloff continues, surely Powell’s Federal Reserve will wind back the tightening of monetary policy (the equivalent of pouring a bit more gin into the punch bowl). Larry argues: Trump has a lot riding on the stock market continuing to rise and certainly did not choose Jerome Powell to be the chairman of the Fed because he thought his appointee was an interest-rate hawk. The falls on Wall Street were triggered by last week’s labour market report, which showed unemployment at 4.1% and a pick-up in average hourly earnings. But Powell would not have to look all that hard to find reasons for a gradual, market-pleasing, rise in interest rates rather than an aggressive tightening. If the current turmoil continues, Powell will no doubt seek to reassure the markets. If this all sounds familiar, that’s because it is. During Alan Greenspan’s long reign at the Fed, Wall Street knew the central bank would ride to the rescue every time share prices plunged. It became known as “the Greenspan put”. The problem for Powell is that the Greenspan put was ultimately disastrous. It encouraged recklessness, ever bigger bubbles and the crash to end all crashes Every share on the FTSE 100 index is now down, as traders hunker down ahead of the Wall Street open in two hours time... James Andrews, head of investment management at City firm Redmayne Bentley, reckons that the global selloff will abate soon. He argues that investors have over-reacted to last week’s jump in US wages (which arguably makes rising inflation and higher interest rates more likely). Andrews says: “This isn’t to say the volatility can’t continue, as we have had a phase of very low volatility and some profit taking is natural following a prolonged period of exceptional returns. However, given the positive fundamentals around the globe currently, it feels like any market pull-back should be relatively short in nature at this time until we see a material change in global interest rates, and therefore the return on cash and less risky assets, not to mention a less favourable outlook for companies globally.” Here’s Reuters latest market update: World stock markets nosedived for a fourth day running on Tuesday, having seen $4 trillion wiped off from what just eight days ago had been record high values. Europe’s main bourses were down around 2 percent, leaving investors with little option but to seek traditional refuges such as gold and one of the initial triggers for the selloff - benchmark government bonds. Wall Street futures offered a chink of light as they turned higher in Europe but commodities remained gloomy, with oil and industrial metals all tumbling backwards as the year’s upbeat start for markets soured rapidly. “Playtime is officially over, kids,” analysts at Rabobank said. “Rising volatility painfully reminds some investors that one-way bets don’t exist.” European stock markets are heading lower as lunchtime approaches, as investors fear another day of losses on Wall Street. Britain’s FTSE 100 is now down 180 points, or 2.5%, heading close to this morning’s one-year low. That’s because the futures market is now indicating fresh losses in New York when the market opens (at 2.30pm UK time, or 8.30am on the East Coast). Right now, the S&amp;P 500 index (which covers the major US companies) is predicted to fall 1% - on top of Monday’s 4% slide. The Dow is also being called lower - it could shed 400 points at the open, following yesterday’s 1,175 rout. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says investors will be glued to the Wall Street open, to get their next cue for where global markets are headed. He adds: Futures have been all over the place this morning but seem to be settling lower, ready to push through another run of levels on the downside. It’s been a rough day for traders around the globe, as today’s correction has gathered pace. Oh dear. Investors who had bet on low market volatility by putting money into that XIV security have been discussing their losses on Reddit. One claims to have lost $4m, due to the surge in volatility yesterday, while other small traders are nursing smaller, but painful, losses. The Dow Jones futures price has been flailing around since Wall Street closed 14 hours ago: Update: The FTSE 100 is currently down 150 points, or 2%, at 7183 points. That’s the lowest level since April 2017, but a recovery on this morning’s one-year low (when the FTSE fell 250 points). Nicholas Brooks, Head of Economic and Investment Research at Intermediate Capital Group, says the sell-off seems to be easing off.... for the moment. The equity market corrections of the past few days were overdue and not unexpected. The sell-off appears to be abating at the moment, with US government yields having dropped back to pre-correction levels and market indices and futures bouncing, but changes in market positioning and technicals make short-term predictions of market direction particularly difficult. Volatility in the world’s financial markets has soared in recent days, bringing a long period of calm to an abrupt end. The CBOE VIX index, commonly known as the Wall Street ‘fear index’, has jumped by 14% this morning to 42.62, a gain of 5.3 points. That’s the highest level since August 2015 (when worries over China’s economy rocked the markets). Yesterday the VIX more than doubled, as shares slumped in London, New York, and then across Asia. It has only closed higher on three previous occasions. This surge in volatility is bad news for speculators who had wagered that markets would remain calm. But how would you place such a bet?.... Well, Credit Suisse has the answer. It offers a financial product called the “inverse VIX”, which rises when volatility falls -- and allows traders to profit from calm markets. Last night’s drama has sparked fears that some hedge funds will be sitting on heavy losses on their XIV holdings, which they weren’t able to unravel. Credit Suisse has said this morning that it hasn’t incurred any trading losses on its inverse VIX product. But surely someone has lost money? After all, the XIV fell heavily in after-hours trading. CNBC has more details. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, says the stock markets love affair with Donald Trump is over. Rather than revelling in Trump’s tax cuts, investors are now focusing on the inflationary impact, and the likely surge in government borrowing to cover the shortfall in revenue. He writes: We are seeing the biggest correction for well over a year on the stock markets but it’s too early to call this a crash. In the last few years indices followed a strong bullish trend and so far, this is nothing more than a physiological correction. The violence of the fall seen in the US on Friday and Monday has to be kept in the context of the huge growth of Dow Jones and Wall Street in the last few years. For Trump however, the long honeymoon between him and the stock markets is well and truly over. Significantly, after years of low inflation, we are now talking about the opposite scenario for the US. Eek. The futures market is now indicating that the Dow Jones industrial average will fall further when trading resumes, in under four hours. It’s still early days (many New York traders will still be asleep), but a sign that Wall Street is somewhat feverish after the biggest daily fall since 2011. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, warns that there could be more turmoil ahead: Stock markets are still squarely in the red this morning even though we are seeing a recovery. After another horrendous session in New York last night and Asia overnight equity markets in Europe are feeling the pain. The sheers size of the sell-offs has sent traders running for the exit. This morning there is some short covering and bargain going on, but the real acid test will be if this short-term move higher can be sustained. Markets don’t move in straight lines so this could be the calm before the next storm. A top central banker has called on international authorities to rein in bitcoin. Agustín Carstens, the new head of the Bank for International Settlements, warned this morning that bitcoin had become a combination of “a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster”. More here: Time for a quick recap. European stock markets have suffered sharp losses this morning after Wall Street was routed last night. But markets are clawing their way back from their worst levels, as investors cross their fingers and hope that we’re experiencing a correction, not a full-blown crash. After two hours trading, the FTSE 100 is down 146 points - or 2% - at 7189. It had earlier hit a one-year low, by shedding 255 points at the open. The Footsie has now fallen by around 6.3% this year, and shed all 2017’s gains. Across Europe, traders have been selling hard - after the shock of seeing the Dow Jones industrial average tumble by 1,175 points on Monday, its biggest points fall ever (but a more modest percentage decline of 4.6%). The benchmark Stoxx 600 is down 1.6%, with heavier losses in Germany (-1.9%). European markets had initially plunged by 3%, their biggest fall since the Brexit vote, after a day of heavy losses in Asia. But shares are rebounding off their worst levels, thanks to indications that Wall Street may open higher. Several analysts are suggesting that today’s falls are a correction, following frothy rises during 2017. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says: Whilst there was no single event which prompted Monday’s sell off, fears over rising interest rates dampening economic growth and the fact that the market is long due a correction, have been weighing on sentiment. The first signs falling confidence and investors have been surprisingly quick to sell out and book profits from the phenomenal rally over the past few months. Asian investors have already suffered a bad day, with Japan’s Nikkei sliding into correction territory (10% below its peak), the Hong Kong Hang Seng down 5%, China’s main markets down around 3%, and India’s Sensex down 1.5%. Today’s sell-off is a great chance to buy stocks, says Michael Strobaek, Global CIO at Credit Suisse. Strobaek is telling his clients that this week’s sell-off is not a crash, and actually an opportunity to snap up shares. Here’s his reasoning: “We still consider the equity bull market to be intact and to have the potential to go further. Yet, as we have said on numerous occasions, the bull market is not going to be as good as what we saw in 2017, and it will be associated with high levels of volatility, as short rates and now yields have left their bottoms and are moving higher.’’ Recent risk-off moves in equities do not shake our equities conviction. We see the latest developments as a healthy correction that offers a buying opportunity for clients who wish to deploy cash.” Just 12 days ago, US president Donald Trump was bragging to the World Economic Forum that the markets were up 50% on his watch (a slight exaggeration). He even claimed that they’d actually have fallen 50% if the Democrats had won the 2016 election, as he banged the drum for his tax cuts. However, Trump’s trip to Davos may mark the top of the rally. As this charts shows, the Dow has fallen by around 8% since his trip to the ski resort: Disappointingly, Trump hasn’t commented about the markets recently. The FT has called him out for this today, pointing out that he tweeted 60 times during the Dow’s surge of record highs in 2017. The boss of oil giant BP, Bob Dudley, is relieved that the FTSE is only at a one-year low. Breaking away from the markets briefly. Over at Parliament,former Carillion executives are being grilled over the collapse of the outsourcing company last month. It’s being streamed live here. My colleague Rob Davies is watching. He reports that Carillion’s ex-boss is blaming certain clients for its demise, but MPs aren’t impressed.... Paul McNamara, investment director at asset management firm GAM, reports that it’s a rough morning - especially for any trader trying to persuade clients to bet that the markets will be calm: Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, says the recent phase of unnatural calm in the markets is definitely over. “The low volatility regime is likely dead – 2017 and early 2018 were a crazy anomaly. So far the blow up is scary but has been relatively contained. This is the largest two-day selloff since the flash crash of August 2015. A 12% top-to-bottom move in S&amp;P 500 futures is likely the product of a chain reaction that started last Friday when unexpectedly strong US wage growth figures pushed US rates higher. S&amp;P 500 futures are now up 2.6% from their lows.” But Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform, Infinox, argues that the sell off is actually healthy: “While the fall in global equity markets looks dramatic, it is no more dramatic than the record rises we have seen since the end of November. For that reason alone many would argue a correction was on the cards. “The party may be over for now but this could be more of a sobering correction than a rout. “There have been plenty of warnings over the past few weeks that equities were overvalued and that US stock markets in particular were overheating. The Dow Jones industrial average is now predicted to rise by 137 points later today. That would barely make an impact on Mondays 1,175-point rout, but could calm fears that a crash is brewing.... There’s a glimmer of good news -- the futures market is suggesting that the US stock market may open higher after yesterday’s rout. The S&amp;P Futures contract is currently up around 0.8%, indicating that American shares will claw back some of Monday’s slump (when the S&amp;P 500 shed 4.1%). Wall Street doesn’t open for five hours, though, so the situation could change. After one hour’s trading, European stock markets are a sea of red - although they’re coming back from their worst levels. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, points out that Britain’s stock market has underperformed Wall Street over the last year - even before today’s rout. He writes: The recent falls in the Dow Jones has left the index down 1.5% in the year to date – but over the last year, the index remains in positive territory to the tune of 21%. In terms of the UK, rather more apples have fallen as the tree has been shaken. Over the last year the index is completely flat, whilst in the year to date it has fallen 6.4%. The previous benefit of weaker sterling has evaporated, and whilst participation in the previous rally was somewhat half-hearted, the same cannot be said of the UK market’s reaction to the current jitters. Gemma Godfrey, founder of investment site Moola, also blames last week’s strong US jobs data for sparking a bloodbath in stocks. This is one of the roughest mornings for the markets in 18 months: The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more medium-sized UK firms, is also suffering big losses today. The FTSE 250 is down over 2%, with almost every member falling. Transport firm Stagecoach is the biggest faller, down almost 9% after losing its franchise to run Britain’s East Coast rail franchise. Online grocer Ocado has shed 7% after missing its profit expectations this morning. It’s worth remembering that the stock markets posted some astonishing gains last year, with global stocks gaining 22% and Britain’s FTSE 100 up 7.6%.. Economics journalist Dharshini David says the markets are now coming back to earth: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the sell-off is being driven by a ‘perfect storm’. They include: A strong 2017 rally extending into January, low volatility, low interest rates, over-optimism and complacency, over-leverage and financial engineering, all coming to a head as investors react to the possibility of higher/faster interest rates rises with bond yields creeping higher to jeopardise the current market situation. It’s always hard to explain exactly why the financial markets are behaving in a certain way. But many City experts are attributing the sell-off to fears that central banks will soon raise interest rates, ending the era of cheap money. Last Friday, we learned that American workers have enjoyed the biggest jump in earnings since 2009. That’s great news - except it could force the US central bank to hike borrowing costs more aggressively. Investors are now factoring in four American interest rate hikes this year - up from three before. It’s also worth noting that markets surged in 2017, thanks to optimism over the global economy. Donald Trump’s tax cuts gave shares another lift -- because cutting corporation tax is good for profits. But.. those same tax cuts could force America to borrow more money to cover its budget deficit. That would probably push down the value of US government debt, and push up the interest rate (or yield) on those bonds. Again, that could force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. It could also make bonds a more attractive investment - another reason to ditch shares today.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: European stocks have fallen to their lowest level since last August, as traders hit the sell button at bourses across the continent. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe’s biggest companies, has fallen by 3.1% this morning. Germany is having a particularly bad morning, down over 3.5%. The London stock market is still deep in the red, but might be bouncing off its opening slump. The FTSE 100 has now lost 7% of its value so far this year, despite hitting a record high in January. Here are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 in early trading: Boom! Britain’s blue-chip index of top shares is tumbling at the start of trading, to its lowest level in a year. The FTSE 100 fell by 255 points, or over 3.2%, to 7079 points, with every share losing ground. It’s not been that low since December 2016. Investors are scrambling to sell shares following the tumbles on Wall Street last night, and Asia earlier today. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group tells us: The stock market open in the UK and Europe looks about as bad as it can get. The bloodbath on Wall Street, which was repeated in Asia has seen confidence evaporate in Europe. Hold onto your hats.... the European stock markets are about to open... Cryptocurrencies are also being hammered hard this morning. Bitcoin has tumbled by 12% this morning, taking the digital currency below $6,000 for the first time this year. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says: The most famous digital currency has fallen 69% from December’s record high, and almost 56% from the start of the year. The slide comes after many banks in the U.S. and U.K. considered banning customers from buying cryptocurrencies using their credit cards. It seems the war against the crypto-world is far from over, and how the situation involves from here remains unknown, but risks are certainly high. If you missed last night’s turmoil (where were you?), here’s a reminder of how the Dow Jones Industrial Average took an almighty bath: Risk aversion is “high” in the City today as we head towards the start of trading., says Elsa Lignos of RBC Capital Markets. She says RBS’s ‘risk aversion thermometer’ hit a 2.5 year high of 27 on Monday - the highest level since China stunned the markets by devaluing its currency in 2015. Lignos adds: That time it took six weeks to turn risk-seeking again. Jamie McGeever of Reuters has a sobering fact -- $4 trillion has been wiped off global markets in the last week. That figure could be somewhat higher by the end of the day.... Earlier today Japan’s Nikkei fell into ‘correction territory’, meaning it has shed more than 10% from its recent high. The sharp losses on global stock markets in recent days may be a sign that the ‘Goldilocks’ era is over -- replaced by some aggressive and hungry bears. Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities., explains: “Since last autumn, investors had been betting on the goldilocks economy - solid economic expansion, improving corporate earnings and stable inflation. But the tide seems to have changed.” Good morning from London. Financial markets are in turmoil after America’s stocks suffered their biggest one-day slide in six years. The Dow plunged by over 1,100 points on Monday, its worst points loss ever and the biggest one-day percentage decline since the Eurozone crisis of 2011. This has sent shockwaves through the markets, as investors fear that the long bull market in shares and bonds may be ending. Worries over rising inflation and the prospect of American interest rate rises sparked Monday’s sell off. Some traders warning that computer trading strategies has triggered a flash crash (at one stage the Dow was down by a vertiginous 1,500 points). Already today, Asian markets have posted severe losses. Japan’s Nikkei has shed 4.7%, while Australia’s market shed 3.2%. My colleague Claire Phipps has been live-blogging all the action in Asia’s markets here: European markets open in under an hour, and traders are already expecting heavy losses. City firm IG are calling Britain’s FTSE 100 down around 3%, with the French, German, Italian and Spanish markets also heading for very sharp falls. Jingyi Pan of IG warns that the markets are febrile today: “There would be few places to hide from the risk-off atmosphere that is expected to extend its stay in Asian markets today in a significant manner. This is fear rolling over itself,” Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says this correction has been a long time coming... These declines have been a long time coming and in a sense have already started to become self-accelerating. At the end of last year margin debt levels on US stocks were at record highs, helping fuel the rise we’ve seen in the last few months. The sell-off in the last few days is likely to reverse this trend, and potentially accelerate it further, particularly if investors start to unwind it over concerns that we could fall further, which seems likely if events in Asia this morning are any guide. It’s a volatile situation out there - traders will be looking to see whether Wall Street can recover, or whether it suffers fresh losses. We’ll be tracking all the action through the day...."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/06/hong-kong-activists-have-jail-sentences-overturned","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T09:08:06Z","webTitle":"Hong Kong activists have jail sentences overturned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/06/hong-kong-activists-have-jail-sentences-overturned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/06/hong-kong-activists-have-jail-sentences-overturned","fields":{"headline":"Hong Kong activists have jail sentences overturned","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Three prominent Hong Kong democracy activists have won an appeal in the territory’s highest court against jail sentences relating to the 2014 “umbrella movement” protests, but were warned that future acts of civil disobedience would be dealt with harshly. Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow were given prison terms ranging from six to eight months in August on charges of “unlawful assembly” for staging a demonstration that sparked 11 weeks of sit-ins in 2014 calling for greater democracy. A five-judge panel at the court of final appeal said those sentences applied a new standard “retroactively”, and overturned the prison terms. But speaking for the court, the chief justice, Geoffrey Ma, said “elements of disorder or violence must be deterred”, and “fully endorsed” harsher sentences for protests in the future. Hong Kong’s government has taken an increasingly hard line on dissent in the past year, jailing protesters, banning activists from standing for election over their political views and successfully applying for popularly elected lawmakers to be disqualified. The judgment was a victory for the young protesters who turned out in their thousands to agitate for greater democracy. But in an increasingly divided Hong Kong, the court’s warning that “it is now necessary to emphasise deterrence and punishment” struck an ominous note. “Even though today my sentence was reduced, I’m still facing prison for other charges,” Wong said. “Although we won today, Hong Kong is still far from upholding the rule of law, there are still political prisoners and the government is pursuing a political agenda in the courts.” The jail terms were highly controversial and came after Hong Kong’s Beijing-appointed government applied for harsher punishments. The trio had already been given lighter sentences, with Wong and Law completing community service and Chow receiving a suspended prison term. “The Hong Kong government has redoubled efforts to weaken pro-democracy voices,” said Maya Wang, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The government is using this case to see how far it can go in pursuing political prosecutions, and it will inform their strategy going forward.” “No one should be prosecuted for a peaceful protest,” she added. In jailing the three activists last year, Judge Wally Yeung argued the sentences were a necessary deterrent to what he called a “sick trend” of anti-government protest. The trio were nominated for the 2018 Nobel peace prize by a group of US lawmakers last week for their “principled commitment to a free and prosperous Hong Kong. They are an inspiration and their cause has reverberations far beyond their city.” The UK handed back Hong Kong to China in 1997 under an agreement that promised to safeguard the city’s autonomy from the Communist-ruled mainland and pledged greater freedoms. Some observers have expressed concern over human rights. Paddy Ashdown, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, painted a bleak picture after a recent fact-finding trip. “Over the past five years, the freedoms guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong in its mini-constitution, the basic law, have been increasingly eroded,” Ashdown wrote in the report. “The rule of law is under pressure, human rights are undermined and the city appears no closer to democracy.” Writing in the Guardian after beginning his prison stint, Wong said: “Being locked up is an inevitable part of our long, exhausting path to democracy. Our bodies are held captive, but our pursuit of freedom cannot be contained.” The jail terms have already prevented Wong and Law from running in an upcoming byelection for the city’s legislature, where rules prevent anyone sentenced to more than three months in prison from standing for five years. Wong was jailed for an additional three months in January on a separate charge of failing to leave a protest site during the 2014 sit-in. He had pleaded guilty. Last month, the government banned Agnes Chow, who founded a political party with Wong and Law, from standing for election because of her party’s pro-democracy manifesto."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/07/kenya-opposition-lawyer-miguna-miguna-deported-crackdown-row-judiciary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T12:10:45Z","webTitle":"Deported Kenyan opposition figure rails against 'despotic regime'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/07/kenya-opposition-lawyer-miguna-miguna-deported-crackdown-row-judiciary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/07/kenya-opposition-lawyer-miguna-miguna-deported-crackdown-row-judiciary","fields":{"headline":"Deported Kenyan opposition figure rails against 'despotic regime'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Kenyan authorities have deported a senior opposition figure in the latest move of a wide-ranging crackdown on political opponents and an intensifying confrontation with the judiciary. Miguna Miguna, who had been held in police custody in defiance of a court order demanding his release, was put on a flight to Canada via Europe at about 10pm on Tuesday. “The illegitimate, despotic regime ... forcefully placed me on a late night KLM flight from Nairobi to Amsterdam in flagrant violation of my constitutional rights, five court orders and common decency,” Miguna said in a statement on Wednesday. The lawyer was arrested last week in a dawn raid on his home in Nairobi after participating in a mock swearing-in ceremony for opposition leader Raila Odinga that was attended by thousands of people. Government lawyers called the ceremony an act of treason. Three TV networks were closed down after broadcasting it, of which two have reopened. Fourteen opposition members have had their passports suspended. Judges had ordered the authorities to free Miguna, but instead he was presented in court in a small town 60km (37 miles) from the capital on Tuesday, to be charged with “being present and consenting to the administration of an oath to commit a capital offence”. The crackdown and confrontation with the judiciary comes three months after Uhuru Kenyatta won another five-year term as president in an election rerun triggered when the supreme court annulled the result of an August election because of irregularities. Kenyatta won the rerun with 98% of the vote, but turnout was only 39% after the opposition boycotted the poll, saying it was neither free nor fair. Odinga dismissed the October election as “fake” and the supreme court was again asked to dismiss the result, but it upheld Kenyatta’s victory. The arrests and broadcast bans are a shock to Kenyans, who have grown used to a freewheeling media and irreverent political culture since decades of autocratic rule ended in 2002. Odinga’s supporters protested on Tuesday, blocking roads and clashing with police in the western city of Kisumu. A man was killed by a stray bullet after police fired into the air to disperse demonstrators in nearby Ahero, Miguna’s home town. On Tuesday evening, the high court judge Luka Kimaru ordered all proceedings against Miguna to be stopped until police brought him to a Nairobi court, as previously ordered. Kimaru had earlier ruled that senior police officers were guilty of disobeying court orders to release Miguna, and summoned them to appear before him. Instead, Miguna was placed on a KLM flight departing Nairobi for Amsterdam, his lawyers said. The authorities say Miguna failed to follow administrative procedures after gaining Canadian citizenship several years ago and was therefore no longer considered a Kenyan national. This claim was contested by Miguna’s lawyers and supporters, who said he had been a candidate in multiple elections last year. Only Kenyan citizens can stand. Overnight, an official government website said: “Miguna is headed home.” Miguna told reporters at court that he had been held for five days without access to his family or a lawyer, in conditions “unfit for human existence”. An editorial in the Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, said the authorities were sending the wrong signal by deciding “which laws and court orders to obey and which ones to ignore”. “In a democracy, adherence to the rule of law and respect for institutions such as the judiciary are important glues that hold the country together,” it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/feb/07/global-stocks-markets-ftse-dow-nikkei-shares-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T18:21:24Z","webTitle":"Dow ends lower in volatile trading but European shares rebound - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/feb/07/global-stocks-markets-ftse-dow-nikkei-shares-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/feb/07/global-stocks-markets-ftse-dow-nikkei-shares-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Dow ends lower in volatile trading but European shares rebound - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In another volatile day of trading, US markets ended the day in negative territory after a new rise in bond yields. Yields rose after a disappointing bond auction and reports of a new budget deal which would increase current spending caps. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 19.42 points at 24,893.35. After an earlier rise of 381 points this was its biggest turnaround since August 2015. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 ended down 0.5%. On that note we’ll close up until tomorrow. After their declines on Tuesday, European markets have taken their cue from the overnight rise on Wall Street and also the opening optimism in the US. The FTSE 100, which saw its biggest losses since the Brexit vote on Tuesday, has recovered more than half of the decline, and there was a similar picture elsewhere. Signs that Germany was putting its political differences aside also helped sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 138.02 points or 1.93% at 7279.42 Germany’s Dax rose 1.6% to 12,590.43 France’s Cac climbed 1.82% to 5255.90 Italy’s FTSE MIB was 2.86% better at 22,986.18 Spain’s Ibex ended up 1.7% at 9976.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.33% to 849.94 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 132 points or 0.49%, off its best levels after US ten year bond yields rose to a day’s high of 2.828% in the wake of a disappointing auction. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. We’ll be back tomorrow (unless something major happens before then). Thanks for reading and all your comments. Meanwhile, Greece is mulling pushing ahead with the sale of a seven-year euro benchmark bond - postponed on account of the sell-off - on Thursday, bankers say. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After years of exile, the debt-stricken county is keen to prove it can tap international markets again. The seven-year issue would be its boldest market foray yet, and was formally announced on Monday with trading expected to take place Tuesday. Instead, Greek finance officials took one look at the market rout and thought better of it. But depending on how the US markets perform, trade could begin Thursday bankers are now saying. Greece hopes to raise €3bn with the issue as part of efforts to build up a €19bn cash buffer that would allow the country to cover debt repayments independently when its third international bailout programme officially expires in August. Back with cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin is up 4% to $8,050 despite negative comments from Goldman Sachs. Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at payments specialist Centtrip, said: Bitcoin staged a solid recovery today, having previously fallen 70% from its record highs last December. The cryptocurrency briefly dropped below the $6,000 a coin level before gaining almost 40%, and is now back above $8,000 a coin. The rise comes at a time when Goldman...suggested market participants should be ready for cryptocurrencies to hit zero. According to the bank, the fall in cryptocurrencies, which erased nearly $500 billion worth of market value over the last month, could get a lot worse. Nouriel Roubini, an American economist, suggested that bitcoin was ‘much worse’ than Tulipmania. His comments had zero impact on the recent surge in Bitcoin, suggesting that some of the optimism around cryptocurrencies is still there. A break of $9,500 would signal further gains for the coin, but a longer term move lower is more likely. US interest rates should not rise before the middle of the year, according to Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans. With the recent strong data - notably Friday’s wage growth - analysts have been becoming more convinced a rate rise is on the cards in March, with four rather than three rises in the rest of the year. But speaking at a conference in Iowa, Evans said: With the data I see today, my policy strategy would be to keep policy on hold until midyear or so in order to assess the incoming inflation data. If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted. In contrast, suppose inflation picks up more assuredly, as many expect. Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction. Evans said he expected US GDP to grow between 2.5% and 2.75% this year, with growth slowing over the next two years as the boost from Donald Trump’s tax cuts wears off. As for inflation, he expects it to rise gradually over the next few years: There is a hint that this may be in train today. Some inflation indicators over the past couple of months have been positive. I also am hearing a bit more commentary from manufacturers about higher commodity prices. While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I’ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets. In my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target. Evans voted against a rate rise in December but is a non-voting member this year, so his comments won’t necessarily hold much sway when it comes to the path of interest rates, although his reasoning is interesting. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The rout in stocks seen in the first two days of the week seems a long way away now, as a classic rebound in sentiment sees the Dow gain over 200 points within the first two hours, while the FTSE 100 continues to claw its way higher. The ‘cash on the sidelines’ theory gets a lot of stick these days, since who in their right mind would still hold cash when the market kept racing higher, but evidently equity investors (or their passive machine counterparts) have managed to scrimmage behind the sofa for some more funds in order to go bargain hunting in stock markets. While we can’t tell what will happen next, the current course of events has mirrored previous market selloffs – brief panic, steady recovery and then a return to the longer-term rally. It is, after all, a bull market. The rebound in markets continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 311 points or 1.28%, while the FTSE 100 is 2.26% better, Germany’s Dax is up 1.8% and France’s Cac has climbed 1.89%. Oil prices have come under pressure amid a rise in US crude stocks and a jump in US production. Opec and Russia have agreed output cuts to try and support crude prices, but there were concerns that US producers would step in to fill any shortfalls as the price rose. Last week the Energy Information Administration reported that US production rose by 332,000 barrels a day to a record high of 10.25m barrels a day. Meanwhile crude inventories rose by 1.9m barrels last week. Brent fell more than 0.8% on the news to $66.18, giving up all the gains made so far this year. The news from the US offset reports that the UK Forties pipeline was shut with no clear indication of when it would re-open. Here’s our story on Donald Trump’s latest comments on the stock market. Dominic Rushe writes: The stock market is making a “big mistake”, Donald Trump said on Thursday, days after a record-breaking sell-off on the US exchanges. “In the ‘old days,’ when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!” Trump wrote on Twitter in his first public comment on the sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,175 points on Monday following another sharp fall last Friday. The drop appears to have been triggered by news of stronger than expected growth in wages which fueled expectations of a sharper rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve. Commenting on the markets on Tuesday White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the US economy was “incredibly strong” and “nothing that’s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that’s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago”. Since his election Trump US – and global – stock markets have hit a series of record highs. Trump has consistently pointed to rising stock markets as proof that his economic policies are working. The full report is here: President Trump’s boasting about the rise in the US stock market came shortly before the crash, and he has been notably silent about it since then. Until now that is: The bounce on Wall Street has given an extra lift to European markets. The FTSE 100 is now up 105 points or 1.5%, while Germany’s Dax has risen 0.9% and France’s Cac has climbed 0.8%. As a sign we’re in for another volatile day, the Dow is now up 97 points. After Tuesday’s rollercoaster ride in US markets which ended with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 567 points and the S&amp;P 500 breaking a four day losing streak, Wall Street is heading lower again. As politicians scramble to put together a two year Budget plan that would prevent another government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down around 111 points but the decline was quickly reduced to just 29 points. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq Composite both opened down 0.32%. Ahead of Wall Street’s open, Federal Reserve voting member William Dudley says he believes “the markets are functioning quite well.” But he also said: Europe’s economy is expected to show robust growth this year and next after a better than forecast performance in 2017, according to the European Commission. In its latest forecasts the Commission said both the eurozone and the wider EU saw GDP grow by 2.4% last year, better than the 2.2% and 2.3% respectively that it predicted in November. For 2018 the Commission expects a slowdown to 2.3%, although this is higher than the 2.1% it forecast in November. It is forecasting a further decline to 2% in 2019, but again this is higher than the November estimate of 1.9%. It said: This is a result of both stronger cyclical momentum in Europe, where labour markets continue to improve and economic sentiment is particularly high, and a stronger than expected pick-up in global economic activity and trade. On inflation it expected a modest pick-up next year: Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, is expected to stay subdued as labour market slack recedes only slowly and wage pressures remain contained. Headline inflation will continue to reflect the significant influence of energy prices and is forecast to rise modestly. Inflation in the euro area reached 1.5% in 2017. It is forecast to remain at 1.5% in 2018 and to increase to 1.6% in 2019. And more positivity about the markets for 2018, this time from Goldman Sachs: Here’s bit of context for the recent market falls: James Swanson, Chief Investment Strategist at asset manager MFS, is also in the ‘correction not a crash’ crew. He argues that the economics fundamentals are solid, so shares shouldn’t keep plunging. Conditions don’t appear to be in place for a prolonged market downturn. Corporate balance sheets remain strong, while fourth-quarter earnings have surpassed expectations. Additionally, the credit markets aren’t signaling that a major shift in risk appetite has taken place. High-yield bond spreads have widened, but only marginally, from historically tight levels. Recent yield increases in non-investment-grade bonds have been driven more by rising Treasury rates than by growing credit concerns. That’s a source of comfort for equity investors. In just over an hour, we’ll discover if Wall Street agrees... London’s stock market is creeping higher, helping the FTSE 100 recover from yesterday’s 10-month low. The Footsie is now at its daily high, up 80 points or 1.1%. That shows that some confidence has returned to the City. However, it still leaves shares down 6% so far this year. Financial stocks are leading the rally, with energy stocks and utilities also in demand. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta remains cautious, though: Whilst we don’t expect this sell off to continue for an extended period of time, given that the fundamentals remain strong and unchanged, it is difficult to call the bottom and judge whether stocks have fallen sufficiently for investors to see value once again. After days of falls, Bitcoin is staging a rally today. The digital currency has bounced back up to $8,200, having hit a near-three month low below $6,000 on Tuesday. Bitcoin has been under pressure from regulators and politicians in recent weeks, keen to crack down on the use of digital currencies for money-laundering and reckless speculation. But Nigel Brahams, partner at London law firm Collyer Bristow, argues that we shouldn’t write bitcoin off: “The current situation is like the dot com boom and bust in the late 1990s, when cynics who couldn’t face up to a changing world wrote off new online businesses too readily. The weak businesses and valueless coins will fail, but the really good projects like Ethereum and Bitcoin are here to stay, much like Amazon 20 years ago.” America’s Dow Jones industrial average is being called down 1%, when trading begins in three-and-a-half hour. There’s less fear in the markets today, but volatility remains high, says Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades. It is curious considering the fact that for years we were fighting against low inflation or even deflation and now this correction is generated by growing expectations of inflation in the US. American stock indices lead the recovery in the last few year and now they spread the uncertainty around the world. Investors who had wagered that the markets would remain calm have been burned by this week’s turmoil. For example, those who bought a security from Japanese bank Nomura, which moved inversely to market volatility, have lost almost all their money. Bloomberg explains: Nomura Holdings Inc. issued an apology after investors in a $300 million product betting on low volatility were all but wiped out during this week’s stock-market turmoil. Japan’s biggest brokerage said Wednesday that it has received inquiries from individual investors after its decision to redeem the exchange-traded notes at a 96 percent discount. “We sincerely apologize for causing significant difficulties to investors,” its Nomura Europe Finance unit said in a statement a day earlier. Nomura’s Next Notes S&amp;P500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Excess Return Index ETN involved a bet against stock-market gyrations by moving in the opposite direction to a gauge of volatility. Its early redemption -- the first of its kind in Japan -- was triggered after the notes lost more than 80 percent of their value amid the global equity-market selloff. The bulls still have the upper hand over the bears on Europe’s trading floors today. After two hours trading, the main indices are all up, as investors hold their nerve. The FTSE 100 has dipped back a little, up 35 points at 7179. Germany’s DAX is up 0.6%, while the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 0.9%. Shares may have found some support after recent losses, but it’s not a strong recovery. Analysts at FX Pro reckon investors are using the turmoil as a cautious buying opportunity: It may still be too early to talk about a return to growth or to celebrate another fast and easy victory of the bull market. Rather, it seems more likely that panicked selling will give way to more calculated portfolio rebalancing. Reuters have a good explanation for how computerised trading, and bets on low volatility, combined to cause this week’s market mayhem: It was a steep spike in yields last Friday that sparked the initial rout on Wall Street, forcing sales by a host of highly leveraged funds, which ramped up volatility and drove yet more selling. Many of these were algorithmic funds crowded into similar trades - long stocks and short volatility. The selling then cascaded through their computer systems in a way almost beyond human intervention. The pivotal gauge of S&amp;P 500 volatility, the VIX , did come off almost 20 points overnight but was still relatively elevated at 29.98 percent. “Short volatility funds were caught by the spike in the VIX and had to cover,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. “You’re a genius until you’re not and when it takes just a day or two to unwind your whole strategy then you were never a genius,” he added. “But volatility does cluster, so there is no guarantee that markets are out of the woods yet.” Important news out of Berlin. Angela Merkel has reportedly reached a deal with Germany’s Social Democrats to create a new grand coalition. After overnight talks, the CDU/CSU and the SPD have broken the deadlock and hammered out a deal that - in principle - would return Merkel as chancellor, according to media reports from Germany. But... the SPD’s members still have to approve the plan. They’ll vote in the next few weeks. Intriguingly, it appears that the SPD could get control of the German finance ministry, and the foreign ministry. That could have significant impact on the eurozone’s economic policy -- Germany’s next finance minister might take a less hard-line approach on issues such as debt relief and eurobonds, compared to Wolfgang Schäuble.... NEWSFLASH: UK house prices fell in January, according to the latest survey from Halifax bank. Halifax reports that prices declined by 0.6% in the three months to January, following a 0.8% fall a month earlier. That takes the annual house price inflation rate down to 2.2%, compared with 2.7% in December. Halifax also found that fewer new homes are coming onto the market: New instructions to sell continued to deteriorate at the headline level and have now fallen for 23 consecutive months – the worst sequence for almost eight years. Here’s some instant reaction: Today’s rally means European stock markets are bucking a seven-day losing streak. But that doesn’t mean the turbulence is over. Many of the factors blamed for the sell off -- such as fears of US interest rate hikes -- are still in place. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities research team explains: Investors seem to believe that the worst is over and that the sell-off was just a market tantrum that happens a couple of times a year but we tend to believe that there’s more to come. As discussed above, the key catalysts behind the retreat in the equities markets have to do with the new reality in bond yields, concerns about a tighter Fed policy and doubts over the effectiveness of Trump’s tax reforms. It was quite a mixed day in Asia, by the end, as the initial optimism from Wall Street faded: Here’s what’s up across Europe, and what’s not.... Supermarket chain Tesco isn’t joining the rally, though. Its shares are down 1%, after shopworkers launched an equal pay claim that could prove very expensive. My colleague Sarah Butler has the story: Tesco is facing a demand for up to £4bn in back pay from thousands of mainly female shopworkers in what could become the UK’s largest ever equal pay claim. A law firm has launched legal action on behalf of nearly 100 shop assistants who say they earn as much as £3 an hour less than male warehouse workers in similar roles. Up to 200,000 shopfloor staff could be affected by the claim, which could cost Tesco up to £20,000 per worker in back pay over at least six years. Tesco warehouse staff earn from about £8.50 an hour up to more than £11 an hour while store staff earn about £8 an hour in basic pay, according to the claim. The disparity could mean a full-time distribution worker earning over £5,000 a year more than store-based staff. Markets are rising across Europe, as a degree of calm returns to trading floors. The Stoxx 600 index is up 0.7% - a modest, rather than spectacular recovery. Lee Wild, Head of Equity Strategy at interactive investor, says: Just as markets cannot keep rising forever, they must also stop falling at some point, but it’s still unclear whether we’ve reached a level where buyers see value again. Futures prices had indicated a much brighter start for global markets, but early gains were wiped out in Asia and Europe looks vulnerable. Volatility is back, and investors had better get used to it. Shares are rising in London at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is up 65 points, or 0.9%, to 7205, as investors join the rally that began on Wall Street late last night. Pest control firm Rentokil is leading the risers, up 4.3%, followed by packaging firm Smurfit Kappa (+3.5%). It’s only a small rebound, compared to yesterday’s 2.6% tumble. Mike van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets says traders can’t decide whether we’re seeing a “technical correction, or the opening sequence for a greater unwind.” An unwind from a protracted period of historically low volatility, yields, borrowing costs and investor concern, which contributed to high levels of market valuation, passive investing, financial engineering and complacency. As the last few days have shown us, things are always “different this time”, until of course, they’re not. Royal Bank of Canada is concerned that the early rally in Asia fizzled out as today wore on. US equities recovered some ground in yesterday’s session after the previous day’s record losses. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 1.74% having lost over 4% the day before. The resurgence in volatility saw the VIX index hit an intraday high of over 50, a level not reached since 2015, having barely exceeded 15 for much of last year. Although Asian stock markets initially opened much higher on the back of the rebound in the US, that performance has faded. For example the Nikkei having been up as much as 3.4% on the day at one point is back to almost flat. Similarly, futures on US equity indices are sliding with the Dow off around 1% at the time of writing suggesting the sustainability of Tuesday’s rebound in sentiment isn’t assured at this stage. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European markets are rebounding this after two days of wild swings, but investors are still nervous. European stocks are tipped to bounce by at least 1% today, recovering some of Monday and Tuesday’s sharp losses. That following a surprise late rally on Wall Street last night that saw the Dow jump by 567 points -- its biggest gain since Donald Trump was elected US president. Over in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei has crept higher over night, but there were further losses in China. City traders are calling the FTSE 100 up 60 points today. That should please shareholders, until they remember that the blue-chip index shed almost 200 points on Tuesday, hitting a 10-month low. The other main European markets are expected to recover today as well. And worryingly, the futures market is suggesting that US stocks could fall back later today. So, it could be another volatile day....

By the time I absorb its contents I have to retrace my steps to take a more careful look. Then, the onslaught of work removes all possibility of being distracted by a piece of advertising. The interpreters are overbooked today and my cancer clinic is burgeoning with people who can’t wait. The first patient is from Punjab, an elderly woman accompanied by her husband. “What language do you feel comfortable with, English or Hindi?” “You speak Hindi, doctor?” she exclaims, visibly relaxed. The rest of the consultation flows smoothly and she walks out feeling reassured. A bewildered Afghan refugee looks frantically for his interpreter. “Dari?” he asks hopefully. “Sorry, no,” I say, before a thought strikes me. “Bollywood?” Recognition dawns on his face and he smiles. “Bollywood, I like very much!” While awaiting the Dari interpreter, we make a start in the broken Hindi he has learnt from watching Bollywood films. It’s enough to build a rapport that will last years. In the course of just one morning, the reality of Australia as a melting pot is evident as I see patients from South Sudan, Myanmar, Cambodia and Egypt. Outside, a Mandarin-speaking nurse soothes an agitated Chinese patient and an intern talks to a pacing relative in Croatian. In the waiting room, a surgeon slips fluently between English and Greek explanations to an elderly couple. On my way to a meeting, the flyer catches my eye again. This time, I pull it down to study it more closely. Lose your accent, the flyer proclaims, associating a foreign accent as one of the greatest barriers to becoming a successful doctor or nurse. Invoking the spectre of failing medical qualifying exams, being constantly misunderstood by colleagues, feeling embarrassed in the workplace and even stumbling in one’s personal life, it offers the services of an “accent reduction specialist” to demolish the barriers to a successful career in some of the best healthcare organisations in the country. While exhorting healthcare professionals to be proud of their culture and background, it suggests a need to fit in and feel at home with the English-speaking culture in order to get that “perfect job or that promotion”. I find this explanation naïve and I doubt that the doctor with an Irish lilt or Scottish brogue will be lining up for help. But while my instinct is to disavow the flyer’s easy premise, I am reminded of the handful of doctors I have known whose accent proved an obstacle to securing a foothold in a new country and who might have benefited from such coaching. A colleague observes that government policy has filled the country’s outer regions with foreign-trained doctors, whose language and culture differ from that of the predominantly white population. The doctors best placed to support multicultural communities work nowhere near their community; they’re sent to outposts to serve out a decade-long moratorium. “This flyer isn’t for people like you. It’s for those whose patients can’t understand them,” he pronounces. “Do you think their patients might judge them without giving them a chance?” “Probably, but the patients are hardly going to change.” Well, it’s going to be hard to source doctors and nurses without some sort of a foreign accent. After New Zealand, Australia has the highest rates of foreign-born (53%) and foreign-trained (39%) doctors. One-third of Australian nurses are foreign-trained. A quarter of doctors in the United States and a third in the UK are also foreign-trained. By 2025, Australia expects a shortage of more than 2,500 doctors and 100,000 nurses along with a maldistribution across the country. These shortages will be increasingly met by professionals hailing from Asia and Africa, who will bring not only their professional expertise, but yes, also their accents. For a section of these professionals, accent modification may well be a pressing matter as it can be an immediate barrier to trust, legitimacy and inclusion. But for many others, being welcomed and shown understanding and cooperation by the profession and the community they serve could prove a more promising start. Foreign doctors and nurses understand that a vital part of their job involves communication and most take pains to improve the way they speak and engage. The flyer praises them as intelligent, educated and self-aware, which they are. They are also all too familiar with being judged by their colleagues and by society, but suggesting that erasing their accent is the straightest path to assimilation strikes me as disingenuous. In all the years of morbidity and mortality meetings, I have never heard of a patient who died because the doctor had an accent. But I have lost count of the mishaps and deaths from inattention, overconfidence, and plain arrogance. Accents don’t hurt patients, attitudes do. In business, it is recognised that diversity of culture, language and ideas benefits shareholders. In medicine, our most important shareholders are patients and I am willing to bet that in some hospital every night, a patient is alive because of a professional who is fluent in another language, and hence, speaks English with an accent. When I was an intern, madly wondering why my Filipino patient was delirious, it was the Filipino nurse who calmly told me that he was in urinary retention. As a resident, it was the Iraqi surgeon who gave me an insight into the disproportionate distress of a refugee who had fractured a finger. As an oncologist, I entrust my patients to surgeons from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Bosnia and Iran. Every single one has a discernible accent. Most also speak a second language, which is not so much a frill but a necessity in serving a diverse, multicultural society. Half of Australians were either born overseas or have one or both parents who were born overseas. When patients with poor English literacy fall ill, we don’t expect them to fix their accent, instead, we try to pair them with providers who understand their suffering in their language. Perhaps this is why in the public hospital I work in, patients ask to see the doctor or nurse with an accent. These doctors are successful because they kept their accent and use their hybrid identity for societal benefit. Accent reduction coaching claims to have helped politicians, actors and salespeople, which is probably true (although the testimonials feature only grateful-sounding doctors and nurses.) No doubt, as the advertising says, the ability to hold a confident posture, nail a presentation or deliver an impactful Ted talk is attractive but the day to day work of medicine is actually humble. Good medicine involves crouching uncomfortably at the bedside so you can hear the patient through a noisy mask. It calls for a warm touch and a kind word. Good medicine is more compassionate conversation, less brilliant lecture. Committed professionals embrace dilemma and distress, joy and grief all in the course of a day. Humanity in medicine transcends boundaries of country and accent. The last patient of the day kicks up a fuss about seeing me. Instead, she desperately seeks “the other one with the accent”. She is Russian, old and insistent. I locate the doctor in question and the patient gives her a handsome present. When that doctor leaves, the patient placates me, “There’s nothing wrong with you, dear. But that other doctor tolerated me and my language problem on the worst day of my life, when I found out I had cancer. Who could forget her kindness?” Ranjana Srivastava is a Guardian Australia columnist and oncologist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/feb/07/formula-one-gambling-feminism-pr-stunts","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"PR stunts of F1 and gambling industry are hardly sharp end of feminism | Marina Hyde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/07/formula-one-gambling-feminism-pr-stunts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/feb/07/formula-one-gambling-feminism-pr-stunts","fields":{"headline":"PR stunts of F1 and gambling industry are hardly sharp end of feminism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"To the list of Great Woke‑ings of our time, we must formally add the gambling industry. This year has seen the disbandment of the Presidents’ Club, Formula One’s pious announcement that it was ending the practice of grid girls and now the Gambling Commission demanding the industry’s biggest conference stops expecting female promotions workers to wear swimsuits on the basis that it is “a significant stain on the industry’s reputation”. Can you imagine how disgusting and depraved the practice must have been to significantly stain the gambling industry’s “reputation”? This is a business with a gross gambling yield of almost £14bn, which collectively contributes a mere £8m to treating the wake of misery it leaves. That’s not even the 0.1% of yield that they’re asked for (the levy isn’t statutory). I mean … what are the swimsuits made out of? Missing kittens? Human remains? According to the highly scientific sample of three people I’ve spoken to who have attended, the ICE Totally Gaming event in question is indeed horrendously backward to anyone under the age of 104 who you would care to have a pint with and anyone who doesn’t think feminism started going “too far the other way” shortly after the Municipal Franchise Act of 1869 (I’m paraphrasing very slightly). Even so, in a country where problem gambling is on the rise among women, where that figure is expected to climb as women are relentlessly targeted as a significantly under-exploited gambling market and treatment for widespread addiction remains bogglingly underfunded, and where young children are so overexposed to pre-watershed advertising for betting firms that many have been found to believe gambling is an intrinsic part of sport, I wonder if it should be a little further down the Gambling Commission’s list of give-a-tosses. And so with Formula One. No one more than me wants to believe that a sport that gladly takes money from the Bahraini government really minds about civil rights of women – our women – but a titchy bit of me can’t begin to keep a straight face. “We feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values,” F1 stated auto-parodically last week, “and clearly is at odds with modern-day societal norms.” (I think the society in question is ours, rather than Azerbaijan’s or Abu Dhabi’s, or any of the other societies in which they race so lucratively.) “We don’t believe the practice is appropriate or relevant.” Having made this eye‑roll of an announcement, F1 took another underserved bite of the apple on Monday with the revelation that the grid girls would, from next season, be replaced with grid kids. Because children are our future. For some, of course, changing gear from sexy ladies to children is a bit of a needle scratch. If only the Presidents’ Club had thought of this instead of disbanding in such haste – they could have done a Bugsy Malone-themed party next year. Still, if you’re worried you’ll be deprived of classic F1 sights such as Lewis Hamilton humiliating a grid girl by spraying her in the face with champagne as she winces winsomely – don’t be. Lewis opted to humiliate a boy in his own family at Christmas by posting a video of the child in a princess dress, so he is perfectly capable of coming up with something superior and excruciating with one of the grid kids in due course. It is to be hoped he will break his silence on the end of the grid girl era even sooner, having last year made the Blatter-esque call for “more ladies” in the paddock. Even so, are such non-battles really the sharp end of modern feminism? It seems disproportionate that cynical announcements such as Formula One’s should achieve the full-spectrum dominance of the headlines which wasn’t attained by, say, the so-called “rape clause”. This is the government policy that limits child tax credits to a female claimant’s first two children (70% of claimants are in work). Those women seeking exemptions have to prove the child is the result of a rape, via an eight-page form. The Child Poverty Action Group is mounting a high court challenge to it, having warned the policy will push 250,000 children into poverty by 2020. I mean, I do care about models wearing hotpants in Monte Carlo and what it says to young girls watching on the circuit … but, all things considered, it’s funny how we end up talking about this stuff quite so much when the harder stuff feels like it might be worthy of more attention. Or to put it another way: it’s much easier and splashier to get Dapper Laughs taken off the telly than it is to address the structural problems of low-paid women in the labour market, whose work often sustains the lives of elite women who a) often don’t even realise they are the elite, and b) have the time to worry about Dapper Laughs (who is, for the avoidance of doubt, a ghastly arse). I realise every little helps, and I don’t want to give the impression I’m not glad about small bits of progress. Eliminating what used to be called a dollybird from a race track strikes some kind of blow as far as the images public life presents to children go. So it’s not a zero‑sum game. But priorities are telling, and if you needed an alarm bell then the fact that F1 and the gambling industry are able to chuck out a press release and claim some sort of moral high ground should ring a few. Very loudly indeed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/07/justin-trudeau-tells-woman-to-say-peoplekind-not-mankind","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T03:42:33Z","webTitle":"Justin Trudeau tells woman to say 'peoplekind' not 'mankind'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/07/justin-trudeau-tells-woman-to-say-peoplekind-not-mankind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/07/justin-trudeau-tells-woman-to-say-peoplekind-not-mankind","fields":{"headline":"Justin Trudeau tells woman to say 'peoplekind' not 'mankind'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has come under fire for “mansplaining” and being too politically correct after he interrupted a woman and lightheartedly corrected her for saying “mankind” not “peoplekind” at a town hall event in Canada on Friday. His correction came at the conclusion of a longwinded question from anaudience member that, over the course of three minutes, included a discussion of her church and the special power of “maternal love”. The questioner ended by asking Trudeau to look at laws surrounding the charitable status of religious organisations, saying , “maternal love is the love that’s going to change the future of mankind”. To which Trudeau said: “We like to say ‘peoplekind’, not necessarily ‘mankind’, because it’s more inclusive.” His comments have drawn ridicule from conservative media who have seized on them to accuse him of “virtue signalling”, being too politically correct and for “mansplaining”, a term coined by a feminist author and popularised by feminist discourse. The Australian conservative commentator Rita Panahi said Trudeau’s use of “peoplekind” was an attempt to “appease those desperate to find offence where none exists”. Fox News dedicated a segment to the controversy, enlisting the help of Jordan Peterson, a Canadian professor who has found fame after arguing against “political correctness”, especially the use of preferred pronouns. However, some have suggested that the rightwing furore surrounding his comments has been manufactured in bad faith. Daniel Dale, Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star, said that the “pile-on” was misleading as Trudeau was “lightly ribbing a woman who was rambling about the power of women” and accused it of omitting important context. The woman did indeed thank the prime minister for his correction and Trudeau allowed her a considerable time to speak.

The new search began on 22 January after the US-based company Ocean Infinity was hired by the Malaysian government to find the missing plane, which disappeared in March 2014. After 10 days, Ocean Infinity’s search ship, Seabed Constructor, abruptly turned off its Automatic Identification System (AIS). Three days later it reappeared on course for a scheduled stop at the Australian port of Fremantle. Tuesday’s report, which covered the dates of the disappearance, made no mention of the AIS outage. Neither the Malaysian government nor Ocean Infinity have offered an explanation. The report said the Seabed Constructor had identified two points of interest that were later classified as geological. KS Narendran, who had a relative on MH370, called for greater transparency over the ship’s temporary disappearance. “I found the development quite odd, and worrying,” he said. “If this silence and becoming invisible was intentional, to ward off suspicion, a satisfactory explanation is due. If it was for other reasons, then in the interests of transparency, we ought to be told what caused it.” The three-day data blackout sparked speculation online, including a conspiracy theory that Seabed Constructor had taken a detour to recover sunken treasure. Other observers suggested the tracker may have malfunctioned, or been turned off while examining the two geological points of interest to prevent speculation that the plane had been found. The Guardian contacted the Malaysian government and Ocean Infinity but did not receive a response. Seabed Constructor is scheduled to leave Fremantle and return to the search area on 12 February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/feb/07/miss-havisham-a-sydneysider-dickens-australian-links-get-an-airing","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T07:52:45Z","webTitle":"Miss Havisham a Sydneysider?

Dickens' Australian links get an airing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Under the dirt in St Stephen’s Anglican churchyard in Newtown, a suburb in Sydney’s inner west, lies the remains of Eliza Emily Donnithorne: one of the most storied characters of the suburb’s colourful past. According to some versions of the tragic tale, Donnithorne was 30 when the love of her life proposed. As she was a member of the city’s social elite, her wedding in 1856 was to be a gala attended by hundreds – but her fiance never showed up. Heartbroken but headstrong, Miss Donnithorne demanded that the banquet and the house remain ready for his arrival. The table stayed set for a party, the door remained opened, and for three decades she waited. She died in 1886, still in her wedding dress. If the story sounds familiar, it should: legend has that Charles Dickens’ character of Miss Havisham, from Great Expectations, was based on Donnithorne. It’s one of a few connections between the great author and Australia that will be explored when the International Dickens Fellowship Conference arrives in Sydney this October, the first time in its 112 years the event has come to the city. Louise Owens, the president of the NSW Dickens Society, has been singled out as the “driving force” behind Sydney’s successful bid for the conference, which she expects will bring up to 150 Dickens enthusiasts to town. She tells Guardian Australia the Donnithorne/Havisham story is “hotly debated”. “He was writing to a lot of people in Australia around that time and his sons lived here [and may have heard the story],” she says. “Whether it’s fact or fiction, probably nobody will ever know – but it’s a fun link.” The Sydney event was announced on Wednesday morning – Dickens’ 206th birthday – underneath a marble statue of the author, which was erected in 1891 at Centennial Parklands in Sydney. The statue has its own “strange, chequered history”, according to Owens. When he died in 1870, Dickens’s will stipulated there be no “monument, memorial or testimonial” to be made of him, preferring that people remember him by his work instead. For that reason, only three Dickens statues exist in the world – one in Philadelphia, US; one in Portsmouth, UK; and one in Sydney, Australia. The statue, commissioned by Sir Henry Parkes – a regular correspondent of Dickens – is a “huge drawcard for ‘Dickensians’”, Owens says. She’s met people at Dickens conferences in Italy and Scotland who are planning the trip to Sydney just to see it. “The question is whether Parkes commissioned it before he knew of Dickens’s request, or whether he just ignored it.” Adding insult to injury, the entire monument went missing – for almost four decades. The lifesize statue had been placed in storage in 1972 and, according to the website of Centennial Parklands, was promptly “lost in the mists of time”. The Melbourne branch of the Dickens Fellowship made various attempts to locate the piece and, in 2006, Sandra Faulkner – Owens’s predecessor at the NSW Dickens Society – wrote a letter to Fairfax’s Column 8, asking if anyone knew of its whereabouts. Although there were no responses, the column republished the letter in 2007 (“We must find Mr. Dickens,” wrote the editor), finally hearing from a reader who said the statue had been “placed into protective custody by the Royal Botanic Gardens some time ago … due to the damage inflicted by vandals (he lost his head)”. The statue was found in a basement in Rozelle. True to the reader’s word, he had lost his head. It took 12 months to find the right white marble with which to recreate Dickens’ face but the statue is back together and planted precisely where Dickens didn’t want it: in the public eye. As for where the original head now lives, that’s anyone’s guess. “Somebody said it’s somewhere in the Blue Mountains, maybe in someone’s yard,” Owens says. “But we don’t know that for sure.” The conference, which runs in Sydney from 25-30 October, will feature a talk from Booker prize-winning author Thomas Keneally about two of Dickens’ nine children, Alfred and Edward, who moved to NSW in the 1850s. “Edward, who was always called ‘Plorn’ – Dickens had lots of nicknames for people – came as a 16-year-old, poor guy, and lived on the land,” Owens says. “That would have been a bit of a shock.” Dr Cindy Sughrue, the director of the Charles Dickens Museum in London, will be delivering a virtual tour through Dickens’s home, showcasing more than 100,000 items that make up the collection. While none of the pieces will be travelling from London, the State Library of NSW will be making its own Dickens collection available to the public, including the original manuscript of an essay Dickens wrote in 1852 encouraging people to settle in NSW (Dickens himself never visited Australia) and a complete set of the pirated Launceston editions of The Pickwick Papers. Prof Christine Alexander will deliver an illustrated talk about the Gad’s Hill Gazette: a weekly family newspaper published by Dickens and his sons between 1861 and 1866, 21 copies of which she has traced through libraries in the US and the UK. At another event, Scott Whitmont – a Sydney bookseller and collector – will speak about his great-great-great uncle Ikey Solomon: a convict who was transported to Tasmania in 1831, widely believed to be the inspiration for Fagin in Oliver Twist. There will be a trivia night and literary tours but Owens believes the prize ticket will be to a night at Vaucluse House, a historical estate built in the Dickens era, and home to the Wentworth family. A candlelit private tour of the land and house will be followed by a banquet designed by gastronomer Jacqui Newling, inspired by What Shall We Have For Dinner: a small book of recipes published by Dickens’s wife Catherine under the pseudonym Lady Maria Clutterbuck in 1851. “That’ll probably be the jewel in the crown,” Owens says. • The 112th annual International Dickens Fellowship Conference will be held 25-30 October 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/07/commonwealth-bank-profit-falls-amid-money-laundering-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T01:41:49Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Bank profit falls amid money-laundering scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/07/commonwealth-bank-profit-falls-amid-money-laundering-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/07/commonwealth-bank-profit-falls-amid-money-laundering-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Bank profit falls amid money-laundering scandal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Commonwealth Bank has seen its half-yearly profits fall after it was forced to set aside $375m as provision against potential fines for alleged money laundering and funding of terrorism. Australia’s biggest bank, reporting its final set of results under outgoing chief executive Ian Narev, said on Wednesday that its six-month cash profit fell 1.9% to $4.735bn. Excluding the provision, earnings for the last six months of 2017 rose 5.8% to $5.11bn – narrowly missing analyst expectations – and the bank lifted its interim dividend one cent to $2.00. Commonwealth is being prosecuted by the financial intelligence agency Austrac, for 53,700 breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. Austrac alleges the bank allowed its smart deposit machines to be used by four money-laundering syndicates, including three linked to drug importation and distribution networks. The bank said it believed the provision of $375m was “a reliable estimate” of the penalty a court could impose based on “currently available information”. It also set aside $200m to cover legal costs. But one legal expert believed the bank had underestimated the fine it was likely to face. Each breach could in theory cost the bank $21m and it is understood that Austrac wants the penalty to be at least $1bn. Helen Bird, a corporate governance specialist at Swinburne University in Melbourne, said the amount set aside by the bank was too low. “The provision of $375m is too conservative,” said Bird. “It is based on the low end of the scale of expectations and it indicates to me that they think their defence will get up. They will say the computers stuffed up and the transactions were not reported.” The bank’s results come at a time of intense scrutiny for the big four retail banks which between them provide four of Australia’s five biggest companies. The Senate on Wednesday passed a bill to increase the regulation of the sector. The banking executive accountability regime (Bear) will be established from 1 July and will require banks to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity, while remuneration obligations will also be imposed on directors and senior executives. The banking regulator will have beefed up powers to hand out substantial fines, withhold bonuses and more easily disqualify people for poor behaviour. Also on Wednesday a Productivity Commission report said that Australia’s big banks were being allowed to exploit loyal customers and the sector faces a sustained public flogging when the royal commission into misconduct in the industry opens in Melbourne on Monday 12 February. Narev will be spared the spotlight after announcing he would be standing down from the top job two weeks after Austrac launched its lawsuit in August. However, he said “a great deal of effort” had been made on “fixing our mistakes, and becoming a better bank”. “We recognise, and regret, that these costs arise from our failure to meet some standards that we should have.” Narev said he remained positive about Australia’s economic prospects but warned about continued market volatility that could affect the country and the bank under his successor, the bank’s retail chief Matt Comyn. “Market volatility remains a risk given ongoing global uncertainty as to the pace and extent of rate rises,” Narev said. “Market movements over recent days highlight this risk.” Shares in Commonwealth were down 0.17% to $77.27 on Wednesday morning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/06/dow-jones-index-stock-markets-new-york","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T22:58:01Z","webTitle":"Volatile Dow closes up 567 points on day of sharp swings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/dow-jones-index-stock-markets-new-york","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/06/dow-jones-index-stock-markets-new-york","fields":{"headline":"Volatile Dow closes up 567 points on day of sharp swings","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Volatile high-volume trading conditions in New York moved stocks wildly on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones closing up 567 points, or 2.3%, at 24,912. The increase came on a day when stocks moved by more than 1,100 points. At its lowest, early in the trading day, the Dow was down 567 points. It was the largest one-day point gain since August 2015, and the biggest percentage gain since January 2016. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.7% to 2,695. The Dow and S&amp;P are now back in positive territory for 2018. After Monday, which saw the biggest one-day drop in six years – now blamed on a combination of interest-rate fears, computer-driven trading and the effect of volatility funds – the results restored a measure of confidence. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he was not “overly concerned about the market volatility. I think the fundamentals are quite strong.” At the White House, where Donald Trump has staked the measure of his performance on the economy and frequently hyped the gains of 6,000 points since he took office, his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, echoed the sentiment. “We have historically low unemployment and we actually have increasing wages for American workers,” Sanders said. “There’s nothing that’s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that’s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago and we’re very comfortable with where we are right now. She added: “Does the president have second thoughts about taking credit for a booming economy? Absolutely not.” After starting the day deep in negative territory, and lingering in a neutral zone for much of the sessions, the Dow surged in the final 90 minutes of trading to end the day sharply up. Earlier in the day, European and Asian markets also fell. The Japanese Nikkei 225 plunged 4.7%, while the Shanghai composite pulled back 3.4%.

It was the third time that police had closed a major highway in the city in a week. Nine people were also killed between Friday and Sunday, the G1 news website reported. The latest violence began in the early hours of Tuesday morning when a three-year-old girl was shot dead after an armed gang opened fire on her parents’ car, local media reported. Her parents were injured but survived. Later on Tuesday, police closed three major highways, including the Linha Vermelha (Red Line) that connects Rio’s international airport to the city centre. Separately, a 13-year old boy was killed when gunfights broke out during a police operation at the huge Maré favela, which is home to about 140,000 people next to all three highways. “Today it was chaos here,” said Vítor Santiago, 32, who lives in Maré. Residents described how gunfire broke out early on Tuesday morning. “I heard a lot of shots, explosions. I did not put my head outside the house because I was terrified,” said Simone Lauar, 40, a cook. A cellphone video circulating on WhatsApp showed motorists cowering on the asphalt as gunfire rang out. “This is the city we live in,” said the man filming. Another showed black-clad police taking cover during an intense gun battle and an armoured police vehicle moving in. TV Globo’s news channel cut live to helicopter footage showing armed men on a favela street. One pointed a rifle at the camera above him. “Wow,” said the presenter, before describing the death of the three-year old as “another case of how the city is hostage to the criminals”. Alberto Aleixo, from the not-for-profit group Redes da Maré – Maré Networks – said conflict in the area had been worsening recently. “Violence is increasing – as much between armed groups as from police operations,” Aleixo said. Two rival drug gangs – the Red Command and Third Pure Command – battle each other and police for control of Maré, with a smaller area controlled by militia – criminal groups of former and serving police and firefighters. From 2014-2015, the area was occupied by the Brazilian army, but the occupation failed to bring peace. In a new report, Redes da Maré said there were 41 police operations in 2017, leading to schools being closed for 35 days and 42 deaths. Twice last week, police closed one of the same highways – the Linha Amarela, or Yellow Line, which connects to the west of the city – after violence broke out at the Cidade de Deus favela, or City of God. Three men were killed, one of whom was described by police as a gang leader.

For Valentine’s Day, for example, that more often than not means anything pink and preferably fizzy, champagne being the obvious choice. But is that what you or your loved one really wants? Recent research shows that consumers regard red wine as the most relaxing drink, but despite red being as legitimate a Valentine’s colour as pink, red is rarely seen as a romantic choice, with the exception of rather half-hearted injunctions to buy Saint-Amour, one of the least interesting of the Beaujolais crus. What I’m looking for – and, I guess, you may be, too – is a lush red that’s smooth and sexy enough to drink on its own without being dependent on food to show it off. And they’re not necessarily expensive, either. In its February Wine Festival, Aldi has an absolutely cracking malbec called Quisco (£6.99; 13.5%) – unusually, this one’s from Chile rather than Argentina – though I admit the label isn’t particularly romantic. You could always decant it and pretend it’s a pomerol. (Yes, I know that’s merlot rather than malbec, but you might – just – get away with it.) Tandem Inmune Garnacha 2016 (six bottles for £71.70 strictlywine.co.uk, £71.94 corkingwines.co.uk; 14%), from Navarra, would also be a good bet for a romantic night in. This gorgeous, lush, ripe red has an apt romantic association (bicycle for two – geddit?) and a good price. If you’re looking to impress, Saint-Émilion should do the trick, though the so-called “satellite” villages surrounding the appellation are generally better value than Saint-Émilion itself. Dourthe does an attractive, supple Montagne Saint-Émilion 2015 (£11.99 Waitrose; 13.5%), which was an excellent vintage; or head farther afield for the voluptuous Los Vascos Grande Reserve 2014 (£14.95 slurp.co.uk, £15.95 Lea &amp; Sandeman ; 14%), from the Colchagua Valley, combining a prestigious name (Domaines Barons de Rothschild – aka Lafite) with Chile’s gloriously intense fruit. I’ve also fallen in love with Our Fathers Barossa Shiraz 2015 (14.5%). Big Aussie reds aren’t normally my bag, but this one has so much elegance and finesse, it’s an absolute joy to drink. At £25 direct from ourfatherswines.co.uk, the minimum order is a case of six, but all proceeds go to charity. The wine was originally made in memory of owner Giles Cooke’s father, which maybe makes it more suitable for Father’s Day than Valentine’s, but why not save a bottle or two for that, too? Quisco Malbec 2016 £6.99 Aldi, 13.5% Smooth, lush Chilean malbec at a terrific price. Tandem Inmune Garnacha 2016 £11.95 strictlywine.co.uk, 14%. A big, luscious red from Rioja’s next-door neighbour. Los Vascos Grande Reserve 2014 £15.95 Lea &amp; Sandeman, £17.32 Ocado, 14%. Chile’s impressive answer to bordeaux, made by the Bordelais. Our Fathers Barossa Shiraz £25 ourfatherswines.co.uk, 14.5%.

Researchers and environmental campaigners warn that a combination of climate change and industrial-scale fishing is threatening the krill population in Antarctic waters, with a potentially disastrous impact on larger predators. A study co-authored by George Watters, lead scientist for the US government delegation to the Antarctic decision-making body Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), warns that the penguin population could drop by almost a third by the end of the century due to changes in krill biomass. “You could potentially have some significant decline in the number of predators – particularly for penguins – caused by climate change,” said Watters. The report, published in the journal Plos One, warned that climate change could reduce krill size by up to 40% in some areas of Antarctica’s Scotia Sea causing a drastic reduction in predator numbers. Researchers also said that current permitted rates of krill fishing “increased the risk for depletion of some predator populations” although it had “less impact than ocean warming”. “I am not advocating removing fishing entirely from Antarctic waters,” said Watters. “People that make management decisions just need to be aware that you can still have an impact on predator populations by managing the krill fisheries more effectively.” Krill are a key part of the delicate Antarctic food chain. They feed on marine algae and are a key source of food for whales, penguins and seals. They are also important in removing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by eating carbon-rich food near the surface and excreting it when they sink to lower, colder water. Prof Alex Rogers, who is a specialist in sustainable oceans at the Oxford Martin School, Oxford University, said: “Climate change is having an impact [on the krill population] at the same time as a resurgence in krill fishing, with increasing numbers of fishing vessels and changes in technology that are causing increasing krill catches.” Krill populations have declined by 80% since the 1970s. Global warming has been blamed for part of that decrease because the ice that is home to the algae and plankton they feed on is retreating. Campaigners say recent developments in fishing technology are exacerbating the problem, allowing ‘suction’ harvesting by large trawlers which are now able to gather up vast quantities of krill. These fishing fleets are feeding a growing global demand for krill-based health products which are claimed to help with a range of ailments from heart disease to high blood pressure; strokes to depression. A recent analysis of the global krill industry predicted it was on course to grow 12% a year over the next three years. In response, a global campaign has been launched to turn a huge tract of the seas around the Antarctic into the world’s biggest sanctuary, protecting wildlife and banning all fishing. The 1.8m sq km reserve would cover a vast area of the Weddell Sea and a small part of the Antarctic Peninsula, and is one of three proposed new sanctuaries under consideration by CCAMLR. The idea was originally put forward by Germany and is now supported by the EU. A decision is likely to be made at a CCAMLR conference in October. Last month, Greenpeace launched a campaign in support of the sanctuary. Will McCallum of the group’s Protect the Antarctic Campaign said the report underlined that the area already faced “multiple threats”, adding it did not need “additional strain” from krill fishing. “Whether it’s fishing near penguin foraging grounds around the Antarctic Peninsula and the East Antarctic, or their expansion plans for the vast and pristine Weddell Sea, the krill industry needs to know that the Antarctic is not theirs to exploit, but all of ours to protect.” Andrea Kavanagh, director of the Pew Charitable Trust’s Protecting Antarctica’s Southern Ocean campaign which funded the latest study, said the findings showed the importance of creating a network of sanctuaries. “This study shows that, with more urgency than we previously thought, we need to get these marine protected areas in place and they need to be “no take” – they have to be fully protected areas.” But Cilia Holmes, sustainability director at Aker BioMarines, one of the leading krill fishing companies based in Norway, said there was “no sound scientific evidence that the krill fishery poses a threat to the Antarctic ecosystem”. Krill fishing, she said, was already strictly regulated by the Antarctic nations with the total krill catch making up just 0.4% the estimated krill biomass in the area around the peninsula. Holmes added that “protecting the Antarctic ecosystem” was critical to Aker BioMarines long-term operation. “We believe in a future where there still is room for well-managed fisheries that take care of the surrounding ecosystem.” Dr Susie Grant, from British Antarctic Survey, and part of the UK delegation to CCAMLR, said BAS scientists and the UK government were fully in favour of the new protected area in the Weddell Sea but said there remained a case for carefully managed, sustainable fishing in some Antarctic waters. “While some parts of the Southern Ocean require a higher level of protection, it makes sense to allow sustainable and responsible fishing in areas where we know the risks are low and it can be managed effectively.” She added: “If a system of scientifically sound reserves can be established to protect Antarctic marine ecosystems, this will send a strong signal as to how we might manage and protect the oceans globally.” Matthew Taylor’s trip to Antarctica has been partly funded by Greenpeace"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/06/nhs-rise-terminally-ill-dying-at-home-drop-hospital-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T19:51:14Z","webTitle":"Call for NHS to do more to help terminally ill people die at home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/06/nhs-rise-terminally-ill-dying-at-home-drop-hospital-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/06/nhs-rise-terminally-ill-dying-at-home-drop-hospital-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Call for NHS to do more to help terminally ill people die at home","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government’s health advisers are urging the NHS to do more to help terminally ill patients achieve their wish of dying at home. The call by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) comes after figures showed that fewer patients were dying in hospital and more were passing away at home or in a care home or hospice. Almost one in four of the 500,000 people a year who die in England do so at home. According to new data published by Public Health England (PHE) that is the highest figure for 12 years. In 2016, accounting for all the deaths, 23.5% occurred in the person’s home, 5% more than did so in 2004, PHE said. The percentage of people dying in hospital fell by 11% over the same period, from 57.9% in 2004 to 46.9% in 2016, according to PHE’s latest end-of-life care profiles. PHE said the trend showed that more people were choosing to die at home, in the company of relatives and friends. Research showed that four in five people approaching death wanted to end their days in familiar surroundings, at home, yet many were denied the chance. “Patients should have the opportunity, wherever possible, to die in the place of their choosing, with their symptoms effectively managed,” said Gillian Leng, NICE’s deputy chief executive, responding to the shift away from deaths in hospital. The number of people dying in a residential or nursing home also rose by 5%, from 16.8% in 2004 to 21.8% in 2012. The other 5.7% of deaths in 2016 happened at a hospice. “It is really positive news that more people are now dying in their own home, as our research also shows that this is most people’s preference,” said Rick Wright, the policy manager for England, at Marie Curie, the charity that helps terminally ill people. “The key focus, for both health and social care, should be to ensure that, no matter where people die, they are able to access the care and support they need. Without the proper support in place people will continue to experience unnecessary pain and distress.” PHE welcomed the findings. “Passing away in a familiar environment, whether in their own home or a care home, helps give people some degree of control. It’s encouraging that more health professionals are supporting patients to fulfil this wish,” said Julia Verne, its head of clinical epidemiology. Evidence shows that patients who have drawn up an advance care plan, setting out how they would like to end their days, are more likely to die in their chosen location, Verne added. Age UK said patients should talk to loved ones about death and their GP, to record the person’s wishes in their summary care record, a document that shows all the care they have received from the NHS. “We know that beginning conversations with the people you love about death and dying can be incredibly hard. It can be a struggle to find the right time and the right words, and tempting to put it off to another day. However, once the subject is broached it may prove to be a less difficult discussion than you expect,” said Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-trade-with-the-eu-not-just-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T18:30:17Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on trade with the EU: not just politics | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-trade-with-the-eu-not-just-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-trade-with-the-eu-not-just-politics","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on trade with the EU: not just politics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The insurgency on the Tory backbenches is turning into open warfare. The irreconcilable Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg is now the strong favourite to replace Theresa May. And although no one can yet foresee the precise sequence of events that might precipitate a challenge, the threat of a coup has so incensed Anna Soubry, the former business minister who has emerged as one of the most passionate voices for Europe, that she has urged Mrs May to sling Mr Rees-Mogg and his band of 35 hard Brexiters “out of the party” entirely. Later, she said she would leave the Conservatives herself if Mr Rees-Mogg became leader. The former education secretary Justine Greening agreed: she too would find staying in under Mr Rees-Mogg “a bit of a stretch”. It is not hard to see why the temperature has risen so sharply since the chancellor, Philip Hammond, told businessmen in Davos he wanted as little divergence from the EU as possible. Leading Brexiters feared that earlier concessions made to get a divorce deal were to be consolidated into the final relationship. To appease them, Downing Street reiterated that Britain would leave the customs union. It is in the aftermath of this spat that Mrs May’s so-called war cabinet meets in a two-day session trailed as the moment when the shape of Britain’s future trade relations with Europe is to be decided. Or not. Mrs May cannot find a course that satisfies either the hardcore clean-break extremists, who want nothing more to do with Europe, or Mr Hammond’s supporters, who believe a minimalist Brexit is the only way to preserve the UK economy. So she drifts. Mrs May must steel herself to offend both extremes. Both sides recognise that. The excitable stories of a coup involving Michael Gove and Boris Johnson as well as Mr Rees-Mogg were part of an effort to get her to decide in their favour. Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, looking on at the disarray, used his visit to Downing Street earlier this week to warn in his bleakly polite way that time was getting short if the European commission is to produce a full withdrawal text in March. Mrs May cannot go on ducking the decision. In TV studios on Sunday, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, suggested the war cabinet – in reality, the European Union exit and trade (strategy and negotiations) sub-committee, on which the 11 most senior ministers sit – was less divided than the headlines implied. That is because they have come to appreciate reality: maintaining trade with the EU outside the customs union is a dauntingly complex affair in an age when European manufactures often contain parts sourced from dozens of countries that travel many hundreds of miles before the end product is ready for export. Nor is it possible, outside the customs union, to see how to protect the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The EU side is preparing a legal text of the agreement that is likely to contain details that were glossed over in the urgency to get a deal. That clarity may be an even greater threat to the negotiations than the ambitious rivals manoeuvring around Mrs May. To millions of voters who simply want Brexit to happen, this dispute over trade deals looks both arcane and irrelevant, of interest only to a small handful of Tory MPs. It is not. It is a much bigger decision, too, than whether or not Mrs May keeps her job. This is deciding what Brexit looks like – the question not on the ballot paper – and it is a matter of overwhelming national interest. Despite this, Labour’s voice has been at best uncertain. The single market has been conceded, and the benefits of membership of the customs union blurred. Yet Labour is clear that it wants a Brexit that delivers more jobs and protects workers’ rights and the environment. It has ambitious plans that rely on an expanding economy. The more distant Britain’s relationship with the EU, the longer those plans will be delayed, and the harder they will be to achieve. Labour must speak in defence of the good that Europe has brought, and it must start by making this a truly national debate. And the prime minister cannot be allowed to go on trying to hold her bad-tempered party together by delaying crucial decisions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/feb/06/trump-government-shutdown-democrats-immigration","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T21:47:25Z","webTitle":"Trump: 'I'd love to see a shutdown' if Democrats don't yield on immigration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/trump-government-shutdown-democrats-immigration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/trump-government-shutdown-democrats-immigration","fields":{"headline":"Trump: 'I'd love to see a shutdown' if Democrats don't yield on immigration","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Congressional leaders on Tuesday moved closer to a broad budget deal to avoid another government shutdown, while Donald Trump signaled he would welcome another lapse in funding if he does not get his way on immigration. Speaking at the White House, Trump appeared to welcome a shutdown without Democrats yielding to his tough demands on immigration and billions in extra funding for border security. “I’d love to see a shutdown if we can’t get this stuff taken care of,” said Trump. “If we have to shut it down because the Democrats don’t want safety … let’s shut it down.” Trump’s remarks came two days before government funding was set to expire on 8 February and as congressional leaders said they were making progress towards a broader deal that would not only keep the government open but roll back some previous limits imposed on government spending. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said: “We’re on the way to getting an agreement and getting it very soon.” The agreement would reportedly keep the government open for six weeks while allowing increased spending on domestic and military items. Defense hawks have long been pushing for an increase in defense spending; Democrats have repeatedly emphasized the need for increased spending on other government programs. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, echoed McConnell. “We’re making real progress on a spending deal that would increase the caps for both military and middle-class priorities on the domestic side,” he said. Schumer declined to say if the increase in domestic spending would match the increase in defense spending. “We Democrats have always stood for parity, and are making very good progress in reaching parity,” he said. The potential budget deal would not address immigration and the fate of Dreamers who benefit from Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, the program that protects more than 700,000 young undocumented immigrants from the threat of deportation. Daca is due to expire on 5 March. The government shuttered briefly in January as Democrats attempted to push for a permanent fix to the program. Instead, the plan now is for an open process on the Senate floor. McConnell said: “Once we have established the government is going to be open – which needs to happen by 8 February – we’ll then move forward with an immigration debate.” He added: “I’m going to structure it in such way that it is fair to everyone … whoever gets to 60 votes wins.” That vote had been promised in January as a concession by McConnell to end the shutdown then. Schumer said that he expected the process to begin next week. Trump’s willingness to see a government shutdown was shrugged off by Schumer. In the room, Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock, who is facing a tough re-election in a swing district, rebuked Trump. “We don’t need a government shutdown on this,” Comstock, a two-term Republican, said. Trump interrupted her and said: “You can say what you want. We are not getting support of the Democrats.” On immigration, Trump later said: “I would shut it down over this issue. If we don’t straighten out our border, we don’t have a country. Without borders we don’t have a country. So would I shut it down over this issue? Yes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/07/kick-it-out-alarm-spike-abuse-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T00:01:50Z","webTitle":"Kick It Out alarmed by spike in abuse against ‘backdrop of rising hatred’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/07/kick-it-out-alarm-spike-abuse-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/07/kick-it-out-alarm-spike-abuse-football","fields":{"headline":"Kick It Out alarmed by spike in abuse against ‘backdrop of rising hatred’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Football’s equality campaign Kick It Out has received a marked increase in reports of racist, homophobic and other discriminatory incidents this season compared with the equivalent midway point last year. In total 282 incidences of abuse were reported in professional and grassroots football and on social media, 59% up on the 177 incidents recorded by the organisation at the 2016-17 midpoint. Kick It Out recognises that the numbers represent just a tiny fraction of the abusive incidents that occur nationally, and on the internet, but are never reported to Kick It Out. In April 2015, the organisation collaborated in research with two specialist social media companies, Tempero and Brandwatch, which found 134,400 racist and other discriminatory posts directed at Premier League players and clubs in the previous seven months. Nevertheless, Kick It Out’s chair, Lord Ouseley, said he believes this season’s increase in the relatively few incidents it receives is significant, not due only to more active reporting of incidents. Ouseley has previously warned politicians that they foment hatred with negative depictions of immigrants and minorities, and said the increase should “act as a wake-up call” to football’s clubs and authorities. “The spike in these mid-season reporting statistics comes against the backdrop of rising hatred in our society, as recently shown in Community Security Trust’s publication of reported antisemitic incidents [a 3% rise was recorded in 2017]. There is no place for complacency when it comes to challenging prejudice,” he said. More than a third of the incidents reported to Kick It Out consisted of abuse on social media; the overwhelming majority, 88%, were on Twitter, with a minority relating to posts on Facebook (10%) and Instagram (2%). Reported incidents in the professional game, mostly abuse by supporters, increased by 75%, to 131 this season, while in grassroots football the rise was small, from 37 to 42 incidents. Incidents can be reported to Kick It Out by telephone, email, directly to its website, via a reporting app or on social media itself. The organisation has a policy of reporting to the police all abuse that its officers believe may amount to hate crime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/06/mauricio-pochettino-dele-alli-dive-tottenham-trickery","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T22:30:48Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino says Dele Alli dive was simple case of football trickery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/06/mauricio-pochettino-dele-alli-dive-tottenham-trickery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/06/mauricio-pochettino-dele-alli-dive-tottenham-trickery","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino says Dele Alli dive was simple case of football trickery","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino has admitted Dele Alli deserved to be booked for diving at Liverpool on Sunday but he warned that overanalysing every controversy would kill the game. The Tottenham Hotspur manager made no excuses for Alli, who went down under zero contact inside the Liverpool penalty area during the 2-2 draw. It was the third time in the midfielder’s two-and-a-half season Premier League career he has received a yellow card for diving. Pochettino dismissed the flashpoint as a minor issue while he made the point that football was “about trying to trick your opponent” one way or another – whether it be with a step-over, a tactical tweak or even a dive. The darker arts were a part of the game, Pochettino argued. When a player was rumbled – as Alli was against Liverpool – he had to be punished by the referee but that should be the end of the matter. “It was a yellow card,” Pochettino said. “It happens. During different games, a lot of situations like this happen. The problem now is we are so sensitive about the situation. And then we are so focused on Dele Alli. The referee was right and perfect. It was a yellow card and nothing [else]. It’s too much sometimes. There is such a focus on this type of situation. I think it’s a minimal issue. “Dele is not perfect. Nobody is perfect. He is a clever boy. He is a little bit nasty. Football is a creative sport in which you need the talent that grows in a very intelligent person, a very smart brain. But the problem today is that, more than this type of situation, I am worried we are going to change the game we know. “We are so focused on minimal details. I am worried that in a few years, the sport we love and that people love to watch around the world, will be pushed into a very rigid, structured thing – with the VAR and with being focused too much on the small actions like this.” Pochettino went back to a time – 20 or 30 years ago – when everybody “congratulated the player who tricks the referee” and it was possible to feel his inner cynical Argentinian. But he was on safe ground when he highlighted how English players have never been angels. Notoriously, Pochettino was adjudged to have fouled the England striker Michael Owen at the 2002 World Cup. David Beckham converted the penalty and England had a 1-0 group stage win over Argentina. The contact from Pochettino on Owen was minimal, to say the least. He has previously said Owen “jumped like he was in a swimming pool”. “You believe that in England you were honest and always perfect,” Pochettino added, with a smile. “That is the football I was in love with when I was a child. Football is about trying to trick your opponent. Yes or no? What does ‘tactic’ mean? When you do some tactics, it is to try to trick the opponent. You say: ‘Oh, I play on the right but I’m going to finish on the left.’ It’s a mix and I am worried that maybe we are going to kill the game.” Alli was on the wrong end of a penalty area decision in Tottenham’s 2-0 home win over Manchester United last Wednesday. He was fouled by Antonio Valencia but no action was taken. Pochettino was asked whether Alli had been denied because of his reputation for diving. “I believe the referee did not see it,” Pochettino said. “The referees are humans, too. Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are not right. I like this. In football, we accept this is the situation. My worry is only this – if you dive and the referee saw you, you are punished. Of course, and he [Alli] deserves it, but don’t go more crazy.” Pochettino is expected to rest Alli and other regulars for Wednesday’s FA Cup replay against Newport County at Wembley. Tottenham’s new signing, Lucas Moura, is ineligible, having joined after the original fourth-round tie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/06/west-ham-patrice-evra-talks-free-transfer","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T15:09:31Z","webTitle":"West Ham sign Patrice Evra on deal to end of season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/06/west-ham-patrice-evra-talks-free-transfer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/06/west-ham-patrice-evra-talks-free-transfer","fields":{"headline":"West Ham sign Patrice Evra on deal to end of season","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"West Ham have signed the former France captain Patrice Evra on a free transfer until the end of the season to reinforce their defensive options. The 36-year-old, who had his contract with Marseille terminated by mutual consent in November after being handed a seven-month European ban for aiming a kick at one of the club’s own fans before a match, passed a medical on Wednesday. He worked under West Ham’s manager, David Moyes, at Manchester United. Moyes needed a left-back because, with Arthur Masuaku serving a six-game ban for spitting at Wigan’s Nick Powell during the FA Cup defeat, Aaron Cresswell was his only option in the position. Evra told West Ham’s website: “It’s amazing to be back and I am thankful to West Ham for giving me the opportunity to do my job. When I wake up and know I am going to work hard, to have fun with my team-mates and give my best on the pitch, I want to say a massive thanks to West Ham, to the chairman, to the manager to all my team-mates, who have given me a nice welcome, my agent and my brother. “I’m just happy to be here, it’s really simple. You don’t realise how lucky you are and just to wake up this morning and know I am going to train with my new team-mates made me smile.” Meanwhile West Ham, who are expected to be without Pedro Obiang for the rest of the season after the midfielder had a knee operation, insist they are not making plans to change manager in the summer and will hold talks with Moyes at the end of the season. A report has claimed that Moyes is unlikely to extend his stay at West Ham past the end of the current campaign regardless of whether or not the club stay in the Premier League. Moyes agreed a contract until the end of the season when he replaced Slaven Bilic in November and, despite a significant upturn in results and performances, he has maintained that he has no intention of opening talks about a new deal yet. And the club have reiterated their stance that discussions over any new deal will take place once the season is over. A statement read: “As previously stated on a number of occasions, the club and David Moyes agreed a deal until the end of the 2017-18 season, at which point both parties will sit down and discuss the future. “Until then, the board and David Moyes will continue to work closely together, with the manager having full responsibility of footballing matters and the full support of the board. Everyone’s sole focus is on trying to achieve results for West Ham United.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/19/the-forgotten-story-of-mexicos-answer-to-cool-runnings","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-19T10:00:51Z","webTitle":"The forgotten story of ...

Mexico's answer to Cool Runnings","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Roberto Tames closes his eyes, he can still see that grainy television footage of Italian daredevil Eugenio Monti as he hurtles to a thrilling 1968 Olympic bobsleigh victory in Grenoble. “I was four-years-old,” he says. “But even though I was very small, these athletes became my heroes. I loved watching them flying down the track. When I was seven, I got a wheel cart. I dreamed I was a bobsleigh pilot and my brothers and I would go racing down the hills of Mexico City.” One of the most famous Winter Olympics moments revolves around bobsleigh and how a group of Jamaicans wound up at the start-line in Calgary 30 years ago. Other curious oddities competed in Canada that year too: a luger from Puerto Rico, a Fijian cross-country skier, Britain’s Eddie the Eagle. But those stories overshadowed what was arguably the most romantic and unheralded story of them all. Eduardo, Jorge, Adrian and Roberto: the four bobsleigh brothers from Mexico. “In 1984, I saw the Mexican flag being carried in the opening ceremony in Sarajevo,” Roberto, the youngest brother, says. “It was an Austrian prince, Hubertus von Hohenlohe, who had a Mexican mother and was representing our country in skiing. I thought if he could be there then me and my brothers could be at the next Olympics competing in bobsleigh. They liked the idea. We agreed that we wouldn’t brake until the last two corners and we might win the gold medal. We didn’t know that in bobsleigh there was no braking at all until you cross the finish line.” Inspired, the siblings contacted the Mexican Olympic Committee and explained their proposal. Inevitably, they were greeted with laughter. But it was agreed that, as long as they didn’t seek any funding, they could do as they wished. When the brothers sought further assistance from the sport’s international governing body, they were encouraged to attend an upcoming coaching clinic scheduled for upstate New York in May 1984. “My father was not a rich man but he made a great effort to find the money so we could go,” Roberto says. “We drove from Mexico City to Lake Placid in an old Volkswagen van. It took us four days to get there.” Their lack of experience was apparent when they arrived at the clinic, but the brothers’ enthusiasm won them plenty of admiration and led to an invitation to further their development deep in central Germany. But before they were allowed into the inner sanctum of the drivers’ school in Oberhof, they needed to sharpen their knowledge of the sport and were dispatched for a week’s tutorial in nearby Konigsee. “Everything was new,” Roberto remembers. “We had never been to Europe before and never even seen snow. We were advised to compete as two separate two-man teams and the first time I got on a sled, I was the brakeman at the back. We went down from the half-track but it was still so scary. We started accelerating more and more and when we got to the corner, the sled moved so fast to the side that it was close to impossible to stay in. “We almost left that first day but I said to my brother, Adrian, ‘Look, we cannot quit now. We have to finish the school and then we can decide if we’ll never come back’. So we stuck it out and survived. When we went back to Mexico we decided to continue. It’s such a big adrenalin rush. You have to make decisions so fast and if you make a mistake you’re upside down. I’ve sky-dived and that’s a good rush but bobsleigh’s is greater because you are driving it. You are in control. “The next year we went to Calgary for the first time. It was a new track there and everyone said it was very safe. But we proved them wrong! Adrian and I were the first bob ever to flip on that track, at Corner 7.” Reaching the Olympics quickly became an obsession for the family but an expensive one. Without financial support from a benefactor, sponsor or Mexico’s Olympic Committee, Roberto and his brothers decided to leave home. “We moved to Dallas to live and work,” he says. “We could make more money there and be able to pay for our sport. We used to train on the streets. We built a wheel sled with some blueprints we got from the federation and every morning we pushed it around a school parking lot. In the afternoon we’d do some track training and some weights in a gym. “We all worked in a Mexican restaurant called Cantina Laredo. Everyone was very supportive, our colleagues and the customers. They had pictures of us on the walls. We sold t-shirts. And we got sponsorship money from them too, which was huge for us.” After honing their craft as best they could, the brothers were authorized to compete at the 1988 Olympics as part of an 11-person Mexican team. But there were still plenty of problems. Without a coach, they were relying on each other for guidance. And there was a more pressing concern: they didn’t own any sleds. In December 1987, the brothers were put in touch with an Edmonton-based photographer, Brian Gavriloff, who had trialled for the Canadian national bobsleigh team years earlier. “I had bought a sled because I wanted to start driving,” he recalls. “Somehow my name had cropped up, the Mexicans contacted me about renting it and I was able to make a few bucks. Everything was done through correspondence. We painted it the colours they wanted too. I think it was basic black and they may have put some decos on it themselves. I remember that it was all quite short notice so when we were loading the sled to drive to the Olympics in February, the paint was still drying.” The brothers hustled another sled and paid for them both with their their savings and the modest sponsorship from their employers. The leftover cash was put towards their race suits, which they had specially made. Accompanied by their parents, they left Dallas and began the arduous drive north in their trusty VW. Back in the restaurant, next to their names on the roster was written ‘OLYMPICS’. The journey to Calgary took 53 hours. “We had little experience driving on icy roads and highways,” Roberto says. “We didn’t know that we had to put chains on the tyres so we had a few small incidents. While one of us drove, the rest slept. We didn’t have any trouble at the Canadian border but the only problem was that we crossed in Winnipeg and it was freezing when we got out of the car to have our passports stamped.” Once they arrived, the brothers were christened The Quatro Amigos. To the vast majority, they were figures of fun and on an early training run, they crashed Gavriloff’s sled. He laughs at the memory. “I think that cost them some more money! There were all of these weird things that popped up at an Olympics for the first time. The entertainment was off the charts. A Mexican bobsleigh team? It’s like the Gobi Desert Canoe Club. But I kinda thought, ‘If the Jamaicans are competing, how much weirder can it be having a Mexican team here?’ “When the dream is big enough, the facts don’t count. I felt that if it wasn’t going to happen for me then maybe I could be part of someone else’s dream. You can’t take it with you so you might as well use it all up.” The brothers completed all of their Olympic runs, something the United States, Portugal and the Japanese failed to do. Forever side by side, just one hundredth of a second separated both Mexican sleds. Overall, from 41 teams, they finished 36th and 37th - more than 16 seconds behind gold medalists the Soviet Union. Still, they made their mark and entered the Guinness World Records as the most siblings to compete in a single Winter Olympics event. Four years later, things were different in Albertville. Adrian took part in the four-man event while Eduardo was a reserve team member. Afterwards, they all went their separate ways. But for Roberto, bobsleigh remained an obsession for a lot longer. Thanks to some sponsorship from a hair products company he competed at his third Winter Olympics at Salt Lake City in 2002. The strain and stress – both mental and financial – had caused marital problems and he told his wife he was ready to walk away from the sport for good. But there was a world championship on the horizon and the itch quickly returned. Inevitably, an ultimatum followed but Roberto chose bobsleigh over his marriage and the pair were divorced in 2004. “Bobsleigh was my life,” he admits. “And when somebody said ‘It’s bobsleigh or me’, the decision was taken. We never had any idea how hard it would be and what we had to sacrifice. But, ultimately, you have to make bobsleigh your priority.” It stopped being Roberto’s priority in 2005. At the age of 40 he was desperately trying to qualify for another Winter Olympics in Turin when a leg injury began to flare up. He took a banned substance to help aid his recovery and was hit with a suspension. And that was the end. Now based in the beach resort of Puerto Vallarta on Mexico’s west coast and working as a swimming instructor, sometimes he’ll gaze at the Pacific Ocean and his mind will return to Calgary and that first Olympics experience three decades ago. The memories resonate even further now. Eduardo passed away in 2012. “The dream I had when I was seven years old – to represent Mexico in the Winter Olympics – came true. It was a difficult and long road but if I was born again, I wouldn’t change a thing. 1988 is the most special, of course. We competed in other Olympics but getting there with all my brothers is impossible to top. I am very proud. It’s hard to ask God for anything else.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/lycra-suits-for-commuters-and-i-tonya-hair-scrunchies-what-to-buy-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T06:00:41Z","webTitle":"Lycra suits for commuters and I, Tonya hair scrunchies… what to buy this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/lycra-suits-for-commuters-and-i-tonya-hair-scrunchies-what-to-buy-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/11/lycra-suits-for-commuters-and-i-tonya-hair-scrunchies-what-to-buy-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Lycra suits for commuters and I, Tonya hair scrunchies… what to buy this week","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Wheely smart Burton has answered the prayers of cycling or skateboarding commuters with its Smart Collection water-resistant, breathable Lycra suits.

Speaking in Manchester on Tuesday, the prime minister said she would sometimes work differently from male politicians, suggesting her strategy was not the same as the big beasts in her cabinet such as Boris Johnson or Philip Hammond, who have used the press to put forward their own “red lines”. “In my experience, women often bring a different approach to politics than do men,” May said in the speech, where she wore a purple jacket, in a nod to the suffragette colours. “For women, politics can be as much about listening and learning from others as it is about broadcasting your own views and opinions. And that is all to the good. Because when there isn’t just one way of doing things or one perspective on an issue, our understanding is enriched and we can achieve better outcomes.” The prime minister has been dogged by cabinet rows over her Brexit strategy, with both the foreign secretary and the chancellor using newspaper and television interviews in recent months to make their own opinions known, including over increased spending for the NHS as well as the strategy for the Brexit negotiations. May has also come under fire from backbench MPs, including hardline Brexiters, as well as some moderate former ministers such as Nick Boles and Robert Halfon. MPs have criticised a lack of bold ideas to tackle key domestic issues, such as the housing shortage and funding the health service. Asked at her speech if she had advice for her younger self on entering parliament, May said she had a firm belief in sticking to her principles rather than changing her behaviour to fit what others demanded. “I think the important thing for women in politics is be yourself,” she said. “Women’s way of doing politics is sometimes different from men, it’s the same in business. But that doesn’t mean they’re not just as good, they are just as good. So I would say don’t feel like you have to be a stereotype of a man in order to get on in politics. Be yourself and believe in what you are doing.” Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, May said women were more interested in trying to work as a team. “Women will often have a different approach to leadership – and just because it’s different doesn’t mean it doesn’t get the same result,” she said. “My approach is much more about trying to work as a team. Women will often say, ‘it’s not me who achieved it, it’s the team that achieved it. I put an emphasis not on what you say but on what you do – and that is another difference between women and men.” At her speech, May said she took huge pride in the number of women now in senior positions in public life. “A century ago women were forbidden the franchise, could not sit on a jury or be admitted into the professions,” she said. “Today, I am proud to serve as Britain’s second female prime minister in a parliament with more female MPs than ever before. “In 2018, the United Kingdom’s most senior judge is a woman. The commissioner of the Metropolitan police is a woman. The director of the National Crime Agency is a woman. Women serve as England’s chief fire officer and chief medical officer. The CBI and the TUC are both headed by women. At Holyrood, a female first minister debates against a female opposition leader. In the National Assembly for Wales, a woman leads the third party. The two largest parties in Northern Ireland are led by women. “And at Westminster, where suffragettes chained themselves to statues and hid in a broom cupboard on census night, the leaders of the House of Commons and the House of Lords are women. Black Rod, whose predecessor ejected suffragettes from the palace precincts, is a woman. A century ago the home secretary and director of public prosecutions were grappling with the direct action of suffragettes. Today, both those offices are held by women.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/07/ambalavaner-sivanandan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T12:39:27Z","webTitle":"Ambalavaner Sivanandan obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/07/ambalavaner-sivanandan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/07/ambalavaner-sivanandan","fields":{"headline":"Ambalavaner Sivanandan obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1958, Ambalavaner Sivanandan, later a leading intellectual of the left who changed the way that race relations were viewed in the UK, dressed up as a policeman in his native Sri Lanka and brandished a gun without any bullets, in order to save members of his Tamil family from a Sinhalese mob. Later that year Siva, as he was more commonly known, left what was then Ceylon and came to Britain, arriving only to witness the anti-black race riots in Notting Hill. “I knew then I was black,” he later wrote. “I could no longer stand on the sidelines: race was a problem that affected me directly. I had no excuse to go into banking or anything else that I was fitted up to do … I had to find a way of making some sort of contribution to the improvement of society.” In his position as the director of the Institute of Race Relations for 40 years, from 1973 to 2013, and the editor of its journal, Race &amp; Class, Siva, who has died aged 94, remained true to that mission. He was a tireless and eloquent voice explaining the connections between race, class, imperialism and colonialism. Siva highlighted – in what was a radical position at the time – that it was not the presence of black people that created racism, but the refusal of the British state to evolve in a multiracial society. His writing was key to ideas that later entered the mainstream with the publication of the Macpherson report in 1999, which concluded that the flawed handling of the death of Stephen Lawrence was because of institutional racism – defined by Siva as “that which, covertly or overtly, resides in the policies, procedures, operations and culture of public or private institutions – reinforcing individual prejudices and being reinforced by them in turn”. Siva was the chief librarian at the IRR when he led a staff revolt against the management board in 1972. The board members were forced to resign and Siva was elected director. He went about transforming what was an anodyne academic institution, embedded in the establishment with a government advisory role, into a radical thinktank whose mission was to support black communities in their anti-racist struggles both locally and globally. As director, Siva focused his advocacy on the most excluded, and those affected by the most vicious manifestations of racism. “There are two racisms: the racism that discriminates and the racism that kills,” he wrote. This was one of Siva’s many celebrated aphorisms – easy-to-remember encapsulations of complex ideas that challenged simplistic assumptions. Others included: “We are here because you were there” (relating to post-colonial migration); “If those who have do not give, those who haven’t must take”; and “The personal is not political, the political is personal”. The latter illustrated his growing frustration with the solipsism of emerging identity politics, particularly among what he saw as a more well-heeled, younger generation of intellectuals, who he felt were reluctant to engage with issues of class even though it was the struggles of the black working-class who had paved the way for them. “The people who made this mobility possible were those who took to the streets,” he once told me. “But they did not benefit.” It was Siva who renamed Race, the IRR’s journal, Race &amp; Class. It became a leading voice for radical race politics, with writers such as John Berger, Angela Davis and Noam Chomsky. His own groundbreaking essays for the journal included The Liberation of the Black Intellectual (1974), Race, Class and the State (1977) and From Resistance to Rebellion (1981), all of which, in different emphases, provided an analytical narrative of the history of black British struggles. He was also perceptive when it came to the kind of developments that shaped our economic systems and social consciousness. In a prescient essay written in 1989, New Circuits of Imperialism, he laid out how new technology would displace labour and liberate capital: “Where once steam and subsequently electricity replaced muscle power, today microelectronics … replaces the brain. Changes in the production process … have freed industrial capital from spatial strictures.” Born in Jaffna, the son of Ambalavaner, a postal worker, and Nageswari, a homemaker, Siva was educated at St Joseph’s College, Colombo. He studied economics at Ceylon University, graduating in 1945, and became one of the first native bank managers at the Bank of Ceylon. In 1950 he married Bernadette Wijeyewickrema. On arriving in the UK, Siva worked briefly as a clerk in the trading company Vavasseur and Co. Unable to find banking work, he retrained as a librarian. He worked for Middlesex and other public libraries, then the Colonial Office library, before becoming chief librarian at the IRR in central London in 1964. His first marriage ended in 1969, and he married his long-time partner, Jenny Bourne, currently joint-editor of Race &amp; Class, in 1993. In 2006 the library on race relations that he had built up at the IRR was moved to the University of Warwick library, where it is known as the Sivanandan Collection. His novel When Memory Dies (1997) won both the Commonwealth Writers’ first book prize (for Eurasia) and the Sagittarius prize. Where the Dance Is, a collection of short stories, was published in 2000. In his polemic he was scathing. In the essay The Hokum of New Times (1990), he slated the shift towards a progressive politics rooted more in identity than class, branding it “a sort of bazaar socialism, bizarre socialism, a hedonist socialism: an eat, drink and be merry socialism because tomorrow we can eat drink and be merry again … a socialism for disillusioned Marxist intellectuals who had waited around too long for the revolution”. In his person he was generous, a keen mind with a sharp, impish wit and a mischievous, impish manner. When New Statesman called on prominent figures to write a letter to God in its 1991 Christmas supplement, Siva – raised Hindu, in a Buddhist society, and educated by Catholics – wrote: “It is that sense of self-determination, self-belief, that authority over myself, the sense of being my own author, that has taken your place. But of course it frightens the hell out of me. For there is no adjudicator except myself, no one who can forgive me except myself, no one who can excoriate me, absolve me, lift me up again, except myself.” He is survived by Jenny and by three children, Tamara, Natasha and Rohan, from his first marriage. • Ambalavaner Sivanandan, writer and editor, born 20 December 1923; died 3 January 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/07/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-win-may-law-and-order","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T13:04:10Z","webTitle":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn condemns May over police cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/07/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-win-may-law-and-order","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/07/pmqs-verdict-corbyn-win-may-law-and-order","fields":{"headline":"PMQs verdict: Corbyn condemns May over police cuts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Key points With MPs due to vote on whether to award police a cash settlement later on Wednesday, Jeremy Corbyn, as usual, avoided the obvious subject – Brexit – and pressed Theresa May on rising crime and cuts to the police service. He said recorded crime was up by a fifth since 2010 and violent crime up 20%, but 21,000 police and £2.3bn had been cut from the police service when May was home secretary. May said she was ensuring crime was recorded properly, and that the then shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham – now mayor of Greater Manchester – had said the police budget could take up to a 10% cut. Corbyn, however, said the inspectorate had found that police were failing to record tens of thousands of offences, 6,700 community support officers had been cut, and the chief constable of Bedfordshire had said he did not have the resources to keep people safe. May, he concluded, had presided over the highest rise in recorded crime for a quarter of a century. May said she had overseen the creation of the National Crime Agency, and police taking more notice of vulnerable victims, modern slavery and domestic violence. Countering May with more statistics, Corbyn said gun crime was up 20% last year, and that the chief constable of Merseyside had said he did not have sufficient resources to fight it. May said police budgets were being increased by £450m, and Corbyn “hasn’t got that good a record of extending the police powers to allow them to do their job”. Corbyn said budgets had fallen £413m, and other cuts – to youth workers and youth clubs – were contributing to the rise in crime. Why had May cut both prevention and cure? May said Corbyn had voted against changing the law so anyone caught carrying a knife for a second time would face a custodial sentence. Knife crime fell in London when Boris Johnson was mayor, and it was up under Labour’s Sadiq Khan. Corbyn said crime could be dealt with by an effective probation service, community service orders and the rehabilitation of offenders. May – as she often does – retorted that only a strong economy could pay for good public services, and that if Labour were in power, Britain would face a capital flight and a run on the pound. Snap verdict It was the sort of routine points-win that Corbyn achieves quite regularly these days – by asking focused questions about public spending, buttressed by awkward quotes from Tories or Tory-types – but what made this a bit special was that it was a win on a traditionally key Conservative battleground. When Corbyn was elected Labour leader, his supporters would have expected him to do well at PMQs on health or housing, but it would have taken a brave call to predict him winning on law and order. Yet during the general election campaign, one of the turning points came when the terrorist attacks gave Labour the opportunity to hammer May and her government over police cuts (Tory and Labour strategists assumed at the time that the attacks would benefit May, but in fact the opposite appeared to happen). Corbyn successfully resurrected those arguments on Wednesday. It was risky, because as a former home secretary May is more confident on this ground and her response to the increase in recorded crime (“because I pushed for that as home secretary”, she claimed) was effective. She could also parry Corbyn’s attack on knife crime. But her overall weakness was exposed by the fact that she had to resort to quoting Burnham, who is now longer even an MP, to defend herself against the charge she has cut police spending. It didn’t work. Best lines After seven years of cuts, will the prime minister today admit that her government’s relentless cuts have left us less safe? You can’t have public safety on the cheap. Corbyn concludes his points on police cuts. That’s what Labour would do – bankrupt Britain and the police would have less money. May retorts with a familiar refrain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/09/folk-albums-of-month-lori-watson-hannah-read-salt-house","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-09T09:36:47Z","webTitle":"Folk album of the month – Lori Watson: Yarrow Acoustic Sessions review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/09/folk-albums-of-month-lori-watson-hannah-read-salt-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/09/folk-albums-of-month-lori-watson-hannah-read-salt-house","fields":{"headline":"Folk album of the month – Lori Watson: Yarrow Acoustic Sessions review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Folk music thrives in the dark, be that in dedicated corners of music magazines or the fertile underbelly of the internet. Folk also prospers when the sun rarely shines, so it’s oddly fitting, in the season of Robbie Burns and winter wassails, that Scotland and its borders have inspired the best new releases this month. The best of these is Lori Watson’s Yarrow Acoustic Sessions, the second record proper by the talented young singer, former Rule of Three fiddler, experimental composer and academic. Watson has stitched together poetry and traditional songs from the Yarrow border country where she grew up with her own piercing melodies, arrangements and effects. The results are rich, multilayered and giving. The album begins unusually: with a long, eerie breath, a sighing harmonium, then the full, deep swell of that instrument alongside Watson’s heavily accented voice; and her adaptation of local woodcutter Walter Elliot’s poem, Yarrow (A Charm), almost lifts off, as if it were announcing a new world. Field recordings, rattling keys and drones add unease to her beautiful vocals, too Fine Floors in the Valley is the album’s knockout moment. Following the jolting poem The Sense of Being Lonely, Watson’s melody plunges you almost viscerally into the green leaves, the moonlight, and the story of a woman and her dead baby. A cover of the Incredible String Band’s October Song is a great choice, too. Also out this month Another record deserving crossover status is Hannah Read’s second album Way Out I’ll Wander (Hudson Records). Its nine gorgeous originals are inspired by Read’s youth playing traditional fiddle music in the Isle of Eigg. She lives in Brooklyn now, which informs the direct, transatlantic mournfulness of her vocal delivery: fans of Emiliana Torrini’s folk excursions or Nina Nastasia will find riches here. Salt House’s Undersong (Make Believe) is also a gentle, lulling delight, the Scottish group recording their new album in a tiny resonant church on the Isle of Berneray, with new member Jenny Sturgeon on vocals, harmonium, guitar and shruti box. And even though the great event has passed, the Band of Burns’ Live from Union Chapel (Ord Ban) remains nourishing stuff beyond its times, another warm, welcoming stew to feed the bones."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/feb/07/criminalised-detained-deported-uk-accused-of-failing-trafficked-children-vietnam-stephen","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T14:30:50Z","webTitle":"'Criminalised, detained, deported': UK accused of failing trafficked children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/07/criminalised-detained-deported-uk-accused-of-failing-trafficked-children-vietnam-stephen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/feb/07/criminalised-detained-deported-uk-accused-of-failing-trafficked-children-vietnam-stephen","fields":{"headline":"'Criminalised, detained, deported': UK accused of failing trafficked children","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Child trafficking victims deported back to Vietnam by the British government face the risk of being retrafficked and further exploited, lawyers and child protection groups have warned. The case of Stephen*, a former child victim of modern slavery, has become a focal point for concern. Stephen was trafficked into the UK aged 10 to work in a cannabis factory, where he was locked up, beaten and forced to take drugs. His appeal against a refused asylum application has attracted support from hundreds of thousands of people. However, lawyers are warning that people like Stephen, now 19, are being routinely deported back to Vietnam without any support. “We have worked on dozens of cases where, without our intervention, child trafficking victims would have been deported back to Vietnam, a country where many of our clients haven’t lived for years and haven’t any support or family to return to,” said Ahmed Aydeed, of law firm Duncan Lewis. “We know from working with many clients who have been trafficked into cannabis farms or nail bars or brothels here in the UK that there is an enhanced risk of retrafficking when they arrive back in Vietnam.” Child trafficking referrals in the UK hit a record high in 2017, increasing to 1,461 in the first three-quarters of the year, compared with 1,278 for the whole of 2016, according to the latest figures from the National Crime Agency. The rise has prompted concern among lawyers and campaigners that the Modern Slavery Act, which prime minister Theresa May introduced as home secretary to help end slavery and support victims, is failing to protect some of Britain’s most vulnerable children. The government does not record data on the number of trafficked children granted or refused asylum, nor does it hold information on how many are deported when they reach the age of 18. “The situation facing young Vietnamese child trafficking victims is really bad now,” said Aydeed. “We supposedly have good legislation and guidance on how to protect victims, but we’re still seeing child trafficking victims routinely criminalised, detained and deported.” Aydeed said that police, focused on prosecution targets, often fail to pick up indicators. In some cases, he said, the Home Office has proceeded with deportation attempts even after positively identifying a victim of trafficking. Aydeed added that children are often deported by the Home Office before confirmation of whether or not a child is a victim of trafficking has been obtained. Mark Shepherd, lawyer and director of Migrant Legal Project, said the Home Office regards the Vietnamese government as a “safe pair of hands”. Shepherd cited the case of another Vietnamese boy who, having helped police identify his traffickers, is under special protection from his local authority because of the risk of retrafficking, yet has likewise been forced to appeal against an asylum refusal. “He’s an orphan with no family, who the local authority consider to be at risk of being retrafficked. He has PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] because of his experiences but it is still considered safe to return him to Vietnam … What profile do you have to have for them to say it is not safe for them to return?” Chloe Setter, head of advocacy at Every Child Protected Against Trafficking, a child protection organisation, said that the system fails to monitor long-term outcomes, such as retrafficking of adults or children. “Why are we referring children into a system like the national referral mechanism that recognises them as trafficking victims but doesn’t do anything for them? We are saying if a child is recognised as a victim of trafficking they should get a level of specialist support.” In 2011, the UN’s International Organisation for Migration warned that trafficking victims returned to Vietnam faced risks including continued threats or dangers from their traffickers. Mimi Vu, director of advocacy at Pacific Links, a Vietnamese anti-trafficking charity, said: “Because of a lack of resources there are no specialised long-term support services for male victims of trafficking returned to Vietnam. These all create the conditions for retrafficking because the factors that led [victims] to be trafficked in the first place still exist and are even enhanced by what [they’ve] gone through.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “In 2015, the government introduced a world-leading Modern Slavery Act to give law enforcement agencies the tools to tackle this sickening crime and it remains a top priority for this government. “In October 2017 the government announced that the UK would spend at least £3m of the modern slavery fund in Vietnam. This money will help to catch offenders, support victims and stop people falling into slavery in the first place.” *Name changed to protect identity"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/07/asa-bans-poundlands-lewd-toy-elf-ad-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T12:02:55Z","webTitle":"ASA bans Poundland's lewd toy elf ad campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/07/asa-bans-poundlands-lewd-toy-elf-ad-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/07/asa-bans-poundlands-lewd-toy-elf-ad-campaign","fields":{"headline":"ASA bans Poundland's lewd toy elf ad campaign","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Poundland’s risque Christmas ads featuring a naughty elf playing strip poker and performing a sex act on a Barbie doll have been banned by the advertising watchdog. The budget retailer posted a series of eight images showing a toy elf in suggestive poses with other toys in the run-up to Christmas. The campaign, dubbed “Elf behaving bad”, ran on Poundland’s Twitter and Facebook accounts with images including the elf on a donkey with the line “Don’t tell Rudolph I’ve found a new piece of ass”. Other images showed the elf having drawn a pair of breasts on a car windscreen, sitting beside a sketch of a penis-shaped Christmas tree, and thrusting a toothbrush between its legs in a sexual manner. The Advertising Standards Authority received 85 complaints that the ads were offensive for depicting “toy characters and other items displayed in a sexualised manner” and should not have been put on social media where children could see them. Poundland defended the campaign, arguing it was based on “humour and double entendres” that were not intended to be understood by children. The company added that Twitter and Facebook also have policies that are meant to ban under-13s from having accounts. Poundland said it never sought to encourage anyone other than adults to follow its Facebook and Twitter accounts, and that it did not intend to offend anyone. The ASA said Poundland’s social media pages were “not age-gated and could be seen by anyone”. The ad watchdog also said that the irreverent Christmas campaign had been shared widely on social media and would have been seen by “a large number of people, including some children”. The ASA banned the campaign saying that depicting a child’s toy in such a sexualised manner, with sexual references and acts, where it could be seen by children was irresponsible and likely to cause widespread offence. After the publication of the ruling, Poundland goaded the ASA on Twitter with a message from the elf locked up at “Wormwood Scrubbers” prison. The tongue-in-cheek message said Britain was the home of “saucy postcards, Carry On Films and panto” so it was a shame that the ASA found the “double entendres hard to swallow”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/feb/08/local-authorities-plan-council-tax-hikes-to-stave-off-financial-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T07:10:40Z","webTitle":"Council tax rises on the way as local authorities try to stay afloat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/08/local-authorities-plan-council-tax-hikes-to-stave-off-financial-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/feb/08/local-authorities-plan-council-tax-hikes-to-stave-off-financial-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Council tax rises on the way as local authorities try to stay afloat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Local authorities in England are teetering on the edge of a financial crisis, with most planning to increase council tax from April while continuing to cut services, a survey has found. The annual finance survey from the Local Government Information Unit thinktank (LGIU) comes days after Northamptonshire county council became the first town hall in two decades to declare effective bankruptcy. Severe financial pressures had left the council unable deliver a workable budget. The LGIU warned that the Northamptonshire crisis was potentially the “tip of the iceberg”, with four-fifths of councils concerned about their financial sustainability amid uncertainty over funding and the accelerating costs of social care. “Councils are on the edge. They are, for the most part, holding services together – although a significant minority are not. But they can only do this by raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves,” said Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU. Lord Porter, the Conservative chair of the Local Government Association (LGA), said the survey showed some councils were being pushed “perilously close to the financial edge”, adding that many more would face huge challenges in setting budgets for the coming year. “Extra council-tax-raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income, but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face,” he said. “This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result.” Local Tory MPs and Labour politicians have called for Northamptonshire to be taken over by government commissioners. The council forecasts a £21m overspend for the current year, and has warned that its finances will remain “grave” in the near future as it struggles to make £34m of cuts on top of the £376m made since 2010. Earlier this week, ministers sought to head off a rebellion by backbench Tory MPs in shire areas by announcing an additional £150m of funding for adult social care in 2018-19, together with extra cash for rural areas. However, critics warned this was inadequate to meet long-term pressures. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Our finance settlement strikes a balance between relieving growing pressure on local government while ensuring that hard-pressed taxpayers do not face excessive bills. “We have listened to representations made from councils and delivered on these with extra funding. Overall, councils will see a real-term increase in resources over the next two years, more freedom and fairness, and with a greater certainty to plan and secure value for money.” The problems facing local authorities are underlined by a National Audit Office (NAO) report that says England faces a recruitment crisis in social care, driven by poor wages and working conditions. It says current low rates of recruitment will not meet the estimated need for between 350,000 and 700,000 extra care workers by 2030. Ministers have no up-to-date workforce strategy and have effectively ignored the growing crisis in social care staffing, the NAO report concludes. It says workforce planning is difficult while there remains little clarity about the sustainability of local authority spending on social care, which has fallen by 5.3% since 2010. Brexit barriers on overseas workers could exacerbate the care worker shortage, the report suggests. There were 95,000 non-British European Economic Area nationals working in care in 2016-17, equivalent to 7% of the total workforce, although this rises to as much as 20% in parts of London and the south-east. Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The NAO’s report shows the social care workforce is in a precarious state. We are increasingly dependent on care workers to look after ourselves and our families, yet the profession suffers from low pay, low esteem and high turnover of staff.” The LGIU survey found spiralling demand for adult social care remained the greatest long-term pressure on council budgets, although a third of councils now say children’s social services funding is the biggest short-term challenge, fuelled by rising numbers of children being taken into care. The thinktank said the vast majority of councils planned to make ends meet in 2018-19 by increasing council tax and drawing on “rainy day” financial reserves, as well as raising or introducing charges for services including parking, garden waste disposal, burial, planning, home care and meals on wheels. Some of the respondents to the survey said charges would rise above inflation. One said charges would be imposed “wherever we can”. Another said parish councils would be asked to see if local residents would fund services such as grass cutting on roadside verges, youth clubs and street lighting. “The situation is dire,” one respondent said, adding: “We pay for parking – why not pay for [access to] domestic waste sites, bus passes, etc?” At the same time, many councils admit they are planning to reduce services further, with over half aiming to cut spending on parks and leisure centres, and a third lining up cuts – or further cuts – to social care, youth centres, libraries, art galleries and museums. Almost all councils (95%) say they are planning to raise council tax this year – a far cry from 2012, when the same proportion froze rates, encouraged by ministers. Many councils plan to increase council tax by 6% in 2018-19 – the maximum allowed – including 3% earmarked to fund social care. With conventional funding sources shrinking, three-quarters of councils say they are considering investing in local commercial property developments, commercialising council services or buying investment properties as a way of generating cash. England’s councils have experienced a 40% cut in their funding from central government since the start of the decade. The LGA estimates that they face a £5bn funding gap by 2020, which could potentially push many councils to breaking point. The LGIU survey analysed responses from about 113 individual county, district and unitary councils – around one third of the total in England. Nearly 70% of those that responded are under Conservative control. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Everyone is entitled to good-quality care and we recognise there are challenges – that’s why we will shortly publish a health and care workforce strategy to address these issues.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/08/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-rendezvous","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T12:00:33Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about rendezvous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/08/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-rendezvous","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/08/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-rendezvous","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about rendezvous","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is this week’s playlist – songs picked by a reader from hundreds of suggestions on last week’s callout. Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. New York is a city of shadows, concrete mountains and canyons, street noise. But there are high-rise havens to be had. On the roof the air is clear and at night the stars put on a show. Our protagonist asks his baby to join him – to rendezvous – and in sharing a hidden paradise the Drifters’ Up on the Roof (Gerry Goffin and Carole King at their finest) starts this week’s playlist. In the Rolling Stones’ Waiting on a Friend, Mick Jagger explains that for once he doesn’t need a lady. He doesn’t mind watching them go by and imagining their stories, their tales of men. Nor does he need the vices assembled in his thoughts; he’s relaxed and content to wait on the arrival of his expected friend. That’s all he needs. Kraftwerk’s Trans-Europe Express is virtually an advert for the now defunct system. Hooking up major European cities, first-class travellers could “Rendez-vous auf den Champs Elysees / Verlass Paris am Morgen mit dem TEE”. In the band’s case they hit Vienna and make a quick turnaround to Düsseldorf to meet David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Fine for some. Let’s face it, sometimes it’s best to cut out the waffle and get straight to the point. British electronic duo Basement Jaxx don’t mince words in their rather persistent call to Rendez-Vu: “I got you in my heart / I got you in my head / Let’s make a rendez-vu.” Manu Chao, on the other hand, needs a ton of reassurance in his Le Rendez-Vous. The previous night’s assignation to see a French movie has left him feeling needy enough to press his date on her reaction. He has to know how much she enjoyed their night out, detail by detail. Jarvis Cocker, who has a way with words, claims everything in Pulp’s Disco 2000 is true except for the woodchip wallpaper. It’s the story of his childhood friendship with Deborah Bone. Deborah was popular with the boys, and though he was crazy about her, he was doomed only to be her friend. So he had the idea of suggesting they meet again in the year 2000 so they could see each other as adults, and hopefully dredge up some adult emotions. He even nominated a time and a place. She died aged 51, but Cocker did sing their song at her 50th birthday party. Mike Skinner, another wordsmith, spins a cautionary tale in the Streets’ It’s Too Late. Despite his deep feelings for his girl, Skinner’s protagonist lacks the motivation to arrive at their rendezvous at the designated time. Repeatedly, he comes up with lame excuses about having to see a mate or a dealer. He has a conscience about this behaviour and eventually resolves to be more reliable. But the day he turns up on time, new leaf turned – she’s not there. Like many an old blues song, John Lee Hooker and Canned Heat’s Meet Me in the Bottom has been recorded dozens of times by dozens of artists. Each recording has produced slight variations on the musical and lyrical themes. But the core of the song has always been maintained: we have a man on the run, scared for his life. Whether facing a lynch mob or a posse, he has to move quickly, so fast that he flees barefoot. He’ll be hiding down in the bottom, he says, where his woman will bring him his boots and shoes. A junk-sick “white boy” is forced by his need to traipse up to Harlem and wait for a dealer to turn up in the Velvet Underground’s I’m Waiting for the Man. “He’s never early, he’s always late / First thing you learn is you always got to wait.” Harassed by suspicious locals, he has to stay rooted to the spot until his man turns up. He is taken to a room full of strangers, scores, goes home, gets grief from his wife, then looks forward to doing it all again the next day. Another kind of illicit rendezvous lies at the heart of Frank Zappa’s Willie the Pimp. A thumbnail sketch of a player at the centre of Hollywood’s Lido Hotel maelstrom, Willie (Captain Beefheart) barks his wares and arranges meetings between besuited businessmen and his waiting floozies. Is this about dogging? For me Richard Hawley’s Down in the Woods conjures up images of Lynx-lacquered lorry-drivers lasciviously looking on as string-vested accountants take their wives in the glare of headlamps across a hot bonnet. Well, at least their bottoms are kept warm. In deeply immoral mode, Clarence Carter, in his Slip Away, beseeches a presumably married woman to slip out of the house without her husband knowing she’s gone. He wants to take her to a place where they’re both unknown. Sometimes the most beautiful music tells the wickedest of tales. Speaking of which, the protagonist in the Incredible String Band’s Saturday Maybe makes Alfie Elkins look like the Archbishop of Canterbury. A typical back-door man, his squalid assignation is related in monochrome images as he explains it’s just a quickie before her husband gets back from the boozer. He suggests a rendezvous, though is uncertain what day that might be. Then he asks her not to cry because she’ll freak out the baby!

He came for an executive job at the telecoms company AT&amp;T, and ended up working there for decades. Like many immigrants to the US, Chaudry came to wholeheartedly believe – perhaps more fervently than his native-born neighbours – in the triumphal story that Americans tell about their nation: how it was always growing stronger through change, melding the many into one through the process of assimilation. Chaudry was a devout Muslim. But to him, it always seemed the things that made him different mattered less than the ways in which he had proved he was the same. Chaudry and his wife, who is from Italy, raised three children on a street called Manor Drive, in the town of Basking Ridge, in the centre of the state of New Jersey. This is not the “Jersey” of popular imagination – the land of belching smokestacks immortalised in Bruce Springsteen’s working-class anthems. Basking Ridge is out in horse country, an area of rolling green hills and white-steepled churches, not far from Bedminster, where Donald Trump has his summer estate. In keeping with the values of his adopted community, Chaudry became an active member of the local Republican party and a conspicuous civic presence, running for various elected boards. In 2004, at the height of George W Bush’s war in Iraq, Chaudry became the first Pakistani-American to serve as mayor of a municipality in the US. Long after Chaudry retired from both AT&amp;T and electoral politics, he continued to keep a busy schedule of volunteer activities, most focused on building religious tolerance. He ran a small nonprofit organisation called the Center for Understanding Islam, and taught classes at local universities. Chaudry is bantam-sized, with a silvery moustache and a starchy manner, and despite his age – now 75 – he possesses a bottomless reservoir of diligent energy. He would travel the state, speaking to audiences young and old, always dressing the part of a politician, with a little American flag badge in his lapel. If there was prejudice around him in his adopted hometown, Chaudry later said that “it was not obvious, or visible, or overt”. That changed in 2011, when he found a new cause: building a mosque in Basking Ridge. For years, Chaudry and other local Muslims had been using a community centre for a makeshift Friday service. But Chaudry decided that the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge needed a permanent place to pray, and he located what he believed to be a suitable site: a four-acre lot occupied by a rundown Dutch Colonial house. Soon after purchasing it, Chaudry held an open house to greet the neighbours. “There was not too much tension,” he said. “It was kind of jovial.” He put the letters “ISBR” on the mailbox in front of the house, to announce the Islamic Society’s arrival. Then someone smashed the mailbox. “I was, of course, very surprised,” Chaudry said. Under New Jersey’s planning laws, the Islamic Society had to secure the approval of the municipal government to build the mosque, and from his experience as a public official, Chaudry knew that the town, which prided itself on its quaint homes and a history dating back to colonial times, was resistant to new development of any kind. But this was a house of worship, and he was someone well-known to the community. “It’s not that I was expecting any favours,” Chaudry said. “I expected them to be fair.” What shocked him, though, was the hatred. That was seven long years ago, before some townspeople formed a group calling for “responsible development” in furious opposition to the mosque, before the 39 planning board hearings, before the mosque was rejected, before Chaudry filed a lawsuit alleging religious prejudice, before his lawyers uncovered racially charged emails among officials opposed to his plan, before the Obama administration accused the town of civil rights violations, before national rightwing activists took notice of the dispute and began smearing Chaudry as a terrorist sympathiser, and before Trump dragged anti-Muslim conspiracy theories from the disreputable fringes into the White House. Today, Chaudry knows his town – and America – better. Long before Trump came along to capitalise on it, though, Islamophobia was building in the US, bubbling up like swamp gas from the depths. Often, racial conflict would manifest itself in small, seemingly isolated local planning fights over proposals to build mosques. The US Department of Justice, which staunchly defended the rights of Muslims during the Obama administration, noted a sharp increase in such mosque disputes between 2010 and 2016. Many took place in conservative locales such as rural Murfreesboro, Tennessee. But they also broke out in unexpected places such as Basking Ridge: a wealthy and well-educated community in the outwardly tolerant north-eastern US. Basking Ridge is governed by a five-person elected committee, which meets in a repurposed Tudor-style mansion. (It previously belonged to John Jacob Astor VI, an American aristocrat whose father perished on the Titanic.) One evening last year, I attended a meeting – the first of many – at the town hall, where the committee members sat on a long dais, discussing their usual business, such as preparations for an upcoming celebration of the signing of Basking Ridge’s royal charter, in 1760. When the meeting was opened to comments from the public, however, all anyone wanted to talk about was Chaudry and the mosque. “The neighbours near this proposed mosque did not sign up to live next to this house of worship,” said one resident, who broke down sobbing as she spoke. “They have been members of a quiet residential neighbourhood for decades, and do not look forward to having their routines and lives disrupted.” The residents said the mosque would create traffic and commotion, and would ruin their property values. But they also complained about the tactics Chaudry had employed in his bitter court battle. One middle-aged woman gestured toward the mosque opponents in the audience, saying that many had been subjected to “a hateful harassment campaign” by the Islamic Society’s attorneys, who had served them with subpoenas seeking the contents of their personal email and social media accounts, in an effort to prove that they were motivated not by planning concerns, but animosity toward Muslims. “Mr Chaudry has waged an expensive PR campaign that has talked about people as if they’re bigots,” the woman said. “And personally, I think it is the ISBR group that has been bullying and bigoted.” Then she invoked Trump, the inescapable presence. “They talk about our current president and how he speaks about Muslims. Well, I find ISBR’s rhetoric to be just as harmful.” Finally, Loretta Quick, a schoolteacher who lived next door to the mosque site, got up to speak. She was one of the neighbours who had come to Chaudry’s initial open house years before. She had even voted for him, back when he was a politician. Now she was a die-hard enemy of the mosque. “If you cave,” she told the board, in a furious voice, “you’re saying that we are bigots, that we based the decision on discrimination against Islam.” Quick was one of those who had been served with a subpoena, and was being represented by the Thomas More Law Center, an advocacy group that claims its mission is to defend “America’s Judeo-Christian heritage and moral values” against forces waging a “Stealth Jihad” to “transform America into an Islamic nation”. Quick referenced a recent press release the Law Center had put out, which had plucked a few verses from a searchable English translation of the Qur’an that could be accessed on the ISBR website – “Fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them”, etc – to suggest that Chaudry was somehow in league with religious extremists. “These are words that seem quite intimidating and threatening to me,” Quick said. “I want to be protected, and you owe that to me, this township and this nation.” * * * How did a small-town property dispute turn into a religious war, with legal and symbolic implications for all of America? Part of the answer has to do with the country’s labyrinthine land-use laws, which leave most control to state and local governments, which are in turn vulnerable to the furies of angry mobs. Part of it has to do with America’s love of litigation. The inherently confrontational and intrusive legal process had a radicalising effect on the town, driving some opponents of the development to extremes. But something else deeper and darker seemed to be at work. Some residents openly discussed Islamophobic conspiracy theories, such as the idea that the mosque was meant to send a message of conquest, due to its proximity to the town’s September 11 memorial. Such crackpot notions, promoted by far-right ideologues such as Pamela Geller and Frank Gaffney, used to be confined to the margins of the internet. Then Trump embraced the Islamophobes, unabashedly. “It’s like his election has given permission to people,” Chaudry told me the first time we met. We were at the proposed site of the mosque, sitting in the old suburban house that he was still hoping to demolish. Its living room, dominated by a large stone fireplace, was filled with boxes of donated clothes that he was preparing to deliver to a family of Syrian refugees. The many bookshelves were lined with theological texts and stacked copies of a paperback that Chaudry likes to give out, Islam Denounces Terrorism. Standing on an easel in a corner was a poster-sized rendering of the proposed mosque. In an effort to make it fit into its suburban surroundings, it had been designed to resemble a mini-mansion, with gray clapboard siding, a pitched roof with asphalt shingles, dormer windows and minarets disguised as chimneys. But the architecture did little to defuse tensions with the surrounding neighbourhood. Liberty Corner considered itself separate from the older and wealthier village of Basking Ridge, though they were both part of the same larger township, and few outsiders recognised the geographical distinction. And as even Chaudry and his allies admitted, some of the locals had a stubborn and ecumenical commitment to protesting anyone who dared to build anything, including Christian churches. People in Liberty Corner expressed an obstreperous ideology often abbreviated as “nimby”, for “not in my backyard”. The opponents of the mosque told their own story of victimisation, in which they were merely objecting to Chaudry’s oppressive development scheme. “It was always about land use,” one Liberty Corner resident told me. “They made it about religion.” The nimby complainers claimed that the mosque site – a marshy plot on a mainly residential street – was a poor location for a busy house of prayer. When the township planning board took up Chaudry’s proposal in August 2012, signs soon appeared in front yards around town, reading “Preserve Liberty Corner”. At one of the first planning hearings, a resident named Lori Caratzola stood up to challenge Chaudry. A law graduate, she cross-examined him about the size of the Islamic Society, accusing him of understating its membership. She revealed that she had done surveillance of a Friday service, counting 125 worshippers going into a space with a capacity for 60. After her confrontational performance, Caratzola became a leader of the opposition. At the public hearings, Caratzola and others confined their criticisms to the nimby issues: drainage, parking, landscaping and the like. They convinced the board that a mosque would need more parking spaces than a church, because midday worshippers would come alone. When the Islamic Society submitted a new plan, with a larger parking lot, the mosque’s opponents protested that, too. It quickly became clear that the opposition was not solely concerned with parking. Around the time the hearings began, some residents received an anonymous piece of mail. Inside was a letter entitled “Meet Your New Neighbor”, and a CD containing a recording of a radio interview in which Chaudry had offered some mildly nuanced opinions on Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah. “Here in Basking Ridge, on the surface, we see the serene, grinning academic Ali Chaudry, always willing to help us better understand the version of Islam he wants us to know,” the letter read. “Scratch the surface a little and an uglier picture emerges.” The author of the letter tenuously linked Chaudry to the Muslim Brotherhood and the “Ground Zero mosque” – a proposed Islamic community centre in Lower Manhattan that Pamela Geller and Fox News had recently whipped up into a national controversy. It cited the term taqiyya, an obscure theological concept that Islamophobes often twist to suggest that Muslims are encouraged to lie about the true nature of their violent beliefs. “So, welcome to the neighbourhood, Ali,” the letter concluded. “Let’s ask Ali about those Koranic verses regarding Jews and Christians in your Koran. Why are so many terroristic acts propagated by Muslims? Is it something they are taught in your mosques and at home? And what will you teach in your new Liberty Corner mosque? You wouldn’t lie to us, would you? Taqiyya is wrong, right?” * * * Just as the author of the letter accused Muslims of deception, the Islamic Society, in its lawsuit, alleged that many of the neighbours were presenting a false front, using preservationist sentiment to disguise their real, less respectable fears. “The key thing to remember,” said Adeel Mangi, an attorney for the Islamic Society, “is that these complaints are commonly used as a smokescreen.” There is, literally, an anti-mosque playbook. Tactics were once unwritten, spread through websites and word of mouth, but more recently they were set down in a book titled Mosques in America: A Guide to Accountable Permit Hearings and Continuing Citizen Oversight. Written by a Texas attorney, it was published by the Center for Security Policy, an organisation headed by Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan administration official who has long espoused the theory that Muslims are engaged in a secret plot to impose sharia law on the US. Gaffney writes in the book’s introduction that it is a “how-to manual for patriotic Americans who are ready to counter the leading edge of Islamic supremacism”. The manual offers lessons from cases like the one in Basking Ridge. “It may be startling to consider, but Islamists are entitled to exploit liberal free speech rights to advance their political and legal operations,” the author warns. It advises residents to express objections in the manner most likely to sway the authorities, avoiding mention of religious issues. “Concerned citizens must learn to express questions and reservations in a manner appropriate to the relevant civic forum’s purpose,” the manual says, instructing readers that “rather than expressing alarm as hysteria, speaking to local government officials and media requires a strategic response based on reason, facts, precedents, and the law”. Sure enough, the transcripts of the dozens of hearings held by the town’s planning board, which run to nearly 7,000 pages, contain no mention of sharia, the Muslim Brotherhood or other rightwing hobgoblins. Most residents swore that religion had nothing to do with their opposition. But the Islamic society’s lawyers suspected – and would later allege in court – that their opponents were showing another face when they talked to each other on the internet. A commenter named “LC” – who appeared to be Caratzola – often expressed anti-Muslim sentiments when the mosque was debated on local web forums and national sites with names such as Bare Naked Islam. (Motto: “It isn’t Islamophobia when they really ARE trying to kill you.”) Caratzola was also listed as a member of a Gaffney-affiliated group set up to defend against the supposedly creeping influence of sharia on US courts. (“I stand by that,” Caratzola later told the New York Times, claiming that “every single terrorist attack in the last 20 years was committed by Muslims”.) In December 2015, a few days after a Muslim husband and wife killed 14 people in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, and shortly before candidate Donald Trump proposed a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslim immigration, the town’s planning board voted to reject the mosque. At Caratzola’s urging, the town government also adopted a new ordinance that raised the minimum size of the plot required to build any new house of worship – which would effectively prevent the Islamic Society from building on its own site in the future. The Islamic Society quickly filed a lawsuit against the township, alleging the opposition was a “well-funded machine” that was “substantially grounded in anti-Muslim animus”. The lawsuit particularly highlighted Caratzola’s role as a ringleader of the opposition. In a letter to a local newspaper, she accused the Islamic Society of “slander” – and invoked the concept of taqiyya to suggest that Chaudry’s mosque proposal was not what it seemed. “Many people and groups in the Muslim community,” she wrote, “are trying to quash what we so fervently cherish in America – the freedom of speech.” The Islamic Society also claimed it had the constitution on its side – specifically, the first-amendment protection of the freedoms of religion and assembly. And Chaudry could call upon a powerful ally: Barack Obama. Under his administration, the Justice Department intervened on behalf of Muslims in many mosque disputes, including a highly publicised case in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where the construction of a mosque was opposed with lawsuits, protests and an arson attack. It was able to rely on a powerful legal tool: a law, originally passed with bipartisan support in 2000, that specifically bans local governments from discriminating against religious organisations when it comes to land use. The enforcement policy “reflected the fact that Islamophobia is a real problem across America”, said Tom Perez, who handled the Murfreesboro case as a director of the Civil Rights Division. (He is currently chairman of the Democratic National Committee.) “I think as you see the proliferation of social media, the world has gotten smaller,” Perez told me. “People who harbour these extreme views have a virtual platform to spread their hate.” In 2016, the US Justice Department filed its own lawsuit, claiming that the local planning board violated the Islamic Society’s rights in rejecting its building plan. To Islamophobic activists, who spent the eight years of Obama’s presidency promoting conspiracy theories about his birth certificate and suggesting he was secretly a Muslim, such moves were yet more evidence of the administration’s suspiciously sympathetic stance toward Islam. “Islamic supremacists and Muslim Brotherhood organisations … called upon their running dogs at the Department of Justice to impose the sharia and usurp American law for Islamic law,” Pam Geller wrote in a blogpost about the Basking Ridge mosque case. “What small town can go up against the US government’s vast resources and endless taxpayer-funded muscle?” The federal government’s intervention had a radicalising effect in Liberty Corner. The neighbourhood’s enemy was no longer a pushy former mayor; it was President Obama. Then, as if a Justice Department investigation wasn’t intrusive enough, private citizens started receiving knocks on their doors from people carrying subpoenas, seeking to probe their email and social media accounts. The Islamic Society’s lawyers – members of a prestigious Manhattan firm that was working pro-bono – wanted to prove that Caratzola was really the commenter “LC”, and that she and her allies were communicating their true attitudes to each other – and to their elected leaders – outside of the public meetings. Understandably, though, the private citizens felt threatened by the intrusion. Their complaints attracted the attention of the Thomas More Law Center, which intervened on the behalf of residents seeking to quash the subpoenas, claiming that the demand would have a chilling effect on free speech. On its website, the Law Center decried the “outrageous unconstitutional intimidation”, alongside a heroic photo of Caratzola standing in front of an American flag. “Lori Caratzola,” the caption read. “Persecuted for opposing the mosque.” * * * On 31 December 2016, a federal judge issued a preliminary decision in the Basking Ridge case, finding that the planning board had exercised “unbridled and unconstitutional discretion” in requiring the mosque to have more parking than other houses of worship. Though the case was far from over, it was clear that the law favoured Chaudry. The victory rang hollow, though. Trump had just been elected president, giving a jarring rebuke to liberal values, and placing Muslim-Americans like Chaudry in a newly precarious position. As a candidate, to bolster his call for a ban on Muslim immigration, Trump had often cited the research from the Center for Security Policy, Gaffney’s group. (“Very highly respected people, who I know, actually.”) Some of his most important advisers, such as Steve Bannon and Mike Pompeo, soon to be named the CIA director, were outspoken Gaffney admirers. Gaffney saluted the new attorney general, Jeff Sessions – the 2015 winner of the Center for Security Policy’s “Keeper of the Flame” award – for his vigilance “against all enemies, foreign and domestic”. With Sessions and other members of the nativist right in charge of the federal government, the Justice Department’s commitment toward protecting Muslims and their mosques looked shaky. On a chilly Friday in April last year, still early in Trump’s presidency, I helped Chaudry as he performed his weekly ritual, carrying items from the garage of the old house in Liberty Corner to his gold Toyota SUV. In went eight rolled-up prayer rugs, then the plastic donation boxes, the folding music stand that serves as a lectern, the sound system, the digital clock, which was synchronised with Mecca, and four decorative mats, which Chaudry uses to slightly sanctify the drab walls of the community centre that the Islamic Society currently uses for its Jummah service. When the SUV, known as the “Mosque Mobile”, was full, Chaudry would drive it across town for prayers. “I’m just overwhelmed with everything that is going on,” he said as we got in the car. For the past few months, Trump had been fighting to impose his ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations, sparking court confrontations and massive protests. Chaudry was responding to the crisis with a characteristic burst of civic activity, participating in political forums and interfaith vigils. The relationship between Muslim communities and their government was wary at the best of times, and Trump was making it much worse, but Chaudry saw himself as a trust-building emissary. He served on advisory panels to law enforcement. A few weeks before, he’d spoken about discrimination and the travel ban at a worried meeting between Muslim leaders and many prominent New Jersey politicians. At the forum, as he did nearly everywhere he went, Chaudry promoted an earnest personal cause, asking everyone present to take a formal pledge he’d composed, to “Stand up for the Other”. The Mosque Mobile turned on to Church Street, the main road through Liberty Corner. The neighbourhood traced its name back to the American revolution, and the whole town took great patriotic pride in the role it had played in the independence struggle, as a stronghold for George Washington’s army. Chaudry took a roundabout route, pointing out horse farms and new tract developments, and a park where the Islamic Society prayed when the community centre was used for a summer camp. “Where the flag is, this is the 9/11 memorial,” Chaudry said. “I was on the township committee when we did that. Eighteen people here died.” A wooded road took us into Basking Ridge. In the yard of its Presbyterian church, founded in 1717, stood an ancient tree known as the “Holy Oak”, where Washington is said to have picnicked with the Marquis de Lafayette. At the community centre, we were joined by Chaudry’s wife, Victoria. We rolled out the mats and set up the speakers, and used a 30-metre (100-ft) sound cable to connect the small main room with an adjacent annex, which was used for overflow. Chaudry pointed, proudly, to his name on a plaque on the wall – he had helped to establish the centre. About a decade before, he and around a dozen other Muslims had started gathering there. But there were more Muslims around than he realised, working as doctors in the area’s hospitals, or as scientists in its many pharmaceutical firms, or as engineers at a big telecommunications company. The Islamic Society had long ago outgrown its temporary space. The worshippers began to arrive, most of them men coming from office jobs, plastic ID badges hanging from their belts. They dropped their shoes in an unruly pile near the centre’s doorway, and used a cramped galley kitchen to perform wudu, the Muslim washing ritual. Then they knelt down as the muezzin sang a call to prayer. Because it lacked a permanent home, the Islamic Society had no imam, and it relied on a rotating cast to lead services. This week’s visitor, Chaudry told me, was known as “the crying imam”. That week, dozens of Syrian civilians, including many children, had been killed in a poison gas attack, and the night before, Trump had fired cruise missiles in reprisal. The imam, dressed in a long black robe, led a prayer for “our brothers and sisters in Syria”. His voice trembling, he sobbed, “Give peace to this region.” “That’s one of his characteristics,” Chaudry said after the service. “He does become emotional.” Most of the worshippers, who numbered around 70 in all, quickly returned to their cars and hurried back to work. Chaudry repacked the Mosque Mobile. “I’ve been carrying these rugs for more than 10 years now, and I’m tired of doing it,” he told me. “We need to have a place of our own.” As we drove out of Basking Ridge, Chaudry pointed out the Holy Oak, standing tall in the churchyard. The tree was rotten, he told me. Later that month, it would be cut down, and its dead branches handed out to townspeople as patriotic keepsakes. * * * Despite Trump’s election, Chaudry still retained his hope for justice, at least for his congregation. The case was now in the courts, which meant the Justice Department couldn’t easily abandon it. The town’s government, facing an almost certain legal defeat, was under pressure from its insurance company to settle its lawsuit with the Islamic Society quickly, before a trial. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, negotiations dragged on over a settlement, which would include a large damages payment to the Islamic Society. I attended endless meetings of the township’s elected committee, at which angry citizens would demand information from stone-faced board members, inveighing against the settlement in increasingly apocalyptic terms. Chaudry attended with other members of the Islamic Society. He sat in the front row but said nothing, keeping his head down and scribbling in a pad, showing no emotion even in the face of incendiary provocations. The opponents were a surprisingly diverse lot. There were some old-money Protestants, who complained that the hubbub would bother their horses. But some of the most emotional speakers were new residents, many of them immigrants from south and east Asia. At one meeting, one of the Islamic Society’s closest neighbours, a medical professional from India who was building a large house directly behind the mosque plot, stood up and addressed the Muslims in the audience directly. “If you are somehow able to get a mosque built, you will create a divide which you will not be able to bridge,” he said. “On the other hand, if the site would move to another appropriate location, you will earn our respect, and you will truly earn the right to build a mosque in this town. What is it that you want, to just build a mosque, or set an example for the whole country?” By the perverse logic of the mosque opponents, it was the Islamic Society that had brought discrimination upon itself, by suing over discrimination. There was only one thing the Muslims could do to prove themselves worthy neighbours: go somewhere else. It wouldn’t be fair to say, though, that everyone who spoke against the mosque was religiously motivated. Many, if not most, of the adversaries appeared to be genuinely impassioned in their opposition to development in Liberty Corner. “Sure, there’s a 5% lunatic fringe,” Paul Zubulake told me one evening while sitting on a bench outside the town hall, waiting for yet another meeting to begin. But he said that for him, and many others, religion was beside the point: “It’s about our quality of life. It’s going to destroy our community.” To show me what he loved about Liberty Corner, Zubalake invited me to visit his home, a few doors down from the Islamic Society property. When I arrived, on a rainy Memorial Day in late May, a soggy town parade was making its way down the main thoroughfare, Church Street. As Zubulake was introducing me to his family – explaining that his son has autism, and they had moved to the area for his schooling – he spotted the mayor marching by with other members of the township committee. He dashed down to the roadside and shouted: “There’s still time!” The politicians frowned and kept marching down Church Street. “I just want them to know how pissed off I am,” Zubulake said. Chaudry, meanwhile, had organised a contingent from the Islamic Society to march in the Memorial Day parade. They met in front of the house, next to a sign that Chaudry had staked in the yard, reading: “Proud to Be An American.” Whether by chance or intention, the parade’s organisers had put the Islamic Society at the very rear, right behind another marginalised group, the local Democrats. Chaudry coaxed the children who were marching with the Islamic Society’s banner to stay in a tight formation. “Good morning!” he called from beneath a big black umbrella, waving an American flag with his free hand. The parade route ended at a war memorial, where Chaudry left a wreath with a mosque insignia. “My advice to the community has always been that this is not the time to hide,” Chaudry told me later. “You have to be out there, fighting for your rights.” To some people in Basking Ridge, Chaudry’s struggle looked less noble. They saw his battle with the town government as a local political feud, which dated back to his tenure as an elected official, long before he ever proposed the mosque. Chaudry had first run for a seat on the town committee in 2001. After September 11, which hit the commuter town hard, he told the local newspaper: “We are all under attack.” But a Republican party leader called him to suggest it might be better if his campaign signs, which read “Ali Chaudry”, just used his last name. “I said everyone knows who I am,” Chaudry told me. “I’ve never kept it a secret.” He won the election. But he was not universally popular. The way the local government worked, the office of mayor rotated annually among the elected members of the township committee. In 2004, it was Chaudry’s turn. As the US’s first Pakistani-American mayor, he made a triumphant visit to his homeland, where he met with the foreign minister, and gave interviews in which he hinted that he had ambitions for higher office. But local critics found him arrogant and high-handed. The next time he was up for election, he held on to his committee seat by just 11 votes. The local Republican party was also in the midst of a schism, and Chaudry and his allies were ultimately driven out by a more conservative faction, which ran on the slogan: “It’s Time To Take Your Town Back.” The bad blood spilled over into the mosque dispute. The most damning evidence produced by the Islamic Society in the course of its lawsuit came from the correspondence of the town’s elected officials, many of whom had formerly served and clashed with Chaudry. They expressed their hostility in raw, racially offensive terms. A town committee member named John Malay compared Chaudry to a stereotypically shifty native character in the 1930s film The Lives of a Bengal Lancer. “We [finally] ousted him, whereupon he went to Mecca, got a funny hat and declared himself the imam of a new mosque here in town,” Malay wrote. “Religion trumps even politics as a refuge for scoundrels, I guess.” Other emails contained jokes about Muslims, pigs and Barack Obama. “Man child,” John Carpenter, another committee member, wrote of Obama. “The product of fools, raised by idiots and coddled by affirmative action. Behold the beast.” The emails revealed that Carpenter had even lobbied to prevent Chaudry from participating in a September 11 commemoration ceremony, alleging he was an extremist. “[Find] a real moderate Muslim,” he wrote. “There must be one. We shouldn’t look the other way on his views – we owe that to our dead residents. Let’s make it happen without that fool.” When the correspondence came out in court filings, Carpenter offered no apologies. “You should not confuse contempt with bigotry,” he told a newspaper. “I’m allowed to not like the guy.” “He’s just a funny guy with this identity thing,” Carpenter told me when we met for coffee at a diner over the summer. “He was known as, quote, ‘Mr Muslim’.” Carpenter, a tall, balding salesman, had served on the town committee for more than a decade, and was running for re-election. He was outraged that his unguarded words had been used to portray him – and the entire township – as racist. “When government tries to see into someone’s heart, that’s when we fall into totalitarianism,” he told me. He advanced a conspiratorial theory, which I heard from other mosque opponents, that Chaudry had been “engineering failure” all along, so that he could sue and win millions in damages, as other mosques had done. He said he believed that Chaudry and the Obama administration had been conspiring. A Justice Department official involved in the investigation of the township, he noted, served with Chaudry on the board of a local university’s Center on Religion, Culture and Conflict. (Chaudry says they never discussed the case.) “I find it ironic that he served on this council for religious conflict, and what he really was trying to do here – and I don’t think he succeeded in the end, because people see through it – is create a religious conflict,” Carpenter said. “I don’t think what happened is fair to the people of the town, and I think it’s important for other people around the country to know what’s coming their way.” Carpenter said he had been hopeful that Trump’s election would bring “a little sanity to the Department of Justice”, and a reversal of its stance on the mosque case, but so far, he had been disappointed. He knew the president was spending his summer vacation at his private club in Bedminster, though, just a quick drive away from Basking Ridge. “He’s there for three weeks,” joked Carpenter, an avid cyclist. “Maybe I could sneak in, ride my bike up the back road: I need to speak to the president!” * * * All year long, as I kept returning to see Chaudry, Donald Trump loomed over our conversation. One Saturday morning in September, on my way to meet Chaudry at a Lutheran Church’s symposium on “Race, Hatred and Bigotry”, I looked up in the sky and saw the presidential helicopter heading toward Bedminster. Trump’s embrace of the worst in politics – fanning terrorism hysteria, retweeting racist memes, refusing to condemn the white nationalist demonstrators in Charlottesville – had real consequences on the ground. “People are emboldened to come out and say things that they never felt they could say before,” Chaudry told the symposium. “They have a licence, because the person in the highest office of the country is engaging in that kind of language.”At one point, the room suddenly filled with a disconcerting roar from low-flying military jets. Chaudry introduced a pair of high school girls, one of whom was wearing hijab, who eloquently described their experiences with bullying confrontations on the school bus and social media platforms. “I would say to my non-Muslim friends: this is the Muslim community,” Chaudry said when they finished their presentation. As the controversy over the mosque moved toward a settlement, the town committee held a series of heated public hearings. Many members of the Islamic Society attended, to show a human face to their neighbours. They always took care to present themselves as model citizens: upscale professionals, and the parents of striving children. “We are not some strange boogeyman that came out of nowhere,” Yasmine Khalil told me. She was a doctor and a vocal mosque supporter, who had moved to the township from Manhattan a few years before. Khalil said she had been dismayed to see the ugliness infiltrate even a private Facebook group for local mothers, where she had got into commenting wars about Islam. “When I wasn’t just quiet and silent and in the background,” she said, “they took it upon themselves to kick me out.” At one public meeting, a white-haired man – one of the crustier opposing voices – tripped and fell, and Khalil rushed across the room, thinking he might need medical assistance. He was fine, and the meeting went on. Khalil gave a speech, introducing herself as a mother. “We are your friends, we are your neighbours – I could be your doctor,” Khalil said. “I want my kids to feel like they’re welcomed. I want my kids to feel proud of the people that we have chosen to surround them with.” The old man she had just rushed to help piped up: “Move to an appropriate place!” Chaudry said non-Muslims in Basking Ridge would often pull him aside, to quietly confide that they were ashamed about what was happening to the town. He hoped that, at some point, the forces of conciliation would make themselves heard. Instead, the tenor of the debate only grew more hysterical. It reached its climax when a particularly vociferous mosque opponent named Nick Xu, a Chinese-American volunteer for Trump’s campaign, gave a speech claiming that the Islamic Society’s lawsuit was part of a “systematic plot” to wage war through the courts. “If you google ‘Islamic Lawfare’,” he said, “you’re going to see dozens, dozens of these kind of lawsuits.” In response to Xu, a man named James Rickey – a member of one of the town’s old Scots-Irish families – came to his feet, full of righteous contempt. “The tone that has been used here tonight is disgraceful,” Rickey said. “We’re all human beings. We should respect each other.” With that, and without debate, the town committee grimly voted to approve the settlement, agreeing to reverse the planning board’s rejection while paying the Islamic Society $3.5m. John Carpenter was the lone dissenter. The townspeople again raised a loud clamour. “We understand your frustration,” the mayor told them. “But this is what we are required to do by federal law.” A few weeks later, the Islamic Society celebrated the end of the holy month of Ramadan beneath a white tent set up next to a practice green at the Basking Ridge Country Club. Chaudry addressed the service while standing next to a poster-sized rendering of the mosque. “As many of you know,” he said, “we now have – alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah – a settlement with the township, which calls for us to submit a revised plan, and I am honoured to tell you that at 4.49pm yesterday I received from our engineers the plan that we intend to submit tomorrow, inshallah. Many people thought this was impossible. As Nelson Mandela said once, things seem impossible until they are done.” For the holiday, Chaudry had secured the services of a guest imam who spoke of the “constant shockwave” that Trump’s election had sent through the Muslim community in America. When the prayers were finished, Chaudry stood at the front of the tent and accepted congratulations from members of his congregation. “People said, why are we doing this here, where people don’t like us?” he told one. “I say, where can you go where people like you?” * * * It is not yet clear what the Trump presidency will mean for the Justice Department’s policy on mosque disputes. Eric Rassbach, an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, an anti-discrimination advocacy group, told me that so far the department “seems to be staying the course”. Still, ideological shifts take time to assert themselves within government bureaucracies, and Tom Perez said there is “every reason to be concerned” about the Justice Department’s direction. “Donald Trump certainly adds gas to the fire,” he said. “That will bring additional pressure to bear on the DOJ to do the wrong thing.” Chaudry no longer considered himself a Republican, for obvious reasons, but he was still guarded in his criticism of Trump. All summer, while the president vacationed nearby, a few self-proclaimed members of the resistance would protest on a street corner in Bedminster. Chaudry never participated. Instead, he organised interfaith prayer services, and tried to be a moderating force. When an alleged Islamic State supporter from New Jersey killed eight people with a truck on a Manhattan bike path in October, Chaudry hastened to arrange a reassuring visit of police officials to a mosque near the suspect’s home, which was receiving death threats. Meanwhile, every time Trump tweeted something horrible about Muslims, Chaudry would wearily draw up a public statement. “With him, you can never tell what he’s going to say,” he said. Under the terms of the Islamic Society’s settlement, the mosque was granted a rehearing before the planning board in August, at which “no commentary regarding Islam or Muslims” was to be considered. The procedure was a mere formality, and the mosque was approved. Lori Caratzola, who recently moved out of Basking Ridge, was not present for the vote. She did not respond to interview requests; neither did the Thomas More Law Center, the rightwing group that came to her aid in the Islamic Society’s lawsuit. With the federal case concluded, the issue of the subpoenas to private citizens is now moot. But the Thomas More Law Center has continued to file lawsuits on the behalf of other mosque opponents, including neighbour Loretta Quick, claiming that their elected representatives had “colluded with ISBR’s ‘Civilization Jihad’”. Another lawsuit, brought by a former member of the planning board, is challenging the mosque’s approval on procedural grounds. “It’s far from over,” Zubulake told me. “We’re going to keep fighting it to the bitter end.” While continuing to fight on the legal front, Chaudry is now raising funds – much of the settlement went to pay his lawyers, who are in turn donating the money to charity – while also going through the permitting process. He hopes to demolish the house soon, so he can hold a groundbreaking ceremony some time in 2018. One person who won’t be attending is the current town mayor, John Carpenter. He promptly appointed Nick Xu – the “Islamic lawfare” guy – to a pair of township boards. Chaudry hopes, though, that constructing the mosque will pave the way for reconciliation with those opponents who are willing to listen. “I am a firm believer – perhaps I am more of an optimist than many people – but I feel that in human nature, when something has been done, people are more willing to accept it,” Chaudry said. “They will find that their fears were baseless.” He has a strong – religious – faith in the notion that differences among people are best overcome through cultural interchange. “Mosques are places where you build those bridges,” he said. A recent Cato Institute survey found that 47% of all Republicans – and a quarter of Americans overall – would support a ban on building new mosques in their communities. Yet Islamophobia, like all prejudices, is rooted in ignorance, and Chaudry felt that if people could just see the inside of a mosque, they would lose their apprehension. “We want to dispel some of these misperceptions that exist,” he said. In addition to his many other activities, Chaudry often teaches about Islam, lecturing at venues ranging from universities to the New Jersey state police academy. Last autumn, he offered a continuing education course to some senior citizens, and he invited me to a culminating event, a tour of a large mosque in the town of South Brunswick. The retirees shuffled across the carpeted floor, awkward and shoeless, as the midday prayer began. The imam, Hamad Ahmad Chebli, welcomed what he called “60 messengers”. After the service, in an adjoining room, Chaudry and the imam took questions. Why were the women and men separated for prayers? Does the Qur’an prohibit women from driving? What’s the deal with sharia, and is it practiced in America? They answered each query patiently, providing some basic theology with a leavening dash of humour. A warm feeling of fellowship inflated like a soap bubble. “I live nearby, and I’ve driven by this Islamic Society any number of times,” said one woman. “And I always wondered, what’s going on in there?” “Making Islamic bombs!” Chebli interjected, eliciting a big laugh. “What we’re doing,” she went on, “is we’re dispelling the mystery.” “There was a strong feeling in the mosque, a feeling of peace,” said an elderly Jewish man. “I was crying, because there was this beauty to all of it.” “I think occasions like this really help us all to understand what Islam and being a Muslim is all about,” said another woman. “And my biggest concern right now is what is happening to this country with our current president.” There was a loud groan of disapproval. “I didn’t mean to bring politics into it … ” “Then why are you?” shouted another audience member. The bubble was punctured. “America does not belong to any president,” the imam said. “America does not belong to any religion. This is our country.” Chaudry sought to defuse the sudden tension. He said he looked forward to welcoming more groups to visit, and learn, in Liberty Corner. “Inshallah,” he said, “when we have our own mosque.” All photographs by Fred R Conrad • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/feb/09/roganic-marylebone-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-09T13:00:04Z","webTitle":"Roganic, London W1: ‘Already a place for chefs, bloggers and blaggers’  – restaurant review | Grace Dent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/09/roganic-marylebone-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/09/roganic-marylebone-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent","fields":{"headline":"Roganic, London W1: ‘Already a place for chefs, bloggers and blaggers’  – restaurant review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On entering Roganic, it was clear I needed a new false name for booking tables. “Mitford”, after my beloved Nancy (not her Hitler-loving fruitcake sister Unity) had lasted exactly four critical ambushes before being sussed and spread across hospitality’s intelligence network. Actually, that makes the chef grapevine sound far too chic and diligent. In reality, it’s just chefs lying about at 3am in mildewed underpants screaming, “That bitch!” into WhatsApp group chats. But I live for this mayhem. I pitched up at Roganic on a Saturday night to find the staff suspiciously alert, with several of them huddled behind reception like the cast of Meerkat Manor sensing a Kalahari thunderstorm. Well played: it’s their job to find stuff like this out, after all. This restaurant, which is both the Second Coming of a much rhapsodised former pop-up and a spin-off of Michelin-bestowed Cumbrian mecca L’Enclume, opened just a month ago. Due to chef/owner Simon Rogan’s rep as a scene leader and striver for high standards, it’s already one of those places that chefs, writers, bloggers, blaggers and miscellaneous food chunterers are expressing vocal intention to visit in 2018. They yearn, they’ll tell you, to experience Rogan’s seaweed custard with caviar, his millet pudding laced with Stichelton and his scallop with gooseberry. Well, that’s what they’ll say. My industry, like this column, thrives on hot air. My experience of reviewing ornate, long-haul, multi-course, Michelin-teasing, 50 Best-flirting dining is that few people truly want to spend their free time in them. Oh, they claim to, but that’s a lie. It’s not uncommon in any 14-course tasting journey to glance at the gargantuan task ahead and feel a bit like Terry Waite during his extended Lebanese sojourn: your captors are treating you reasonably, but you’d rather be home with a pleasant stew. Not that Roganic’s staff are not joyous; in fact, they’re so affable, I’d let several of them move into my house. Or that the opening canape of a teensy preserved raspberry tart was not utterly gorgeous: it tasted just like a Robertson’s jam tart. A small, croquettish bundle of pork with eel blobbed with sweet hay cream was a delight, similar to a bunny rabbit version at Fera, Rogan’s previous joint in the capital. That was followed by a neat, palm-sized parcel of pickled kohlrabi stuffed with raw mackerel and wreathed with lovage. All faultless. Still, after an hour, we still had 10 courses ahead, a task that felt all the more arduous because Blandford Street attracts some of the biggest tosspots in London. It has gorgeous restaurants – Jikoni, Carousel, Trishna and so on – but terrible people painted into a corner of blandness by their own spare cash. This isn’t the eccentric opulence of Chelsea, geed up by Russian and old British money, or Shoreditch, still riding on lost 1990s notions of hipness. This is Marylebone, where rich Harley Street neurologists eat dinner like Trappist monks, then go home to buy Mark Knopfler tickets. Dinner has highs and lows, but then Rogan’s food is always a deeply subjective experience. It excites and then, minutes later, repulses. Perhaps that’s the point. A ramekin filled with an inch of cold, set seaweed custard appears. What fresh hell? But then a plate of salt-baked celeriac with spindly enoki mushrooms in puddles of whey is fantastic. (I spend the next day researching enoki, and conclude that celeriac with enoki should be on every vegan menu by 2019.) A porridge of millet thick with blue cheese and a clump of bone marrow comes in a mercifully tiny portion. But a small plate of butter-poached halibut with brassicas turns out to be quite wonderful. Oddly for someone who lacks a sweet tooth, puddings were the stars of the show for me. A mini caramelised douglas fir tarte tatin was a bewildering work of apple architecture: what felt like a million tiny, dainty slivers somehow arranged into a coherent, edible artwork. A notably unpretty gathering of burnt milk ice-cream with a jus of blackcurrant resembled something unsightly that you might find on a pavement, but had us in raptures over its depth of fruity sweetness. It felt churlish to eat it, rather than put it in a glass box and charge a fee to behold it. That said, by this point it was 11pm. I’ve had meaningful romances shorter than this dinner. By midnight, they were still slinging us juniper fudge, quince tart and snaps made of dandelion seeds. And bread and tea bags to take home for breakfast the next morning. At least that gave me a tagline for a future Roganic PR push: “Spend all night with Simon Rogan’s gang. Wake up with a bun in your oven.” • Roganic 5-7 Blandford Street, London W1, 020-337 06260.

It’s his seventh opera, only one of which – Julie, based on Strindberg’s Miss Julie – has so far been staged in the UK. This one was jointly commissioned by the Aix-en-Provence festival and the Monnaie in Brussels, and the recording comes from the Belgian performances last year, which followed the Aix premiere. The libretto by Joel Pommerat is adapted from his own play, which in turn, of course, stems from Carlo Collodi’s 19th-century children’s novel about the adventures of the wilful boy carved from a tree trunk, who eventually learns the value of telling the truth. Whatever Boesmans says, though, it’s not obvious that this is a work for children – with over two hours’ music and a very dark take on Pinocchio’s experiences, it’s as much a morality tale for adults as for the young, and a distinctly more challenging piece than Jonathan Dove’s “family” opera on the same subject that Opera North premiered 10 years ago. Boesmans and Pommerat present the narrative as a series of loosely connected scenes, framed as a show put on by an itinerant troupe of circus performers, whose ringmaster also provides the linking narration. It’s distinctly episodic and the characterisation is paper thin, so that it’s hard to feel for the characters, and anyone who knows the original story is likely to get much more from the opera than those coming to it for the first time. Much of Boesmans’ gleefully time-travelling score, though, is a delight – nimble and imaginatively coloured, slipping effortlessly between styles – and it emerges vividly in this performance, with Chloé Briot very sparky as the errant marionette who has to learn how to be human. Stéphane Degout is outstanding as the narrator and ringmaster, a bit of a grownup Pinocchio himself, and Vincent Le Texier is the father with whom the boy is eventually reconciled. It’s certainly a much more rewarding experience than Great Scott, the latest stage work by Jake Heggie to appear on disc. Warner Classics doesn’t exactly specialise in new music, and this recording, taken from performances in Dallas in 2015, surely appears on its Erato label only because the title role of Arden Scott, a prima donna intent on reviving a long-lost bel canto opera, was written as a vehicle for Joyce DiDonato. There are plenty of cutesy operatic jokes in the text and lots of pastiche in the score – everything from Rossini to Richard Strauss – but very little real music."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/07/amnesty-calls-for-immediate-release-of-jordi-sanchez-jailed-catalan-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T12:03:20Z","webTitle":"Amnesty calls for immediate release of jailed Catalan leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/07/amnesty-calls-for-immediate-release-of-jordi-sanchez-jailed-catalan-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/07/amnesty-calls-for-immediate-release-of-jordi-sanchez-jailed-catalan-leader","fields":{"headline":"Amnesty calls for immediate release of jailed Catalan leader","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Amnesty International has called for the immediate release of a Catalan pro-independence leader who has been in prison for almost four months, saying his continuing detention without charge is excessive and disproportionate. Jordi Sànchez, the former president of the influential grassroots Catalan National Assembly (ANC), has been in custody since mid-October, when he and another civil society group leader, Jordi Cuixart, were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged sedition in the run-up to the regional independence referendum a fortnight earlier. The pair have been accused of using huge demonstrations to try to stop Spanish police officers from following a judge’s orders to halt the referendum, which had already been suspended by the country’s constitutional court. A Spanish supreme court judge on Tuesday refused a request to free Sànchez, who is also an MP for the Together for Catalonia party of the deposed Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont. Judge Pablo Llarena said he would not release the politician on the grounds that he could once again try to push for unilateral Catalan independence, adding that Sànchez had played a major role in “the mass demonstrations that favoured a social uprising”. Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty’s Europe director, said that while Llarena could have used the opportunity to release Sànchez, he had instead aggravated an existing injustice. “The extension of Jordi Sànchez’s provisional custody constitutes an excessive and disproportionate restriction on his right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” she said. Van Gulik said the possible rebellion and sedition charges Sànchez and Cuixart faced were unjustified and should be dropped. “Although calling protests to obstruct legitimate police operations can – if proof is produced of their commission – constitute a public order offence, it does not constitute a serious crime such as sedition or rebellion.” The continuing detention of senior Catalan secessionist leaders, including the ousted regional vice-president, Oriol Junqueras, has prompted accusations that the Spanish courts are holding them as political prisoners – a claim denied by both judges and the Spanish government. Last week, Llarena refused to release the former Catalan interior minister, Joaquim Forn. Although Forn had already stepped down as an MP, the judge said he feared the politician could reoffend “given the uncertainty over whether the majority political will is to respect the legal order to achieve the aspiration of independence that [Forn] shares even today”. Lawyers acting for Sànchez, Cuixart and Junqueras have appealed to the United Nations, claiming the men are unlawfully imprisoned. Catalan pro-independence parties retained their parliamentary majority in December’s snap election, which was called by the Spanish government after it sacked Puigdemont’s administration over its unilateral independence drive. Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels in late October, faces arrest on possible charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds the moment he returns to Spain. However, he remains the only candidate for the Catalan presidency and is reported to be exploring the legal and political possibilities of setting up an exiled “Council of the Republic” in Belgium while a government in Barcelona focuses on the day-to-day running of Catalonia. According to the Barcelona-based daily La Vanguardia, Puigdemont plans to establish the council in Brussels on 18 February, while a separate session would see him voted in as Catalan president in the regional parliament three or four days later. Were the latter option to prove difficult, the other pro-independence parties would be offered an alternative candidate from Together for Catalonia. The Spanish government is fiercely opposed to Puigdemont’s return to office and has said a “clean candidate” needs to be put forward to lead the region. It has also said that the emergency legislation that allowed it to take control of Catalonia will remain in force until a new president is sworn in. If no candidate is proposed and approved over the coming weeks, parliament will be dissolved and new elections called."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/feb/07/jorja-smith-review-liquid-room-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T14:24:14Z","webTitle":"Jorja Smith review - smoky new voice in UK soul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/07/jorja-smith-review-liquid-room-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/feb/07/jorja-smith-review-liquid-room-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Jorja Smith review - smoky new voice in UK soul","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘You have to dance with me!” grins Jorja Smith, half pleading, with the only flicker of shyness she has shown all evening. When the bass kicks in, Edinburgh’s unruly, adoring audience need no persuasion. It’s the first night of Smith’s sellout UK tour, two years after she shared her first track on SoundCloud. Since then, the 20-year-old from Walsall has gained heady accolades and celebrity supporters with one EP and a handful of singles. That first song, Blue Lights, written for a school project on post-colonialism in UK grime, sampled Dizzee Rascal’s Sirens and showed a spellbinding talent for sleek, inventive soul. A month later, Drake played it on his Ovo Sound Radio and became one of her loudest champions. Shortlisted for the BBC’s Sound of 2017 award, winner of the Brits critics’ choice award in December, and due to feature on Kendrick Lamar’s soundtrack for Marvel’s Black Panther, Smith’s ascension to pop stardom has been secured by her strong sense of self. The stage is dressed like a living room, lit in warm pinks by draped lampshades, Smith conjuring intimacy. Tonight’s fans are word-perfect to tracks released on YouTube in Smith’s homemade videos, and respond so noisily that she occasionally holds a finger to her lips to quieten the applause. Still, they can’t drown out Smith’s staggering voice. Smoky, honeyed and so powerful it could hold its own against a Super Bowl-sized brass band, she moves through pop, funk, garage and soul with ease. On Don’t Watch Me Cry, she hits eye-watering highs with serenity, and as the final notes fade the room is held transfixed, the spell only broken when she cackles, beaming: “Why are you all so quiet?” She breathlessly promises a debut album, dotting new songs through the set. Some lack the inventive sparkle with which she made her name, but a mesmerising cover of Frank Ocean’s heartbreaking Lost and a thunderous rendition of Let Me Down, her latest single with Stormzy, show a sensibility for stadium-filling balladry. Closing track On My Mind, a kooky, throwback UK garage banger with producer Preditah, is received like an old classic and she’s visibly delighted.

The clonal freshwater crayfish is regarded as an invasive species which threatens endemic wild species, but its success may help scientists better understand how cancer spreads. Researchers have been surprised by the marbled crayfish’s reproductive success and remarkable adaptability, with genetically identical crayfish now thriving in the wild in diverse habitats from subtropical Madagascar to Sweden, Japan and German cities including Hanover and Heidelberg. Scientists from the German Cancer Research Center used genome sequencing and comparative studies of individual animals to prove that the all-female offspring of the marbled crayfish are genetically identical, in a study published in Nature, Ecology &amp; Evolution. Previous genetic studies have shown that the marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) recently split from the slough crayfish (Procambarus fallax), found in the wild in Everglades national park in Florida. The new species was first identified in a German aquarium in 1995 but has since spread around the world – with a helping hand from humans. “It was known that the crayfish can establish itself in the wild after releases from the aquarium,” said Frank Lyko of the German Cancer Research Center. “But the news was that it can spread so rapidly and massively.” In another part of the study, a scientist in Madagascar examined how well the crayfish is able to multiply in the wild via parthenogenesis, a natural form of asexual reproduction. The crayfish, now banned in the European Union, has been distributed by the aquarium trade and has rapidly spread across Madagascar in less than a decade because of its popularity as a cheap source of protein for humans. According to Lyko, the marbled crayfish could out-compete seven native crayfish. But researchers hope that the adaptability of the clonal crayfish may also shed light on how cancer tumours adapt to their environment by developing resistance against drug treatments, for instance. The team led by Lyko wants to look more closely at how clonal evolution occurs in both marbled crayfish and tumours. “Epigenetic mechanisms”, which work like switches turning genes on or off, enable both the crayfish and tumours to adapt to a wide variety of habitats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/09/padman-review-r-balki-arunachalam-muruganantham-sanitary-pads","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-09T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Pad Man review – heartfelt portrait of a feminine hygiene pioneer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/09/padman-review-r-balki-arunachalam-muruganantham-sanitary-pads","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/09/padman-review-r-balki-arunachalam-muruganantham-sanitary-pads","fields":{"headline":"Pad Man review – heartfelt portrait of a feminine hygiene pioneer","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This good-natured, big-hearted film from India puts a romantic topspin on a true story.

Twenty years ago, Arunachalam Muruganantham was a metalworker who thought it lamentable that his wife Shanthi and all the women in his community had to rely on dirty rags when they got their periods because sanitary pads were absurdly overpriced. So he did something about it, developing a low-cost machine for making the pads and evangelising for their use all across the country, instituting a revolution in feminine hygiene, ending the toxic masculine culture of silence and disapproval and introducing a vernacular culture of social entrepreneurship.

There are, as ever, gems to be found, though I must confess to finding a slight lack of tonal variety this year, and a couple of films had a worrying tendency to rely on a single, casually conceived act of violence to beat the audience into submission. Violence-equals-real is a cliche, and a problem with the writing. At any rate, my favourite piece was the excellent Work, written and directed by Aneil Karia, starring Jasmine Breinburg as Jess, a young dancer who battles through her day, being menaced, patronised and abused by almost everyone she meets. Everything is hard work, both her life and the jobs she does to make ends meet, and yet somehow she absorbs the anger and frustration and channels it – enigmatically – into the dance routine itself. This is her real work as an artist. I also enjoyed the animation Poles Apart, by Paloma Baeza, about a polar bear who comes across a goofy, friendly Canadian grizzly. It had a touch of Wes Anderson. Some films made an honourable attempt to represent the refugee experience: Vika Evdokimenko’s Aamir and Mahdi Fleifel’s A Drowning Man. Often, it feels as if it’s film-makers rather than TV news journalists who are most alive to the refugee issue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/feb/08/the-1517-to-paris-review-clint-eastwood-france-train-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-08T14:00:29Z","webTitle":"The 15:17 to Paris review – Clint Eastwood derails a tale of real-life terror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/08/the-1517-to-paris-review-clint-eastwood-france-train-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/feb/08/the-1517-to-paris-review-clint-eastwood-france-train-attack","fields":{"headline":"The 15:17 to Paris review – Clint Eastwood derails a tale of real-life terror","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The authentic courage of three American heroes who foiled a terrorist attack has been anti-alchemised by Clint Eastwood into a strangely boring, dramatically inert film in which the main characters remain as opaque and unreadable as sphinxes to the very last. But there is some interest in this film nonetheless because of the experimental chutzpah Eastwood has showed in using – not Chris Hemsworth, not Bradley Cooper, not Trevante Rhodes – but the three actual guys stolidly playing themselves. (The attacker, one Ayoub El-Khazzani, being now incarcerated, was not available for filming.) The resulting film looks bizarrely like an essay in take-it-or-leave-it social realist grit or radical, non-professional clunkiness, as if before filming Clint watched Ken Loach’s I, Daniel Blake and Tommy Wiseau’s The Room and couldn’t decide which one he liked more. The men themselves were Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler; two were from the US military, trained in combat and first aid, and at least one had a strong Christian faith. While backpacking in 2015, the three tackled a heavily armed jihadist terrorist on a train from Amsterdam to Paris – saving dozens of lives. There also happened to be a British guy there whose contribution, following the tradition of Hollywood war movies, has pretty much been cheerfully ignored. The effect of realness in this film is a strange one. The three are bad at acting, of course, but not as bad as all that, and a basic level of woodenness is important for underscoring the film’s genuine quality, because how disconcerting would it be if they all turned out to be talented thespians, a trio of Benedict Cumberbatches? The movie starts with the tense initial situation aboard the train and then – exasperatingly – keeps cutting back to the three men’s dull and diffidently directed backstories, their unhappy and unsatisfactory childhoods, their early lives in the forces, and then their quite excruciatingly boring backpacking holiday, which we all have to live through in real time before they climb aboard the 15:17 to Paris and we reach the main event. Except that, weirdly, the attack is not the main event. That comes one step later when Eastwood, with almost avant garde cheek, uses actual footage of French President François Hollande presenting the three men with the Légion d’honneur and we seamlessly cut away to the actors playing their adoring mothers and relatives. Even here, though, he can’t resist slathering syrupy music on the soundtrack to make sure we realise that it’s an emotional moment. The attack itself is robustly and forthrightly shot, without the nerve-twisting horror of Paul Greengrass’s 9/11 movie United 93, it is true, but that was a different situation. It is all over pretty quickly. It seems almost anticlimactic and detached. Perhaps that is faithful to the experience itself. But, intentionally or not, the real meat of the film is that mind-bendingly boring holiday: endless beers, endless coffees, endless selfies. No tension between the guys. No real connection either. They look as if they don’t know each other all that well. But then again, that is probably what real friends actually look like, without artificially scripted filmic moments to denote friendship. Eastwood and his screenwriter Dorothy Blyskal, who has adapted the three men’s book about the event, have rigorously avoided any premonitions or creepy omens, although Spencer talks about God having a purpose to his life. No, we just trudge through the vacation, like being forced to look at someone else’s photos. It is dull. But perhaps that’s what life is – dull. Especially compared to a sudden burst of frenetic, heroic activity on a train when you’re faced with a religious murderer and your training kicks in. As for Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler, my admiration for them knows no bounds. But their real presence in the film? It reminded of the Player in Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead who said he once hanged someone for real on stage and a baffled audience just took it for bad acting. A documentary by Eastwood might have served everyone better. But François Hollande might be in line for a special reality Oscar for that climactic movie speech he didn’t realise he was giving."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/feb/07/great-britian-sprinter-nigel-levine-suspended-after-failing-a-drugs-test-athletics","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T10:47:10Z","webTitle":"Great Britain sprinter Nigel Levine suspended after failing drug test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/07/great-britian-sprinter-nigel-levine-suspended-after-failing-a-drugs-test-athletics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/feb/07/great-britian-sprinter-nigel-levine-suspended-after-failing-a-drugs-test-athletics","fields":{"headline":"Great Britain sprinter Nigel Levine suspended after failing drug test","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The sprinter Nigel Levine, who has been an integral part of Great Britain’s 4x400m relay squad for nearly a decade, has been provisionally suspended after failing a drug test. Levine, who has won nine world and European championship medals, was reported to have tested positive for clenbuterol before Christmas. The drug is used to help asthma sufferers but it is on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s banned list because it also helps burn fat, builds muscle, and improves athletic performance. The 28-year-old has the right to respond to the charge but if found guilty could receive a four-year ban. Levine had been hoping to make a comeback after suffering career-threatening injuries last year when he was involved in a motorcycle accident with his Great Britain team-mate James Ellington during a training camp in Tenerife. Many in the sport suspected Levine would not fully recover from his injuries, which included a fractured pelvis. He was back running before his positive test, dividing his time between an elite squad at Loughborough University and a group trained by Linford Christie, although the former British champion is no longer his primary coach. A ban for clenbuterol was given to the cyclist Alberto Contador, who was suspended for two years after testing positive at the 2010 Tour de France. The Spaniard claimed it was caused by a contaminated food supplement but he was stripped of the Tour title as well as his victory in the 2011 Giro d’Italia. UK Athletics said: “Nigel Levine has been provisionally suspended from participating in athletics after being charged with having committed an anti-doping rule violation. The individual now has the opportunity to respond to the charge, including the right to a full hearing of the case.” Levine, who has won gold and silver 4x400m relay medals at the European championships and three 4x400m world indoor championships relay medals, is yet to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/feb/07/inquiry-says-letters-to-john-worboys-victims-lacked-clarity","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T11:01:57Z","webTitle":"Inquiry says letters to John Worboys' victims 'lacked clarity'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/07/inquiry-says-letters-to-john-worboys-victims-lacked-clarity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/feb/07/inquiry-says-letters-to-john-worboys-victims-lacked-clarity","fields":{"headline":"Inquiry says letters to John Worboys' victims 'lacked clarity'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Some letters sent to victims of the black-cab rapist, John Worboys, informing them of his impending release, spelled their names wrong and failed to explain the Parole Board’s decision in a way that was readily understandable, an official inquiry has concluded. The report by Dame Glenys Stacey on the operation of the victim contact scheme in the Worboys case also says some victims who wanted to make a personal statement to the Parole Board were not given enough time and were sent letters that “lacked clarity and urgency”. Stacey confirmed that the majority of Worboys’ victims who were not covered by the contact scheme learned of the decision to release him from the media. “All who spoke to us described their shock and distress. They had not felt prepared for this outcome,” she said. The report, ordered by the justice secretary, David Gauke, comes as the high court decides whether to give the go-ahead for a full judicial review hearing of the circumstances in which Worboys’ release was decided. The challenge has been brought by two victims and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. Worboys was ordered by the judges to be brought to the court in person after a videolink failed on Tuesday. One of the judges, Sir Brian Leveson, apologised to victims in the court for Worboys’ presence. Stacey’s report says that “in the main, the national probation service did as required by the victim contact scheme”. Only four of the 12 victims whose attacks resulted in convictions opted into the victim contact scheme, her inquiry found. The probation service lost contact with one of them, and there was a period between 2010 and 2012 when contact with the other three lapsed. “The quality of correspondence was poor. Some letters contained errors in victims’ names and addresses, and the messages were not conveyed clearly. This was particularly significant at the time when the women had the opportunity to contribute their views to the parole hearing,” the report says. Stacey said the probation service took the well-intentioned step of trying to contact women who had not opted into the scheme: “Unfortunately, however, there was not enough time before the hearing for women to receive the letters, absorb the information and respond. “What is more, the style and content of the letters lacked clarity and urgency. One woman who had engaged with the scheme from the start did make a victim personal statement to the Parole Board. Others who we interviewed were adamant that they would have wanted to do so, had they had the opportunity.” She reports that by the time the Parole Board hearing took place, the five women who were in the victim contact scheme were notified by email, letter or telephone depending on their pre-expressed preferences. “Inevitably, they each received the news at different times, and regrettably the news broke in the press before some had received and read the notification. Those women not in contact with the scheme – the majority – learned of the decision through the media.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/feb/07/gundog-review-royal-court-london-vicky-featherstone-simon-longman","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T23:59:15Z","webTitle":"Gundog review – a family fights to survive in mud-spattered drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/07/gundog-review-royal-court-london-vicky-featherstone-simon-longman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/feb/07/gundog-review-royal-court-london-vicky-featherstone-simon-longman","fields":{"headline":"Gundog review – a family fights to survive in mud-spattered drama","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nature is cruel in Simon Longman’s play, which is set on a remote farm. Lambs are born dead, disease strikes the flock and the old sheepdog lies dying just as her mother and grandmother did before her. The world keeps turning and it’s nobody’s fault. Anna (Rochenda Sandall), her sister Becky (Ria Zmitrowicz) and her brother Ben (Alex Austin) are in crisis. Their mother has died, leaving the rest of the family adrift. Their grandfather, Mick (Alan Williams), is demented, often stuck in the past, and their dad wanders the dilapidated farm like a spectre. Longman’s distinctive debut at the Royal Court’s Theatre Upstairs is set somewhere in the UK, but it feels as if it might be set in outer space, so little contact do the family have with the outside world. The stage tingles with loneliness in Vicky Featherstone’s bleakly beautiful, delicately acted production, which is designed by Chloe Lamford with so much mud that at first glimpse you might mistakenly think it’s set in the first world war’s trenches. There is a war going on here, a war for survival, and into the middle of it wanders Guy (Alec Secareanu), a guilt-ridden foreigner looking for a quiet place. But what happens when the quiet turns to a roar inside your head? Longman plays with the past and present and the unchanging cycles that tie the family to the land. This is a compelling, unforgiving glimpse into rural life, and one in which there is not a single fluffy, gambolling lamb in sight. At the Royal Court, London, until 10 March.

The case is brought by a community group from the tiny Hunter Valley village of Wollar, which it says has been devastated by the development and gradual expansion of the Wilpinjong coalmine over the past decade. Mine owner Peabody Energy won approval last April to further expand the mine, which sits between the towns of Mudgee and Denman, to extend its life by seven years to 2033. In a case starting on Thursday, the Wollar Progress Association will argue the decision was unlawful as it did not properly consider the impact of the increased greenhouse gas emissions, including “downstream” emissions when the coal is burned in NSW and overseas power plants. It says the state also did not look at whether the extension was in step with state and national climate change policies and targets, including Australia’s commitment under the 2015 Paris agreement to keep warming below 2C. Lawyer David Morris, from the Environmental Defenders Office NSW, said the association would argue 2007 legislation covering extractive industries was explicitly designed to ensure these two points were considered before decisions were made on whether projects could go ahead. “What is the point of commitments and targets if they are not factored into and reflected in decisions about projects which contribute to emissions?” he said. “We say it is a landmark case. When you think about a coalmine in 2017, it is difficult to think of a more important consideration than its contribution to climate change.” The secretary of the Wollar Progress Association, Bev Smiles, said the mine had gradually grown from approval in 2006 to mine 9.5m tonnes a year to the current 13m tonnes. She said the proposed expansion would bring it to within 1.5 kilometres of the village. She said many landholders had sold to the company, and the population had fallen from about 300 to 70. “The impact from noise, dust and blasting has been extreme,” she said. “What happens under government processes is we are left to our own devices up against people who have a lot more resources than we have, and the treatment of people over time by this company has been quite disgraceful.” A spokeswoman for Peabody Energy said the company had been through a comprehensive process and the case related to the approval process by the state’s Planning Assessment Commission, not the merits of the extension project. She said the mine generated jobs and invested in the Mudgee region, employing 413 people. Peabody Energy is also applying for an exploration licence over more than 1,600 hectares of land east of Wollar. The case starts in the land and environment court on Thursday. The planning minister, Anthony Roberts, declined to comment while the issue was before the court. Separately, Smiles and two others will be in Mudgee local court on Friday facing charges relating to a protest at the mine last April. While the case is believed to be the first time a mine approval has been been contested over its climate impact under the 2007 NSW law, at least one decision has been challenged on similar grounds under federal legislation. In 2016, the federal court dismissed a case brought by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) against the federal government’s approval of Adani’s Carmichael mega-coalmine. The ACF argued the mine’s approval was inconsistent with the country’s obligations to protect the world heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef. The court found the then environment minister Greg Hunt had considered the impact of the emissions from burning the coal on the reef, and that Australia had latitude under the World Heritage Convention as to how it carried out its obligations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/12/black-panther-how-superhero-film-can-inspire-indigenous-and-african-youth","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-11T17:00:09Z","webTitle":"Black Panther: how superhero film can inspire Indigenous and African youth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/12/black-panther-how-superhero-film-can-inspire-indigenous-and-african-youth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/12/black-panther-how-superhero-film-can-inspire-indigenous-and-african-youth","fields":{"headline":"Black Panther: how superhero film can inspire Indigenous and African youth","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The last thing Shareena Clanton expected when she decided to organise a free screening of superhero blockbuster Black Panther for Melbourne’s Indigenous and African youth was for Marvel to get involved. When Clanton, an actor best known for her role as Doreen in the Foxtel drama, Wentworth, saw Black Panther, she knew this was something different. It wasn’t just that the director, Ryan Coogler, and the majority of the cast were black – something rare enough on screen as it is, let alone in a superhero film. Nor was it simply that the story focused on black characters in powerful roles, telling a story with them at the centre. “The fact that this film culminates with a celebration of beautiful strength and black beauty and black power is everything,” Clanton says. “It’s a welcome advancement in our industry.” Clanton was keen to get as many kids of Indigenous Australian and African heritage along to see the film in her current hometown of Melbourne as she could. Inspired by the charitable actions of Hollywood stars such as Octavia Spencer, but without any financial capacity of her own to fund a screening – or, indeed, any experience in events management or fundraising – Clanton decided to start a GoFundMe page to generate some community support for the event. “I had no idea what I was doing,” she tells Guardian Australia, laughing. She was nevertheless propelled by the firm belief that it is important for young black kids to see themselves represented in the stories they see on screen. “When I was growing up it was still predominantly white shows through the Australian media,” she says. Seeing actors such as Deborah Mailman on television was revelatory for her. “She was one of the first black people I would see on TV – an Indigenous woman who looked like me.” Because there were so few Indigenous faces on TV, much of her inspiration came from the black American faces in films and sitcoms such as The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. “I think we don’t see ourselves often represented in powerful positions, especially as people of colour, often we’re relegated to the sidelines as supporting or expositional narratives,” Clanton says. “I think the paradigm is shifting but it’s not progressing fast enough. And I think that this film eradicates white-centric narratives entirely.” Clanton said she cried when a publicist from the film’s production company Marvel called her to say they would provide funds to support the first screening so that it was cost-neutral. With that initial support, she would potentially be able to host multiple screenings, and she plans to use the funds raised online to do just that. Marvel would not comment on the nature of the support they were providing, only to confirm that they had come across Clanton’s GoFundMe page and were able to facilitate a screening for her. “There’s an endless discussion of inclusivity and diversification, and I think on a societal level we throw the word diversity around ... without actively laying down the foundation, challenging structures,” Clanton says. “I’m hoping that our youth are reminded to stand strong in their truth, and unwavering and unapologetic in their own fire and courage.” For Clanton, the recent media beat-up over youth crime in Melbourne only added fuel to that fire. “We already know that there’s a huge amount of vilification within the mainstream media [of black kids] and they are demonised as a result,” she says. “What I’m trying to endorse here is something incredibly positive. Who knows, we might be able to inspire the next superhero film writer, the next director or another actor who sees themselves up there and goes, yeah, that is possible. Now you’ve shown me that it’s possible.” In order to fill the screenings, she has reached out to Melbourne-based community groups and youth-focused organisations and is still taking expressions of interest through the fundraising page. “It’s about being able to see yourself in a position where despite the obstacles, despite the atrocities that you may face, despite the losses, that you are able to overcome.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/06/stock-markest-carnage-ftse-london-europe-falls-plunge","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T15:10:32Z","webTitle":"FTSE and European stock markets fall after US and Asia rout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/stock-markest-carnage-ftse-london-europe-falls-plunge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/06/stock-markest-carnage-ftse-london-europe-falls-plunge","fields":{"headline":"FTSE and European stock markets fall after US and Asia rout","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fears of another plunge in Wall Street shares proved unfounded on Tuesday after the Dow Jones shrugged off an initial 500-point drop to post early gains. It was a volatile open session as shares fell further into the red before investors regained their nerve and the Dow rose 184 points or 0.6% to 24,527. The gains followed the biggest ever one-day points fall on the US index on Monday, when the Dow plunged by 1,175 as traders bet on interest rate rises. The FTSE 100 of Britain’s biggest listed companies initially fell by 255 points or 3.5% to 7,079.41 as the turmoil spread to global markets. The index later recovered some of its losses, and was down 138 points or 1.9% at 7,196. Investors took fright elsewhere in Europe as trading got under way, with markets in Germany, France, Italy and Spain all down by more than 3%. “The stock market open in the UK and Europe looks about as bad as it can get,” said Jasper Lawler, the head of research at online trading firm London Capital Group. “The bloodbath on Wall Street, which was repeated in Asia has seen confidence evaporate in Europe.” Falls in Europe followed a near 5% drop in Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index and a 3.3% fall on Australia’s ASX200. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index declined by as much as 7% during the day’s trade before a slight recovery to close down 4.7%. The Nikkei’s decline of 1,071.84 points was its largest points fall since 2016. Maki Sawada, from the investment research and investor services department at Nomura Securities Co, said stocks were being sold in panic after the Wall Street losses. “The sell-off accelerated in a chain reaction,” she told Kyodo News. Other markets across Asia also suffered losses. South Korea’s Composite Stock Price Index fell by about 3% in morning trade. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index plunged 4.9% while the Shanghai Composite index lost 2.2%. These losses followed the dive in the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday, with investors appearing to react to equity losses and concerns that central banks will soon increase interest rates to rein in inflation. It coincided with the arrival of Jerome Powell as the new chair of the US Federal Reserve. “This was volatility unleashed,” said Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer at at Cresset Wealth. “It’s partially fear of interest rates, partially this new Fed chairman Jerome Powell, partially the market is overvalued relative to fundamentals.” While market fear may not be based in any change in economic fundamentals, in its last meeting under chair Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve indicated it expects inflation pressures to increase through the year. According to projections released in December, officials expect three rate hikes in 2018 – so long as market conditions remain broadly as they are – but some economists believe the central bank could add another increase at its final meeting of the year. If the market falls continue they could prove problematic for Donald Trump who has consistently touted record high stock markets as proof that his presidency is boosting the economy. US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February. However, the White House, responding to the market drop insisted on Monday night that long-term economic fundamentals “remain exceptionally strong”. Vice President Mike Pence characterised the stock market’s plunge as “simply the ebb and flow of our stock market”. On Monday, the FTSE 100 suffered its worst single-day slump since Theresa May called the snap election last April. The index fell 1.3% to 7,345 – having peaked at almost 7,800 last month – extending its longest losing streak since November into a fifth day. “The era of cheap money is ending, and for markets who got addicted to it, it’s undoubtedly bad news,” said Hussein Sayed, the chief market strategist at currency dealer FXTM."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/06/labor-pushes-for-federal-investigation-into-adani","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T06:54:32Z","webTitle":"Labor pushes for federal investigation into Adani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/labor-pushes-for-federal-investigation-into-adani","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/06/labor-pushes-for-federal-investigation-into-adani","fields":{"headline":"Labor pushes for federal investigation into Adani","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labor is pressing the Turnbull government for a federal investigation into Adani, arguing the commonwealth has responsibility for sensitive wetlands contaminated near the Great Barrier Reef after Cyclone Debbie. Guardian Australia revealed last week concerns that Adani submitted an altered laboratory report while appealing a fine for contamination of the Caley Valley wetlands on the Queensland coast. The wetlands were blackened by coal-laden water released from the Abbot Point port after Cyclone Debbie’s torrential rains inundated its coal storage facilities in March 2017. Federal Labor has grabbed last week’s Guardian report as it hardens its public position on Adani’s controversial Queensland mine project. On Tuesday in parliament, pressing for a federal investigation of Adani’s conduct, the shadow environment minister, Tony Burke, pointed out that environmental approvals for the Adani Abbot Point terminal placed conditions on the project, including the downstream impacts on the Caley Valley wetlands. Burke asked, “given the minister has responsibility for the wetlands”, when would the federal government investigate Adani’s conduct and report publicly. But the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, insisted the “primary regulatory authority” for the project was the Queensland government. Frydenberg said Labor’s positioning on Adani was about the looming Batman byelection, where Labor faces a challenge from the Greens to hold the seat in inner-city Melbourne, rather than matters of policy substance. Shadow cabinet discussed options for toughening Labor’s stance on the Adani mine on Monday night and the issue also dominated the Labor left caucus meeting, where differing views were expressed by MPs. Labor is mulling legal options but some in the opposition are concerned a sharp move against the project will trigger a significant backlash about sovereign risk, and have negative implications in both Queensland and other coal regions. Asked on Sky News on Tuesday about the implications if Labor ultimately adopted a position of reversing approvals for the Adani project, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, dead-batted. “We’re getting very far ahead of ourselves,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/feb/07/squinters-review-tim-minchin-and-jacki-weaver-take-the-low-road-in-glib-commuter-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-07T03:35:34Z","webTitle":"Squinters review – Tim Minchin and Jacki Weaver take the low road in glib commuter comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/07/squinters-review-tim-minchin-and-jacki-weaver-take-the-low-road-in-glib-commuter-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/07/squinters-review-tim-minchin-and-jacki-weaver-take-the-low-road-in-glib-commuter-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Squinters review – Tim Minchin and Jacki Weaver take the low road in glib commuter comedy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Remember that old episode of The Simpsons in which Homer enters a magical portal and is transported into the real world? The more I watch the comedian Sam Simmons, the more I come to think perhaps this episode was inspired by actual events – that the 40-year-old performer was a former Springfield resident who snuck through the portal undetected. No comic in Australian history has looked so much like a cartoon character. Despite no shortage of dick jokes in his standup routines, Simmons is a “waist-up comedian”: his face is so animated he doesn’t need the rest of his body. He is, then, a perfect choice for ABC TV’s six-part comedy series, Squinters, in which he plays a flustered George Costanza-like everyman caught behind the wheel during the daily rush-hour commute. The series was co-created by Trent O’Donnell (No Activity) and Adam Zwar (Wilfred, and the Agony series). It’s no surprise then that Squinters is Agony Aunt/Uncle/random commuter stuck in traffic. It’s not just Seinfeldian but reminiscent of a particular Seinfeld episode: 1998’s The Puerto Rican Day, when Jerry and the gang got caught driving through a street parade. The first episode opens with Simmons sharing a vehicle with the beloved Jacki Weaver, who doesn’t appear again until episode four. They play mother and son: embittered middle management type Lukas (Simmons) and Audrey (Weaver), a caustic grump unsympathetic about her child’s troubles at work. She also blames the dog on the back seat for her farts. In another car, Paul (Tim Minchin) is a delivery driver who set up a fake carpool to spend private time with a colleague he fancies, Romi (Andrea Demetriades, seen in Seven Types of Ambiguity and Adam &amp; Eve). Minchin tries his best to make Paul endearing in a bumbling but well-meaning sort of way, but he can’t transcend this fundamentally creepy premise. Other cast members include Damon Herriman as barrister Miles, Mandy McElhinney as time-strapped professional mother Bridget, Wayne Blair (director of The Sapphires and Cleverman) as her potential love interest, and a pair of best friends (Susie Youssef and Rose Matafeo) whose relationship is tested when one of them gets a promotion. Most of the characters work for the fictitious goods dispatch company Kosciuszko, the scope of the show strictly limited to their trips to and from work. A theme emerges regarding the delivery of comedy in politically correct times, when opinionated people (and there are many in this show) believe they have to watch what they say, even in private. The series writers (Zwar, Lally Katz, Sarah Scheller, Adele Vuko, Leon Ford and Ben Crisp) are well aware of a sensitive modern culture, extracting laughs by probing their limitations. Romi comments that Paul’s choice of van colour – white – is creepy: the colour of choice for psychopaths, she says. The driver launches into a passionate defence, exclaiming: “You wouldn’t say that about a black van or a yellow van.” To which Romi responds: “Don’t make this a race thing.” Current sensibilities have even influenced bong-head forklift operator Macca (Justin Rosniak, who played a bandage-wrapped bogan in Down Under). This rough-as-guts fellow acknowledges that yelling crude come-ons to pretty women from passing cars just isn’t what it used to be. “I’d love to get to know you in a non-threatening setting!” he hollers to someone or other, ruefully acknowledge to his driver (Steen Raskopoulos): “You’ve got to be careful not to yell out anything degrading these days.” Consistency with that theme – or any other – is patchy at best, and it’s quite possible the writers were not so much making a point as acting in the interests of career self-preservation. But one wouldn’t want to think too much about it. It’s clear early on that Squinters will be a glib and meandering gabfest that gives its actors plenty of room to flap their arms and squawk. There’s a healthy quota of laughs, with an irregular tempo perhaps explained by how the hodgepodge of directors (O’Donnell, Amanda Brotchie, the Van Vuuren Bros, Kate McCartney and Cate Stewart) divided their work: by character segments rather than episodes (meaning everybody directs every episode). There are occasional ho-hum spots, then: pow – you’re laughing again. Squinters won’t send audiences into paroxysms of delight but it’s good, tightly packed comedy, kept bouncy and fun by a thoroughly appealing cast … including the guy who may or may not be a cartoon character. • Squinters is on ABC TV Wednesdays at 9pm and is available to stream on iView"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/feb/06/chelsea-football-antonio-conte-played-with-fear-future-watford-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-06T00:24:55Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte says Chelsea played with fear at Watford and lack character","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/06/chelsea-football-antonio-conte-played-with-fear-future-watford-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/feb/06/chelsea-football-antonio-conte-played-with-fear-future-watford-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte says Chelsea played with fear at Watford and lack character","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Antonio Conte admitted his team had been undermined by fear and cast doubt over whether some of Chelsea’s players have the strength of character to thrive at a big club after the Premier League champions were thrashed at Watford. A second successive defeat by three goals, the first time Chelsea have endured that ignominy in 22 years, has heaped further pressure on Conte, who is left contemplating publicly whether he will be able turn the team’s fortunes around. The head coach had called for a show of support from the board before this fixture in an attempt to quash suggestions he would leave the club before the end of the season but, after his team played for an hour with 10 men, he saw them succumb to a third defeat in four games. “We played with fear,” he said. “To play football in a great club, it means you must have a personality. It’s simple to play when there is the confidence. Especially in this type of moment, you can see who is [ready to play] for a great club, to play with personality and also to risk something. “In this moment you have to show you have personality. We have to work, to try to work ... but sometimes the work is not enough to change the situation. I try to continue. I try to continue to work, to try to improve different aspects of my players. But our performance was very poor. For sure, I have to take the responsibility. Maybe I made the wrong decision for the starting XI. “I saw a great will, a great desire, in the second half but a lot of confusion too. When we drew level we had to manage the situation, to understand the moment. A great team must do this. Instead, in six minutes, we conceded three more goals. It’s right, everyone must take responsibility: me, the players. But, from the start, I didn’t see confidence. We started with fear and this is the worst situation I can see out on the pitch as a coach.” While the prospect of losing out on the top four has tended to prompt Roman Abramovich to seek a change in the dugout over his ownership of Chelsea, Conte insisted he has no fear over his own position and intends to oversee preparations as normal for next Monday’s visit of West Bromwich Albion. “I’m not worried about my job,” he added. “I work every day and I give 120%. OK? If this is enough, it’s OK. Otherwise the club can take a different decision. But I’m not worried. “ My conscience is clear. I go to sleep without a problem that maybe, maybe, I could do this or that. I try to do everything. If it’s not good, the club can make a different decision. Life goes on. For sure, this is a difficult moment. If we want to find excuses, alibis, we can find everything. Tiredness, injuries... but this is not my way to face the situation, to solve the problem. “The problems you have to solve with work. You don’t win with excuses. In my life, I like to be a winner, and I’m a winner. Now it’s very difficult to predict turning this situation into a positive, but I can promise to work to change it. But, I repeat, the level of our performance was very poor.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
