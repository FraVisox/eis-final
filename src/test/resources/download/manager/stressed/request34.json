But Guillermo del Toro’s sublime fantasy The Shape of Water has attracted so much international critical support that I expect it to triumph (although in fact it could quite plausibly be entered in the musical or comedy category). Luca Guadagnino’s passionate love story Call Me By Your Name will arguably garner support among the Foreign Press Association voters and it is still my personal favourite, though I think Del Toro will come out on top. Having said that: Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, Steven Spielberg’s The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, are all real contenders, considerably more than wild cards. Will win: The Shape of Water Should win: Call Me By Your Name Shoulda been a contender: The Florida Project Best film (musical or comedy) Greta Gerwig’s lovely autobiographical coming-of-ager Lady Bird is such a seductive movie, and has left a stardust trail of happiness everywhere it has played. I absolutely expect it to come away with a Golden Globe for Gerwig and her producers Scott Rudin, Evelyn O’Neill and Eli Bush in the musical or comedy category. But in many ways, a more resounding and satisfying result would be to see the Globe go to Jordan Peele’s liberal racism satire Get Out. It is an incendiary provocation, and the Globes’ musical and comedy section is probably the only way that the awards season will reward it. Otherwise, I, Tonya has got a real shot, and so does James Franco’s much-liked The Disaster Artist, though I think it has been a little overrated. It would have been interesting to see the Globes recognise Edgar Wright’s terrifically entertaining heist caper Baby Driver, at least partly as it is so intensely concerned with music – a robbery carried out in sync with the wheelman’s favourite tunes. Will win: Lady Bird Should win: Get Out Shoulda been a contender: Baby Driver Best actor (drama) Two Brits are the big contenders for this prize, and my suspicion is that the time-honoured respect for Winston Churchill is going to gift it to Gary Oldman for his (excellent) portrayal of Churchill in the darkest hour of 1940, when Hitler was poised across the Channel and the prime minister faced down a policy of appeasement from Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an outrageously enjoyable performance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread – something to compare with Laurence Olivier in Rebecca. He plays the fictional 1950s fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock, who falls for a shy foreign waitress played by Vicky Krieps. It could be that Globes voters think Day-Lewis was already sufficiently rewarded for what many might think of as his ultimate performance, as Abraham Lincoln. Jason Mitchell’s excellent performance in Mudbound deserved a nod here. Will win: Gary Oldman Should win: Daniel Day-Lewis Shoulda been a contender: Jason Mitchell for Mudbound Best actress (drama) This has got to be Frances McDormand’s year. She plays Mildred in Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, who is a compellingly tough, shrewd, disillusioned character – but it’s a performance in which there is room for sympathy, growth, and a third-act pivot away from grim resentment and towards direct action. Mildred is enraged at the failure of the local indolent and bigoted police force to catch the man who raped and murdered her teenage daughter, so she rents three dilapidated billboards to advertise her discontent and this spectacle has an explosive effect. Otherwise, it is possible that Sally Hawkins might get the Globe for her guileless and sympathetic performance in The Shape of Water – and of course there is Meryl Streep, playing Katharine Graham in Steven Spielberg’s The Post. But I would bet that this isn’t Streep’s year, for a performance which, though perfectly watchable, is not breaking new ground. Will win: Frances McDormand Should win: Frances McDormand Shoulda been a contender: Kristen Stewart for Personal Shopper Best actor (musical or comedy) There’s a lively spread in this category: Ansel Elgort for Baby Driver, Daniel Kaluuya for Get Out, James Franco for The Disaster Artist, Hugh Jackman for The Greatest Showman and Steve Carell for Battle of the Sexes. It’s a good list, though I would have preferred to see Baby Driver earn Edgar Wright a nomination in the director category. All in all, this has to be Kaluuya’s year for his excellent performance in the excruciatingly relevant Get Out: it was vital for the satire to work that he be completely believable – and he is. A word, also, for Darren Aronofsky’s outrageous and controversial provocation Mother! It seems to have vanished off the radar, but it is an extremely edgy, risky, well-made picture, with a very amusing performance from Javier Bardem as an author turned religious cult leader. Will win: Daniel Kaluuya Should win: Daniel Kaluuya Shoulda been a contender: Javier Bardem for Mother! Best actress (musical or comedy) Saoirse Ronan has surpassed herself in Gerwig’s comedy Lady Bird. As Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson, a tense, lonely and yearning teenager, she is beguilingly funny and smart. It’s a deeply felt and honest performance – appreciably ahead of the other contenders, good though they are, which are more about technique than anything else. It is possible, however, that Margot Robbie will pinch it for her performance in I, Tonya, which is getting serious word-of-mouth. Zoe Kazan arguably gives more of a supporting turn in the very likable romcom The Big Sick, but she has presence and charm and it would have been nice to see her get a Globes nomination. Will win: Saoirse Ronan Should win: Saoirse Ronan Shoulda been a contender: Zoe Kazan for The Big Sick Best supporting actor He was the last-minute replacement who absolutely stole the show; the equivalent of an 89th-minute substitution who comes on and scores a winner: Christopher Plummer was hired by Ridley Scott to play the ageing and disagreeable oil tycoon J Paul Getty in All the Money in the World, after shooting had been completed but allegations of abuse surfaced against the original actor in the role, Kevin Spacey. Plummer was born to play the role: it is as juicy as these parts ever get and he squeezes every drop. That said, it would be pleasant to see the Globes recognise a very intelligent and subtle performance from one of the best American actors working today: Willem Dafoe, who plays the caretaker Bobby in Sean Baker’s The Florida Project. One omission was Daniel Craig, who showed he can do comedy as an explosives expert in Steven Soderbergh’s very likable robbery romp Logan Lucky. Will win: Christopher Plummer Should win: Willem Dafoe Shoulda been a contender: Daniel Craig for Logan Lucky Best supporting actress Allison Janney is a such a robust, intelligent comic performer and perennial crowdpleaser that she has to be considered a frontrunner in this category for I, Tonya. But my personal favourite was Laurie Metcalf for her wonderful, heart-wrenching seriocomic performance as Saoirse Ronan’s mother in Lady Bird, who goes through a parallel emotional crisis as her stroppy and ungrateful daughter prepares to leave for college. Catherine Keener is absolutely superb as the hypnotherapist in Get Out, who puts people under to sinister effect, and it would have been great to see this performer rewarded. Will win: Allison Janney Should win: Laurie Metcalf Shoulda been a contender: Catherine Keener for Get Out Best director Christopher Nolan is a director in the largest and most ambitious sense: he makes big things happen, he controls vast spectacle, but he interconnects it with potent, intimate drama, marshalling ideas and images with equal elan. Dunkirk puts him in pole position for the Golden Globe for best director, though I think, as an achievement in directing, it arguably comes just behind Del Toro’s masterly The Shape of Water. I was disappointed not to see anything for Denis Villeneuve here: his control of Blade Runner 2049 was so extraordinary and it is such a jaw-dropping film. Will win: Christopher Nolan Should win: Guillermo del Toro Shoulda been a contender: Denis Villeneuve for Blade Runner 2049 Best screenplay Aaron Sorkin is an entertainingly fierce and flashy writer, zapping us with dialogue riffs and extended speech arias; he is the inheritor of Mamet’s mantel. Molly’s Game is a wildly enjoyable if not especially profound movie, but he is a screenwriting brand with hardly any equal, and could well walk away with the Globe. Greta Gerwig’s writing in Lady Bird has no lack of zingers and laugh-lines but it is, I think, richer, deeper, more tender and more humanly plausible. Her partner, Noah Baumbach, also delivered an excellent feature last year, The Meyerowitz Stories, which perhaps could have got a nod in this section. Will win: Molly’s Game Should win: Lady Bird Shoulda been a contender: The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/04/hard-sun-agyness-deyn-jim-sturgess-tv-cop-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T10:29:05Z","webTitle":"Agyness Deyn and Jim Sturgess on Hard Sun: 'It felt like our bodies were going to combust'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/04/hard-sun-agyness-deyn-jim-sturgess-tv-cop-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/04/hard-sun-agyness-deyn-jim-sturgess-tv-cop-drama","fields":{"headline":"Agyness Deyn and Jim Sturgess on Hard Sun: 'It felt like our bodies were going to combust'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s Jim Sturgess’s mother you have to feel sorry for. “She asks me, ‘Why are you always getting beaten up?’ She finds it quite distressing, watching me get my arse kicked,” he says. She has a point. In the 2008 thriller Fifty Dead Men Walking, the 39-year-old played a British agent infiltrating the IRA who got beaten up repeatedly. In the forthcoming movie Feed the Beast, he gets a kicking from the Polish mob. “It’s just never ending,” he says. And now, in BBC One’s new six-part primetime pre-apocalypse cop drama Hard Sun, Sturgess gets beaten up by model-turned-actor Agyness Deyn. Sturgess plays DCI Charlie Hicks, a corrupt but big-hearted detective who loses it when he finds out that his new partner – Deyn’s cool, controlled and cerebral DI Elaine Renko – is investigating him for the murder of another copper. In the first episode, Hicks and and Renko sort out their differences Thames-side. Both whip out their telescopic batons and start whacking each other, then she pulls out a knuckleduster and gives him a good thumping. Deyn says she was channelling krav maga, the fighting system developed by the Israeli Defence Forces, which she learned in preparation for the role. “I was being trained by this tiny woman in New York,” she says, “who could beat up her husband – this massive 6ft guy. Women like her are very precise with their energy because they don’t have the weight. I learned from her that you use anything you can – bin lids, lip liners, keys, knuckledusters.” Deyn was also channelling the martial arts moves she learned as a kid in Manchester. “I did karate from the age of four. My older brother Greg did karate. So when my parents had me, they were like, ‘We’re not driving you to ballet. You’ll just have to do what Greg’s doing.’” She stopped aged 13. “I was just about to do my black belt – then I discovered boys.” Some of Hard Sun’s production team worried if Deyn had what it took to play a fighter. “Apparently, I split the camp. Some didn’t believe I could punch someone. I suppose if you looked at me you would think, ‘She can’t fight.’ But I’m from Manchester. I’ve taken a few punches.” The characters Deyn and Sturgess play are polar opposites. Hicks is a working-class lad who learned fighting on the streets, while Renko represents a new breed of educated copper. “I talked to some detectives,” says Sturgess. “Hicks is a dying breed in that he worked his way through the ranks. He probably joined at the age of 17 or 18. He grew up around a lot of criminal activity and could have easily fallen into that path but chose to become a law enforcer because it felt like a fun thing to do. It’s not like that any more – the newcomers have degrees. So there is a bit of friction between them.” I check out what the two actors are wearing as they share a sofa opposite me in a London hotel. Deyn still sports the short bob she had in Hard Sun, but today is elegant in long black skirt and black top by Margaret Howell and Giuseppe Zanotti patent black loafers. Sturgess is togged out like the skateboarder he’s been since he was a teenager, in baseball jacket and jeans. “I looked at myself in a picture when I was 17,” he says, “and I was wearing what I wear now.” Hard Sun is written by Neil Cross, who created Luther, the cop drama starring Idris Elba. In the six-parter, our two cops stumble on proof that the world is facing certain destruction while investigating the seemingly routine death of a hacker in London. Cross’s imagination was catalysed by David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust-era song Five Years. His idea is that humanity is doomed and only two cops who hate each other know the unbearable truth – that the sun is going to destroy Earth in five years. This is the first time Deyn has acted on TV and she found the 16-week shoot, often working 14 hours a day, six days a week, apocalyptic. “It felt like the world was going to end, like our physical bodies were going to combust. I think we carried that intensity over into the drama. I definitely had an emotional breakdown in the middle. Tears and everything.” The shoot was made more intense because she was away from her husband, New York hedge fund manager Joel McAndrew, whom she married last year after her divorce two years ago from actor Giovanni Ribisi. Which is the worse profession, I ask, modelling or acting? “For me, modelling. I love acting. This is the most exciting thing I’ve ever done, even with the nervous breakdowns and working all hours.” According to legend, Deyn – born Laura Michelle Hollins, the second of three children – was shovelling batter and scraps in a Rossendale chip shop when she was signed up for a modelling agency. She changed her name and became globally renowned for, as one interviewer put it, “her peroxide crop and gangling Bambi legs that stretched all the way from her Dr Martens to her armpits”.Except it didn’t quite happen that way: “I was actually on my gap year after doing theatre studies and music at college when I got spotted.” At the height of her modelling career, she was the face of Burberry, Armani and Vivienne Westwood, before moving to America in 2005. It is now 10 years since she quit modelling. “I don’t miss it.” She got into acting in an odd way. Seven years ago, two video artists in New York invited her to be in a “weird black and white Hitchcock thing”. The 13-minute short, Mean to Me, was a striking debut: instead of the short-haired gamine of her modelling career, she appeared in raven-hued finger waves and crimson lips, playing what the New York Times called “a victimised starlet consumed by passion and greed”. There, too, she got to beat up some bloke – whacking her lover Linus Roache over the head, tying him up and dumping him in a bathtub before extorting a cheque. “My agent asked me if I was serious about wanting to act. I said yes and we decided to do it slowly.” She played Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty, love and sex in 2010’s Clash of the Titans, followed by a West End debut in François Archambault’s comedy The Leisure Society. Since then, she’s been a stripper in Pusher and the lead in Sunset Song, Terence Davies’s adaptation of the Lewis Grassic Gibbon novel about a young Scottish woman coming of age just before the first world war. Does it matter that you never trained as an actor? “I blag my way through it a little bit. You have to be ballsy to employ me.” “Same with me,” says Sturgess. “I haven’t trained either. We’re a pair of blaggers. Well, not really – but I think if you haven’t trained, you work harder.” “I feel if I put the most energy in I can,” says Deyn, “I won’t have any regrets.” Sturgess, though, does have regrets. For a while, his film career was developing nicely: he was George Boleyn in 2008’s The Other Boleyn Girl, and had multiple roles in Cloud Atlas a few years later. Then in 2015 he worked on an adaptation of Martin Amis’s novel London Fields, playing the darts player Keith Talent, virtuoso of not just throwing arrows but of a superbly fanciful prole eloquence. “That’s probably the most fun I’ve ever had,” says Sturgess. “You could leave yourself so far behind and be repulsive.” But, even though the film also starred Billy Bob Thornton, Johnny Depp and Cara Delevingne, it has never been released. Why? “There were some very conflicting opinions on what the film should be. It’s pretty horrific. It got caught up in a lot of legal stuff. Now two very different versions exist.” One was shown at the Toronto film festival to scathing reviews a couple of years ago. But the directors’ version, Sturgess says, has never been publicly screened. “And the director’s is better, right?” says Deyn. “I’m not legally allowed to say that,” replies Sturgess guardedly. “Well, I’ll say it,” says Deyn. “What I’ve heard is that the director’s is really, really good.” What keeps Sturgess sane amid such setbacks, he says, is music: he’s an accomplished guitarist, pianist and drummer. Between acting gigs, he retreats to his studio at home in London to write songs. “I’ve written about three albums nobody’s ever heard. I like to keep it something I really enjoy it rather than stress about it.” As for Deyn, she will film in her home town New York in the spring. She won’t tell me anything about the project, though. “All I will say is that I’ll put a lot energy into it. I’ve always done that – ever since I was four and doing karate.” • Hard Sun starts on 6 January at 9.35pm on BBC One."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/jan/03/uk-box-office-star-wars-the-last-jedi-beauty-and-the-beast-jumanji-greatest-showman","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T07:00:09Z","webTitle":"Star Wars battles Beauty and the Beast for year's top spot at UK box office","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/jan/03/uk-box-office-star-wars-the-last-jedi-beauty-and-the-beast-jumanji-greatest-showman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/jan/03/uk-box-office-star-wars-the-last-jedi-beauty-and-the-beast-jumanji-greatest-showman","fields":{"headline":"Star Wars battles Beauty and the Beast for year's top spot at UK box office","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The winner: Star Wars: The Last Jedi Cinemagoing in the UK is usually pretty robust ahead of New Year’s Day but even so, Disney and Lucasfilm should be pleased with a slim 22% decline for Star Wars: The Last Jedi from the previous, pre-Christmas session. Third-weekend takings of £7.98m push the total after 18 days to £68.3m. Star Wars: The Force Awakens stood at £97.4m at the same stage of its run, so The Last Jedi is running 30% behind the pace of Disney’s 2015 prequel. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story grossed £66m in the UK, so The Last Jedi is already ahead of that number. The biggest-grossing release of 2017 remains – for the moment – Disney’s Beauty and the Beast, with £72.4m. Expect The Last Jedi to knock Belle off her perch this coming weekend. The runner-up: Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle While The Last Jedi fell by 22%, box office for Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle increased by 28% from the period 22-24 December. Buoyant takings of £5.21m pushed the total after 12 days to £17.8m. Including New Year’s Day that rises to £19m. The original Jumanji grossed £13.5m in the UK, in 1996. The reboot benefits from considerable ticket price inflation, but distributor Sony will nevertheless be pleased with the outcome so far. The newcomer: The Greatest Showman Hugh Jackman’s PT Barnum musical The Greatest Showman had to content itself with third place, but a debut of £4.75m, grossed over six days beginning on Boxing Day, is a decent start for the film. Over the 29-31 December weekend, it managed £2.58m. It’s rare for a major-budget musical not to be based on an existing stage property (eg Chicago, Les Misérables) or at least on songs with established familiarity (Moulin Rouge!), so success for The Greatest Showman was hardly a given. However, a notable counter example is La La Land, which didn’t require familiarity with its songbook to reach more than £30m in the UK and $446m worldwide. Incidentally, The Greatest Showman has songs by La La Land lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. The chart veteran: Paddington 2 Still in the UK Top 5 after eight weeks on release, Paddington 2 saw box office rise by 15%, with £1.88m weekend takings pushing its tally to £37.6m, and just under £38m including New Year’s Day, meaning it has now overtaken the original film. Paddington (2014) enjoyed an exceedingly long tail, with solid returns all the way through to the end of February 2015. StudioCanal will be hoping to similarly sustain Paddington 2, but faces competition from Disney-Pixar’s Coco from 19 January and its own Early Man (from Aardman’s Nick Park) a week later. The market Six titles grossed £1m or more at the weekend, for the first time since July. The robust numbers for The Last Jedi, the Jumanji reboot, The Greatest Showman, Pitch Perfect 3, Paddington 2 and Ferdinand helped the market overall achieve a 17% uptick on the same session from 2016, when Rogue One, Why Him? and Passengers were the top films on release.

Rose Marie, playing one of three comedy writers on the fictional Alan Brady Show, felt she had struck a blow for gender equality on American television because Sally was not a wife, mother or secretary but a writer equal to Rob Petrie (Van Dyke) and Buddy Sorrell (Morey Amsterdam). Witty and self-deprecating, desperately seeking a husband, Sally acted as a balance between Buddy, the “joke machine”, and the accident-prone Rob. In her constant verbal jousting with Buddy, Sally offered “the woman’s point of view”. Always wearing a distinctive hair bow, she was in every episode of the show for five seasons, and was sometimes called upon to sing, reminding those in the know that she had already had a lengthy career as an all-round entertainer – one of the longest in show business history, covering nine decades, almost her whole life. She started performing at the age of three under the name of Baby Rose Marie. At five she became a radio singing star on NBC, which offered her a seven-year contract. “I had a deep voice, not like Shirley Temple but more like Sophie Tucker,” she recalled. “I never sounded like a child so there were some people who thought I was really a 30-year-old midget.” To counteract these rumours, NBC arranged for her to make stage appearances around the country and to appear in a few short films such as Baby Rose Marie the Child Wonder (1929), in which she sang three jazzy songs. At the age of 10, still billed as Baby Rose Marie, she was seen belting out My Bluebirds Are Singing the Blues in a film called International House (1933), a crazy feature starring, among others, WC Fields, Rudy Vallée and Burns and Allen. She did not make another film for 20 years. Always credited solely by her forenames, she was born in New York as Rose Marie Mazzetta, daughter of the Italian-American vaudeville actor Frank Mazzetta, who went by the name of Frank Curley, and his Polish-American wife, Stella Gluszcak. It was the latter who guided Rose Marie’s childhood stardom, though not in pushy, stage-mother fashion. “I had a wonderful time,” said Rose Marie. “I was never forced to do anything against my will.” In her teens, having dropped the “Baby” from her name, she became a singing comedian on radio, where she was billed as “the darling of the airwaves”, as well as on records, in vaudeville and in nightclubs, continuing as an adult performer. In 1946, having just married Bobby Guy, a trumpet player with some of the leading big bands, she performed at the opening night of the Flamingo hotel in Las Vegas, which had been built by the gangster Bugsy Siegel. In 1951 Rose Marie was cast opposite Phil Silvers on Broadway in the Johnny Mercer musical Top Banana, in which she had a show-stopping solo number, I Fought Every Step of the Way, likening a romantic relationship to a boxing match. But when United Artists released the film version of the show in 1954, all of Rose Marie’s numbers and some of her scenes had been cut. According to her 2002 autobiography, Hold the Roses, during rehearsals for the film she received unwelcome sexual advances from one of the film’s producers, which she firmly rejected with a wisecrack. Apparently he had told her: “This could be your picture. I’m the producer and I can see to it that it’s your movie ...” Rose Marie, who never had to cope with a similar situation again, began her long television career in 1955 on The Red Skelton Hour, continuing, with hardly a break, to voicing characters in the animated series The Garfield Show from 2008 to 2013. In between were series that included The Bob Cummings Show (1958-59) and My Sister Eileen (1960-1961), before the five-year run of The Dick Van Dyke Show. She nearly gave up acting in mid career after her husband died suddenly at the age of 48 in 1964, but was persuaded to stay by members of the Dick Van Dyke Show cast, whom she viewed as “my close family”. Following her signature role as Sally Rogers, she played a secretary working at a magazine in The Doris Day Show (1969-71), a variation of her wisecracking, lovelorn persona. Besides the sitcoms, she was also one of the regular panellists in the game show Hollywood Squares (1965-80). From 1977 to 1985 Rose Marie picked up her singing career, touring in the musical revue 4 Girls 4 with Rosemary Clooney, Helen O’Connell and Margaret Whiting. She is survived by her daughter, Georgiana. • Rose Marie Mazzetta, actor and singer, born 15 August 1923; died 28 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/too-busy-lazy-person-guide-self-improvement","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"‘Most of us are too busy to be better’: the lazy person's guide to self-improvement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/too-busy-lazy-person-guide-self-improvement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/too-busy-lazy-person-guide-self-improvement","fields":{"headline":"‘Most of us are too busy to be better’: the lazy person's guide to self-improvement","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I am lying on a mat, looking up at the bright blue of the skylight above me. I exhale purposefully, then let my lungs reinflate of their own accord. I am trying hard to concentrate on this slightly counterintuitive way of breathing, but the voices in my head are distracting me. They are telling me about business regulation, specifically about the inhibitory effect of hairdresser licensing in Utah. I do not, as a rule, make New Year resolutions. As an anxious person, the 12 months that lie ahead of New Year’s Eve do not fill me with excitement or anticipation. I just wonder what else could go wrong. I am as susceptible as the next person to notions of promise, to the idea that, with the right effort, I could become fitter, smarter, happier, better. But each new December, as I coast towards the end of the year on squeaky wheels, I find myself feeling the same way: older, wiser, worse. It’s the time and effort involved that puts me off most kinds of self-improvement. Many years ago, I signed up for an online life-coaching course, and when I complained about the difficulty of one of the exercises I’d been sent – I was meant to make a list of my qualities, keeping to the strict format “I am (quality)” – the instructor immediately replied by email, saying, “Yes, this is REAL WORK, isn’t it?’ I thought: I already have a job, thanks. In recent years, however, a new school of self‑improvement has sprung up, one that seems to recognise that, frankly, most of us are too busy to be better. Books with titles such as The 10-Minute Millionaire, The 5-Minute Healer, 10 Minutes To Better Health and 10 Minutes A Day To A Better Marriage represent, if not a global revolution in self-improvement, at least a reliable publishing trend. I am ineluctably drawn to the quick fix. Could it be possible to cram a year’s self-improvement into a few minutes of effort a day, to get the whole business out of the way before the end of January? It can’t do any harm to try, can it? *** My first self-improvement guide is a new book called 15 Minutes To Happiness by Richard Nicholls. My first thought is that 15 minutes sounds a lot, especially when somebody else is promising to make me a millionaire in 10, but Nicholls’ book is full of quick exercises interspersed with longer explanations of why and how they work. Some of the exercises are designed to fix problems I don’t think I have, so I’m pretty sure I can skip ahead. Nicholls posits a model for happiness that I find reassuring. He stresses the value of negative thinking. He says that actively seeking happiness can often end up making people feel less happy. On page 49 he writes: “Be open to the possibility that you bought this book and you don’t actually need it.” This, I think, is my kind of self-help. Here and there Nicholls inserts a “quick happiness boosting idea”, designed to give you an injection of contentment as and when you need it. In the chapter on gratitude, for example, he suggests you “take a moment or two to send a text message to someone thanking them for being a part of your life”. I embarked on a preliminary challenge: trying to find someone – anyone – in my list of contacts I could send a text like that, without having to send an immediate follow-up apology text: “Sorry about that – I was only following orders.” Here’s another: “Put your town name into JustGiving.com and see who is raising money for a good cause in your local area. Even if you don’t donate anything to anyone, spending time looking at the good that’s going on in your town will dilute any doom and gloom you’ve picked up from elsewhere.” I tried this one – it was incredibly easy, and it did make me feel slightly happier. It ended up costing me £30 (donated anonymously, because that’s the kind of person I am now), but the feeling lasted for almost four hours. A dozen years ago, I had an hour-long session with a yoga instructor, and when I asked what sort of benefits I could expect, he promised that yoga would bring me joy. I hadn’t even considered this possibility, but I liked the sound of it. I will try this yoga, I thought. And when I get my joy, everyone else can go to hell. Then I went to one of his classes in a London studio, full of supple people in leggings, and found the whole experience nerve-racking and humiliating. It wasn’t relaxing at all. It was like auditioning for Cats. So I’m done doing yoga in front of people, but a book called The 10 Minute Yoga Solution raises the possibility that I could get my joy in the privacy of my home, quietly and quickly. The author, Ira Trivedi, makes a lot of bold claims: she says that 10 minutes of yoga a day will not just make me calmer and more physically fit, it will improve my eyesight, control unhealthy eating habits and cure a multitude of hair problems (it’s all about blood flow to the scalp). She also mentions joy, if only in passing. The book itself has very few words in it. It is simply a collection of illustrated poses – or asanas – with instructions, grouped into workouts tailored to specific requirements. Again, I find myself in a position to skip bits: yoga for women, for kids, for weight loss, for fasting, for binge-eating. I like the sound of “yoga for lazy people” and “yoga for hangovers”, but for the moment I am concentrating on yoga for beginners: eight poses, 10 minutes in all. I wasn’t sure what to expect from a basic, self-administered yoga programme, but I hadn’t expected it to hurt quite so much. Sitting cross-legged hurts. The seated spinal twist hurts. Even the shavasana, the so-called corpse pose – lying flat on your back, arms and legs spread, palms up, toes pointing out – hurts. I am, I discover, a collection of small aches. As instructed, I contract the muscles in my feet and then relax them. My toes refuse to uncurl. Ten minutes begins to seem like an age. *** There are, of course, a lot of self-improvement podcasts available – I found one titled simply You Suck: Be Better. Another, created by a former lawyer, suggested that I think of my time as if it were broken down into billable hours, so I learn to prize it more. I’d rather use my headphone time to acquire some actual information. I’ve got the happy book and the yoga routine already. What I really require is a little knowledge. I’ve always resisted the idea of learning more about economics. It was a passive resistance – I just wasn’t that interested in the subject – but maybe, armed with the right podcast and a decent set of headphones, I could enter into a new phase of passive learning. By common consent, NPR’s Planet Money is one of the best economics podcasts going. I haven’t listened to many – well, any – but Planet Money is entertaining, informative and aimed squarely at the layman. It’s not a primer, but more of a fun way to engage with what for many remains an off-putting subject. I encounter no mathematics. But there’s a lot of it: two years’ worth, with a new episode posted every couple of days. Where to begin? What’s more, the average length of each instalment is close to 20 minutes, which, in today’s self-improvement environment, is positively leisurely. There is a solution: it turns out you can just speed a podcast up. At first I thought: who would do this? But lots of people do it. My own children, it transpires, routinely listen to sped-up recordings of their university lectures in order to save time. I had to download a new app to acquire the facility, but I can now listen to Planet Money at three times the original speed. Actually, I can’t – it’s pretty well unintelligible at that clip – but I soon find that if I spend a few minutes trying to keep up with the podcast at double speed, it then sounds perfectly normal at a more relaxed one-and-a-half times. Within a few days, I’ve worked my way up to 1.8x. Over the course of a week, I grow increasingly impatient with the pace of actual human conversation. Spit it out, I want to say. A week in, I rise (10 minutes) early and run through my yoga positions, beginning with some breathing: inhale the future, exhale the past, as the book says. I move on to the spinal twist and the shoulder stand. The corpse pose no longer hurts; in fact, my impersonation of a corpse is so convincing that I worry about my wife walking in and finding me. He died doing what he loved, she would think. Express yoga. I listen to a podcast about robots taking over our jobs on my way to and from the shops; about 1.6x makes it the right length for the journey. Back at home, I sit down to settle on my next 15-minute happiness task. Deciding often takes longer than 15 minutes, because I reject a few out of hand. Going through Nicholls’ book, I come across the following passage: “If we’re grateful for life then we can’t be fearful, which means that any anxiety we experience gets processed as excitement instead. If we’re grateful, then we act out of a sense that we have enough rather than out of a sense of scarcity or envy.” He goes on to suggest spending “15 minutes writing about some positive things that have happened to you”. I am extraordinarily resistant to this idea. I only like writing about bad things that have happened to me, in part because I know I will never run out. At first, I can’t even think of any recent positive experiences, but after a few minutes, I recall a long and mostly tedious drive to Exeter the previous week. I was thinking about nothing but my destination when I came upon Stonehenge at sunset, the stones glistening in the low, pink light. At that moment, traffic slowed to a crawl, enabling me to get a long look. This is free, I thought. A wondrous thing to marvel at, and I haven’t driven an inch out of my way. After 10 minutes, the traffic cleared and I was off again, feeling strangely moved. And then I forgot all about it. The exercise takes 20 minutes from start to finish – too long. I recall that email from the life coach – “This is REAL WORK, isn’t it?” I begin to think of my time in terms of billable hours. *** Time is becoming an issue. Ten minutes of yoga is one thing, but when you add in a happiness exercise and the 12 minutes it takes me to listen to a 20-minute podcast, you’re talking about nearly a whole hour. It occurs to me that I might double up on some of this improvement. There is a certain amount of natural overlap. Both 15 Minutes To Happiness and The 10 Minute Yoga Solution stress the importance of breathing, and the exercises are not dissimilar. But focus is the key to both, and the focal points are different. It’s harder to mix mindfulness and stillness than it sounds. Add in a podcast explaining what GDP is, and the whole thing becomes an exercise in frustration. I am reminded, to my eternal disappointment, that there are no quick fixes. After a fortnight of this, I would have to say the improvements have been marginal: some extra flexibility here, a little more gratitude there, a lot more to say when the subject of GDP next comes up at a dinner party. The Nicholls book is worth a read even if you do none of the exercises, if only to come away with the knowledge that the successful pursuit of happiness mainly involves not trying too hard. “It’s not unrealistic to think that in stopping trying to be happy, you can find that you’re happy enough already,” he writes. “Paradoxically, it could be that the only reason for you being unhappy is your relentless attempt at trying not be.” And I’ve learned the lesson I was always going to learn, only faster: stop making New Year resolutions.

That felt bad, in a bruising sort of way, because it turned out I’d paid her £25 to rob us. This time was less bad: I returned home a few nights ago to an empty house, tripped into my bedroom to find it tipped on its side, then heard a noise downstairs as the rest of the back door fell in and thought, oh, so this is how I die. He’d taken our Christmas presents and my computer, and he’d trodden mud all over our pillows looking for cash hidden in the curtain rail. Apparently people hide cash in the curtain rail! But it was less bad, less personal, and this meant I was able to pay closer attention. Most robberies don’t happen at night, as assumed, but between 3pm and 5pm, during school pick-up time The policeman and I were crouching in the spare room, looking at a muddy footprint. Then he stood up, and said: “You need to have more kids.” It’s not the first time a person has told me how to do fertility and it won’t be the last, but this time it threw me slightly. Would they not have robbed us if we’d had more kids? Was this one of the unknown truths of a criminal mind that the more children living in a property the less of value inside? It makes sense, I thought. For one thing everything’s plastic; for another, diamonds are a choking risk. When he was taking my statement at the kitchen table later he asked if I employed a nanny, and my mum, having arrived to help me check the burglar had gone, cleared her throat, pointedly. “No, we rely on my mother for a lot of the childcare, and we’re very grateful for everything she does,” I said in a monotone. “Let it be added to the statement.” Up in the spare room I started to stutter the reasons we’d only had one child, until the policeman cheerily explained, “But you’ve got all this space!” he said. “You should have more kids to fill it!” And because I was still me, obviously I apologised. The only way to prevent your house being broken into is to make it look less attractive We moved in at the beginning of September, a van taking our furniture maybe five doors down the road. After two years of trying to buy a house and weaving whole lives into the linings of strangers’ flats, the parties we’d have, the chickens we’d roast, then having to bury the whole idea when the estate agent called with their chirpy “no”. Of viewing derelict houses that you’d wrinkle your nose through until you got to the single armchair, the kettle, and realised a person had been left alone eating Cup-a-Soups for a decade by the son now trying to sell it for half a million pounds. The process wrung me dry of hope. Until, one day I met our neighbour, whose sale, it turned out, had fallen through. And over a cup of tea in her kitchen we worked out how we could afford to buy her house. The humanness of the whole thing was sort of breathtaking, after all that time grunting through Rightmove and men we didn’t trust; it was a conversation, not a game. Every time we approach the place now, the porch light illuminating some sort of future, we are reminded of our exquisite luck. And now, what, the police want us to pebbledash it? A SOCO is a scene of crime officer who gathers forensic evidence. You must not clean up until they arrive By the time the woman from forensics turned up, tough and immaculate, with cat’s-eye glasses and the demeanour of a pub landlord, it was getting dark. “Sorry I’m late,” she said, her radio fizzing away with its own short stories as she crunched through the broken glass to dust a large Nike footprint. “I’ve just come from a massive shooting in Brent.” Obviously, I apologised again. Most people hide cash and jewellery in their bedroom We had neither cash nor jewellery, and the burglar seemed a little confused at this absence, opening jars of face cream and going through my partner’s vinyl records.

The two batsmen’s returns contrast starkly heading into Thursday’s fifth Test, with Root’s three half-centuries eclipsed by Smith’s 604 runs and three hundreds that included a career-best 237 in Perth; even with a pair in Sydney the Australian’s average would still be above 100 for the series. “You see that and you want to be the one doing it,” said Root, whose side are 3-0 down with one last chance of a consolation victory. “It’s a little lesson to me on leading from the front and how he’s played different types of innings at different periods of games.” Asked how he appraised his performances to date, Root replied: “I’m disappointed with on the field. To not go on and make those big scores that as a senior player you pride yourself doing in big series, and which I have done in the past, is disappointing. As a captain I think tactically I’ve been quite good. It’s been difficult on occasions on these surfaces.” Root’s inability to capitalise when set at the crease leaves his conversion of fifties into centuries at 27% – comfortably the lowest of the world’s top five batsmen and just over half that of Smith – but he believes there is “no exact science” to overcoming this glitch. Instead the hope is that one big innings will start a run of scores. Despite this personal frustration and the off-field issues to deal with during the campaign, Root stated his desire to lead England back out to Australia in four years’ time. Victory in Sydney would not only end a winless run of 10 Tests away from home but also start the preparations for that tour and what he still considers should be England’s ultimate goal. Root, who along with the selectors will this week be picking a Test squad for New Zealand in March, said: “It’s paramount we win this game. It’s really important to me and this squad moving into the rest of this winter, and then the summer, and build on that for four years’ time. “I want us to be the best side in the world, and it’s not going to happen overnight. And it’s not going to happen by chucking guys in for the last game of a series. So it’s really important that we do it in a way which, over the next four years, gets us in the best place to perform well here, but throughout that period being as successful as we can be.” Root’s insistence that caps should not be handed out frivolously sits at odds with the situation at the end of the 2013-14 series when Boyd Rankin and Scott Borthwick – as well as Gary Ballance – made debuts never to be seen in Test cricket since. If Mason Crane, the 20-year-old leg-spinner, does play it will be a sign the England management consider him a long-term option. The likelihood of Crane’s debut has increased, with Chris Woakes emerging as a doubt for the Test owing to a side injury. The all-rounder is to have a scan on Wednesday and, given his importance to the one-day campaign that follows, England are unlikely to take any risks. Moeen Ali, who appeared set to be dropped, could earn a reprieve as a result. “Mason has definitely done all he can to push his case forward,” Root said. “He’s been very professional for a young man in the way he’s gone about his business. It’s really pleasing to see him have that attitude when he’s first come into the squad.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/09/my-brothers-husband-graphic-novel-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T07:30:02Z","webTitle":"My Brother’s Husband review – a Canadian gay man about the house","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/09/my-brothers-husband-graphic-novel-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/09/my-brothers-husband-graphic-novel-review","fields":{"headline":"My Brother’s Husband review – a Canadian gay man about the house","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"When a young Tokyo couple called Yaichi and Natsuki got divorced, it was agreed that Yaichi would bring up their daughter, Kana – a decision that makes Yaichi seem like a more than usually modern and sophisticated Japanese man. But this isn’t the whole story. Yaichi has his share of cultural prejudices, or so it seems when a smiling, bear-like Canadian arrives at his door and announces that he, Mike Flanagan, is the widower of Yaichi’s estranged gay twin, Ryoji. Yaichi hesitates unaccountably before inviting Mike to stay (Mike is in Japan because he wants to see all the places Ryoji told him about before he died). Then he worries that the stranger now sharing his bathroom is about to hit on him: after all, he looks just like his dead brother. How, he wonders, will he explain to little Kana that in Canada men may fall in love and even marry? How, in other words, can he hope to keep the disgust from his voice? Mike, though, is an unexpectedly easy house guest, even in his grief – and Kana regards both her new uncle and gay marriage as marvellous novelties, things about which she can boast to her friends on the way to school. It isn’t long, then, before the distance between the two men begins to close, their differences lying as much in their attitude to sushi – why do Canadians put tempura in it? – as in anything connected to their sexuality. After all, neither one of them conforms to the old stereotypes, for isn’t it the soft-cheeked Yaichi, rather than the bearded, gym-pumped Mike, who stands in the yard pegging washing in an apron? Yaichi, almost without realising it, grows protective of Mike, a feeling that’s heightened when the mother of one of Kana’s schoolfriends makes it clear she doesn’t want him around her daughter, and this in turn causes him to rethink what might constitute a family. Finally, he gives in to grief himself, not only for the long-lost Ryoji, but for their parents, too, killed in an accident when they were still at school. My Brother’s Husband is the work of Gengoroh Tagame, the award-winning manga artist whose cartoons have been translated into several languages, and it arrives in the UK garlanded with praise from, among others, Alison Bechdel. It’s not hard to see why. Not only is it very touching; it’s also, for the non-Japanese reader, unexpectedly fascinating. Gay life remains largely closeted in Japan, and Tagame’s complex but deftly told story – this is volume one; a sequel is forthcoming – seeks to examine the effect such secrecy has not only those who must live it, but also on their wider family relationships. The pain, he suggests, cuts both ways, for while Ryoji found the freedom to express his feelings in another country, all that was left to his brother was shyness, silence and stoicism. If Yaichi envies anything about Mike, it’s his unnerving openness, the sound of his thoughts filling up every room like dazzling sunlight through suddenly opened blinds. • My Brother’s Husband by Gengoroh Tagame is published by Little Brown (£16.99).

Earlier this summer, in the town where those men were raised, two of their grandchildren gave one another a hug. My second cousin Michael and I had never met before, and we may never meet again: but our embrace felt like the healing of a schism, the nuances of which play out in our family to this day. Michael’s grandfather was Arthur Moorhead. He was the sixth child of our great-grandparents, an Irish doctor, Henry, and his wife, Mary Monica, who lived in Moate in County Westmeath, Ireland. Their house was opposite the church where Arthur and my grandfather George, seven years his junior, were baptised. Henry and Mary Monica’s eldest child, another Henry, followed his father to medical school. Arthur enrolled at Trinity College, Dublin, a few years later, also to read medicine, but in 1920 took a holiday job on a ship to Canada. The family fully expected him to return, but in Canada he bought a one-way passage to Australia. According to his son Garry, now 88, Arthur hated medicine. In Melbourne, where he settled, he became a journalist, and met his journalist wife, Leslie. The two were married in 1929, and went on to have six children, two of whom are still alive. My great-uncle Arthur went home to Ireland once after Garry’s birth. Times were hard in Australia, and Arthur came home to ask for assistance. His parents said they would help him, but only if he returned to Ireland with his family and went back to medical school. Arthur refused, and never returned to Ireland again. What must have rankled on his visit was the news that his brother George, my grandfather, who he’d always had a difficult relationship with, had found a well-off bride, my grandmother Miriam, and was now running a successful business in Manchester. During my childhood several decades later, I don’t remember Arthur’s name being mentioned; my grandfather never spoke of him, nor did my father. But a few months ago, I received an invitation to the 50th birthday party of a man called Michael Moorhead. By email, Michael told me there would be about 40 people gathering in Moate to celebrate his birthday, most from Australia and about half of them relatives. No one in my branch of the Moorhead family had met any of them. I booked my flight. Which is how I came to bowl up in the cowboy town of Moate with the celebrations in full swing. It felt like every Moorhead gathering I have ever attended, except that I had no idea which revellers were relations. There were clues: Garry, Michael’s father, was eerily reminiscent of my late father, the cousin he had never known. Michael, the second cousin celebrating his half century, was unmistakably a Moorhead. And it was clear it wasn’t just a physical resemblance. Like my father and so many Moorhead men I have known, Michael is a laid-back bon viveur, an eternal optimist and – as demonstrated by his decision to tempt 40 people across the world to a little town in Ireland for three days of festivities – a risk-taker. So what had led him to celebrate his 50th birthday in the town on which his grandfather had turned his back? “I didn’t know my grandpa,” he told me, “but what I did know was his reputation as a colourful character. Growing up in Melbourne, one of six children, I very much occupied the same sort of role: I was seen as a bit of a rascal, rather eccentric, and that gave me an affinity with my grandfather.” A few years ago, on a trip to the UK, Michael took a detour to Ireland, and called in on Moate. What he found there changed everything for him. “Growing up in Australia, of European descent, there’s an indigenousness missing. I was part of a community that had invaded that country, and I didn’t have any roots there. But walking down the main street of Moate, I felt a wonderful sense of belonging that up to that stage of my life I hadn’t even been aware was missing.” Serendipitously, Moate has a heritage centre, Dún na Sí, which incorporates the genealogical centre for Westmeath. We were able to do some research there into our forebears, and Michael managed to meet an elderly man in the town who remembered our great-grandparents, who died in the 1950s. Visitors like us aren’t unusual in Ireland: genealogy, according to Bernie Norris of Dún na Sí, is the country’s fastest-growing industry. “It’s huge,” says Norris. “We’re inundated, especially in the summer. They want to learn about their roots, they want to find a sense of belonging. And it’s an endless cycle: over the last few years we’ve had another wave of emigration, so a few decades down the line all those people will be coming back to try to reconnect with the family they left.” On the musical evening that formed part of Michael’s birthday celebrations, I was struck by how much our family character has been shaped by Irish history, and how pertinently it plays out in my own life. The improvisation that’s central to one strand of Irish dancing; the richness of the storytelling tradition. This is my heritage in a living way; it has played out in my own life to help make me who I am. It’s mysterious, this weaving of historical nurture into the other strands that make up our personalities, but it’s there. On the final morning in Moate we gathered for mass at St Patrick’s. We sat in the pews where our great-grandparents and grandparents sat a century ago; we received communion at the altar rails where they once knelt. If I had a prayer that morning, it was for Arthur, the great-uncle I never knew I had. Whatever family ructions had torn him from Ireland and sent him across the world to Australia, his greatest ambition must have been to start again and to put his demons behind him. And for a while, he did. Marriage to Leslie; four children. But we never do quite put the past behind us; eventually it seeks us out, overtakes us once more. Thirty years after leaving Ireland, when Garry was about 21, Arthur disappeared again. He’d left one family. Now he left another. Just as before, he walked out without explanation and left no trace. It was only chance that led Garry and his mother and siblings to find out a few years later that he’d died, in his 50s, in slightly mysterious circumstances on Thursday Island, off Queensland. He’s buried in a grave without a headstone. One day, the family would like to erect one there. Like the journey to Moate, it would symbolise an understanding and an empathy; a sense of caring that reaches out from the living to embrace a generation gone, offering healing and forgiveness to people we would have recognised but never met; people whose choices shaped our lives, and whose pain, even a century on, we can still feel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/04/golden-globes-2018-tv-who-will-win","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"Golden Globes 2018: who will win – and who should win – the TV categories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/04/golden-globes-2018-tv-who-will-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/04/golden-globes-2018-tv-who-will-win","fields":{"headline":"Golden Globes 2018: who will win – and who should win – the TV categories","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"While last year’s ceremony found itself dominated by elegant Brit dramas The Crown and The Night Manager, the 2018 TV Golden Globes nominations suggest this is likely to be a more scattered and open race.

With the surprising absence of Veep, and no Transparent or Orange Is the New Black, which have had a strong showing up until now, the comedy categories are particularly up in the air. What with the influx of Hollywood A-listers to TV, this year will be particularly starry, but may also be one for the underdogs to shine. Best drama Last year’s winner The Crown returned with a grand second season, but given that its victory felt like a shock in 2017, it’s hard to imagine it pulling off the double. Stranger Things had a patchier second season than the first, when it seemed more likely to win – and frankly its inclusion here feels like more of a nod to the zeitgeist than a true reflection of its quality. The Handmaid’s Tale wasn’t perfect, and could well suffer from the same sort of criticisms, but it was more of its time than anything else, was consistently original, and given its dominance of the Emmys, it would be no surprise if it cleaned up here, too. Will win: The Handmaid’s Tale Should win: The Handmaid’s Tale Best comedy or musical For the first time in years, this category appears to have cracked down on what counts as comedy, as opposed to shorter dramas with the occasional moments of absurdity (hello, Transparent). There’s an honourable mix of the established (Black-ish), the very well established (Will and Grace, which, with a surprisingly strong comeback, deserves its nod) and the brand new (The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and Smilf). Given its spread of nominations, historical showing and Tracee Ellis Ross’s best actress win last year, Black-ish may well finally get the gong, if only to make up for the controversial snub of Ellis Ross this year. But it would be a treat for the inventive and increasingly confident Master of None to triumph too. Will win: Black-ish Should win: Master of None Best TV movie or limited series No TV movies were shortlisted, though HBO’s Madoff drama Wizard of Lies has its acting nods instead, so it’s all about the limited series. If there is any realistic expectation of an upset for the big-name, glossy juggernaut that is Big Little Lies, leading the pack with six nominations, then perhaps there might be enough love for Fargo’s excellent third season, but let’s face it, this one feels as if it’s already in the very expensive designer handbag. And rightly so – it was a slick, masterly series packed to bursting with thrilling plot and elegant performances. Will win: Big Little Lies Should win: Big Little Lies Best actor in a drama This category feels like a clear indication that women have led the field in 2017, in terms of both characters and storytelling, and there isn’t one obvious standout. However, the Globes have shown their love for Ozark where other ceremonies have not, and Bateman has won it before, for his comedic side, in Arrested Development back in 2005. While Bob Odenkirk and Liev Schreiber may be similarly sturdy bets, Sterling K Brown was nominated last year for the much-decorated The People vs OJ Simpson, and this may be his chance to repeat his This Is Us Emmy win – which would mean another outstanding victory speech. Will win: Jason Bateman, Ozark Should win: Sterling K Brown, This Is Us Best actress in a drama Claire Foy is routinely excellent as the Queen in The Crown, and deserved her Globe last year, but it’s likely to go to Elisabeth Moss this year, for suffering all the rage of Gilead in The Handmaid’s Tale. Look out for 13 Reasons Why’s Katherine Langford as a potential underdog. The show may not have been to all tastes, but her harrowing performance was deeply convincing. The Deuce, however, is criminally underrepresented – perhaps it will pick up more love as the series progresses – and it deserves some recognition, not least for Gyllenhaal, who was magnificent as Candy/Eileen, and embodied the show’s brittle heart. Will win: Elisabeth Moss Should win: Maggie Gyllenhaal Best actor in a comedy There are heavyweights to contend with – Eric McCormack has almost 20 years of playing Will &amp; Grace’s Will Truman under his belt, while William H Macy has been nominated for Shameless before, in 2015, and Kevin Bacon is, well, Kevin Bacon, swimming through the often difficult I Love Dick. But it’s down to two frontrunners. Aziz Ansari will probably build on the success of Master Of None’s truly brilliant return, and deserves to, though if Anthony Anderson finally wins for Black-ish – and with this season’s more in-depth silliness, he may well do – nobody is likely to complain. Will win: Aziz Ansari, Master of None Should win: Anthony Anderson, Black-ish Best actress in a comedy This is a particularly strong category, and each nominee has carved out a specific and unique path. Pamela Adlon’s Better Things went from strength to strength this year, and what she created was wonderful, warm and affectingly blunt. It would be a shame if the Louis CK fallout were to taint what she achieved. But with a strong, more steady, and consistently creative second season of Insecure, which she also created and co-writes, it feels as if this should, rightfully, be Issa Rae’s year. Will win: Issa Rae, Insecure Should win: Issa Rae, Insecure Best actor in a TV movie or limited series Robert De Niro plus a prosthetic nose feels more Oscars than Golden Globes, which may nix his chances for The Wizard of Lies here, in addition to the fact that he’s among strong competitors. Paolo Sorrentino’s extraordinary vision of The Young Pope gave Jude Law the chance to smarm and charm as only Law can do, and it would be a nice way to recognise the ambition of this often astonishing series, which has never quite earned the level of acclaim it should have. A win for him would be some way of recognising the show. However, Ewan McGregor was fantastic as the troubled twins Emmit and Ray Stussy, and surely will walk away with it, not least for doing twice the work of everyone else. Will win: Ewan McGregor, Fargo Should win: Jude Law, The Young Pope Best actress in a TV movie or limited series Kidman had two knockout TV roles in 2017, stealing the show as a wafty freckled academic in the divisive Top of the Lake: China Girl, but it’s her subtle and strange turn as a woman in the middle of an abusive relationship that should grab her the honours. It was the meatiest role in Big Little Lies, though she and Reese Witherspoon shared the heavy lifting. Feud’s up for four awards, and Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon could relive the Davis/Crawford rivalry here, but all would be safe choices. The Sinner was as trashy as it was thrilling, in the end, and both aspects were a lot of fun, but it gave Jessica Biel a vehicle that she drove into the sunset with and proved her considerable acting chops. Will win: Nicole Kidman, Big Little Lies Should win: Jessica Biel, The Sinner Best supporting actor Again, star power and a strong storyline should propel Big Little Lies to victory here. Skarsgård plays an excellent creep, and was truly chilling as the picture-perfect husband who never seemed to quite grasp the depravity of his actions. Davids Thewlis and Harbour played it grisly and grizzled for Fargo and Stranger Things respectively, but Alfred Molina’s take on director Robert Aldrich was funny, touching and desperate, and may be one of his finest roles in a long and fine career. Will win: Alexander Skarsgard, Big Little Lies Should win: Alfred Molina, Feud: The Bette and Joan Story Best supporting actress Big Little Lies has two categories pitching its female stars against each other, and this time it’s Laura Dern’s Renata versus the traumatised Jane, played by Shailene Woodley. While Dern offered some necessary balance and even comedy in her uptight, Waspy panic, it may be a case of BLL overload, and Michelle Pfeiffer’s remarkable career comeback continued with a movie-saving turn in HBO’s Madoff drama, for which she’ll probably be rewarded. However, Ann Dowd summoned stern cruelty as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid’s Tale, and it would be no great surprise nor disservice if she walked away with it. Will win: Michelle Pfeiffer, The Wizard of Lies Should win: Ann Dowd, The Handmaid’s Tale"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/29/danny-rampling-primal-scream-best-brit-bands","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T11:00:28Z","webTitle":"Danny Rampling: ‘Primal Scream are one of the best British bands of all time’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/29/danny-rampling-primal-scream-best-brit-bands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/29/danny-rampling-primal-scream-best-brit-bands","fields":{"headline":"Danny Rampling: ‘Primal Scream are one of the best British bands of all time’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The track I’ll be opening my next DJ set with Leftfield: Open Up (Skream Remix) This has always been a great set opener.

She will be the weaker without him, but the fact that she was able to time his departure – delaying it until the end of term, as MPs packed up for Christmas – has given her at least the appearance of control. She has until the new year now to plan a reshuffle that, after the departure of the most unflinching pro-European in cabinet, will require an element of rebalancing. The key role Mr Green has played as prime ministerial aide and stand-in is clear from his membership of all but two of the 21 cabinet committees that shape government policy, including all those directly involved in strategy for exiting the EU. This is a job that requires the prime minister’s complete confidence; he will be hard for her to replace. Mrs May would probably describe the dismissal as orderly. It is all the more remarkable in the light of her record since her disastrous decision to call June’s unnecessary election. In just six months, she has lost her majority; her closest advisers, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill; her defence secretary, Michael Fallon; her secretary for international development, Priti Patel; and now Mr Green – a rate of attrition that would almost certainly have destroyed her predecessors. In the climate of revulsion that has swept the country since the predatory conduct of Harvey Weinstein finally forced the public to confront harassment in all its forms, Mr Green was lucky not to have been suspended weeks ago. It was at the beginning of November that the journalist Kate Maltby, who is also the daughter of family friends, alleged that he had exploited a professional encounter, offering career advice “and in the same breath [making] it clear he was sexually interested”. The cabinet secretary’s report into his conduct said that contradictory accounts of private meetings made it impossible to reach a definitive conclusion as to whether he acted inappropriately, but found her account plausible. In his resignation letter, Mr Green – while still insisting he did not recognise her account – has now apologised for making Ms Maltby feel uncomfortable. That just might have been enough to save his career six weeks ago. But since then, Ms Maltby has been the victim of a series of vicious personal attacks in newspapers sympathetic to Mr Green. This character assassination is completely unacceptable and a powerful deterrent to any young woman who wants to expose and challenge the behaviour of a powerful man. Mrs May should have recognised that and at the least suspended Mr Green at once. Paradoxically, Mr Green may have survived as long as he did for the reason that ultimately forced him to resign. Days after Ms Maltby’s account appeared, a retired police officer, Bob Quick, told the Sunday Times that in a search of Mr Green’s Commons office in 2008, made in the course of a leak inquiry, pornography had been found on the MP’s computer. Mr Green’s immediate response was to deny that he knew anything about it. He still insists he had never downloaded or watched pornography on the computer. But he now admits that his lawyers were told about it at the time, and had further contact on the subject in 2013. He lied. He breached a principle of ministerial conduct, set out in the official code. That is why he was sacked. His friends believe he has been the victim of a long vendetta by the police that has its origins in the row that followed the search of his office. Mr Quick’s conduct – and that of a colleague who backed his allegations – has now been referred by his old bosses at the Metropolitan police to the information commissioner. Regardless of that, it was wrong of Mr Green to lie. All the same, sacking him for this reason has the air of convenience: in doing so, Mrs May has been able to duck more complicated questions about both the pornography allegations and Ms Maltby’s charge. It is evident in the letter she wrote to Mr Green on Wednesday night that Mrs May was genuinely torn between her commitment to promote women in public life, and thus give Ms Maltby’s allegations their due weight, and her loyalty to a friendship that goes back to university days. Her attempts to do both have been less than convincing, and as a result she has failed on both counts. She has been unable to protect her most loyal and reliable ally in cabinet, the politician who perhaps comes closest to sharing her priorities. But she has also failed to make an effective statement against sexual exploitation. In the end, her apparent success is a flimsy thing. She took back control, but in a way that will ultimately leave her weakened."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/29/justine-skyes-dont-think-about-it-giggs-lily-allen","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"Justine Skye’s Don’t Think About It: super-smooth R&B from the Purple Unicorn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/29/justine-skyes-dont-think-about-it-giggs-lily-allen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/29/justine-skyes-dont-think-about-it-giggs-lily-allen","fields":{"headline":"Justine Skye’s Don’t Think About It: super-smooth R&B from the Purple Unicorn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"TRACK OF THE WEEK Justine Skye Don’t Think About It Justine Skye first came to prominence via Tumblr and regular holidays on yachts with Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid. For the zeitgeist-bingo full house, she also refers to herself as the Purple Unicorn. Thankfully, Skye has a habit of knocking out finger-click-friendly R&amp;B mini-bangers such as this, an unhurried mid-tempo with more than a nod to 90s Aaliyah. The supple chorus is so nostalgia-inducing you’ll be reaching for the dungarees and headscarf combo in no time. Lily Allen ft Giggs Trigger Bang Three years after 2014’s muddled comeback Sheezus, Twitter antagonist, disgruntled landlady and occasional singer Lily Allen returns to the melancholic pop that made her so intriguing. Featuring a light dusting of plinky plonk piano and Giggs’s slow-mo drawl, Trigger Bang sounds surprisingly jaunty considering its lyrics touch on the allure of class As, the downward spiral of addiction and – worst of all – missing Neighbours as a child. Børns I Don’t Want U Back Garrett Borns, aka Børns, has crafted the perfect song for anyone who’s felt the warm huff of stagnant breath on their cheek at 7am while trying to wrestle a duvet from beneath an immovable loved one. In essence, I Don’t Want U Back is an expensive-sounding anthem for lone sleepers. “I sleep better than every night you were lying next to me,” Børns croons, likely starfishing alone on satin sheets. White Town Your Woman 1917 It’s 20 years since White Town’s Your Woman topped the UK chart, kickstarting a career that involved a No 57 follow-up and a song entitled The Function of the Orgasm. But White Town, AKA Jyoti Mishra, is finally back with Your Woman 1917, “a version that would have sounded pretty sweet 100 years ago”. It’s an intriguing pop time-travel idea, one I hope other one-hit wonders can replicate; imagine The Ketchup Song bashed out on a clavichord, or Frankee’s FURB reworked for the crumhorn. Camila Cabello Never Be The Same The fifth-best member of Fifth Harmony left for solo stardom last year and things are going quite well so far, thanks. Recent single Havana spent five weeks at No 1 and this follow-up is precision-tooled for Spotify playlist domination: all slightly-too-slow-to-dance-to tempos, mumbled verses equating love with drug addiction and rampant Auto-Tune abuse.

Ten years ago, not long after my 60th birthday, a belated present appeared in the shape of small lump within my penis. I went to a doctor, who diagnosed Peyronie’s disease – a buildup of plaque in the penis. It was a tiny lump and he didn’t seem concerned. But about three months later, I noticed my penis becoming misshapen when erect. It sort of tilted to the left. Very soon after that, my erection was not strong enough for penetration. I remember being shocked; that part of my body was suddenly disabled. A specialist put me on a course of tamoxifen and Viagra. When these didn’t work and my erection was still soft, I tried reducing the plaque via a vacuum device. After that failed, the consultant recommended an implant. It’s a balloon-type object inserted into the penis, which I could pump up when I felt the urge. I couldn’t imagine it; nor could my wife. We’d been together about 20 years, and now our sex lives were over. Mine at 60, hers at 50. The consultant was astonished that I didn’t go for the implant. I told him we found it repulsive, about as non-sexy as you could get. And the Peyronie’s has left me embarrassed about my penis. Of course, sex is always there. It creeps into my thoughts and, I know, into my wife’s. It spices our dreams. And often, it depresses us both. Now 70 and 60 respectively, we haven’t had sex for over a decade (we don’t do “heavy petting”: I don’t think I could stand the frustration). If there’s any consolation, it’s that our life and love has survived. But god we miss it. • Each week a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?

That’s my story and I’m sticking to it. And it’s safe to believe me because 2017, that time of rampant falsity and inexactitude, exemplified by the fact that “fake news” was named word of the year, is long gone. Here and now (2018), we can’t get away with the untruths that there and then (2017) were so prevalent people would even lie about what year it was. In those bad old days (2017), someone might say it was another year – maybe 2018 – an act that now (2018), no one would ever get away with. So what has saved truth? I can answer you in a simple phrase: “Apple”. In fact, “Apple” was named phrase of the year 2018, while word of the year went to “I’ve got a lovely bunch of coconuts” as a result of Adele’s multi-Grammy-winning cover of the song. Her heart-rending interpretation runs to a full six and a half minutes and yet she sings no further than the title line. She’s believed to be bringing out a soul-plumbing rendition of “There they are all standing in a row” in the new year. But Apple is our saviour, thanks to the polygraph machines discreetly fitted to every iPhone which, unbeknown to users, have been measuring the veracity of all of our remarks for several years. Without an average iTruth rating of at least four out of five, no one’s going to believe a word you say. Initial concerns about foreign secretary Boris Johnson’s rating of 0.2 were allayed when he explained he’d “dropped the phone in the bath” while “scrubbing away like Lady Macbeth”. You’ve probably already read dozens of 2018 retrospectives and will have had your fill of the endless analysis of the alien landing on Antarctica, Donald Trump’s instructional video on masturbation and Theresa May’s meltdown on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!, so here are a few less widely reported stories. Tiffany launches “Hum-Bling” jewellery range in time for the Oscars “Winning an Oscar is a humbling experience – everyone says so,” explained a Tiffany spokesperson at the launch of the new designs. “So what better to wear during your humbling triumph than a piece of triumphant Hum-Bling? It’s a more brazen bejewelled look than you’d perhaps associate with Tiffany, but that’s because it’s proclaiming its humility in a voice so commanding that no one will dare contradict it. Sometimes you need a megaphone to make people hear the quietness inside.” H&amp;M Revenue and Customs opens up tax names to sponsorship “It’s just a great extra source of income for the country,” explained the civil servant in charge. “Who cares what the taxes are called as long as people pay them? Advertisers increasingly like a bit of reverse psychology so don’t mind the negative associations of putting their name to a tax.” The launch of “Stomp Duty” in May provided a huge awareness boost for the West End percussion troupe: “It’s a really big tax – people really notice paying it – which has been great for us,” said their public relations officer. Meanwhile eyebrows were raised at Amazon’s decision to sponsor corporation tax: “I think it’s actually a very clever move,” said an analyst from the FT. “Now the tax is named after them, it becomes much harder to report how little of it they pay without it looking like there’s been a typo.” Sections of moon sold to first-time buyers “People are desperate to get on the property ladder and this is a really innovative solution,” said an agent at Foxtons. “I mean, sure, you can’t live there – but one day, maybe. So it has a value, which can be leveraged. It’s an absolutely rock-solid investment – excuse the reference to the fact that the moon is made of rock. At the moment, you can’t get there, there are no walls or roof and you can’t breathe. That is the very definition of a doer‑upper.” Hyde Park’s Fatberg hotel closes after only three weeks “For me, this has been a deeply personal journey,” said the hotel’s founder on its last day of trading, “which has culminated in the painful realisation that I have completely lost my sense of smell. Ultimately, that was the difference between me and the project’s detractors.” Despite generating a lot of publicity around its opening, the hotel, constructed entirely within London’s giant sewer fatberg relocated to the banks of the Serpentine, was plagued with operating glitches: “I mean, you name it: vomiting guests, vomiting staff... yeah, a lot of vomiting… which really knocks back restaurant turnover. They weren’t in the mood for sushi, and the Guinness bar was an absolute ghost town. But still, I’m proud of what we achieved. It’s still got a higher TripAdvisor rating than the Jurys Inn.” It is possible to talk to the dead, statisticians discover A team of eminent statisticians published a report in February stating that there’s an overwhelming statistical likelihood that it’s possible to speak to the dead. “It’s quite straightforward,” explained the professor leading the research. “However small we estimate the chances of any single medium’s attempt to speak to the dead being successful, there will always have been enough such attempts to make the probability of one of them getting through overwhelming. No other conclusion is possible unless you rate one encounter’s success probability as zero rather than merely vanishingly unlikely, and that feels narrow-minded.” Critics pointed out that the study was commissioned by the trade body of clairvoyants, mediums and homeopaths. “It’s sad,” said the Guardian’s higher education correspondent. “These days you can pretty much stick a university crest on whatever finding your market sector needs for as little as £10,000 plus Shake’n’Vat.” European parliament hides from Nigel Farage Dramatic footage emerged in March of Nigel Farage walking into the chamber of the European parliament to find it empty. “We heard him coming – he was talking on his phone about how annoying it is that when you buy duty-free gin on an aeroplane, it comes in a plastic bottle,” one MEP told BBC News. “So we were like, ‘Shh shh, let’s hide!’ We were determined to remain hidden until we made him cry which, as it turned out, only took 12 seconds. Then we came out and he pretended he thought it was funny, which was actually the worst thing I have ever seen happen to a human face, and I used to be a surgeon in a burns unit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/12/experience-i-took-my-mother-to-dignitas","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T09:59:26Z","webTitle":"I took my mother to Dignitas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/12/experience-i-took-my-mother-to-dignitas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/12/experience-i-took-my-mother-to-dignitas","fields":{"headline":"I took my mother to Dignitas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I always called my mum “Sandy”. Once, as a kid, I asked, “Can I call you Mum?” And she said, “Of course, and I’ll call you Sonnypie.” From the age of six, after she split from my stepdad, it was just the two of us. There were lots of rude words and giggling, listening to music and dancing, and she was proud of me when I became a musician. When my wife and I had our first daughter, she became Grandy, but she never met our youngest. In May 2016, she started getting bad headaches, and the next month, we had a diagnosis: a brain tumour. She had three months to live, at 66. It was crushing, but seeing Sandy ask her sister Norah to look after me was also beautiful. That night, she texted me about a drive we’d been on together in ridiculous rain, when she’d parked up and we’d lain in the road and the rain just hit our faces. I cried and cried. Sandy didn’t want hospitals, pain and palliative care – she just wanted to die. It was so intrinsic to who she was that, in a funny way, none of us was surprised by her decision. But while you spend your whole life worrying about dying, when it comes to wanting to do it you realise how difficult it is. She found a load of morphine from when her sister was dying of cancer, and decided to take it. But the attempt failed, and that’s when she decided to go to Dignitas. We spoke to someone who had travelled to Dignitas with their loved one and was happy to speak to us about their experience. Sandy emailed Dignitas, letting them know she had a deadline of less than three months. Then she started the process of collecting letters and documents, and transferring money – it would cost £12,000 all in. The next weeks were precious. I’d spend half the week with Sandy at her home in Oxford, the other half with my family in London while Norah took over, and every weekend we would all have a big Sunday lunch together. She didn’t have any other visitors: she didn’t want to be at her funeral before she died. We danced in the front room, drove to the country listening to playlists of her favourite music, watched films like Die Hard and one awful Adam Sandler movie. She sat in her bed in an opiate high with the sun beaming down and a breeze through the window. She got the green light from Dignitas and Sandy, Norah and I flew out in August. The doctor came to our hotel and asked her, over and over, “Is this what you want?” She bit his hand off. The next morning, I remember Sandy, Norah and I laughing at the word ausfahrt in the cab, before the building came into view. Volunteers welcomed us, then there were more interviews and more documents to sign. Sandy took the first vial of liquid to line her stomach, then we walked around the garden to wait the half hour before she could take the next step. We had tea and a biscuit, and Sandy sat on the sofa between Norah and me and we hugged, before she took the final vial. When she turned to me, I did an over-the-top wave and said a cheery “Goodbyeeee!” and she giggled. Then she went to sleep in our arms and died about an hour later. It’s only supposed to take 10 minutes – that’s how strong her body still was. Driving back from the airport next to an empty seat, I thought, thank God she got there in time. Throughout it all, I was writing music: I recorded a song on my phone in the car park after the diagnosis; on all the drives to Oxford; and lying next to her when she was asleep. It was very therapeutic, but also sad because she wanted to listen to the songs: I couldn’t play them to her without leaving her for a few weeks to record them. Now it’s an album she’ll never hear. What shocks me most is that the thing I was so scared of throughout my childhood ended up being a moment of such freedom; that the experience of Sandy’s death brought so much good into our lives. • As told to Moya Sarner.

One is a black and white portrait showing them in an intimate embrace, and the other is a more formal portrait of them sitting together holding hands. The 33-year-old prince and his bride-to-be announced their engagement on 27 November and they are set to marry at St George’s Chapel, Windsor, on 19 May. Lubomirski, whose previous subjects have included the actors Julia Roberts, Julianne Moore and Angelina Jolie, took the portraits this week at Frogmore House, Windsor. He said: “It was an incredible honour to be asked to document this wonderful event, but also a great privilege to be invited to share and be witness to this young couple’s love for one another. “I cannot help but smile when I look at the photos that we took of them, such was their happiness together.” Markle, 36, an American actor best known for her role in the legal drama Suits, displays her engagement ring in both studies. The ring was designed by Harry. In one image she holds his face, and in the other she sits just below him on the steps of Frogmore. On Wednesday Markle joined senior royals at a Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace.

This year, we have been royally blessed. Last night gave us the first of a three-part Little Women (BBC One), Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 children’s classic, and of a two-part The Miniaturist, Jessie Burton’s 2014 bestselling debut, and each was – forgive me – a cracker. Slight initial misgivings about the amount of head-tilted, winsome smiling going on in the opening minutes of Little Women vanished as a confident and charming production hit its stride. The makers avoided the sentimentality that is easily introduced into the tale of Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth making their way to maturity in the world while their father is off fighting on the side of the angels in the American civil war. More importantly, they rightly judged that this is neither the year nor the time of year for a revisionist Alcott. Emily Watson as Marmee and Angela Lansbury – Angela Lansbury! – as Aunt March are magnificent and all the girls hit the right spots. Meg (Willa Fitzgerald) was gentle and sensible (we haven’t yet got to the bit where she goes to the Moffats’ dance and gets her shoulders out for the lads) without being dull, Amy was whatever the 19th-century Massachusetts phrase for “fabulous, shade-throwing badass” is, Beth was … well, she was Beth and you either love her or hate her, but, whatever your mileage, you should know that she survives until at least next week. Jo was fully and completely Jo, a rambunctious, gangly, non-standard beauty, throwing herself around Concord with Laurie until the creative urge consumes her in the garret again. (Laurie, incidentally, is played so persuasively by Jonah Hauer-King that I may have to revisit my long-held opinion that Jo was right to reject him in the end and that he and Amy deserve each other. I hope this is the very last recalibration of childhood beliefs the year will hold.) None of the big moments have been missed so far. Jo has burned Meg’s hair off, Mr Laurence (Michael Gambon, who obviously had two days to kill at some point this year and thought, “Yeah, well, why not?”) has been stern to everyone and a big softie with Beth, and the Hummels have been fed the March Christmas muffins. We have also – and I must take a moment to compose myself – had a faithful rendering of the Manuscript Moment. Amy, piqued by Jo’s refusal to take her to the theatre with Meg and Laurie, burns Jo’s only copy of the story she has written. When Jo thereafter fails to pass on Laurie’s warning about the ice when they go skating later, Amy plunges through. As in the book, instead of leaving her to drown she helps to save her and the whole thing is turned into a lesson for Jo about learning to control her temper. Balls to that, say I, even at Christmas. When I adapt Little Women, everything after the foolscap turns to ashes will comprise the delivery of ever-more barbaric and yet still wholly and forevermore justified tortures of Amy, culminating in icy death and a hell spent having her nose flattened under a deadweight of pickled limes. Justice cometh, Jo, I promise. The Miniaturist (BBC One) was a full-sized treat. What with being set in 1686’s Amsterdam an’ all, it’s very Vermeery, which I am all for (and don’t write in and tell me he died in 1675, unless you think the Dutch middle classes changed their domestic interiors and threw out their wardrobes the moment his obituary hit that week’s Delft Herald), and beautiful as well as being a whopping good story. Nella Oortman arrives at the house of her new husband Johannes Brandt (who secured her hand in marriage by paying off her family’s debts) to be met not by him but his unimpressed sister, Marin. She makes Mrs Danvers look like Ma Larkin. The house is full of mystery, power plays, love letters, sex-vibes and a doll’s house furnished by an unseen artisan who somehow knows, then starts to predict, what happens in the house of increasingly ill repute. The writing and the acting is as stunning as the scenery and it sent me scurrying off to find the book. The concluding part tonight will be a tremendous treat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/28/halifax-card-application-credit-rating","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"Halifax’s incompetence has left me with a poor credit rating for months","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/28/halifax-card-application-credit-rating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/28/halifax-card-application-credit-rating","fields":{"headline":"Halifax’s incompetence has left me with a poor credit rating for months","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I applied online for a credit card with Halifax, which failed because of a “system error”.

She plays a smart woman whose elite poker club attracts stars, billionaires, mobsters and, ultimately, the FBI. It could almost be a female Goodfellas but often tries a little too hard. Out from New Year’s Day 2 Star Wars: The Last Jedi (12A) (Rian Johnson, 2017, US) 152 mins You get a lot for your buck with this crowd-pleaser, which packs in backstory and action, honouring the saga’s lore but with added surprises. Mark Hamill’s Luke and Carrie Fisher’s Leia return, while Daisy Ridley’s Rey and Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren form a connection that could go either way. 3 Pitch Perfect 3 (12A) (Trish Sie, 2017, US) 94 mins Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and co embark on another round of slapstick and a cappella competitiveness. Despite a plot that takes in long-lost fathers and action scenes, it’s consistently funny. Everyone here is singing from the same hymn sheet. 4 Mountain (PG) (Jennifer Peedom, 2017, Aus) 74 mins Something of a palate cleanser in contrast to current blockbusters, this nature documentary offers a different kind of big-screen experience, with its grand, vertiginous vistas and high-altitude extreme pursuits. Unobtrusive narration (written by Robert Macfarlane, spoken by Willem Dafoe) and a symphonic score complete the sublime experience. 5 Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (12A) (Jake Kasdan, 2017, US) 118 mins For the Star Wars-averse; teens find themselves inside an Indiana Jones-style video game, in the bodies of Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart and (in the case of the self-absorbed queen bee) Jack Black.

The main work is a concert staging, devised by Daisy Evans, of Bartók’s only opera, with Robert Hayward and Claudia Mahnke as the protagonists. Before it, Elder conducts a pair of orchestral showpieces: Liadov’s The Enchanted Lake and Dukas’s The Sorcerer’s Apprentice. Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, 5 January; touring to 7 January 2 Baroque at the Edge Early January is an unlikely time to launch a music festival in London, but Baroque at the Edge, the brainchild of Lindsay Kemp, is no an ordinary baroque music festival. Its idea is to invite performers from classical, jazz, and world music backgrounds to take baroque music as the starting point for their own musical explorations. The weekend begins with a recital by pianist Joanna MacGregor; others appearing include the Marian Consort, the Persian percussionist Keyvan Chamerani, and the viols player Paolo Pandolfo. LSO St Luke’s and St James Clerkenwell, EC1, 5-7 January 3 Jörg Widmann The Wigmore’s artist in residence features as both clarinettist and composer in this appearance, for which he is joined by viola player Tabea Zimmermann and pianist Dénes Várjon. Schumann’s Märchenerzählungen and Märchenbilder, and Mozart’s Kegelstatt Trio K498, are interleaved with two of Widmann’s own works. There’s the UK premiere of his Es War Einmal, co-commissioned by the Wigmore Hall, and his solo party piece, the Fantasie for clarinet. Wigmore Hall, W1, 4 January AC Five of the best ... exhibitions 1 Rose Wylie This exhibition is rollicking entertainment. Rose Wylie is 83 but she paints with a childlike exuberance that is easily mistaken for hamfisted chaos. The longer you spend in the show, however, the more poetic and beautiful her colours become, in strong, vital, memorable images of holidays, music, chocolate biscuits and the Blitz. There is something very civilised about the way she celebrates the gallery’s Hyde Park location in paintings of dogs, ducks and park benches. It’s even called Quack Quack. Serpentine Sackler Gallery, W2, to 11 February 2 Rachel Whiteread Art does not come much more ghostly than Rachel Whiteread’s eerie casts of the forgotten spaces in abandoned homes. She is like a paranormal researcher seeking out the spookiest corners of an old house. She makes her casts under the stairs, below the floorboards, in a room that no one has been into since an unspecified event. An eerie teller of strange tales and one of our most magical artists. Tate Britain, SW1, to 21 January 3 Cézanne Portraits Need a New Year purgative? There is no more intelligent artist than Paul Cézanne and no better way to get your brain working again than a visit to this great survey of his portraits: from early images of his family and friends, whose naive style contains massive pathos, to his late works that question the nature of human identity. If you feel bad after one too many seasonal drinks, just take a look at what Cézanne saw when he looked in the mirror: the perplexed mask of a man unsure of everything. National Portrait Gallery, WC2, to 11 February 4 Susan Philipsz That contemplative moment between Christmas and the New Year is something to cherish, and this atmospheric exhibition will have you looking deep into your soul. A lone violinist plays on a big screen in the middle of a vast, dark space. The sounds of her strings reverberate in the shadows. As the music rises and falls, you become newly aware of the mysterious power of sound. BALTIC, Gateshead, to 4 March 5 Peter Doig What does Peter Doig do at this time of year? Skiing is a good guess, for winter sports are among the favourite themes of this strangely perfect painter. His chalet is being paid for this year by a seasonal display of his highly saleable paintings. No one could begrudge him, since his very solid, very real, yet utterly bizarre pictorial world of hippies, musicians, hikers, empty seas and fir forests is one of the strongest artistic visions of our time. Michael Werner Gallery, W1, to 17 February JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows 1 Romantics Anonymous It’s goodbye to Emma Rice and it’s goodbye to her swansong show at the Globe. A bittersweet moment, and this is definitely a bittersweet show focusing on a pair of painfully shy chocolate-makers, who are so crippled by fear and social inadequacy that their fledgling love affair seems doomed. There are plenty of melting moments in a low-key but rewarding musical that has a saucy sense of fun and a rich dark heart. Lovely stuff, and not just for the sweet-toothed. Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to 6 January 2 Follies It may be flawed, but Stephen Sondheim’s 1971 musical, about a group of showgirls and their husbands gathering for a reunion in an old theatre due for demolition, is still a heart-breaker. It’s a show about broken youthful dreams and the pain of middle age and it’s all the better for being so unsentimentally staged in Dominic Cooke’s revival, which has a Chekhovian blush. Starring Tracie Bennett, Janie Dee and Imelda Staunton, it ends this week and is sold out, but day tickets should be available. National Theatre: Olivier, SE1, to 3 January 3 Girl from the North Country An Old Vic transfer you shouldn’t think twice about, this play with songs brings together the talents of Conor McPherson and Bob Dylan. Playwright McPherson entwines Dylan’s songs with real atmospheric effect to tell the story of the residents of a rundown boarding house eking out life in the shadow of the Great Depression. Noël Coward Theatre, WC2, to 24 March 4 The Little Matchgirl and Other Happier Tales Hans Christian Andersen’s stories can seem mawkish, but Joel Horwood and Emma Rice bring out the magic and the social satire in this beautifully staged set of stories. Thumbelina becomes a refugee, The Emperor’s New Clothes sends up the fashion industry, and with the flare of a match the title story points the finger at a contemporary world where millions of children live in poverty. Smart stuff delivered with a dusty magic. Bristol Old Vic, to 14 January 5 Matilda: The Musical The aching When I Grow Up is just one of Tim Minchin’s sweet, witty songs that keep this musical version of Roald Dahl’s novel top of the West End class. Matthew Warchus’s brilliantly drilled production features smart kids and gruesome adults including the nightmarish Miss Trunchbull, the head teacher who hates children, especially the super-bright Matilda. Cambridge Theatre, WC2, to 10 February 2019 LG Three of the best ... dance shows 1 Ballet Theatre UK: Snow Queen Created in 2015, this is a nice alternative to the season’s Nutcrackers, a highly visual adaptation of Andersen’s tale about siblings Kay and Gerda and their encounter with the malevolent Queen of the Frozen North. Brighton Dome, 30 December; touring to 27 January 2 Boing! This is the final weekend for Travelling Light’s lovely evocation of the tingling delirium of Christmas Eve, a story of two small boys waiting for the arrival of Father Christmas.

But what is the government doing? Looking after their own voters, again. The chancellor is pouring another £10bn into the help-to-buy programme next year, despite the government’s own evidence that the last £10bn helped largely better-off buyers who would have bought anyway. Help to buy offers an interest-free government loan worth up to 20% of a property’s value for new-build homes. But of those using it, one in five are already homeowners: Shelter finds their incomes are higher than those of young renters in the English regions where the scheme is used most. It has made things worse for the rest of the would-be first-time buyers, pushing up house prices further beyond their reach. Even for those in the scheme, it has inflated the price of properties they buy: new-build has outstripped secondhand by 15% since the start of help to buy. Who benefited most? The biggest house builders, wallowing in cash poured straight into their pockets: their profits tripled since the scheme began. Persimmon hit the news when its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, took a bonus of £110m, corporate looting straight from the taxpayer via help to buy. Some 150 senior Persimmon staff shared another £500m from the same trough. The chair resigned when his plea to Fairburn to donate to charity fell on stony ground. But as all greedy executives find, the cash is well worth one day’s embarrassing news, one blush-making annual meeting. Theresa May’s new name-and-shame list of corporate rapacity will probably not cost them much sleep, as there’s safety in numbers. That’s just normal business as usual. The real shocker is that despite all the evidence, the government chooses to put another £10bn into the same well-filled pockets. Even the Adam Smith institute calls it “throwing petrol onto a bonfire”. If originally the scheme was to kickstart house building, it did a bit, but its main intent was to help the young who would never afford to buy. There is no possible excuse for redoubling a scheme they know largely helps the better-off buy bigger homes sooner. What could that £10bn buy? Shelter says 125,000 new social homes could be built by councils or housing associations for those on housing waiting lists. But few of them are Tory voters. Help to buy is another help to vote Tory policy for the children of their people. So much madness in the housing “market” is a direct cause of government action. The price of land has tripled since 1995 – and there is never more land, only inflation. The misuse of quantitative easing money not to invest in creative and productive growth, but to inflate property assets should stand as a text-book case of what never to do again. Imagine what that £10bn could do in the hands of the charities we are raising money for this Christmas. Donations are magnificent, but what an affront donors must feel at this gross misuse of so much state money. At our telethon appeal on Saturday we listened to readers’ distress at the multiplying numbers of rough sleepers in doorways all round the country. Homelessness – the well-predicted result of housing benefit and other benefit cuts – becomes politically dangerous when destitution floods onto the streets for all to see. Famously the last Tory government had their own MPs complaining about having to step over sleeping bags when they came out of the opera house in Covent Garden. Foreign film crews piled into Waterloo’s cardboard city as the perfect symbol of Thatcherism. Food banks and rough sleeping are now the public face of this Tory era, that will end as changing public attitudes show rising concern at so much deliberately induced destitution. • Donate to the Guardian and Observer appeal here • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/21/nhs-figures-show-sharp-rise-in-patients-waiting-for-ae-care","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T12:45:39Z","webTitle":"NHS figures show sharp rise in patients waiting for A&E care","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/21/nhs-figures-show-sharp-rise-in-patients-waiting-for-ae-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/21/nhs-figures-show-sharp-rise-in-patients-waiting-for-ae-care","fields":{"headline":"NHS figures show sharp rise in patients waiting for A&E care","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Growing numbers of patients taken to hospital by ambulance are having to wait an hour or more before they are handed over to A&amp;E staff for treatment, NHS England figures show. In the week to last Sunday, 17 December, one in seven such patients faced a delay of at least 30 minutes in the back of an ambulance or an area of the hospital where the crew look after them, up from one in eight the week before. Hospitals are finding it impossible to stick to tough rules brought in for this winter by NHS England and NHS Improvement requiring that no patient should have to wait more than 15 minutes. In a further sign of the extra pressure the NHS is under this winter, the number of times A&amp;E units had to temporarily divert patients elsewhere because they could not cope with the demand for care rose from 25 the previous week to 30. Gateshead hospital trust had to do so nine times, including four times on 13 December alone, while the main trust providing acute care in Worcestershire did it eight times. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Patients should be under no illusions: there has been an appalling winter downturn across our NHS over the past month. Despite the heroic efforts of our brilliant NHS staff, it’s unacceptable that so many patients have been stuck in the back of ambulances for such a long time.” In the week to 17 December, 14,323 patients in England (15% of the total) waited at least half an hour before they were handed over for A&amp;E care, up from 11,852 the previous week, a 21% increase. Of those patients, 10,899 were unable to access A&amp;E care for between 30 and 60 minutes, up from 9,515 the week before, and 3,424 waited at least an hour, up from 2,337. A total of 95,392 patients arrived by ambulance at hospital emergency departments in England last week. Some trusts fared significantly worse than the England average: at least one in three patients in 11 trusts waited 30 minutes or more before being admitted to A&amp;E. According to official NHS figures 93% of ambulance patients arriving at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS foundation trust and half of ambulance patients attending United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS trust had to wait 30 minutes or more. Ashworth said that during the first month of winter a total of 46,993 patients had had to wait in the back of ambulances for more than 30 minutes, and 9,775 had had to wait for longer than an hour. “There has been an 86% rise in the number of delays for over one hour in just the past two weeks as the cold snap has hit,” he said. The general and acute bed occupancy rate in hospitals rose from 94.6% to 95%, far above the 85% level experts consider the maximum to maintain safe patient care. Slightly fewer beds – 1,071 a day on average – were closed last week as a result of norovirus, the winter vomiting bug. But NHS England said the number of incidents was growing. For example, norovirus forced Northumbria Healthcare in the north-east to close and seal seven wards at four of its hospitals. “Every year we are affected by norovirus but this is the worst it’s been for a few years. All our main sites have people with the bug on them in some shape or form,” said Dr Jeremy Rushmer, the trust’s medical director. The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb said: “These figures show the NHS is under huge strain as we enter the Christmas period. Hospitals are suffering from a severe lack of beds and A&amp;Es are already under intolerable pressure. “No patient should ever have to wait in pain in the back of an ambulance outside A&amp;E, yet this is now becoming a routine occurrence across the country.” An NHS England spokesman said: The recent cold snap has seen hospitals put under pressure, but they are generally coping. Additional services and beds will be coming online over the next few weeks funded by the [£337m] winter budget cash released by the government. Staff are working hard to ensure ambulance handovers are as smooth as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2017/dec/30/we-rebel-against-the-system-inside-sowetos-thriving-punk-scene","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘We rebel against the system’: inside Soweto’s thriving punk scene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/dec/30/we-rebel-against-the-system-inside-sowetos-thriving-punk-scene","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/dec/30/we-rebel-against-the-system-inside-sowetos-thriving-punk-scene","fields":{"headline":"‘We rebel against the system’: inside Soweto’s thriving punk scene","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"On a downtown street corner in Johannesburg, Puleng Seloane is trying to get a mosh pit going. He and the three other members of the Soweto punk band TCIYF are playing an impromptu gig, and a group of young men have gathered to watch. “This is the only punk band I’ve seen on Instagram,” says onlooker Masta Za, 20, filming on his phone. “I was like: ‘What, a punk band from Soweto?’” Za, who usually listens to hip-hop, says he likes what TCIYF are doing. “This music is better for my generation. They’re not promoting depressed music … They’re just happy.” This Soweto is starkly different to the tumultuous Soweto that members of TCIYF were born into in the 1980s. In 1976, massive student protests erupted in the township over the apartheid government’s education system, sparking a violent state crackdown that led to international sanctions against South Africa. Today, Soweto is a thriving, sprawling urban hub, home to 1.27 million South Africans. Unemployment is high and some residents still lack basic services, but it also has a sizeable middle class, malls and rising property prices. “A lot of places are boring. Soweto is not,” says Thulasizwe Nkosi, 29, the guitarist and de facto spokesman of TCIYF. “There are no rules here.” TCIYF is at the heart of a small but thriving punk scene that will gain more followers at this weekend’s Afropunk festival in Johannesburg. It is the first time the globetrotting culture and music festival has been held in Africa. The band’s penchant for skating, cold beer and heavy guitar riffs – rarely heard in Soweto before they came along – has been attracting the attention of magazines and documentarians interested in how they and their friends are redefining punk subculture on their own terms. “Punk chose us,” says Nkosi, who sports rainbow-hued dreads, blue-tinted sunglasses and a chain hanging from his skinny jeans. “It’s a calling.” In keeping with punk tradition, TCIYF claim they make up their music as they go along. It is is fast and loud, with lyrics that range from subjects such as their grandmothers’ fixation with Tupperware to getting drunk on wine at church and growing up without fathers. “The generation before us was very weak. I don’t know what the government did with them – what they put in the water,” says Nkosi, who has a young daughter. “We’re doing a better job.” Like the Sex Pistols, who sent 1970s Britain into shock with calls for anarchy, Nkosi and his friends say they are fuelled by frustration with the status quo. The country’s unemployment rate is close to 30%, and young black South Africans bear the brunt. There are still neighbourhoods in every major city that don’t receive electricity and water, and President Jacob Zuma’s government has been mired in scandal and allegations of gross corruption. TCIYF see themselves as offering a voice for disenfranchised youth, lashing out at the “robots” of society and proselytising on life without a day job. “We are rebelling against the system: going to work every day, waking up, running after the bus,” says Mbuso “Moose” Zulu, 31, one of the founders of Soweto’s skate punk scene. “There’s so much more you can do.” The scene was started in 2010 when Nkosi, Zulu and friends formed the skate collective Skate Society Soweto. They started playing music, too, and before long founded Soweto Rock Revolution, which organises music and skate events under the motto “no politics, no hatred and no bullshit”. The heart of the scene is Dube, a Soweto suburb named after the first president of the ruling African National Congress. Here, bands regularly turn up to play on an outdoor stage in a converted backyard adorned with graffiti and murals. The events attract a diverse crowd, still unusual in South Africa, who enjoy copious amounts of beer and guitar feedback. Through their music and skating, TCIYF and their friends are trying to create something new in Soweto, particularly for younger people. In the township, Zulu says, if someone tells their parents they want to go to art school, they will be told they are crazy and asked how they’re going to feed their family. He wants to show the younger generation that there’s “more to life than being a doctor or lawyer. They just need a positive influence.” Inspired by a 2003 documentary about black punks in the US, the Afropunk festivals have grown into sprawling events celebrating black culture that attract tens of thousands of people. This weekend’s event in Johannesburg is being staged at Constitution Hill, a former prison complex. “It’s wonderful to be in a place that has so much history, so much of which we can kind of rewrite,” says Matthew Morgan, co-founder of the Afropunk festivals. “Johannesburg feels like New York to me 30 years ago. The opportunity is there, and I like that.” TCIYF are not South Africa’s first taste of punk culture. While punk was scandalising the UK in the 1970s, a small punk scene was forming in South Africa, featuring anti-establishment bands such as Wild Youth and National Wake, whose members were put under police surveillance for their anti-apartheid stance. Morgan says Afropunk has been supporting TCIYF for a couple of years and the band fit well into how the movement has come to define punk. “I’m a black British kid who grew up in the 70s and 80s in the UK,” he says. “I’ve never been trying to recreate a black version of white punk rock. If you’re a person of colour in music and you’re pushing the boundaries, that’s punk rock to me.” The drinks manufacturer Red Bull has also been backing TCIYF in the run-up to the Johannesburg event, and as the band set up for another pop-up show at a notoriously dodgy taxi rank downtown, a photographer snaps away. But the band seem unbothered by the apparent incongruity of having a corporate sponsor for their trademark anti-consumerism. They play a short, loud set to a semi-circle of befuddled onlookers amid the fruit sellers and minibus taxis ferrying people around the city. An elderly woman passing by gives the band a sharp elbow and a disapproving look. They think it’s hilarious and play her a cheeky tribute. “Thank you, Super Granny!” Seloane calls into his mic. It’s a moment that encapsulates what TCIYF is about: being inspired by punk’s history but not bound to its old rules. A couple of women on their way through the area stop to soak up the unexpected sight of four guys from Soweto, thrashing. “I love this music,” says Lemon Npanjwa, 30. “It’s hardcore.” If you have experiences relating to this article that you’d like to share, please email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/26/the-best-of-the-long-read-in-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T07:00:42Z","webTitle":"The best of the Long Read in 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/26/the-best-of-the-long-read-in-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/26/the-best-of-the-long-read-in-2017","fields":{"headline":"The best of the Long Read in 2017","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every year, it seems like the world gets even worse and the Guardian publishes a hundred long reads about it.

At one point he worked as an assistant for the physicists Otto Frisch and Joseph Rotblat in the secret “tube alloys” experiments that led to the creation of the atom bomb, apparently without knowing what the project was about. Born in Brixton, south London, to Arthur, an accounts clerk for a dog biscuit factory, and Ellen (nee Stallard), a cleaner, Bryan had a cleft palate at birth; reconstructive surgery was not undertaken until he was 13. Because of the Depression his father struggled for work and the family moved frequently – Bryan attended more than 10 schools, and his education was basic. As a child he developed a fascination for the element radium, having read a biography of Marie Curie. On leaving school it was suggested to him that working in a hospital supporting radiotherapists might be an outlet for this interest. The second world war had just begun, and for a year he worked at Westminster hospital in London, where duties included collecting fragments of incendiary bombs to recover magnesium alloy, and lowering the radioactive material into a borehole sunk into the clay far below the level of the Thames during bombing raids. In late 1940 his father moved to Southport for work, and Bryan and his mother followed the next year. Bryan took a reference to James Chadwick at Liverpool University, and was taken on as a junior lab assistant helping Frisch and Rotblat. During this time, Bryan also studied for his school certificate at night classes. When the secret work was moved to the US, Bryan was left behind and called up for army service. Despite five years’ relevant experience with radiation, it was his interest in photography that led to him being trained as a radiographer by the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving for three years in Palestine. After army service, a number of radiography positions followed before he moved into radiotherapy and returned to Westminster hospital for five years from 1950, during which period he became a fellow of the Society of Radiographers. He also met Enid Sutton, a medical secretary at Westminster, and they married in 1951. From 1955 until his retirement in 1990, Bryan was superintendent radiotherapist at Pembury hospital in Kent, where his focus was always to alleviate for his patients, as far as possible, the frightening experience of cancer treatment by radiation. During his tenure the department developed considerably (including the construction of a cobalt unit in the 1960s). As a young man Bryan was a communist, but joined the Labour party during the early 1950s. After moving to Tunbridge Wells in 1955 he canvassed for the local party, one year standing unsuccessfully for election as a local councillor. He is survived by Enid and their three children, Alison, Matthew and me, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/30/this-week-best-radio-ed-balls-musical-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"This week’s best radio: Ed Balls on musical theatre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/30/this-week-best-radio-ed-balls-musical-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/30/this-week-best-radio-ed-balls-musical-theatre","fields":{"headline":"This week’s best radio: Ed Balls on musical theatre","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As 2018 begins, the former economic secretary to the Treasury consults with the former speaker of the House of Commons on the subject of a shared interest in musicals.

The Conversations from a Long Marriage (New Year’s Day, 11.30am, Radio 4) take place between Joanna Lumley and Roger Allam, who play a couple who have been married for more than 40 years. Topics covered include statins, knees that don’t perform as they once did, the many opportunities modern life affords to be patronised by people half one’s age and the ticklish problem of reconciling the dance you are doing in your head with the one your body appears to be performing of its own accord. This one-off comedy was written by Jan Etherington with Lumley in mind. 50 Years of Just A Minute: Nicholas Parsons in Conversation with Paul Merton (New Year’s Day, 6.15pm, Radio 4) has the irrepressibly perky host quizzed by his unfailingly puzzled guest, and can be relied upon to get to the big questions. Did Parsons sport his trademark cravat back when he worked as an engineering apprentice on the Glasgow docks? And how does it feel to have seen his own fame increase while Arthur Haynes, the TV comic he was once the straight man for, has faded away into obscurity? Returning to prominence elsewhere is Tudor-era lawyer and PI Matthew Shardlake in a dramatisation of the CJ Sansom novel Heartstone (Weekdays, 7.45pm, Radio 4), set against the background of the war of 1545 and the sinking of the Mary Rose in the Solent. Also, John Finnemore’s ever reliable Souvenir Programme (4 January, 6.30pm, Radio 4) is back with the usual cast for a seventh series. And it’s no less than series 95 of The News Quiz (5 January, 6.30pm, Radio 4) in which Miles Jupp is joined by Jeremy Hardy, Andy Hamilton, Susan Calman and Hugo Rifkind. The Canon is a film podcast that also has much in common with books podcast Backlisted. Both suggest you can get a lot of pleasure out of things that aren’t new. Recent Backlisted eps have discussed books such as Gordon Burn’s Alma Cogan and RF Delderfield’s To Serve Them All My Days. Meanwhile, The Canon sees film buff Amy Nicholson joined by someone who nominates a favourite film to be included in the titular roll of honour. Recent episodes have looked at Last Tango in Paris, The Philadelphia Story and Back to the Future. Because the films are familiar, the conversation inclines to what they tell us about life rather than cinema, which is a refreshing change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/21/devastating-climate-change-could-see-one-million-migrants-a-year-entering-eu-by-2100","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T19:00:32Z","webTitle":"Devastating climate change could lead to 1m migrants a year entering EU by 2100","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/21/devastating-climate-change-could-see-one-million-migrants-a-year-entering-eu-by-2100","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/21/devastating-climate-change-could-see-one-million-migrants-a-year-entering-eu-by-2100","fields":{"headline":"Devastating climate change could lead to 1m migrants a year entering EU by 2100","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Climate change will drive a huge increase in the number of migrants seeking asylum in Europe if current trends continue, according to a new study. The number of migrants attempting to settle in Europe each year will triple by the end of the century based on current climate trends alone, independent of other political and economic factors, according to the research. Even if efforts to curb global warming are successful, the number of applications for asylum could rise by a quarter, the authors predict. Wolfram Schlenker, professor at the school of international and public affairs at Columbia University in New York, and lead author of the study, said: “Europe will see increasing numbers of desperate people fleeing their home countries.” Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who was not involved with the report, told the Guardian the results should be taken seriously by policymakers, though current forecasting models frequently fail to take such factors into account. He said: “This study shows how Europe will be impacted by one of the most serious impacts of climate change. Hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of people will be exposed to coastal sea level rise and shifts in extreme weather that will cause mass migrations away from the most vulnerable locations. We know from human history that such migrations often lead to conflict and war, with devastating consequences. The huge potential costs of migration-related conflict are usually omitted from economic models of climate change impacts in the future.” Climate change is predicted to result in more droughts, floods, heatwaves, and other extreme weather, as well as more intense storms and rising sea levels. These effects are likely to render agriculture more difficult, if not impossible, across swathes of the globe, including sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. These effects will also be felt in Europe, but its lower base temperatures, relative prosperity and advanced infrastructure mean the damage could be contained, and make it an attractive destination for migrants. Migration, or attempted migration, to Europe has increased markedly in the last decade, with leading causes including the war in Syria, turmoil in north Africa and the middle East, and a burgeoning young population with few economic prospects in many regions of Africa and the middle East. The new study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, was initiated and largely funded by the EU’s Joint Research Centre, with contribution from the US Department of Energy, and led by scientists at Columbia University in New York. The authors of the study examined asylum applications in the EU from 103 countries between 2000 and 2014, during which time applications averaged more than 350,000 a year. They compared the applications with information on environmental factors, such as temperature and weather, and adjusted the data for factors such as conflict and political turmoil. In doing so, they spotted a trend correlating weather and changes in the number of asylum applications. For instance, countries with average temperatures around 20C – the optimum for growing many crops – show a higher number of applications, while there are fewer asylum seekers from areas with cooler temperatures. The data showed that the more temperatures in a country’s key agricultural regions rose above 20C in the growing season, the more people left their homes for another country. They recorded increases in the number of migrants from hot places such as Iraq and Pakistan when temperatures rose. However, immigration from colder countries fell when temperatures rose towards 20C. The scientists posit that as the globe warms, the number of people seeking asylum in Europe will correspondingly rise. Warming of 2.6C to 4.8C, which climate experts say is likely unless stronger action is taken to bring down greenhouse gas emissions, would result in as many as 660,000 additional asylum seekers coming to Europe each year by 2100, according to the model. Linking migration to climate change is controversial. Although many scientists, and many studies, are clear that rising temperatures and extreme weather are likely to increase migration, it is difficult to separate this factor from the myriad other factors that drive people to flee their homes. A drought in Syria from 2006 to 2010 was posited, in a 2015 study, as a factor behind that country’s civil war, which broke out in 2011 and still rages. Immigration, especially in the wake of the financial crisis and recessions which crippled European economies a decade ago and whose effects are only now beginning to subside, has become one of the hottest political issues in Europe. It was cited as one of the biggest factors in the UK’s referendum on EU membership, and has played a major role in recent elections in Germany and France. Schlenker said a rise in migration owing to climate change could exacerbate political tensions further. “Europe is already conflicted about how many refugees to admit. Though poorer countries in hotter regions are most vulnerable to climate change, our findings highlight the extent to which countries are interlinked.” Solomon Hsiang, professor at Berkeley, University of California, and author of a previous study linking conflict and climate change, who was not involved with the current research, said the world must prepare. “We will need to build new institutions and systems to manage this steady flow of asylum-seekers. As we have seen from recent experience in Europe, there are tremendous costs, both for refugees and their hosts, when we are caught flat-footed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/speedy/1160","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T00:00:35Z","webTitle":"Speedy crossword No 1,160","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/speedy/1160","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/speedy/1160","fields":{"headline":"Speedy crossword No 1,160","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/21/swansea-manager-leon-britton-caretaker-paul-clement","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T22:38:12Z","webTitle":"West Ham identify Swansea City’s Alfie Mawson as key target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/21/swansea-manager-leon-britton-caretaker-paul-clement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/21/swansea-manager-leon-britton-caretaker-paul-clement","fields":{"headline":"West Ham identify Swansea City’s Alfie Mawson as key target","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Swansea City face a battle to hold on to Alfie Mawson in the January transfer window amid serious interest from West Ham United, who are expected to make a bid for the central defender. The Hammers have identified Mawson, who caught the eye for England Under-21s at the European Championship finals in the summer, as one of their key targets next month and are ready to test Swansea’s resolve. The Welsh club, who are bottom of the Premier League and without a manager after Paul Clement’s dismissal on Wednesday, rate Mawson highly and are determined to hold on to him as they try to plot a route to survival. They opened new contract talks with Mawson some time back – he has two and a half years remaining on his current deal – and those discussions remain ongoing, with Swansea hopeful that an agreement can be reached. Although the defender is settled at Swansea, the club’s league position makes them vulnerable to bids from West Ham and other potential buyers. West Ham would be expected to offer around £20m for Mawson, which is likely to fall well short of Swansea’s valuation, especially as the club cannot afford to lose another of their more influential players after the damaging departures of Gylfi Sigurdsson and Fernando Llorente in the summer. Signed from Barnsley for £5m in August last year, Mawson, now 23, had to be patient to get his chance at Swansea but impressed after Clement took over in January. He scored four goals during the second half of the season and formed an excellent partnership with Federico Fernández at the heart of the Swansea defence, helping the club to stave off the threat of relegation and earning him an England Under-21 call up. The news of West Ham’s interest in Mawson comes as Swansea, meanwhile, continue their search for Clement’s replacement. It is understood Frank de Boer and Aitor Karanka have been sounded out, with the club initially hopeful that a new manager would be in place for Saturday’s crucial visit of Crystal Palace. However, they announced on Thursday that Leon Britton, the player-coach, will take charge of the team for the Palace match in a caretaker capacity. Britton, who has spent a total of 15 years with Swansea and is hugely respected by everyone at the club, has no interest in being considered for the role on a permanent basis. “It is not to say I wouldn’t take it in the future, but I just think at this moment in time it is not the right move for me,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/27/rent-arrears-student-accommodation-unfit-for-purpose-mezzino","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"I’m being chased for rent arrears, but the student block was unfit for purpose","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/27/rent-arrears-student-accommodation-unfit-for-purpose-mezzino","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/27/rent-arrears-student-accommodation-unfit-for-purpose-mezzino","fields":{"headline":"I’m being chased for rent arrears, but the student block was unfit for purpose","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I recently graduated from the University of Central Lancashire where I rented private student accommodation at Jubilee Court in Preston. The new building was unfit for occupation for parts of the 2016/17 academic year and the facilities substandard for the rest of the time. We spent the first 16 days of our tenancy in a hotel and were told we could revoke our contracts if we wanted. When we were allowed to take possession on the first day of term, parts of the building were still under construction, there was no car parking that we had paid for, no lifts, fridge, table or chairs. There was intermittent hot water, then none at all for four days in October. Then the power outages started as we were not on mains supply. There were 20 power cuts for several hours between November 2016 and February 2017, and we had to be put up in a hotel on three occasions. At the end of November I asked to terminate the contract and was told I would have to pay the rental term in full. I spent most of the year commuting from my home in Liverpool, staying at Jubilee Court only if necessary. At no point did the management firm, Mezzino, reduce the rent. Nominal compensation was deducted in an ad hoc manner. I left the property in May and was advised by the students’ union to pay £1,000 towards the £1,568 rental dues and ask for the rest to be written off. I am now being chased by Mezzino for amounts ranging from £422 to £657. MR, Preston Mezzino’s stance is hard to justify. I see from correspondence that students were told in writing that they would not be charged the £340 rent during that first fortnight in temporary lodgings, but it then declared the accommodation manager did not have the authority to make the offer. Mezzino accepts the building was unfinished but says students were given the option to leave without penalty until mains electricity was connected in June 2017. You insist you were told otherwise when you tried to leave in November. The view seems to be that since you had a roof over your head, it fulfilled its role and the £25 compensation for each power cut of up to 15 hours was enough. “Mezzino have acted in a thorough manner giving tenants the ability to relinquish their contract, acknowledging dissatisfaction,” says a spokesperson, adding that the sum you owe keeps growing because of late payment charges. Your next step would be Ombudsman Services: Property, of which Mezzino is a member.

That is how I like my corduroy: a bit campus dreamboat, a bit arthouse cinema. Accessorised with a strong scarf game, and maybe an elbow patch; some reading material (either news or fiction but printed on actual paper) and deep conversation peppered with hand-gesture quotation marks. In other words, nothing to do with Jeremy Corbyn. No offence, Jezza, but I’m thinking more along the lines of Ali MacGraw in Love Story crossed with Diane Keaton in Annie Hall crossed with Tina Fey. There is a whole late-70s-staffroom piece that happens around corduroy in Britain that I choose to ignore, because I prefer what’s on my moodboard. Corduroy is the postgraduate degree of the fabric world. It adds letters after your name. It makes you look smart, in the brainy sense. Even when it is in fashion, like it is now, it looks more high-minded than fashion-victim. At least, that’s how it works in my head. The trouble with what you wear, of course, is that other people see it, too. And judge it according to what’s in their heads, which can sometimes be quite different. (I know! So meta today. It’s the corduroy talking.) You may have noticed that I am wearing not just corduroy, but pink corduroy. An unexpected colour is one way to nudge people into realising that you are wearing corduroy in a soulful-and-cultured sense, not in the grumpy-and-outdated sense. Black looks great, cream is fabulous. If you must do brown, make sure it’s a rich butterscotch caramel; if you go for burgundy, make it crimson and regal rather than dingy uniform-shop blazer. Go up a size: when tight, corduroy has a tendency to lumpiness. It looks best when it is generous. Also, go luxe. Wear with a silk blouse rather than a cotton shirt. Or choose a lush knit, instead of a scratchy cardigan. Cable knits, smooth textured merino or groovy ribs all work well. This is not the moment for Guccified maximalism: sleek and uncluttered works better. Robert Redford in his treacle-toned cord suit in All The President’s Men is never not a good look. George Clooney as the nattily attired Fantastic Mr Fox is the best of all. Corduroy may not be foxy. But it looks fantastic to me. • Jess wears cords, £45, and polo neck, £24, both topshop.com.

The dismissal, which was announced late on Thursday, forced the prime minister to defend her record on tackling sexual harassment, saying she wanted parliament to be a place where everyone could work with “no cause for concern”. May made her comments at a press conference in Warsaw, where she had been holding talks with her Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, primarily on Brexit, defence and EU concerns about his apparent crackdown on judicial independence. A Cabinet Office report on Green looked into allegations made by a Conservative activist, Kate Maltby, that May’s de facto deputy had behaved improperly towards her. It found Maltby’s account plausible but said it was impossible to definitively conclude what had happened. Green, 61, lost his job because the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, found statements he had made to a newspaper about not knowing pornography had been found on his office computer in 2008 were “inaccurate and misleading”. Information about the pornography, found during a Met police raid before Green was in government, came from two former detectives. A number of Conservative MPs have condemned the officers’ intervention. The Information Commissioner’s Office said on Thursday it had begun an investigation into whether the officers had breached the Data Protection Act in releasing the information. Asked at the press conference whether she shared the worries, May said: “As I said in my letter to Damian yesterday, I share the concerns that have been raised across the political spectrum about comments that were made about a former police officer, and I expect that issue to be properly investigated, to be taken seriously and to be properly looked at.” Despite May asking him to resign, Green will receive a payoff of nearly £17,000, the Cabinet Office has confirmed. Under a 1991 law, ministers under 65 who lose their jobs and do not get a new post within three weeks receive a severance payment of three months’ salary, irrespective of the circumstances of their departure. Green tweeted: Asked when he might be replaced, May’s spokesman said it would not happen before parliament went into recess later on Thursday, pushing the timetable past the festive period. “In terms of roles, that’s obviously a decision for the prime minister, which she’ll announce in due course,” he said. There has been speculation May is planning a cabinet reshuffle and that replacing Green could be a chance to act. There is less of a pressing need to replace him than with the other two cabinet minister’s May has lost in recent weeks – the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, and the international development secretary, Priti Patel – because Green does not have the same departmental responsibilities. He chairs several cabinet committees, but May’s spokesman said the next of these was not due to sit until mid-January. Speaking earlier on Thursday, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who is among those tipped as a possible replacement, said Green had lied and it was the right course of action for May to sack him. Green’s departure is a personal blow for May, who brought him into Downing Street to help shore up her authority after her majority was wiped out in June’s general election. In his resignation letter, Green continued to maintain that he did not download or view the pornography, but said he should have been clear in his press statements that his lawyers were informed about its presence in 2008. In her letter to Green, May said it was “with deep regret and enduring gratitude for the contribution you have made over many years that I asked you to resign from the government and have accepted your resignation”. Heywood found that Green had breached the ministerial code twice, because his misleading comments had fallen short of the “seven principles of public life”, one of which is honesty. In his letter, Green said: “I deeply regret the distress caused to Kate Maltby following her article and the reaction to it. I do not recognise the events she described in her article, but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and I apologise.” Maltby did not comment publicly on Green’s resignation, but her parents, Colin and Victoria, said in a statement they were not surprised that the inquiry had found Green “to have been untruthful as a minister, nor that they found our daughter to be a plausible witness”. They said: “We have received many supportive messages from people near and far who appreciate Kate’s courage and the importance of speaking out about the abuse of authority. “We join with them in admiring her fortitude and serenity throughout the length of the investigation and despite the attempted campaign in certain sections of the media to denigrate and intimidate her and other witnesses. We are proud of her.” In her letter to Green, May welcomed the fact that he had apologised to Maltby. Labour’s Jess Phillips told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the inquiry had taken too long and that Maltby’s allegations were still hanging over Green. “The investigation said that Kate Maltby was credible and plausible and what they found that they couldn’t prove was the sexual harassment charge. “However, I’m not convinced by that. I’ve seen all of the evidence that’s in the public domain: text messages between Damian Green and Kate Maltby, text messages between Kate Maltby and her friends at the time, saying how uncomfortable she’d felt, whether she felt she had to report it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/29/paddy-mcguinness-laugh-in-my-sleep-but-never-remember-why","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T14:00:33Z","webTitle":"Paddy McGuinness: ‘I laugh in my sleep but I never remember why’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/29/paddy-mcguinness-laugh-in-my-sleep-but-never-remember-why","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/29/paddy-mcguinness-laugh-in-my-sleep-but-never-remember-why","fields":{"headline":"Paddy McGuinness: ‘I laugh in my sleep but I never remember why’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The funniest standup I’ve ever seen I don’t go out of my way to see standup but I caught Micky Flanagan’s set on TV a while back which made me laugh.

Sometimes there’s funding available, sometimes there isn’t. Others have strings attached by industrial partners who are stakeholders in the project. In my case, it was a requirement to build a prototype for a large company in the UK, in exchange for additional funding and a work placement. A great opportunity, I thought. But I wish I’d considered the potential risks associated with this arrangement. I accepted my PhD on the basis that, as a student, I would be seconded to my industrial partner’s facilities for 12 months. But after starting work, that period fell to three months, then finally no months at all. The funding had dried up as the company was struggling financially. Great, I thought, there goes my experience! But I continued, focusing on my research. Then, after the first 10 months, my initial supervisor was offered a very big carrot elsewhere in the form of a promotion, and he left. I thought nothing of it; we live in a free labour market after all, and he was offered a better package. It was still frustrating though, as I had to change the direction of my research, since it had been moulded to suit his specialism. What was worse, however, was his replacement: my second supervisor was barely around, and mismanaged my funds so I didn’t have as much available support as I should have done. Two years passed, I dabbled with my prototype and had several meetings with my industrial partner. But when I approached them for a real world setting in which to test my prototype, the response was radio silence. I was starting to feel as though I had fallen through the cracks in the university system. Without a committed supervisor, it took two years for the university to organise my first panel review, something that should normally happen within the first 10 months. By the time I had my second panel review the following year, I only had six months before my funding was set to run out. A member of the review panel said to me, “We do see a PhD here, but you only have six months of funding left, and we’re predicting that you need another year and a half.” They recommended instead that I transfer from PhD to MPhil status. This wasn’t good news; it carries with it the baggage of a failed PhD, and isn’t the right qualification to launch the career in academia that I had aspired to.After finishing my MPhil, I found that opportunities to work are limited when you are based in a university town. I retrained as a technician, and worked at the university as a postgraduate teaching assistant, earning a very low salary and struggling to get by. Looking back, I feel like my situation could have been avoided had the university had a plan B to mitigate the damage in the event of an industrial partnership changing. Equally, there should have been more accountability for my PhD supervisors, including better monitoring of how they were managing the funding. Since they usually have oversight of several PhD projects, it also wouldn’t be surprising if supervisors sometimes find themselves focusing their attention on the ones that are making best progress. We need to ensure they’re equally engaged. I never received an induction at the start of my PhD, so I never knew who to turn to about my concerns. When I finally got round to making an official complaint, it was brushed under the carpet. The university said that I had waited too long to do it – but how was I to feel comfortable complaining about my disinterested supervisor when I knew they could make my life difficult while I was still doing my research? I still can’t shake the feeling that a disservice was done. My next PhD will be one with no strings from industry attached.

A little before dark she had the food cooked for Christmas, and served in small bowls around the fir tree. There was juice and yoghurt and blueberry pie and eggnog and other things the Moomin family liked. The Fir Tree, Tove Jansson --- Usually, by three days before Christmas, my kitchen is filled with the chutneys, jams, cordials, and preserves I’ve made in the preceding months. I would normally have baked row upon row of gingerbread or pepparkakor, stacking them up in jars to give as gifts. There would be piles of crystallised ginger, and boxes of fat, squashy Turkish Delight. Christmas has always been, without question, my favourite time of year. But this year, having been on a book tour for two months, my kitchen cupboard has remained empty. This year, more than any other, my favourite seasonal books are sustaining me, in the absence of all the rituals that usually do. We see, in The Fir Tree, the strangeness of ritual and of tradition, through the eyes of the Moomins. The family, who normally spend winter in hibernation, are woken and told that Christmas is coming. Unaware of what Christmas may be, and flummoxed by a world deep in snow, the Moomins prepare as if readying themselves to appease a vengeful God. Their preparations are frantic and anxious, but this eventually fades to calm, lit candles and a decorated tree. My favourite Christmas rituals are still to come. Tomorrow, I travel back to my adopted home, to spend a week with my beloved family. We’ll dress the tree and I’ll find time to bake some biscuits. We’ll celebrate with a smörgåsbord on Christmas Eve, and a pudding on Christmas Day. And as I write, beside me sits a glass of eggnog; a festive ritual that is new to me. It has always seemed odd and unappealing, poured out of cartons in American sitcoms. But the homemade version is a different beast entirely: rich, boozy, creamy and lightened by the addition of beaten egg whites. Best enjoyed in small portions, it sits between a dessert and a cocktail, which certainly seems entirely seasonally appropriate. I’ll be making it yearly from now on.

Bring the milk, cream, mace, nutmeg and cinnamon to a slow simmer over a low heat. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and sugar for a couple of minutes in a bowl, until very pale and forming thick ribbons when dropped from the whisk into the bowl. 2. Pour the simmering milk over the yolks, whisking constantly to prevent them scrambling, and then add the bourbon. Cover and transfer to the fridge for 24 hours (or up to three days) to allow the flavours to develop. Don’t forget to hold onto the egg whites - you’ll need them too. 3. When you’re ready to serve, beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Carefully fold into the eggnog mixture, then pour into glasses.

The Good Agency, the brainchild of author Shukla and literary agent and Julia Kingsford, intends to work with “exceptional” writers who identify as black and minority ethnic, working class, disabled or LGBTQ. It will “identify, nurture and promote” these authors, with the intention of making the UK’s literary landscape more representative. ACE, which published a report last week identifying the lack of diversity in literature, is allocating The Good Agency £581,542 from its National Lottery-funded Ambition for Excellence programme, to support three years of activity, it announced on Thursday. “Our funding of The Good Agency represents the Arts Council’s commitment to do more to promote and sustain diversity in the publishing sector in the wake of the Canelo report on literary fiction,” said literature director Sarah Crown. “We believe that Nikesh Shukla and Julia Kingsford are ideally placed to make a direct and meaningful intervention in this area, and we are glad to be able to support them as they go forward.” As well as identifying a sharp fall in sales for literary fiction, the ACE report also found “literary fiction is dominated by ‘insider networks’”, and how “breaking into these still proves tough for many”. A survey carried out by the report’s authors found that 73% of respondents felt there was an issue with the representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) voices in literary fiction. “There is a sense that over the past 15 years or so, the position of BAME writers within British writing and publishing, never robust, has in fact gone backwards,” said last week’s report. “In London, the proportion of BAME residents in the total population is at 40% (the proportion for the UK as a whole is around 15%), but comparatively few people work in the London book industry, and when they do tend not to occupy the top decision-making roles. Low pay, insider networks, unpaid internships, a perception that the industry caters to ‘white’ tastes and that it is not looking for writers and staff from a BAME background, all contribute.” Shukla edited the bestselling collection of essays on race and immigration, The Good Immigrant, and, together with Kingsford, successfully raised £40,000 on Kickstarter earlier this year in order to launch a new literary journal for British writers of colour, The Good Journal. He said that the Good Agency would help “to continue and expand the work we started with The Good Immigrant”. “I’m really excited to get the agency started and get some amazing people on board to help find the next generation of diverse writers who represent the many stories Britain has to tell. As we head towards an uncertain future, now is the time to find, nurture and platform the writers who will tell the stories of all of us,” said Shukla. Kingsford said that the last year had seen “so much action” in the publishing industry to address under-representation. “We conceived The Good Literary Agency to blow open the pipeline for these writers and we’re incredibly excited to have funding for three years to build a sustainable business that can help to finally redress this,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/31/100-best-nonfiction-books-response--by-hannah-jane-parkinson-robert-mccrum","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T08:30:25Z","webTitle":"A response to the 100 best nonfiction books list: ‘Some I agree with, some I’d add, and some I’d hoof right off the field’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/31/100-best-nonfiction-books-response--by-hannah-jane-parkinson-robert-mccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/31/100-best-nonfiction-books-response--by-hannah-jane-parkinson-robert-mccrum","fields":{"headline":"A response to the 100 best nonfiction books list: ‘Some I agree with, some I’d add, and some I’d hoof right off the field’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"As listicles of The Best… proliferate, I’m often reminded of the Arctic Monkeys lyric, “there’s only music/ so that there’s new ringtones”. Part of me worries about becoming a society that publishes books just to round them up into end-of-year lists, or designing jackets to the specifications of an artsy Instagram post. How would this play among the influencers? But then I am a book nerd, so really I love them. While others might dissipate a sort of listless frenetic energy in cleaning the house, or baking or boozing, I end up reordering books into shelf sections like a kid playing schoolteacher assigning pupils into classes. Which is why I was excited to be asked to respond to Robert McCrum’s list, as someone of a different generation (I’m afraid I am a millennial, but I have never liked the texture of avocado), as someone who was drawn to move to Russia for a time because of its literary history, and as someone who sidled into journalism without a university education. I’m not sure I envy Robert’s task of whittling down the nonfiction titles of the circa 130m books that exist in the world today. Unfortunately we don’t have, say, the Library of Alexandria to delve into, so perhaps that makes it easier. I have to admit I too had never heard of The Egg &amp; I, and given Robert’s assessment, I doubt I’ll be cracking it open. Many of his other choices I would also pick; others I have not read (which will be rectified), some I would absolutely hoof out of the field of play and there are books I would add. So what makes a real nonfiction classic? My definition would be a book that is always, or has so far proved, to be worthwhile; to have contributed something, whether political, emotional, social, psychological or scientific to the world at large, and has continued to do so over time. A book can fall out of fashion, or be disagreed with, and still offer a contribution. Or it can reassert itself as relevant to contemporary events, or as a provider of context. As Robert puts it: “Your list-maker, then, is a creature of his or her times.” Quite. To go back to my earlier point, it’s possible that lists themselves are creatures of our times. It was pleasing to see Robert’s inclusion of writers of colour and women who for so long were obscured by white men. I remember sitting in an English class and being outraged when I learned that Charlotte Bronte’s first book was published under the pseudonym Currer Bell. Then a year later, the first of “JK Rowling’s” Harry Potter books came out. Not quite for the same reasons, but still. I’m pleased therefore to see the likes of Baldwin and Said. I would recommend Angela Davis’s If They Come in the Morning (1971) and do, to people who still don’t seem to grasp the institutional oppression of black people in the US and who rail against “political correctness gone mad”. As though equal rights were such a zany concept. There are too many of Claire Tomalin’s definitive biographies of female literary greats to mention all of them, so can I just say all the lives by Tomalin, including Katherine Mansfield, Jane Austen, Mary Wollstonecroft. Robert has picked some of my favourite feminist texts, so no issues there. I agree, too, with the Johns (Milton, Locke, Stuart Mill, Keynes). I’d add Francis Bacon’s Essays (1597), if only because people spy it on my shelves and say: “I didn’t know he also wrote!” I seem to share with Robert a keen interest in medical and scientific texts, and my particular interest is psychology, because I like to untangle the cat’s cradle of neurones. So, though it seems pretentious, I’d like to weigh the shelves down with Gray’s Anatomy and the DSM-V [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders], if these are allowed. Would absolutely agree with A Brief History of Time, which I remember somewhat incongruously reading under the Florida sun, aged 16, the toner melting on to my fingertips. But I’m afraid I have to quibble with the inclusion of Shakespeare’s First Folio, not because Shakespeare’s plays aren’t, you know, unadulterated genius that have influenced… well… everything, but plays are works of fiction, and therefore I would veto their inclusion. Ditto Beckett’s Waiting for Godot. Yet, somehow I don’t have an issue with poetry’s inclusion. I can’t really explain this, even though I would also argue that poetry is closer to fiction than nonfiction. It’s just something I feel in my bones that I didn’t ask for, like osteoporosis. Plath’s Ariel, yes, an exemplary collection. But then, I’m a big Plath fan. Not because I read The Bell Jar under the duvet as a teen (although there is that). I am jettisoning Hughes’s Birthday Letters because, while it is good, I don’t think a book that, as Robert puts it, “contributes to the couple’s mythology” should be included, because that mythology so often overshadows Plath’s work. I’d much rather people remembered her for lines such as, on the birth of her first child: “Love set you going like a fat gold watch.” Plath was also a meticulous journal keeper, and I’d also include The Journals of Sylvia Plath: 1950-1962, a fascinating record of her journey from precocious Massachusetts teen right up until the year before her death (Hughes destroyed the final year of journals). As a northerner, I’m also tempted to add either Philip Larkin’s collected works or Brian Patten’s, the latter too often overshadowed by fellow Merseybeat bard Roger McGough.

Created by Hossein Amini and director James Watkins, it’s “inspired” by Misha Glenny’s 2008 book McMafia: Seriously Organised Crime, a study of 21st century global criminal and financial networks. Although rooted in grim authenticity, however, McMafia initially reminds of last year’s The Night Manager (it’s another co-production between BBC and AMC), in its tale of a handsome Englishman caught up in a web of criminal intrigue. It’s also a shamelessly telegenic travelogue, taking in Prague, Tel Aviv, Cairo, Paris and Ravenscourt Park underground station. We begin in opulent Mumbai. A Mr Vadim from Russia is in conference with a Mr Chopra, who assures his visitor he is “god”, with control of the police and port authorities – the ideal go-to person for someone like Vadim, who wishes to transport heroin through the city. Assured, Vadim leaves. However, in an underpass, a woman riding pillion pulls up alongside Vadim’s car, smiles and attaches a bomb to the side of his vehicle. Ka-boom! Cut to London and our first glimpse of Alex Godman, descending the stairs at a London charity auction. Like Tom Hiddleston, he is hewn from the finest British timber. At the table are his partner, Rebecca (Juliet Rylance), who works for “ethical banker” Sydney Bloom. His own family, however, are exiled Russians – his father, Dimitri looks vodka-ravaged, soul-sick, grumbling when his son speaks to him in English rather than Russian. Later, Alex must persuade him down from the roof in the latest in a series of drunken suicidal episodes. Casting Leviathan actor Aleksey Serebryakov as Dimitri is a coup, and he’ll hopefully be able to do more than act sullen and miffed. His doting mother is a picture of fading elegance. Then there is Uncle Boris, Dimitri’s brother. Pasty, loud, sporting a white dinner jacket, he recalls Fredo in the Godfather – but Boris is a player. And, it emerges, it was he who ordered the unsuccessful hit on Vadim. And he is now curious about who wanted him dead. In hospital, he is visited by Ilya, a close friend and senior member of the Federal Intelligence Agency. “Shipping and entertainment” Alex loves his family deeply but business-wise he keeps a distance. He has set up his own investment company and prides himself on playing with a straight English bat, avoiding any associations with the dubious Russian money into which he was born. When Boris proposes that he go into business with an associate of his in Israel, Alex firmly demurs. Back at his office, Alex learns of an article about his company’s supposed Russian links. Fabricated rumours, but now investors are withdrawing. Reluctantly, he approaches an English colleague, Alan, to see if he will help make up the investment shortfall. But oily Alan only agrees to do so in return for a chunk of the company. Desperate, Alex agrees to meet with Boris’s Israeli chum, a Mr Kleiman, after all, and they travel to Tel Aviv. Having stoically fended off the amorous attentions of one Tanya in a nightclub, in the midst of an air raid siren, Alex is introduced to Kleiman. If he is a gangster, he looks like the kindler, gentler, Corbyn-esque sort. He has made his pile in “shipping and entertainments”, as one does. It’s clear that he is a direct rival to Vadim. “I’m a banker not a gangster” Back in London, Alex learns from his colleague that it was Boris who spread the rumour that caused the company’s crisis. Alex goes up to Boris’s home to confront him but when there, finds that his uncle is entertaining guests, three bald Russians seeking cash to go to war with Vadim. Over caviar, however, one of them attacks Boris with a knife, slitting his throat. Alex fends off his own assailant and escapes to the basement, where he phones to warn his family that they too are under attack; a successful call to the police prompts the assailants to flee. At Boris’s funeral, Tanya reappears, lying to Rebecca that he and Alex are old friends. He does not correct her. He is handed a card by Tanya’s associate with a sim card attached – this is how he will communicate with Kleiman. They meet in London, where Kleiman explains that the reason McDonalds is bigger than Burger King is simply that there are more of them – he wishes to apply the same business model to destroy Vadim. McMafia, see? Alex protests he is a “banker not a gangster” but he’s sinking visibly into the mire. Concerned for his distraught and broken father, Alex meets Vadim in Paris, essentially to beg for his father’s life – he’s a harmless old man, he says. It’s an emollient exchange charged with underlying menace. “Are you harmless?” Vadim asks Alex. No response. Credits. Additional notes Apart from Boris’s reminiscence of Fredo, there are other echoes of The Godfather. Alex’s determination to stay straight reminds of Michael Corleone’s “That’s my family, it’s not me.” to Diane Keaton’s Kay, whose outsider decency is mirrored by Caring Capitalist Rebecca, Alex’s partner. There’s also Dimitri, weeping at the morgue over Boris like Vito Corleone over Sonny, and Keiman’s speech to Alex about how “moving money is your weapon”, recalling Mario Puzo’s line about how a lawyer with a briefcase can steal more than a thousand men with guns. If there is a Platonic ideal of the love between uncle and nephew it is expounded in an affectionate playful scene at the Tel Aviv beach in which Alex and Boris romp in the water and compare buffness. Alex says he goes “once or twice a week” to the gym but we see him work out and it’s more onerous than 20 minutes on the cross-trainer. It’s a shame to lose Boris so early; his relationship with his gloomy maid Geena in his vast, lonely mansion was but one of the intriguing facets he brought to this episode. Are there inadvertent shades of Britain’s Brexit quandary about McMafia? Suddenly forced to make deals in the wider world, unprotected by EU scruples, with new “international partners” who might play by different rules? What are the intentions of Tanya? What exactly does Kaiman’s business entail? And how long can Alex keep up what is now a facade of ethical practice in front of Rebecca and his co-workers?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/21/puppy-farming-targeted-uk-government-crackdown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T22:30:36Z","webTitle":"Puppy farming to be targeted in UK government crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/21/puppy-farming-targeted-uk-government-crackdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/21/puppy-farming-targeted-uk-government-crackdown","fields":{"headline":"Puppy farming to be targeted in UK government crackdown","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Unethical puppy farming is to be targeted in a new government crackdown against unscrupulous breeders, including tight new restrictions for selling pups online. Announcing the proposal, the prime minister said she understood the joy of bringing home a new puppy, but that pet owners needed to know that many had not had an ethical and healthy start in life. The government plans legislation in the new year to tackle so-called battery dogs, born in large-scale commercial breeding establishments. Campaigners have uncovered farms where mothers are given just enough food and water to keep them breeding continuously, in filthy conditions and with no exercise. Plans include tough new rules for licensed dog breeders, including showing puppies alongside their mother before a sale is made. Breeders will only be able to sell puppies they have personally bred and online sellers will have to publish their licence number, and the pet’s country of origin and country of residence. Puppy sales will only be legally completed in the presence of the new owner, meaning sales cannot take place unless the buyer has physically seen the dog. In a consultation to take place when parliament returns after the Christmas recess, measures will also be explored to tackle puppy smuggling across borders and address the breeding of dogs with harmful genetic disorders, Downing Street said. Theresa May said the new regulations would be part of a “drive to achieve the highest animal welfare standards in the world”. “The arrival of a happy, healthy puppy, as I know myself, is a memorable time for a family, but it’s absolutely right we do everything we can to eradicate animal cruelty from our society,” she said. “The proposals my government is developing will be an important step forward.” Downing Street said May herself had not had a dog since childhood, but had owned a poodle called Tassle when she was a child and later a mongrel called Lucky. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said dog lovers could often be seduced at Christmas time by puppies needing a home, but said buyers should check their purchase was being made ethically. “At this time of year it is all too easy to be moved by images online or adverts in the local press advertising newborn puppies looking for a home for Christmas,” he said. “But what we don’t see is all too often a sad history of mistreatment and malpractice.” Environmentalism and animal welfare are key planks of the Conservatives’ new electoral strategy after the general election. Ministers were blindsided by a huge public backlash when Conservative MPs voted down an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience into UK law. May has since committed to recognising animal sentience in domestic law. Gove said the crackdown on puppy farming was the latest of the government’s proposals to improve animal welfare standards. It is set to ban the sale of puppies, kittens and rabbits under eight weeks old and make licensing compulsory for dog breeders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2017/dec/21/mays-made-it-till-christmas-your-best-comments-today","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T12:12:57Z","webTitle":"'May's made it till Christmas': your best comments today","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2017/dec/21/mays-made-it-till-christmas-your-best-comments-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2017/dec/21/mays-made-it-till-christmas-your-best-comments-today","fields":{"headline":"'May's made it till Christmas': your best comments today","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Stories that have got you talking today include Damian Green’s departure, an Apple iPhone admission and a review of Judy Dench’s new TV show.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell to £8.7bn in November, down £200m on the same month last year. The consensus of City economists had been for a rise to £9bn in response to sluggish wage growth, which has restricted income tax receipts and pushed up borrowing in October by £500m to £8bn. The deficit for the current financial year – April to November – hit its lowest level in a decade, dropping by £3.1bn to £48.1bn over the period. A jump in tobacco tax receipts gave the chancellor a boost while the Treasury’s strict welfare spending limits kept tax credit and housing benefit costs in check. But the gradual improvement in the public finances is expected to be cut short in the new year, with lower self-assessment income than seen in the last financial year. Tax changes last year brought forward tax payments by those with self-employment income, which the Treasury’s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has said was unlikely to be repeated this year. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The trend will deteriorate primarily because self-assessment tax receipts in January and February 2017 were boosted temporarily by about £4bn, due to prior tax changes.” The OBR cut its expectations for government borrowing this year to £49.9bn in the autumn Budget but warned of a worsening picture for 2019 and beyond following downward revisions to productivity that will continue to restrict wage growth. Updating on its forecasts last month, the OBR called into question the chancellor’s target for balancing the books by 2022, saying the government may not eradicate the deficit before 2031. Tombs said a series of one-off costs would also restrict any further improvements in the public finances, including payments to the EU, which would be about £1bn higher in December than in the same month in 2016, when the UK received a net repayment of funds. He said central government investment would also need to grow strongly in the remaining months of this financial year in order to meet the government’s spending commitments. “All told, borrowing is on track to meet, but not significantly undershoot, the OBR’s November forecast,” he said. “The chancellor can go on his Christmas vacation content that the public finances have weathered the economy’s slowdown well this year. But with slow growth likely to persist next year and little margin for error now left to meet fiscal rules, it’s unlikely that the chancellor will be able to soften his fiscal plans materially further again,” he added. The UK’s total public sector net debt, excluding state-owned banks, increased to £1,734.8bn in November, equivalent to 84.6% of gross domestic product (GDP). A Treasury spokesman said: “This is the best year-to-date borrowing in a decade, but there is still further to go to repair the public finances. “We continue to build an economy fit for the future by taking a balanced approach, getting debt falling while investing in our vital public services and keeping taxes low.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-us-press-office/2017/dec/21/guardian-appoints-new-moscow-and-beijing-bureau-chiefs","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-us-press-office","sectionName":"Guardian US press office","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T10:37:22Z","webTitle":"Guardian appoints new Moscow and Beijing bureau chiefs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-us-press-office/2017/dec/21/guardian-appoints-new-moscow-and-beijing-bureau-chiefs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-us-press-office/2017/dec/21/guardian-appoints-new-moscow-and-beijing-bureau-chiefs","fields":{"headline":"Guardian appoints new Moscow and Beijing bureau chiefs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Guardian is pleased to announce the appointment of Andrew Roth as Moscow bureau chief and Lily Kuo as Beijing bureau chief. Andrew Roth is named as the Guardian’s Moscow bureau chief. An experienced Moscow-based journalist, Andrew has reported on Russia and the post-Soviet region since 2011. Andrew will be replacing Shaun Walker, who after more than a decade in Moscow and four years at the Guardian, has been appointed the Guardian’s central and eastern Europe correspondent based in Budapest. Most recently Andrew was a reporter in the Washington Post’s Moscow bureau where he led the bureau’s coverage during Russia’s military intervention in Syria, as well as reporting on allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections and several other international crises. Previously he was a Moscow reporter for the New York Times, covering the impact of Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency and the war in Ukraine. Lily Kuo is named as the Guardian’s Beijing bureau chief. Based in the city, Lily will be working closely with Benjamin Haas, the Guardian’s China correspondent. Previously Lily was Quartz’s correspondent in Kenya, where she spearheaded the publication’s coverage of China’s presence in Africa through investigations into Chinese manufacturing in Rwanda, Chinese migrants in South Africa, China’s foreign policy engagement in South Sudan, and other stories. Lily has also reported from Hong Kong for Quartz and covered general news for Reuters in New York and Washington, DC. She previously wrote for the Los Angeles Times and other publications while living in Beijing. An expert on China, Lily won the 2014 Society of America Business Editors and Writers award for international feature for her series on China’s water crisis. Jamie Wilson, head of international news, Guardian News &amp; Media said: “Andrew and Lily are both highly respected journalists and we’re thrilled they will be bringing their talent and expertise to the Guardian. We look forward to working with them both.” Andrew Roth said: “I’m very excited to join the Guardian, a paper whose foreign coverage I have always deeply admired, as this region attracts more attention and controversy than at any moment since the fall of the Soviet Union. Amidst the extraordinary accusations of Russia’s meddling in foreign elections and the ongoing war in Ukraine, the goal here remains the same: providing coverage that tries every day to hold those in power to account. I hope to do that from Russia, Ukraine, and the other countries on this beat, while taking time to tell stories that explore this vibrant and complex part of the world.” Lily Kuo said: “I am thrilled to be joining the Guardian and look forward to building on its already excellent coverage of China.” -ends- Notes to editors For more information please contact: media.enquiries@theguardian.com About Guardian News &amp; Media Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) publishes theguardian.com, one of the world’s leading English-language newspaper websites.

The plans, which have alarmed the Patients Association, will explore restricting prescriptions for a number of mild ailments. Promoting the idea, NHS England revealed that it currently spends £4.5m a year on dandruff shampoos – a sum that would fund 1,200 hip replacements. It said 300 community nurses could be funded from the £7.5m spent on treatments for indigestion and heartburn. Other readily available items such as cough mixtures, laxatives and sun creams would also be reined in, it said. NHS England said the changes could cut costs by £136m and make money available to help with the treatment of more serious conditions. Its chief executive, Simon Stevens, said: “This consultation gives the public the opportunity to help family doctors decide how best to deploy precious NHS resources, freeing up money from the drugs bill to reinvest in modern treatments for major conditions such as cancer, mental health and emergency care.” The Patients Association said the plans would unnecessarily worry many vulnerable people in the run-up to Christmas. Its chief executive, Rachel Power, said the proposals threatened to change the relationship between GPs and patients. “GPs will be asked to implement guidance involving a complex set of criteria and exceptions,” she said. “Mistakes are bound to happen, and for some patients a GP appointment will come to feel more like a benefits assessment, where they wait to find out at the end whether they will receive support or not – and sadly we know there are major shortcomings with that system.” She agreed that it was “counterintuitive for the NHS to be paying pounds for something that the individual can buy for pence”, but she called for clarity from NHS England on how the proposal would affect those deemed social vulnerable. NHS England approved the proposals after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced £1.6bn in extra funding for 2018-19 in the budget last month – less than half of the £4bn that Stevens had called for. Power said the prescription proposal “may or may not be a good idea, but it certainly shouldn’t be motivated by a funding crisis”. Under the plans, prescriptions could be restricted for treatments for cold sores, conjunctivitis, mild indigestion, dandruff, haemorrhoids, infant colic, minor burns and scalds and minor pain conditions such as headache and back pain. Remedies for mouth ulcers, nappy rash, ringworm, head lice, mild toothache, travel sickness, and warts and verrucae are also among the items that could also be affected, as well as vitamins and minerals. Items prescribed for longer-term or more complex conditions would not be affected, and nor would prescriptions for minor illnesses symptomatic of something more serious, NHS England said. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “What remains imperative – and we will be making this clear in our consultation response – is that no blanket bans are imposed, and GPs will retain the right to make clinical decisions about prescribing appropriately for our patients based on the unique physical, psychological and social factors potentially impacting on their health.” The consultation comes just weeks after the health service’s board voted to cut a number of items from the NHS prescription list in England. Officials agreed 13 items deemed “ineffective, over-priced and low value treatments” – including homeopathy, herbal remedies and some painkillers – should no longer be routinely prescribed. They said an additional five items should only be provided in appropriate circumstances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/21/nxt-suspends-negotiations-with-coalition-on-senate-legislation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T05:17:06Z","webTitle":"NXT suspends negotiations with Coalition on Senate legislation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/nxt-suspends-negotiations-with-coalition-on-senate-legislation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/nxt-suspends-negotiations-with-coalition-on-senate-legislation","fields":{"headline":"NXT suspends negotiations with Coalition on Senate legislation","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Nick Xenophon Team has suspended critical negotiations on Senate legislation until the government commits to improving transparency and accountability measures. The NXT senator Rex Patrick has written to the defence minister, Marise Payne, to advise her his party will suspend negotiations with the human services minister, Alan Tudge, after the party’s latest attempts to use Senate oversight processes to gain further information on government policies and projects were rebuffed. Writing to Payne, Patrick made it clear Payne’s refusal to answer what he considered a “reasonable” question about the date a departmental decision was made at a recent Senate estimates hearing was not the catalyst for the move to suspend negotiations with Tudge but the trigger. “Your refusal to answer the question asked of your department is quite at odds with the principles which predicated constructive negotiations with NXT,” he wrote. “Unfortunately this is not the first instance where a government minister has failed to adhere to the standards of accountability NXT is committed to uphold and we have concluded there is a broader problem with regard to the government’s preparedness to be appropriately open and accountable. “This will affect NXT’s general approach in its dealings with the government.” Speaking to Guardian Australia, Patrick, who spoke about the need for better transparency and use of Senate oversight powers in his maiden speech earlier this month, said the party would not withhold its votes. He said the party would continue to “work constructively” on legislation but, without a commitment from the government for more accountability, it risked entering legislative votes blind to NXT’s intentions. “We are not placing additional requirements on the government, we are simply insisting they do what they are already required to do,” he said. “The failure to behave in an open and transparent manner, or in accordance with principles of responsible government, erodes trust and NXT will find it more difficult to be confident in the government’s construction and implementation of legislative proposals. “NXT will assess all legislation on its policy merits. Suspending negotiations does not mean that we will or will not vote for a particular legislation, it just makes it difficult or the government to ensure NXT are comfortable with legislation that is being put to the parliament. In essence, we will use ‘uncertainty pressure’ to ensure government behaves as it should in respect to accountability.” Patrick said while negotiations on Tudge’s welfare bill were on hold, other negotiations would remain ongoing – for now. “We will apply uncertainty pressure according to the government’s conduct and in a very measured way,” he said. “Open and accountable government is not just a policy option for NXT but a key priority. It is the the lens though which other issues and negotiations are viewed. Obstruction and refusal to provide information will make the government’s legislative agenda harder to achieve.” Patrick has placed the same question to Payne on notice and an answer, with “the factual information sought”, will see “negotiations recommence”. Questions on notice in the Senate often run past the designation response date without an answer, which Patrick has previously highlighted is part of the accountability issues present in the parliament. The party, founded by Nick Xenophon, who resigned from the Senate to run in the South Australian state election, currently controls two votes in the Senate. Its third Senate position is awaiting a declaration from the high court on how it is to be filled, after Skye Kakoschke-Moore resigned as a dual-citizen. With the government lacking the numbers to control the Senate, NXT’s bloc vote can make or break the chances of legislation passing in the Senate. It was NXT’s withdrawal of support of the government’s superannuation bills, over a separate matter, which recently forced the government to pull the legislation from its agenda in the last sitting of parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/21/federal-court-boosts-protections-in-native-title-negotiations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T06:51:32Z","webTitle":"Federal court boosts protections in native title negotiations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/federal-court-boosts-protections-in-native-title-negotiations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/federal-court-boosts-protections-in-native-title-negotiations","fields":{"headline":"Federal court boosts protections in native title negotiations","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The federal court has made a landmark decision strengthening the protections for traditional owners against governments or companies that try to circumvent good faith negotiations. In a majority decision handed down on Wednesday, the court ruled that the obligation for parties to negotiate in good faith did not expire if the matter had been referred to the national native title tribunal for arbitration, and that failure to conduct any ongoing negotiations in good faith was a breach of the Native Title Act. The decision was made in an appeal brought by Kimberley traditional owners, who have an undetermined native title claim over the Mount Jowlaenga region on the Dampier Peninsula, about 95km northeast of Broome. The Mount Jowlaenga group began negotiations with mining company Sheffield Resources Limited in 2014 about Sheffield’s proposal to build a large open-cut mineral sands mine. They appointed KRED Enterprises as their legal representatives and set terms stating that all negotiation must be done through KRED Enterprises, and not through approaches to individual traditional owners. That protocol was applied to protect traditional owners “so that their best interests would not be compromised and they would not be taken advantage of”, the court said. The parties failed to reach an agreement about compensation, employment and heritage protection as compensation for the extinguishment of certain areas of native title if the mine were to go ahead. In October 2016, Sheffield applied to the National Native Title Tribunal for a future acts determination that would allow the project to go ahead without agreement. Shortly after, the court heard, three individual traditional owners received a letter from Sheffield saying that an offer that had previously been put to KRED and rejected on their behalf was still on the table. Lawyers for the Mount Jowlaenga people argued that the breach of established negotiation protocol meant the negotiations were no longer being conducted in good faith. The National Native Title Tribunal agreed, but said there was no obligation for negotiations to be conducted in good faith once an application for a future acts determination had been made and therefore the application could go ahead. The tribunal ruled in June that the mine could go ahead. “I will make clear that this finding is made on a relatively technical point and should not detract from the inappropriateness of the behaviour,” the tribunal’s written decision said. “Had Sheffield’s contact occurred prior to the lodgement of the [future acts] application my findings may have been different. It appears clear that the purpose of this communication was to advance negotiations by circumventing Mount Jowlaenga’s legal advisers, which is not acceptable.” The Mount Jowlaenga people appealed the decision before a single judge of the federal court, which upheld the tribunal’s appeal, and then appealed again to the full court. In their majority decision on Wednesday, judges Anthony North and John Griffiths overturned the earlier decision and said there was an implied obligation to negotiate in good faith until an agreement had been struck, and that obligation did not lift just because an application for arbitration had been filed. “Merely because there is no obligation on the government party or grantee party to continue to negotiate once an arbitrarial determination has been made does not necessarily mean that the obligation to negotiate in good faith … does not apply as a matter of implication where the parties do continue to negotiation,” they said. Judge Richard White gave a dissenting judgment, saying both the tribunal and the earlier federal court judgment were correct and that if parliament had intended the obligation to negotiate in good faith to continue it would have explicitly stated it in the act. The Kimberley Land Council chief executive, Nolan Hunter, said the decision would strengthen the rights of traditional owners. “Today’s decision makes it clear that companies that want to operate on Aboriginal lands must negotiate in good faith at all times,” Hunter said. “The right to negotiate is a bedrock of the Native Title Act and is crucial in redressing the disparity between the strength of a mining company as opposed to a native title party.” Hunter said the Mount Jowlaenga people were yet to reach an agreement with Sheffield for the operation of the proposed mine. He said traditional owners were not opposed to development but must be able to give genuine free and informed consent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/21/second-north-korean-soldier-defects-south","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T03:14:48Z","webTitle":"Second North Korean soldier in weeks defects to South, say reports","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/21/second-north-korean-soldier-defects-south","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/21/second-north-korean-soldier-defects-south","fields":{"headline":"Second North Korean soldier in weeks defects to South, say reports","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Weeks after a North Korean soldier was seriously wounded during his successful escape to South Korea, another member of the regime’s military has crossed the countries’ heavily armed border, according to media reports. The second soldier, who has not been named, appeared at a guard post along the western section of the 2.5-mile-wide demilitarised zone [DMZ], the heavily armed border that divides the Korean peninsula – on Thursday morning, according to Yonhap news agency. No gunfire was heard during the latest defection by a member of the North’s 1.2-million strong army, but Yonhap said South Korean forces had fired around 20 warning shots at North Korean border guards as they searched for the missing soldier. It is possible that the defector’s fellow soldiers were initially unaware of his bid for freedom as the area was blanketed in thick fog at the time, media reports said. The serviceman, who is said to be of a low rank, is being questioned by South Korean military authorities. The latest defection will cause embarrassment in North Korea, coming weeks after another soldier, Oh Chong-song, survived a hail of bullets fired by his compatriots during his daring flight across the DMZ. Security camera footage showed the soldier drive his jeep at high speed towards the lightly armed joint security area, a section of the DMZ where guards from either side stand just metres away from each other. He abandoned his vehicle after it got stuck in a ditch and dashed across the narrow demarcation line into the South, as his compatriots opened fire from behind. The 24-year-old, who was shot five times, collapsed in a pile of leaves near a wall, before being dragged to safety by South Korean forces. He underwent several operations to treat his wounds and to remove parasitic worms that doctors believe were caused by poor nutrition among average North Korean soldiers. Last weekend Oh, whose condition has stabilised, was transferred to a military hospital near Seoul to continue his recovery. “South Korea’s intelligence services will soon schedule the security questioning process depending on his condition,” an intelligence official told Reuters. The South has turned Oh’s defection into a propaganda weapon, with loudspeakers set up along the border broadcasting details of his escape within earshot of North Korean troops. North Korean defectors undergo security questioning by South Korea’s intelligence agency once they arrive before being sent to a resettlement centre for a three-month education on life in the South. After they are released, central and local governments provide 7 million won ($6,450) in cash over a year, as well as support with housing, education and job training. The Korea Herald said Oh had been given a “lifetime’s” supply of Choco Pies, a popular South Korean snack after their manufacturer, Orion, heard that he was a fan of the confectionery – a combination of cake and marshmallow covered in chocolate. The snacks are a rare treat in the North Korean capital Pyongyang, where they found their way onto the black market via people employed at Kaesong, a jointly run industrial complex that South Korea closed early last year in protest at the regime’s missile tests. South Korean military officials said 15 North Koreans, including four soldiers, have fled the country this year, compared with one soldier and four civilians in 2016. The vast majority of the estimated 30,000 people who have defected from the North since the end of the Korean war in 1953 crossed into China before moving on to a third country to gain passage to South Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/01/the-most-exciting-action-and-thriller-films-of-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-01T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"The most exciting action and thriller films of 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/01/the-most-exciting-action-and-thriller-films-of-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/01/the-most-exciting-action-and-thriller-films-of-2018","fields":{"headline":"The most exciting action and thriller films of 2018","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The 15:17 to Paris Remember the three Americans who foiled a terrorist attack on a train in France? Clint Eastwood has made a thriller about them – with the trio starring as themselves. Apostle Gareth Evans directs a period thriller about a man travelling to a remote island to rescue his sister from a cult. The Raid meets The Wicker Man? If so, it will be your favourite film of 2018. Bad Times at the El Royale Drew Goddard – always a welcome presence – directs Chris Hemsworth and Jeff Bridges in this 60s-set film based in a dilapidated hotel near Lake Tahoe, California. That’s the sum total of anyone’s knowledge so far, but it sounds promising. Beirut John Hamm is a former US diplomat who returns to work to save a colleague in a Tony Gilroy-written thriller, co-starring Rosamund Pike. It will gett its debut at Sundance. Damsel A Million Ways to Die in the West should still be enough to repel you from comedy westerns for ever. Could Damsel – starring Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska – be enough to turn the tide? Here’s hoping. Kursk The K-141 Kursk submarine disaster in 2000, in which 118 sailors died, was the stuff of nightmares. If you’ve got the stomach for it, Thomas Vinterberg’s retelling – starring Colin Firth – is likely to be grimly compelling. The Nightingale Jennifer Kent’s follow-up to The Babadook sounds wild, although it remains to be seen if the tale of a woman seeking bloody revenge against her family’s murderers in 1825 Tasmania can inspire as many memes as her last feature. Old Man and the Gun Robert Redford stars as Forrest Tucker, a criminal who once escaped Alcatraz in a homemade canoe. It’s based on a New Yorker longread, so its fancypants credentials are in place. Outlaw King Chris Pine stars as Robert the Bruce. You have already decided whether you want to see this film or not. The fact that it’s directed by Hell or High Water’s David Mackenzie should be just enough to convince. Red Sparrow After the misfires that were Passengers and Mother!, Jennifer Lawrence needs a hit.

Sicario 2: Soldado With Sicario, Denis Villeneuve proved he could handle heavyweight blockbusters. He’s absent for the sequel – as is Emily Blunt – but if it manages to be half as tense as the original, it’ll still be worth a look.

Councils are also urging consumers to be wary of turning to suspect online sellers offering next-day delivery to secure toys that are out of stock elsewhere because they could be left out of pocket if the toys do not exist. In the final countdown to Christmas, councils have seized thousands of counterfeit and dangerous toys, including many that contained parts that pose a choking hazard to children. Thurrock council seized 86% of all products tested – a total of 88,000 items, many of which were toys – which arrived at ports between July and September. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, said criminals were exploiting a spike in demand for must-have toys, with someappearing online at more than six times their recommended retail price. It warned parents desperate to buy the most popular toys, such as Fingerlings and Hatchimals, to avoid buying them at suspiciously low prices or from suspect websites as these may be run by fraudsters. The LGA urged shoppers to look for the CE mark on toys or packaging, which confirms they meet EU consumer safety standards. With people increasingly buying presents online, the LGA called for the CE mark to be clearly included in the information on websites that offered toys for sale. “Christmas can be a great time for bargains but it can also be a magnet for dodgy traders and criminals who won’t think twice about making easy money from selling dangerous toys to unsuspecting shoppers,” said Simon Blackburn, who chairs LGA’s safer and stronger communities board. “Faulty electrical toys can lead to fires or electrocution, inferior materials can break and cause injuries, while toxic levels of ingredients can cause burns, illness and even prove fatal.” Shoppers are also being urged to look out for grammar and spelling errors on packaging, tell-tale signs of counterfeit goods, and to be wary of cheap offers involving toys sold out elsewhere. “Selling illegal, fake toys is a crime and ruins the reputation of genuine traders, harms legitimate businesses, costs the economy millions in lost tax revenue and often funds organised criminal gangs,” said Blackburn. The British Toy and Hobby Association, representing legitimate traders, said criminals were making an estimated £400m a year from counterfeit toys. It called for a new agreement with China to jointly identify and stop these dangerous products."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/21/catalans-more-resigned-than-expectant-on-catalonia-election-day","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T13:37:28Z","webTitle":"'I voted with my conscience': Catalans more resigned than expectant on election day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/21/catalans-more-resigned-than-expectant-on-catalonia-election-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/21/catalans-more-resigned-than-expectant-on-catalonia-election-day","fields":{"headline":"'I voted with my conscience': Catalans more resigned than expectant on election day","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The last time Catalans turned out to vote, thousands of people lined up outside polling stations in the drizzle from before dawn, almost all of them hopeful of ushering in a sovereign republic. On Thursday, almost three months after October’s illegal, unilateral referendum, the region’s voters returned to cast their ballots in an election called by the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, after he sacked the regional government. The grey skies that greeted those referendum voters may have given way to Thursday’s clear blue, but the mood among those standing in line was more of resignation than excitement. With polls pointing to a hung parliament and a close-run race for first place between the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party (ERC) and the unionist, centre-right Citizens party, few expected any dramatic change in a region that is more or less evenly split on the question of secession. Outside the polling station in the large Escola Ramon Llull in Barcelona, children played football on the patio while voters queued patiently. During the referendum, the school became emblematic of the Spanish police violence that marred the poll when riot officers dragged voters out, beat them with truncheons and fired rubber bullets at the crowd. Aside from independence posters and pavements stencilled with images of Catalonia’s jailed former vice-president, Oriol Junqueras, there were few reminders of that day and its momentous consequences. Josep, a 52-year-old voter, was not expecting any political earthquakes. “I’ve voted with my conscience,” he said, but did not tell the Guardian what this meant. “I think we’ll get another hung parliament and we’ll get the same cycle and more elections. These elections may have been imposed, but they’re legitimate.” Eduard Millan, a 31-year-old doctor from Barcelona, voted for Junqueras’s ERC. “[Independence] may not be close but it’s what I’m hoping for,” he said. “I think it will be like last time but I would like to see a leftist grouping.” Eduardo Piquer and his daughter Marina were also at the school to vote. The self-employed 63-year-old would say only that he had cast his ballot for “the only one with balls”. This could have been a reference to Junqueras, whose jailing stands in contrast to the actions of the former president, Carles Puigdemont, who decided to flee to Brussels rather than risk arrest and imprisonment on possible charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Piquer was rather more forthright in his condemnation of Rajoy, berating the Spanish prime minister for refusing to let Catalans identify as they wished and suggesting he do something fairly obscene to himself. He also had harsh words for King Felipe VI. By supporting Rajoy’s position, said Piquer, the monarch had shown that “the king of Spain isn’t king of everyone in Spain”. As people voted, politicians of all stripes used Twitter to urge them to make sure their ballots counted. “If the same old people win, we’ll go back to declarations of independence and social fracture,” said the Citizens party leader, Albert Rivera. “If there’s change, we’ll go back to coexistence and the union of all Spaniards.” Miquel Iceta, leader of the Catalan socialist party (PSC), also called for a fresh start. “I’ve just voted in my polling station,” he wrote. “I want everyone to participate in these decisive elections. I am convinced that the hope of an economically prosperous and socially just Catalonia will become reality for all of us. Let’s change course to ensure a better future.” Puigdemont, meanwhile, sought to invoke memories of referendum day, tweeting: “Today we will demonstrate the strength of an irreducible people. May the spirit of the #1oct guide us always.” His erstwhile colleague sent a far more personal message to mark his wedding anniversary. “Today I would like to be with you and the children more than ever,” he wrote to his wife, Neus. “By chance it is four years ago today that we were married. Four intense years but four years of happiness. I am convinced that soon I will leave and I will be able to embrace all three of you! I love you!” Back at Escola Ramon Llull, Marta Robles emerged from the polling station after voting for Iceta’s PSC. Robles, a 38-year-old designer, said: “I’m not pro-independence but I’m on the left and I want to see what will happen if there’s a change. But I don’t know if we’ll get one.” The problem, she said, was that Catalans remained deeply divided on the issue of independence – “and it’s difficult to change people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/21/injury-crises-rugby-union-breaking-point-the-breakdown","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T11:50:23Z","webTitle":"Injury crises every weekend suggest rugby has reached breaking point | Paul Rees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/21/injury-crises-rugby-union-breaking-point-the-breakdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/21/injury-crises-rugby-union-breaking-point-the-breakdown","fields":{"headline":"Injury crises every weekend suggest rugby has reached breaking point","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Professional rugby is reaching breaking point. And break is the word with each weekend bringing more injury problems. Wasps lost three more players in victory over La Rochelle last weekend: Elliot Daly, Nathan Hughes and Jimmy Gopperth will be out of action for weeks or months, not days. To watch Leicester’s Champions Cup match against Munster on Sunday was more evidence of why the casualty rate owes more to war than sport. It was unrelenting in its ferocity, players thundering into each other from the start with space so elusive it had to be forced. It had the intensity of an international and the Irish province had even more Test players than the Tigers. It was the same earlier in the day when Clermont Auvergne faced Saracens, whose lock George Kruis reflected on another brutal encounter. “They have some big boys and they kept on coming,” he said. If it makes for entertainment, and you can only admire the commitment shown by players who defy strains, aches and pain to keep piling into the fray, rugby union has moved some way from the game it once was. It was not just in the days of black and white television that the game was essentially two-toned: forwards against forwards, largely in the set pieces with breakdowns around one quarter of today’s number, and backs against backs. All the forwards contested rucks, many using them as a rest period, and there was no fanning out in a line behind. Law changes and tweaks have been made in recent years with the aim of encouraging space on a cluttered pitch that has not changed its dimensions over the years. Each one tends to be counteracted by defence coaches, who have the time to work out ways of sabotaging each initiative so it almost has the opposite effect of what was intended. The change of emphasis at the breakdown, where it has become harder to win legitimate turnovers after a tackle, has led to teams not bothering to contest unless a ball-carrier is isolated but organise defenders in a line to see off the next phase of the attack. As ball-in-play time has increased, so has the number of tackles and it is in the collision area where the majority of injuries occur. One solution is a return to rucking as it used to be, although that is highly unlikely on safety grounds. Players being rucked off the ball when it is on the floor would force an attacking team to commit greater numbers to the breakdown and so reduce the trail in the defensive line, but trampling, even in a forward rather than an up-and-down motion, would lead to an outcry. It is an issue that is concerning World Rugby which next March will consider proposals, including one to reduce the number of substitutions to prevent teams from making mass replacements in the final 20 minutes, the point at which players used to tire. “Rugby used to be a game for all shapes and sizes and we are moving away from that,” said the Welsh Rugby Union chairman, Gareth Davies, the former Wales and Lions’ fly-half who is on World Rugby’s council. “As a fly-half, part of my job was to outfox a wing forward who spent the game chasing you but now after 50-odd minutes a whole new team come on. “I am not sure what law changes can achieve. There is an experimental one being conducted now in the tackle but the only way I can see it is guys having to play for the full 80 minutes. That would force them to shed a few stone: players are physical specimens now and if it carries on they will get even bigger and stronger. “It will certainly not get any better. When I played, no one tore biceps of hamstrings off the bone. No one had stinger injuries and what is happening is a player’s muscular set-up is not natural while your ligaments and bone structure remain the same. It is the load that causes the problems. “Players are bigger than their bodies are designed for them to be and a lot of the injuries are because of that, not just because of the physical demands of the game. If players have to run for 80 minutes, they will have to become lighter and get closer to their natural body weight and there is a chance of opening up the game. It is worth looking at because many are now conditioned to play for only 50 minutes.” Another option is to reduce the number of players on the field. Going down to 13-a side would mean union resembling league in more ways than one and would be considered heretical but the vast majority of clubs constantly have injury lists in double figures. Sam Warburton, Billy Vunipola, Taulupe Faletau, Ben Te’o, Garry Ringrose, Willem Nel, Wesley Fofana, Ross Moriarty and Nathan Hughes have been among the long-term casualties this year while the Worcester fly-half Tom Heathcote is out until April with concussion. Something needs to be done to protect players from themselves. “Going to 13 would fundamentally change the game,” Davies said. “There is no easy answer. If you tried to force teams to commit more players to the breakdown through a law change to create more space behind, how would you police it? A game would last for hours. Whatever you do, coaches will find a way around it.” • This is an extract taken from the Guardian’s weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

What is astonishing is how well the form fits the subject: Miranda’s use of rap, hip-hop and R&amp;B becomes the ideal vehicle for exploring the birth of a nation. Hamilton, as we’re told from the outset, is “a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman” who leaves the Caribbean to become George Washington’s right-hand man, a key interpreter of the constitution and secretary of the treasury. He marries well, overcomes a sex scandal and dies in a duel with his rival Aaron Burr who is his nemesis and the show’s narrator. But, while Hamilton is the story’s pivot, he is also part of a musical that, like the nation itself, seems in perpetual motion. Miranda’s music and lyrics combine two things that rarely go together: political passion and nimble wit. Hamilton early on tells us: “I’m just like my country. I’m young, scrappy and hungry, and I’m not throwing away my shot.” These lines are echoed by the whole ensemble in a terrific revolutionary anthem, Yorktown, in which the victorious American troops appropriate a traditional British ballad, The World Turned Upside Down. Miranda’s lyrics, which include references to Shakespeare and WS Gilbert, are full of verbal dexterity. Burr, surveying the nostalgie de la boue of the Schuyler sisters, tells us: “There’s nothing rich folks love more than goin’ downtown and slummin’ it with the poor.” In a show that glories in language, “Boston” is rhymed with “cost n’” and “lost n’”. Two numbers, particularly, symbolise Miranda’s superb mental agility. George III – played by Michael Jibson as a figure of ineffable absurdity – surveys the political infighting after Washington’s resignation with unholy relish. Crying: “Jesus Christ, this will be fun,” he jigs as if, under all the royal regalia, he were a closeted rocker. The outstanding number, however, is Burr’s The Room Where It Happens. This takes a politically complex subject: the secret deal in which Hamilton accepted the idea of Washington DC as the nation’s capital in exchange for federal control over the debts accrued by the separate states. Miranda turns it into a number of rapidly accelerating momentum about Burr’s desire to be in the room at the time of the deal – and about the mystery of history. The song, referencing Someone in a Tree from Sondheim’s Pacific Overtures, shows Miranda’s deep roots in America’s musical past. There are times in the second half when the show’s virtuosity becomes a little taxing. I’m also not sure that Miranda, who acknowledges the influence of Ron Chernow’s biography, ever fully establishes the difference between Jefferson’s vision of America as an agrarian paradise and Hamilton’s as one of urban entrepreneurship. But this is a show that, in Thomas Kail’s production and in Andy Blankenbuehler’s choreography, moves with intoxicating speed and combines historical sweep with attention to detail: one tiny example is the way the coveted letter that gives Hamilton command of a battalion in the fight with the Brits passes from hand to hand like an electrified baton. The performances also match the variety and energy of the music. Jamael Westman, not long out of drama school, invests Hamilton with immense authority, reminding us that words were always his most effective weapon and suggests a mixture of opportunist and visionary. Giles Terera plays Burr with an envious gleam as if he were Salieri to Hamilton’s Mozart and always slightly in awe of his rival’s whirlwind success. Obioma Ugoala’s Washington, Hamilton’s surrogate father, has great gravitas, Rachelle Ann Go lends Hamilton’s wife the poignancy of the neglected and Rachel John is impressive as his adoring sister-in-law. But the funniest performances, aside from Jibson’s English king, come from Jason Pennycooke who doubles as a patriotic Lafayette and a spring-heeled Jefferson in a maroon maxi who jives and jumps with glee as Hamilton’s fortunes fade. In the end, however, the power of Hamilton lies in its ability to make the past seem vividly present. It suggests its subject was an Icarus who flew too close to the sun. But it also shows that he was an outsider who believed in strong central government and an enlightened capitalism. Above all, Miranda has created an invigorating and original musical that, at a time of national crisis, celebrates America’s overwhelming debt to the immigrant.

The white SUV ran through the intersection on Flinders and Elizabeth Streets in Melbourne around 4.45pm. According to various eyewitness reports, it reached pedestrians about six or seven seconds after they were given the green light to cross the road. It came from the Swanston Street end of Flinders Street and hit a number of pedestrians before striking the concrete barrier at the tram stop on Flinders Street just past the Elizabeth Street intersection. That intersection is one of the busiest in Melbourne and is multi-directional, meaning that when the pedestrian lights go, people cross on the diagonal and swarm the road. Witnesses say between 40 and 60 people were in the intersection when the SUV went through. One witness told the ABC a number of bystanders responded quickly to assist those who had been injured, and one immediately approached the driver’s side of the car. The suggestion is they attempted to detain them. Police arrived within minutes. The male driver was arrested very quickly by police, and a second man, who was also alleged to have been in the car, has also been arrested. Police say have said they believe the crash was a “deliberate act” but it is too early to know what motivated it. The alleged driver of the car is a 32-year-old Australian citizen of Afghan descent who was arrested at the scene by an off-duty police officer. The man is known to police but there is no evidence or intelligence connecting either him or this incident to terrorism or extremism. Police say he does have a history of drug use and mental health issues and police are investigating those issues in connection with the incident. Another man, 24, was arrested a short time after the incident. He was filming it on his mobile phone and was searched by police, who allegedly found knives in his bag. Police do not believe he knows the 32-year-old man or is connected in any way. Nineteen people were injured and taken to hospital for treatment, including the alleged driver and the arresting off-duty officer. On Friday, 12 people remained in hospital with only one, a man in his 80s, in a critical condition. A four-year-old boy who suffered head injuries in the crash was still in hospital. Police say this was a “quarantined” incident and does not increase the risk at major upcoming events like the Boxing Day Test."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/21/antique-gun-dealer-jailed-supplying-gangsters-paul-edmunds","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T14:43:34Z","webTitle":"Antique-gun dealer jailed for 30 years for supplying to gangsters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/21/antique-gun-dealer-jailed-supplying-gangsters-paul-edmunds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/21/antique-gun-dealer-jailed-supplying-gangsters-paul-edmunds","fields":{"headline":"Antique-gun dealer jailed for 30 years for supplying to gangsters","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A 66-year-old antique firearms dealer from Gloucestershire has been jailed for 30 years after being found guilty of supplying weapons and handcrafted bullets to gangsters across the UK. Ammunition made by Paul Edmunds and weapons supplied by him have been found at more than 100 crime scenes including gangland murders and a firearms attack on a police helicopter. Edmunds crafted bespoke bullets for use in vintage weapons such as Smith &amp; Wesson pistols from the US and 19th-century French and Russian guns that he brought into the UK supposedly as collectors’ curiosities. He also imported prohibited 1950s Colt pistols following trips to Chicago, Las Vegas and Denver and falsely claimed they were more than a century old and therefore antiques. Jailing Edmunds, Judge Richard Bond told him: “You ran roughshod over your legal responsibilities as a registered firearms dealer. You were at the top of the chain of supply of handguns and ammunition to criminal gangs. “Without your actions the numerous handguns and hand-loaded ammunition would not have found their way on to the streets of the United Kingdom. Quite simply, you were the linchpin to this conspiracy and without you it could not have been carried out.” Edmunds, standing in the dock dressed in a formal white shirt, stood silently and did not react as he was jailed. A few feet away, in the public gallery, were the parents of an 18-year-old shooting victim, Kenichi Phillips, killed in Birmingham in March last year. One of Edmunds’s unfired rounds was found at the scene of his murder. In wider remarks calling for tighter firearms regulations, the judge added: “Unfortunately it takes just one person, as this case shows, to act in breach of the trust placed in them. Death and mayhem follow.” Edmunds supplied the guns and ammunition to an outwardly respectable Birmingham physiotherapist called Mohinder Surdhar after the pair met at a legitimate gun fair in 2008. In turn, Surdhar passed them on to a notorious Birmingham crime group called the Burger Bar gang, who kept some and sold others to underworld contacts. When West Midlands police arrested Edmunds at his home in the Gloucestershire village of Hardwicke they found 100,000 rounds of ammunition in his garage, bedroom and attic. Detectives have linked 1,000 rounds of ammunition and 17 guns found at UK crime scenes to Edmunds but believe many other guns and ammunition that passed through his hands are still in the possession of criminals. West Midlands police have likened Edmunds and Surdhar to the unlikely crooks Walter White and Jesse Pinkman from the US television show Breaking Bad – apparently decent but making money through crime. They said Edmunds had an “encyclopedic knowledge” of firearms. When he was interviewed by police, Edmunds spoke candidly about his disdain for the UK’s strict laws on firearms and the handgun ban introduced in the wake of the Dunblane tragedy. He told police he “didn’t give a shit” about potential victims. He said he was “not responsible for the actions of somebody that buys some things”, adding that his “duty of care” extended only to not selling to people who “didn’t look right”. Police said that of the 280 guns imported between 2009 and 2015, the whereabouts of 207 remained a mystery. Edmunds was found guilty of conspiracy to transfer prohibited weapons and ammunition, two counts of perverting the course of justice, transferring prohibited weapons, possession of prohibited weapons and importing firearms from America. He pleaded guilty to exporting ammunition. Surdhar admitted conspiracy to transfer prohibited weapons and ammunition. The net began to close in on Edmunds and Surdhar when firearms experts at the National Ballistics Intelligence Service (Nabis) noticed that since 2009, particularly in the West Midlands, police were recovering an increasing number of antique handguns and specially adapted ammunition. After Dunblane it became harder for criminals to source new handguns. One way around this is to use antique pistols with specially created ammunition. The experts from Nabis realised that much of the ammunition they were recovering had been made with the same equipment. Typically four tools are used to create ammunition, each of which leaves markings, creating a sort of industrial fingerprint. The Nabis experts and police connected members of the Burger Bar gang to some of the weapons and secured the convictions of 16 gang members. But the names of Surdhar and Edmunds also surfaced and led police to their doors. The judge, in remarks on gun legislation, said he had been “aghast” to hear from one legally registered firearms importer who gave evidence how packages were “not always checked” by UK border officials. He said: “This lax attitude ... means that those who can lawfully bring weapons into this country can do so without them being properly checked.”Bond said: “Are the public aware that there is legislation to prevent the sale of scrap metal for cash, whilst an antique firearm can be bought and sold for cash, and the seller is not obliged to keep any record?“There are real concerns that the use of handguns is becoming more prevalent. The evidence I have heard demonstrates that firearms dealers are able, if they so choose, to circumvent the firearms legislation. “I ask myself, how is it possible to reduce the number of firearms falling into the hands of criminal gangs? I hope that certain MPs would be willing to discuss with the police ideas as to how to achieve this goal.” Bond called for a better legal definition of the word “antique” so there was no room for argument about how a weapon should be categorised. The judge also expressed shock that Surdhar’s firearms licence allowed him to own a sniper rifle that could kill at a range of two miles. “I believe that many people would be horrified to hear that such weapons can be lawfully held in this country by members of the public. Quite simply, this type of weapon needs to be outlawed.” The prosecution said that since October 2017, when Edmunds’ trial began, there had been 13 more recoveries of weapons and ammunition linked to him. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has some of the toughest gun laws in the world. We are determined to keep it that way, which is why we are strengthening firearms controls further, including those relating to antique firearms, to stop them falling into the hands of criminals. “Furthermore, we have updated our training and guidelines for frontline border force officers on the checks required for declaring antique firearms. “We work with other law enforcement agencies, using intelligence and advanced technology, to detect and stop dangerous weapons at the border. Border force targeted operations and routine searches led to the seizure of over 400 firearms and over 1,500 items related to firearms last year.” The Home Office been drawing up proposals that will enshrine in law a new definition of antique firearms, which will help ensure older firearms that still pose a danger to the public are licensed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/31/human-rights-commissioner-ed-santow-on-religious-freedom-its-about-potential-conflicts","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:29:39Z","webTitle":"Human rights commissioner Ed Santow on religious freedom: 'It's about potential conflicts'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/31/human-rights-commissioner-ed-santow-on-religious-freedom-its-about-potential-conflicts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/31/human-rights-commissioner-ed-santow-on-religious-freedom-its-about-potential-conflicts","fields":{"headline":"Human rights commissioner Ed Santow on religious freedom: 'It's about potential conflicts'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s been a good end to the year for Ed Santow. Before I can ask about the upcoming religious freedom inquiry under Philip Ruddock, Santow rattles off three big wins in his area of responsibility at the Australian Human Rights Commission. First, Australia became the 25th country to legalise marriage equality after the unprecedented national postal survey. Second, the family court ruled, after the AHRC intervened in the case, that Australia’s transgender teenagers will no longer have to apply to the court to get access to hormone treatment. And third, Australia ratified the optional protocol to the convention against torture. But Santow will now have to pull together AHRC submissions by the 31 January deadline for the panel led by Ruddock, a former attorney general, which will review religious freedom in Australia. During the marriage debate, the meaning of “religious freedom” was hotly contested. The Liberal senator Dean Smith, at first supported by Malcolm Turnbull, maintained that his bill did not restrict religious freedom; senators James Paterson and David Fawcett argued that a raft of legal changes were needed to allow service providers to refuse to cater to weddings. Santow explains that international human rights law protects religious freedom in two main ways: the right to hold a religious belief, which he says is “absolute and there can be no restriction on that”; and to manifest it, which he says is “very important but can be subject to some restrictions under human rights law”. “The way one person manifests their right can impact another’s rights and interests – it’s about trying to create an accommodation between potential conflicts.” Santow says protection of freedom in religion in Australia is “piecemeal”. There is a “strong but narrow” protection in section 116 of the constitution, which says the government cannot prohibit the free exercise of religion, but there are gaps in other laws. “There is no freestanding protection in our anti-discrimination law, at the federal level, against discrimination on the basis of religion,” he says. “That’s an anomaly in many ways.” Santow says closing that gap would be “the most obvious” way for Australia to implement its obligations under article 18 of the international covenant on civil and political rights. He says Australia “hasn’t fully implemented” provisions that ban hate speech against people on the basis of their religion. That may entail something like applying section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act – which bans speech that insults, offends or humiliates people based on their race – to discriminatory speech against religious people. In a textbook case of the difficulty of balancing rights, in March the Senate blocked the government’s push to weaken section 18C by nudging the balance in favour of freedom of speech and away from non-discrimination. The international covenant says freedom to manifest religious belief “may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others”. Santow says this calls for a “commonsense approach” – that impositions on freedom to manifest religious belief must be proportionate, clear and “absolutely necessary to protect other legitimate interests”. “How we achieve that accommodation is a mark of how embracing we are of diversity of our community,” he says. “If one right is permitted to completely swamp all other rights, that will really diminish the level of freedom that ordinary people will be able to enjoy.” A new appointee to the Ruddock review panel, Nicholas Aroney, has warned in his academic writing that religious freedom risks becoming a second-class right to anti-discrimination. Just Equal’s spokesman, Rodney Croome, seized on the remarks as indicating a view that “religious freedom trumps other rights, including equality”. Santow declines to comment on the implications for marriage service providers, except to say that there are gaps that need to be filled for both rights. Asked how to balance the two in the context of marriage, Santow says: “It’s a difficult debate. The balance in the law that just passed is a pragmatic one,” he says, although he accepts that reasonable minds can differ on that point. Santow notes that it provides “very significant” protection to religious ministers to refuse to solemnise weddings. “By saying civil celebrants may not have that same choice open to them – I guess what parliament is saying is there is a difference between religious marriage and civil marriage.” Religious institutions get strong protection because society considers organised religion “unique and special ... as opposed to someone individually who may be motivated by a particular religious belief”. Despite all the focus on religious freedom, Santow says, Australia has not incorporated all its international human rights law obligations into domestic law. “We are the only liberal democracy that doesn’t have a national human rights act or constitutional bill of rights. “That leaves gaps in freedom of expression, association, the right to life and many others. Whether we reconsider those is a question for the community.” Santow says he has “no concern” at the focus on religious freedom, explaining it is normal to deal with human rights questions as and when they arise in public debate. He says it’s perfectly possible to deal with religious freedom while also considering other human rights law questions. Santow is on record as supporting a human rights act, an idea rejected as recently as 2009 after a review by another Ruddock panel appointee, Frank Brennan. But he notes that reform processes “have to have strong popular and political support”. Another thorny question for the AHRC will be its position on sharia and other religious laws. Aroney has argued that recognising religious freedom should include acceptance of sharia within “strictly justifiable limits imposed by the general law”. But the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has warned that “there’s no way I’ll be supporting a process that gives rise to a push for sharia law”. “We don’t have a position, it’s something we will consider carefully in drafting our submission,” Santow says. “Any religious organisation has significant freedom to run its own affairs … [but] there are limits and … the state will carefully intervene where any religious organisation commits harmful practices.” Asked if private disputes, such as wills or divorces, could be handled differently because participants are adherents of a particular religion, Santow says it “happens anyway”. He gives the example of an Orthodox Jewish couple who divorce under Australian civil law. A parallel “second religious set of requirements” can exist to deal with the religious marriage according to Orthodox Jewish principles “provided that second set of requirements isn’t going to harm each other or anyone else”, Santow says. Marriage equality advocates expect Santow to have the careful, rational approach to legal problems that will guarantee a judicious and influential contribution from the AHRC to the debate on religious freedom. But – as he observes with respect to calls for a human rights act – it is the government that controls the reform process and it’s up to the people to decide how the law finds its balance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/22/in-the-year-of-covfefe-turnbull-managed-to-look-more-villainous-than-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"In the year of covfefe, Turnbull managed to look more villainous than Trump | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/22/in-the-year-of-covfefe-turnbull-managed-to-look-more-villainous-than-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/22/in-the-year-of-covfefe-turnbull-managed-to-look-more-villainous-than-trump","fields":{"headline":"In the year of covfefe, Turnbull managed to look more villainous than Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s been a mad, bad, dark year, where the pace of events moved so fast that legislators and the media in the US barely paused to consider the country’s worst ever mass shooting (October, the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Vegas) before moving onto the next thing, and the next, and the next. This pace, these wild and bizarre times, and the increasingly hysterical push alerts that chronicled them, were embodied in 10 weird days in July. Remember July? Remember when Sean Spicer suddenly resigned and was replaced by Anthony Scaramucci, aka the Mooch? Fronting the media in slicked back hair and mirrored sunglasses – like a costume party Gordon Gekko – the Long Island hedge fund manager started his job by saying four times that he “loved the president”; and also for the sake of transparency he was deleting his old tweets, which among other things advocated for gun control, called Hillary Clinton “incredibly competent” and called Trump “so smart with no judgment.” It was hang onto your hat stuff. He threatened to “fire everybody” for leaking – before he was caught leaking, to the New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza. He said in a taped telephone call, he wanted to “kill all the fucking leakers”, before accusing Donald Trump’s right-hand-man of auto-fellatio. “I’m not Steve Bannon; I’m not trying to suck my own cock.” And bang. Just as soon as he arrived, he was gone: one vivid and strange part of a fever dream that lasted all year. The year began with a portent: the dark skies of inauguration day and Trump’s dark American carnage speech. Then: the women’s march, crowd sizes and “alternative facts”, government policy announced by tweet, the travel ban to US from citizens of seven Muslim majority nations. The Oscar for best picture given – literally – to the wrong film, Trump accusing Obama in a tweet of having “had my ‘wires tapped’”. It was the year of covfefe and the Fyre festival. Bill O’Reilly was fired (sexual harassment), Kevin Spacey was disappeared (sexual harassment), Louis CK disappeared (gross masturbator), and in October allegations against Harvey Weinstein led to the #metoo movement, which has the potential to lead to a once in a generation structural and behavioural change. Terrorism continued: Barcelona, New York, Istanbul, Sehwan, St Petersburg. The United Kingdom had a summer of pain: the Westminster bridge attack, the Ariana Grande concert terror attack in Manchester, followed in quick succession by the London Bridge attacks, and then the Grenfell tower disaster. Jeremy Corbyn didn’t quite seize power in the UK but he left the Tories shaken – and reignited a socialist movement, particularly among young people. The Tories remain battered, limping towards the end of the year. There’s been the never ending war and never ending misery in Yemen, and, in Myanmar, the slaughter and ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people. They’ve been driven from their homelands into border camps in Bangladesh, while that once great symbol of human rights, and the country’s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi has remained mute. In August, white supremacy showed its hand in Charlottesville. Anti-fascist protester Heather Heyer was killed and in a press conference soon after, Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides”. On it went. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the devastation of Puerto Rico (who could forget Trump throwing paper towels into the destitute crowd). Threats of deportation hanging over children of illegal immigrants (“the Dreamers”), African American athletes taking the knee during the national anthem at matches to protest police violence. Mass shooting, after mass shooting. Australia was not immune to a year of absurdity and high drama. Politicians disappeared – one by one, party by party, in a sort of bloodless revolution known as the “citizenship saga”. No one saw it coming. Grown men started blaming their parents for not telling them about their ancestry, for not putting in the paperwork. The high court did its proper job of upholding the constitution. On social media – and in some cases, the streets – people were engaged in what seemed at times like hand-to-hand combat over same-sex marriage. The plebiscite felt dirty from the get-go. The win for yes and the joy that followed was pure, but the rest, leading up to it, carried a taint of stinky politics. There was no taint to what happened to refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island. It was pure bastardry. Which brings me to the most cynical thing that occurred this year – which is really quite a feat. Remember that phone call between Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull in January? The one that ended abruptly with Trump hanging up? The assumption, before the transcript was leaked to the Washington Post months later, was that Trump was being an unreasonable bully. Instead, it is Turnbull who comes off looking worse than Trump. Here’s a taste of it again, lest it becomes one more thing that we forget about. The basis of it is a negotiation of a swap of refugees in Australian offshore detention for some South American refugees from the US. Trump: Why haven’t you let them out? Why have you not let them into your society? Turnbull: OK, I will explain why. It is not because they are bad people. It is because in order to stop people smugglers, we had to deprive them of the product. So we said if you try to come to Australia by boat, even if we think you are the best person in the world, even if you are a Noble [sic] Prize winning genius, we will not let you in. Because the problem with the people — Trump: That is a good idea. We should do that too. You are worse than I am. You are worse than I am. We should not forget that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/live/2017/dec/21/damian-green-sacking-theresa-may-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T17:01:22Z","webTitle":"May says she wants investigation into release of Damian Green information – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/dec/21/damian-green-sacking-theresa-may-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2017/dec/21/damian-green-sacking-theresa-may-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"May says she wants investigation into release of Damian Green information – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here’s a summary of today’s events. Thanks for all your comments and Happy Christmas from me as well as I’m off now until Boxing Day. Theresa May has called for an investigation into the release of private Met information about Damian Green. Green, a friend and close political ally of May, resigned as first secretary of state after he falsely denied claims from a former Met officer that porn was found on Green’s computer nine years ago. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said that he wants the one million Poles living in the UK to return to Poland. He made the comments at a press conference in Warsaw alongside May, who he said wants the Poles to stay in the UK. Morawiecki signalled that he would back the UK on a bespoke Brexit deal including services, warning against “very dangerous” EU protectionism. The Polish prime minister said: “The UK is a very important trade partner for Poland. The UK is a very powerful country exporting services, it’s obvious for the UK they would like to remain a very strong player in this area.” Mark Garnier did not break the ministerial code when he admitted asking his former assistant to buy sex toys, the Cabinet Office has found. Although its investigation concluded that his former assistant Caroline Edmondson had suffered distress as a result of his behaviour, it said that it occurred before he was a minister and that “he did not break the ministerial code while holding government office”. The Cabinet Office has ruled that Mark Garnier, who admitted asking his former assistant to buy sex toys, did not breach the ministerial code when doing so. The crucial point, from the investigation’s perspective, seems to be that he was not a minister at the time that that particular behaviour occurred. Garnier was one of many politicians named in reports as allegations of sexual harassment swirled around Westminster after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. In a statement just released, a spokesman for the prime minister said: Following allegations of sexual misconduct, the prime minister asked the Cabinet Office to look into the behaviour of Mark Garnier MP, parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department for International Trade. The Cabinet Office’s investigation primarily considered Mr Garnier’s behaviour as a minister, but also heard evidence from before he was appointed to government.The Cabinet Office concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that Mr Garnier’s conduct as a Minister since 2016 had breached the expected standards of behaviour. The prime minister’s view is therefore that Mr Garnier did not break the ministerial code while holding government office. The Cabinet Office also took evidence in relation to an incident that happened before Mr Garnier was a minister, between Mr Garnier and a member of his parliamentary and constituency staff. The Cabinet Office concluded that there was no dispute about the facts of the incident, but there was a significant difference of interpretation between the parties, and that the member of staff in Mr Garnier’s office was distressed by what had occurred. “It was not his intention to cause distress, and Mr Garnier has apologised unreservedly to the individual. On that basis the prime minister considers that a line should be drawn under the issue.” The Press Association reports that the prime minister was tickled by a reference to her as “Madame Brexit” during the press conference in Warsaw: Theresa May could not help smiling as an interpreter for the Polish prime minister referred to her as “Madame Brexit” in a translation broadcast live on television. A passage of Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki’s opening speech was translated as: “It’s very important for us that this co-operation, even though it will be based soon on different rules and different regulations than it has been so far because of Brexit, because as Madame Brexit said, Brexit is Brexit...” Mrs May was then seen smirking as Mr Morawiecki went on: “But regardless of all that, we all realise how important the co-operation in defence, internal affairs, economic affairs, financial affairs is, as is the co-operation in all the areas.” The pair appeared for a joint press conference after signing a joint UK-Poland Treaty on Defence and Security Co-operation, and with phase two of the Brexit negotiations, on the future UK-EU relationship, due to begin in the new year. Poland’s prime minister’s signalled his country would back the UK on a bespoke Brexit deal including services, at a joint meeting with Theresa May in Warsaw where he warned against “very dangerous” EU protectionism. Five senior cabinet ministers accompanied May on the visit to Warsaw, a signal of the growing strategic importance of the relationship, but which risked being overshadowed by the deepening rift between prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki’s administration at the EU over his hardline government’s crackdown on judicial independence. Chancellor Philip Hammond, Home secretary Amber Rudd, Foreign secretary Boris Johnson, Defence secretary Gavin Williamson and Business secretary Greg Clark all flew in for the trip aimed at wooing the Polish government seen as key allies in post-Brexit trade talks, given their desire to retain close security cooperation. At a press conference where Williamson and his Polish counterpart signed a wide-ranging defence treaty, Morawiecki said there were clear joint interests in a bespoke deal: On economic co-operation, there is hard to find closer partners than we are. The UK is a very important trade partner for Poland. The UK is a very powerful country exporting services, it’s obvious for the UK they would like to remain a very strong player in this area. Morawiecki said the EU should resist reactionary protectionism, something which he said the UK had always pushed for as a member. All the protectionist movements are very dangerous and that’s why we really regret losing the UK as our ally in a number of discussions at the EU level where we tried to mitigate and reduce the red tape and a number of regulations. But we do believe in this new agreement that will soon be worked out, will soon be negotiated, and we will be able to co-operate with the UK as close as possible. May, he said, had told him she wanted to maintain deep links on defence, economic affairs, student exchanges and educational co-operation. Poland’s own influence at the European Commission is highly contested however as it remains mired in a stand-off after the body said it would commence official censure proceedings, over legal changes that the EU claims would threaten the independence of the Polish judiciary. The government has in turn accused the commission of a politically-motivated attack. Labour has commented on the government’s defeat in what it calls a “landmark” court case against “discriminatory” personal independence payment (Pip) legislation (see previous post). The shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams said: This landmark ruling is a damning indictment of the government’s discriminatory approach to Pip support and its refusal to make this support available to people with mental health conditions. So much for the prime minister’s commitment to deliver parity of esteem for mental health. When the government should have been listening to successive court rulings on PIP payments and correcting injustices for people with debilitating mental health conditions, they decided to undermine the legal basis for the judgments and introduce emergency legislation. This was a step too far, even for this Tory government. Labour is committed to overturn the emergency regulations and make Pip available to people with mental health conditions, as well as scrapping the PIP assessments to develop a personalised, holistic assessment process which provides each individual with support and a tailored plan. Charities have urged the government to take heed of a high court ruling, which found in favour of a woman with mental health difficulties who questioned the fairness of personal independence payments (Pips), designed to help disabled people maintain independence. The judge, Mr Justice Mostyn, said the regulations were “blatantly discriminatory” against people with mental health impairments. Mark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, said: Thousands of disabled people rely on Pip to live independently and help meet the often substantial extra costs they face related to their condition or impairment. The government must listen carefully to today’s ruling and act quickly to reverse these changes, rather than further dragging the issue through the courts. Georgina Carr, head of campaigns and external relations at the MS Society, said: As the judgment suggests, not everyone fits neatly into categories, and people shouldn’t be denied support because of this. We’re urging the government to scrap these rules so that people don’t have to rely on courts to get the support they need. Sarah Lambert, the National Autistic Society’s head of policy and public affairs, said: This ruling is hugely significant for many autistic adults, who struggle to make new and unfamiliar journeys because of anxiety and psychological distress. We opposed the changes the government made earlier this year, which limited psychological distress as a factor in assessing eligibility for mobility payments and we gave evidence in this case, because we knew how serious the impact of this change was on autistic adults. So we are very pleased that the courts have agreed that the changes were discriminatory and that the new rules should be quashed. Dr Jed Boardman, the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ social inclusion lead, said: I’m delighted that the court has agreed the government’s decision to change the law to prevent people with mental health conditions accessing the support they need was blatantly discriminatory. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: PIP replaced a system that was less generous for people with mental health conditions and is designed to consider the broader picture of how someone’s life is affected by their disability or health condition... We are disappointed the judgment fails to recognise that PIP provides more support to people with mental health conditions than ever before.” My colleague Haroon Siddique is taking over the blog now. I’ve got to head off for a meeting. Since this will be the last blog of 2017, Happy Christmas to everyone. Thanks for reading, and thank you to all of those who comment. Smart, informative comments are an important part of what makes this blog successful, and I know my reporting is definitely improved by the way you flag things up and challenge me BTL. The blog should be back on Tuesday 2 January, at around 9am. May says she is glad the UK and the EU have made progress on citizens’ rights. Poles in the UK will be able to apply for settled status. That will be an easy process. There will be a significant period of time during which people can apply. She says people who have decided to live in the UK have made a life choice. The UK government wants them to continue to have that right. Morawiecki says there is a difference of opinion between him and May about Poles in the UK. She says she wants the 1m Poles in the UK to stay, he says. He says he wants them to return to Poland. Polish PM says he wants the Poles living in the UK to return to Poland. He says the Polish economy is growing. That should give people an incentive to return. Q: Do you want to see the UK get a bespoke trade deal from the EU? Q: Are you concerned about reports of a Russian spy in Number 10? That was a reference to this. The tweet is from a BBC Kiev correspondent. May says she is aware of this. It is for the Ukranians to investigate. Q: Is there a police vendetta against Green? May says she shares the concerns expressed about the comments made by a former Met officer. She expects those concerns to be properly investigated. Q: [From the BBC] Have you done enough to deal with sexual harassment? And have the police questions to answer? May says this is a wide question. The government is continuing to address this question. It has a strategy for addressing domestic violence. And, in parliament, she has taken steps to ensure it is a workplace where people can raise concerns about harassment or bullying. Work is being done to put a proper grievance procedure in place. As for the attitude of the police in the Damian Green case, May says she shares the concerns about the comments from a former Met officer. She expects those concerns to be properly looked at. May says she wants the release of private Met information about Damian Green to be investigated. Q: Do you support the UK’s demand for a bespoke trade deal? Morawiecki says he he would to see rules for the UK functioning in the EU after Brexit developed as soon as possible, to provide certainty. Theresa May is speaking now. She says our ties with Poland are rooted in history. We will never forget Polish troops who fought alongside British troops in the war, or the contribution of Polish airmen. And she says many Poles are in the UK now where their contribution is valued. Today a landmark UK-Polish treaty has been signed on defence cooperation. It is the only second treaty of its kind signed with an European partner, she says. She says the UK and Poland have also agreed to bolster cooperation to resist Russian attempts to weaponise information. The Kremlin is trying to undermine the international rules-based system, she says. She says it will not be allowed to succeed. She says the UK and Poland will continue to work together on foreign policy. She says 2018 will be a UK-Polish year for entrepreneurs. She says she wants to give assurances to the almost 1m Poles in the UK “that they are a strong part of our society and we want them to stay”. She says the talks have been very productive. She ends with a few words of Polish. These are from Jakub Krupa from the Polish Press Agency. Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish prime minister, goes first. He is talking about cooperation between Poland and the UK. On Brexit, he says he would like to see a quick agreement on a transition period, and then a deal that would allow the UK to cooperate with the EU to the highest extent. He says he is glad the UK will cooperate with Poland on defence. After Brexit, Nato is particularly important, he says. The press conference is starting now. It is going to begin with the signing of a defence cooperation treaty. UPDATE: This is from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn. Here are two articles on Damian Green worth reading. From Adrian Wooldridge’s Bagehot column in the Economist In some ways Mr Green was a classic second-division politician, sensible and reliable but never a man to make the weather. He liked to present himself as the solid embodiment of middle-class common sense, which might be one reason why he got on so well with Mrs May. He also specialised in pouring oil on troubled waters. But in other ways he was more interesting. He was brought up in a council house in South Wales and nevertheless won a place at Balliol College, Oxford. He remained on the left wing of the Conservative Party through thick and thin, and even contemplated leaving the party in the early 1980s for the breakaway Social Democrats, because he worried that Margaret Thatcher might tear the country apart. This columnist, though a few years younger than Mr Green, remembers seeing him in Balliol College Junior Common Room looking and sounding almost the same as he does today, a member of that strange breed of politicians, of which William Hague is the archetype, who arrive at university fully formed as middle-aged fogies. From the Evening Standard’s editorial When Mrs May became PM last year she ripped out all the inner wiring that had made the Cameron Government function — getting rid of virtually the whole Downing Street staff and Cabinet Office ministerial team, for no other apparent reason other than that her own advisers, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, didn’t much like them. All the lessons that had been learnt over the previous six years were lost. Unsurprisingly, the result was paralysis — and no real domestic achievements. It was an approach that culminated in the most disastrous manifesto in modern UK history. In the election aftermath, the Cabinet forced Mrs May to fire her advisers and Mr Green was hired to pick up the pieces. Although a university contemporary, he was not especially close to her. But as a rational, calming voice at the centre Mr Green was welcomed by an exasperated Civil Service. Now that he’s gone there is no one around Mrs May with any enduring bonds of loyalty to her — the new, competent team recruited to No 10 hardly knew her at all before they got the call-up. Theresa May is about to hold a press conference in Poland. There is a live feed here. Despite being effectively sacked, Damian Green will receive a pay-off of nearly £17,000, the Cabinet Office has confirmed. Under the legislation which governs these things, the Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991, all minister who lose their jobs and don’t get a new post within three weeks – it seems pretty likely Green will not – receive three months of salary as a severance payment. Green was entitled to a ministerial salary of £69,844, but under a voluntary pay cap scheme for ministers, received £67,505. A quarter of that will net him £16,876.25. This system is in effect for all ministers, no matter whether they resign, are sacked or reshuffled. The one caveat is that they must be under 65. Green is 61, but when Michael Fallon stepped down as defence secretary he had recently turned 65, so got nothing. Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, has put out this statement about the Metropolitan police’s decision to refer the Green case to her. (See 12.39pm.) She said: We can confirm that we have received a referral from the Metropolitan police service that explains their belief that offences under the Data Protection Act 1998 have been committed by former MPS officers. As the UK’s data protection regulator, we’ll be looking at whether individuals acted unlawfully by retaining or disclosing personal data. These are serious allegations and we are investigating to determine whether the law has been broken and what further action is necessary including potential criminal prosecution. Under the Data Protection Act, anyone who is prosecuted and found guilty could face an unlimited fine. In Edinburgh there were emotional scenes at the final first minister’s questions of the year as Scottish Labour’s Jackie Baillie spoke about the fire at Cameron House Hotel in her constituency, which killed a young couple and injured several others earlier this week. Fighting back tears, Baillie called on the first minister to ensure that lessons are learnt once the investigation into the fire is completed, or if a need to enhance building standards regulations becomes apparent. A young couple on a winter break from London, Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson, died as the fire ravaged the Loch Lomond-side resort. Clearly also moved by the tragedy, Sturgeon conveyed her deep condolences the families of the young men who died, and asked the chamber to join with her sending their thanks to the emergency services involved. She added the investigation should be allowed to run its course but gave her assurance that any lessons would be fully applied. Elsewhere, Sturgeon praised former SNP cabinet minister Richard Lochhead’s tireless campaign against inflated delivery charges for his Highland constituents. Lochhead has recently scored some significant successes with his Rip-off Surcharge campaign, which estimates that online shoppers in Scotland pay an additional £36.3million in delivery charges than the rest of the UK every year. The regulation of parcel pricing is reserved to Westminster, and UK ministers last week agreed to review the system. Sturgeon said that she hoped that “this is the last Christmas for consumers in the north of Scotland to be so blatantly ripped off in this unacceptable way.” Damian Green has posted a tweet saying that he has been “overwhelmed” by the support he has received from friends, colleagues and constituents since he was sacked. The government’s Brexit reports have been published by the Commons Brexit committee. But the committee, which has a narrow Tory/DUP majority, decided to leave out the “sector views” sections, which cover what firms and trade bodies are saying about Brexit, and it has not said much about what the reports actually say. But the reports were also sent to the House of Lords EU committee. And that committee, which does not have a Conservative majority, has delivered a verdict of sorts on the reports. It comes in the form of an open letter (pdf) to David Davis, the Brexit secretary, from Lord Jay of Ewelme, the former head of the Foreign Office who is now acting chair of the committee. The letter says the committee staff have reviewed all 850 pages in their entirety and it makes the following points. Davis should publish the reports in full, including the “sector views” sections, Jay says. Jay says there is nothing in the reports that is “negotiation sensitive” and that most of the stakeholder views material (the “sector views” stuff that has been held back by the Commons committee) is material “already in the public domain, including in committee inquiries and reports. He says: In light of these findings, we can see no reason why the sectoral analyses should not be published in full – they pose no risk to the UK’s negotiating position, and making them publicly available would, in our view, only promote an informed public debate on the options for Brexit. We understand that the House of Commons exiting the EU committee has decided to publish a redacted version of the documents. Nevertheless, we would urge you to publish them in full. The reports show there is a general desire amongst industry to “minimise disruption and uncertainty”, Jay says. In other words, the reports do show there is a general desire amongst business and industry to soften Brexit, the committee’s analysis suggests. Jay says: Views on particular Brexit options, such as single market membership, differ across sectors, but in most cases there is a wish to minimise disruption and uncertainty. A number of themes recur in the views of stakeholders. These include: access to EU labour; the minimisation of tariffs and regulatory barriers to trade; data sharing; mutual recognition of qualifications; access to cross-border services; and the importance of EU R&amp;D funding. The reports are “inconsistent in approach” and their representation of stakeholder views is “patchy”, Jay says. There is also “little over-arching analysis” and “no conclusions are drawn with regard to the UK’s future relationship with the EU”. Here is more on the government Brexit reports. From the Labour MP Jo Stevens From the Labour MP Seema Malhotra From HuffPost’s Paul Waugh Here is the statement from the Metropolitan police about the decision to ask the information commissioner to investigate the release of private police information about what was found on Damian Green’s computer in a police raid. The Met said: The Metropolitan police service has asked the information commissioner’s cffice (ICO) to investigate the apparent disclosure to the media of confidential material gathered during a police investigation in 2008 by two former officers. An ex-assistant commissioner and ex-detective constable have both made a number of disclosures to the media, passing on information that they were privy to as part of a police investigation. Due to the length of time that has passed since both officers left the MPS, legal advice was sought regarding the most appropriate action to take. In this instance it was determined that the most appropriate course of action was to make a referral to the ICO to carry out a further investigation in relation to potential Data Protection Act offences. The MPS is clear that confidential information gathered during any police inquiry should remain confidential. That is an enduring confidentiality regardless of whether an officer leaves the service. Gareth Bacon, leader of the Conservative group on the London assembly, has welcomed the news. In a statement he said: I am pleased to see the Met is taking seriously what appears to have been a gross abuse of trust from former police officers. If the general public is to have future confidence in the force’s ability to protect sensitive information, this case must be dealt with robustly. I welcome the commissioner’s strong words this morning and the referral to the IC. An investigation into allegations about the private life of Labour MP Keith Vaz has been suspended by the House of Commons sleaze watchdog “for medical reasons”, the Press Association reports. The halting of the probe was revealed in an update of the list of ongoing inquiries on the parliamentary commissioner for standards’ website, and her office did not give any more details. In 2016, the Leicester East MP issued a public apology to his wife and children, and quit as chairman of the Commons home affairs Committee, following reports in the Sunday Mirror that he paid two male escorts for their services. The PA story goes on: The probe by the standards commissioner Kathryn Hudson will determine whether Vaz was guilty of a conflict of interest as he headed the home affairs committee’s review of vice laws at the time of the allegations regarding male escorts. The watchdog was also looking into whether the former Europe minister has caused “significant damage” to the reputation of parliament. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, has also criticised the government for the lack of analysis in the Brexit reports. Here is Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, on the publication of the government’s secret Brexit reports. This is the biggest case of the dog ate my homework the world has ever seen. We’ve been given binders of old information, extracts from Wikipedia, and a few choice quotes, and yet nothing at all on how Brexit will hit each sector. Now the government’s woeful failure to prepare for Brexit has been laid bare in front of the whole country. The mess this government are making of negotiations shows why the people must be given the opportunity to exit from Brexit. On Twitter, Brake also argued that if Damian Green deserves the sack, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, should do too. Here is some more reaction to the publication of the secret government Brexit reports. Open Britain, which is campaigning for a soft Brexit, has put out this statement from the Labour MP Pat McFadden. The knots the government has tied itself in over publication of these reports says more about the state of politics and the government’s paranoid state of mind than it does about Brexit. There is little or nothing in them that couldn’t be learned from the annual reports of different trade bodies yet we were asked to believe that somehow revealing how many cars were made in Britain every year was an act of national treachery. The government’s most ardent supporters on the select committee voted not to reveal the sections which showed the industry views of Brexit and what they hoped the outcome of the talks would be. You have to wonder what they have to fear. This whole saga of whether or not there were impact assessments or sectoral studies, and what the difference between them may or may not be, has revealed that breezy busking won’t cut it when people’s jobs and livelihoods are on the line. Winging it should not be a matter of principle. The best way through this is to know as much as we can and put jobs and prosperity before the ideology that has driven much of the positioning up until now. And this is from Eloise Todd, chief executive of Best for Britain, which is campaigning to keep open the option of reversing Brexit. She said: These reports are the most useless and shoddy piece of work a government department has ever produced. Even the Iraq Dodgy Dossier had some useful information in it. These are a shoddy mess that a sixteen year old wouldn’t be proud of. It is a masterclass in copy and paste. David Davis has been shown up for the charlatan he is. He needs to consider his position. This is from Sky’s Jason Farrell, who is with Theresa May on the trip to Poland. Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, has told the London assembly that the release of private police information about what was on Damian Green’s computer has been referred to the information commissioner, LBC’s Theo Usherwood reports. Here are some tweets from journalists and specialists who have been looking at the government’s Brexit reports. From the Guardian’s Dan Roberts From the Centre for European Reform’s John Springford From the New Local Government Network’s Adam Lent From the BBC’s Ross Hawkins From MailOnline’s Tim Sculthorpe But there is one dissenting voice. These are from the Institute for Government’s Jill Rutter. At the regular Number 10 lobby briefing we had a few details confirmed about the process behind Damian Green’s departure. Theresa May’s spokesman said the report was first received by May on Monday, and she then passed the findings to Sir Alex Allan, the former senior civil servant who is now her adviser on ministerial appointments. Alex Allan reported back to the prime minister yesterday to say that he agreed with the conclusions and the fact that there had been breaches of the ministerial code, the spokesman said. On a replacement for Green, he said there was unlikely to be an announcement before parliament goes into recess later today, meaning it will presumably happen in the New Year. No cabinet committees which would have been chaired by Green are due to meet before mid-January, he added. On the other investigation into a minister over alleged inappropriate behaviour, about trade minister Mark Garnier, there is no news as to when that might come. “Once we are in a position to give you the findings, we’ll do so,” the spokesman said. A very quick skim through the Brexit reports suggests their news value is minimal, if not non-existent. They all seem to start with a blurb that includes this paragraph. As the government has already made clear, it is not the case that 58 sectoral impact assessments exist. The government’s sectoral analysis is a wide mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis contained in a range of documents developed at different times since the referendum. This report brings together information about the sector in a way that is accessible and informative. Some reports aggregate some sectors in order to either avoid repetition of information or because of the strong interlinkages between some of these sectors. Each report then summarises the size and nature of a sector of the economy, including reference to its relationship with EU regulation. But there does not seem to be any reference to the potential difficulties posed by Brexit, and in each document the section entitled “sector views”, which presumably says what relevant firms and trade bodies are demanding from the government post Brexit, has been redacted by the committee. The Brexit select committee has just published most of the government’s secret Brexit reports. They were supplied to the committee after the Commons voted for Brexit impact reports to be published, although the government subsequently said that proper impact reports did not exist. These are described as sectoral analysis reports instead. The Brexit committee has published 39 of them. You can read them all here. But you may well have better things to do. As Jessica Elgot reported earlier this month, MPs and peers who have read the documents have not been impressed. Theresa May has been meeting the new Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, in Warsaw. ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, has written a good blog about the sacking of Damian Green on his Facebook page. Earlier this month he reported, on the basis of what he was told by his sources, that Green would survive. In the blog he explains what changed. I understand that at the time, the keeper of the government’s conscience, Sue Gray of the Cabinet Office, had only one example of Green making a misleading press statement about what he knew about the computer porn. And just one inaccurate statement could have been seen as an accident. Green was expected by the prime minister to cling on because this one example of misleading the press could be seen as cock-up not conspiracy. But after I reported that Green was likely to survive, Gray was made aware of a second similar statement - and that established the lethal pattern of Green being systematically economical with the truth. Which sealed his fate. Peston also argues that the departure of Green changes the balance of power in Theresa May’s administration. Whitehall, and in particularly the cabinet secretary, Heywood, have reasserted their authority, having for months looked like affection-starved poodles. Green’s exit also shines a new light on the political troika - the chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, the former chief whip and now defence secretary Gavin Williamson, and the current chief whip Julian Smith - who live and breathe to serve HER. They did not die in a ditch to save Green. In fact their colleagues tell me they actively want to see the back of what they see as the “old men” like Green in the cabinet, so that the government can be remade in their “new Tory generation” image. This is from ITV’s Joe Pike. Last month ICM did some polling for the Guardian to find out what people think of various types of sexual misconduct that MPs have been accused of. We weren’t asking about Damian Green, or any other individuals, and of course Green denies watching pornography on his office computer or propositioning Kate Maltby. But the findings were interesting because they show how seriously people take these matters. Voters are more unforgiving than some people might expect. I wrote the findings up here. And Britain Elects helpfully turned them into a graphic. Theresa May not replace Damian Green as first secretary of state, the BBC reports. Having a first secretary of state is very much optional for a prime minister. As Wikipedia points out, it’s a title that for many years was not used. Margaret Thatcher never had one, and when May first became prime minister she felt about to do without one. There are plenty of other people who can stand in for the prime minister if necessary at PMQs; in the past it used to be a job for the leader of the Commons. Theresa May is not expecting to announce a replacement for Green until after parliament returns in January, a government source said. The prime minister flew out this morning to Warsaw this morning, away from the crisis which forced her to sack her deputy, but has landed in Poland in the midst of another storm. Her visit, with five senior cabinet ministers, comes less than 24 hours after an unprecedented decision by the EU to censure Poland for a “serious breach” of its values. Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Boris Johnson, Gavin Williamson and Greg Clark are all meeting their counterparts in Poland for a trip aimed at wooing the Polish government seen as key allies in post-Brexit trade talks, given their desire to retain close security cooperation. The timing is awkward so soon after the EU decision. Downing Street has said May will raise concerns about potential for political interference in the judiciary by Poland’s hard-line conservative government. In Warsaw, May will announce a new joint UK-Poland treaty on defence and security cooperation, only the second such treaty the UK has signed, after one with France. The governments will also jointly launch UK-funded offensives to combat alleged Russian state-sponsored “disinformation”. Johnson is set to fly on to Moscow after his meetings in Warsaw. Downing Street said the new defence partnership expected to be announced on Thursday would deepen ties that would build on the deployment of British troops to the Polish-Russian border. May will announce £5m of UK funds to build joint capacity to detect and counter the spread of Russian information operations, some of which will fund Belsat, a Polish-funded TV channel for Belarusians. A government source said future trade talks would also be on the agenda when ministers meet their counterparts, with the Polish government also likely to raise the future status of incoming EU migrants. May is first set to meet her Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki at the Belvedere Palace in Warsaw. Williamson and his counterpart are expected to sign the defence treaty mid-morning, followed by a press conference with May and Morawiecki. During her whistle-stop trip, May is also set to meet British troops and Polish world war two veterans. The women’s equality party thinks Damian Green and Michael Fallon should both resign as MPs because of their conduct towards women. In a statement its leader Sophie Walker said: That Damian Green regrets being asked to quit, despite accepting that he breached the ministerial code, shows how many lessons he still has to learn about taking responsibility for his conduct. If he is not suitable to be minister because of his actions then he is not suitable to be an MP. It is bizarre that both he and Michael Fallon, who also resigned from cabinet, think they retain legitimacy to stay on in parliament. That decision should be given to their constituents, with a proper system of recall introduced so that they can decide whether these men should still be representing them. After being accused of sexual misconduct, Fallon resigned as defence secretary saying his behaviour in the past had “fallen below the high standards” expected, although he did not give details. Green denied making sexual advances towards the Tory activist who accused him of propositioning her, although in his resignation letter he admitted he had made her feel “uncomfortable” and apologised. The former Labour MP Andy Sawford is one of various people on Twitter who have been making this point about the downfall of Damian Green. But Sean Kemp, a former Lib Dem spin doctor, points to the obvious flaw in this thesis. I’m hearing that Brexit select committee will today publish the bulk of the “impact assessments” - or whatever the government would like to call them- today. But they are withholding parts of the documents after a committee disagreement. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, a prominent campaigner on behalf of the victims of sexual harassment, told Sky News that she welcomed the decision to sack Damian Green. But she said she thought the inquiry took “longer than it needed to”. And she said she thought that the conclusions of the inquiry meant that Green might avoid being investigated by the new body parliament is setting up in the light of the sexual harassment scandal. She said: The fact that he left for lying, essentially, about pornography on his computer does seem to be the slight get-out to stop potentially the new independent system in parliament that is going to be set up looking into this further. It does seem they are trying to protect him from any future claims of sexual harassment. Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, will be making a statement to MPs about progress in setting up the new complaints process later. Here are the main points from Jeremy Hunt’s Today interview. Hunt, the health secretary, confirmed that Damian Green had been sacked because he “lied”. Asked if Green was “sacked”, Hunt said: “Yes, I think that is clear, sadly from the letters that were exchanged.” And, asked if Green “lied”, Hunt replied: He lied on a particular incident, yes. I think lots of people who understand the context would appreciated why that might have happened. But that doesn’t make it any more acceptable. And I think what this shows is that in our democracy we hold cabinet ministers to the very highest standards of conduct, rightly. But I think we should remember that those are standards that would probably not apply in many other countries. And those standards apply even to cabinet ministers who are the most senior, as he was. Hunt expressed concerns about the behaviour of the police in this episode. He said: I think if you look at what happened, some of the actions, particularly of a retired police officer, don’t sit comfortably in a democracy, and Theresa May made very clear in her letter that she was very uncomfortable with what had happened and that she was pleased that Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, also felt that which is why an investigation is happening. He praised May as “someone of the most extraordinary resilience in very, very challenging circumstances”. He expressed regret about Green’s departure, describing him as “an outstanding public servant who did an extraordinary job in the various ministerial posts that he did”. Tim Shipman, the Sunday Times’s political editor, thinks Hunt did his own career prospects no harm at all with his interview. UPDATE: Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron’s communications chief, was also impressed by the Hunt interview. And here is the summary that Number 10 last night of the cabinet secretary’s report on the allegations against Damian Green (pdf). Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s communications chief when Blair was prime minister, says that if Theresa May wants to sack cabinet ministers who have told lies, other culprits spring to mind ... Here is the full text of Damian Green’s “resignation” letter (pdf). And here is the full text of Theresa May’s reply (pdf). The interview now turns to the NHS, and maternity services. Q: There are more than 100,000 mistakes with maternity services every year. Hunt says mistakes happen. It is important for the NHS to learn from them. Q: Does the NHS need more resources? Hunt says: It is a real mistake to say this is principally about money. He says there have been improvements. One issue is litigation; doctors are worried about being sued. He says the professionals think they can make a massive improvement in maternity safety with the resources they have. Q: Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, asked for £4bn in the budget and did not get it. You probably want more money. Why don’t you ask for more money? Hunt says he is always asked about this. The discussion today is different to the discussion five years ago. Five years ago the budget was frozen. Now the discussion is about how it spends extra money. In the last three years NHS spending has gone up by £8bn. That is because the economy is growing, generating more tax revenue. Q: You once said health was your last big job in politics. Are you sure? There is now a vacancy at the very top. It would suit someone calm, someone like you who voted remain but now backs leave. Hunt says his job is very rewarding. “I’m a health man, full stop,” he says. And that’s it. Q: May has lost the people close to her. Who are her close advisers now? Hunt says leadership is lonely. Despite the most incredible pressure, May has carried on. She has taken big decisions, and made big progress. What is emerging is “someone of the most extraordinary resilience in very, very challenging circumstances”. He says people will be assured that someone like that is there leading the country. Hunt says we need to get to the bottom of the police’s role. Q: People will say this was not the fault of the police. They will say this happened because Green made a sexual advance to a young woman. Shouldn’t Green have been sacked or suspended then? Hunt says a tough prime minister is a fair prime minister. That is why May ordered an inquiry. Q: Was May worried that other allegations would emerge? Hunt says everyone is entitled to due process. Q: In other lines of work someone under suspicion would be suspended. Hunt says Robinson is trying to castigate Green for allegations that have not been proven. Everyone has a right to a fair hearing, he says. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Claire. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is being interview on Today now by Nick Robinson. Robinson says Damian Green was just one of two MPs invited to Theresa May’s 60th birthday party. Q: Can you admit Green was sacked? Hunt says that is correct. He breached the ministerial code. Q: He lied? Hunt says: He lied on a particular incident, yes. Hunt says people will understand the context. But that does not make it acceptable. He says cabinet ministers are held to a high standard. Q: Are you saying it is understanding he lied. Hunt says Green was an outstanding public servant. But people get pushed into a situation where they say things they don’t mean. Q: May did not want him to go. No, says Hunt. He says Green was valued by MPs on all sides of the House. I’m now handing over the live blog to Andrew Sparrow, who’ll bring you Jeremy Hunt’s Today programme interview, more Green fallout and the rest of the day’s politics news. Thanks for reading and for the comments and tweets. And for all those commenters asking when David Davis will be handing in his resignation letter: don’t hold your breath. There has been speculation about whether the Brexit secretary, David Davis, could follow Green out of the door, given his previous threat to quit if his colleague were forced out. However, the threat was caveated carefully: The Brexit secretary let it be known that he would resign in protest were Green to be forced out solely on the basis of allegations by former Met officers, although he accepted that other factors could lead to Green having to quit as first secretary of state. And Davis appears to have let it be known on Wednesday night that he was going nowhere. And here are those two statements made by Green last month that the inquiry judged were “inaccurate and misleading” and breached the ministerial code - as well as Green’s admission yesterday that they were misleading. 4 November The police have never suggested to me that improper material was found on my parliamentary computer, nor did I have a ‘private’ computer, as has been claimed. The allegations about the material and computer, now nine years old, are false, disreputable political smears from a discredited police officer acting in flagrant breach of his duty to keep the details of police investigations confidential, and amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination. 11 November I reiterate that no allegations about the presence of improper material on my parliamentary computers have ever been put to me or to the parliamentary authorities by the police. I can only assume that they are being made now, nine years later, for ulterior motives. 20 December I accept that I should have been clear in my press statements that police lawyers talked to my lawyers in 2008 about the pornography on the computers, and that the police raised it with me in a subsequent phone call in 2013. I apologise that my statements were misleading on this point. For those readers who weren’t awake for the politics live blog’s early start this morning, a reminder of the key findings from the inquiry, issued by the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood. (The bolding is mine.) The investigation has concluded: that Mr Green’s conduct as a minister has generally been both professional and proper; that with competing and contradictory accounts of what were private meetings, it is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the appropriateness of Mr Green’s behaviour with Kate Maltby in 2015, though the investigation found Ms Maltby’s account to be plausible; that Mr Green’s statements of 4 and 11 November, which suggested that he was not aware that indecent material was found on parliamentary computers in his office, were inaccurate and misleading, as the Metropolitan police service had previously informed him of the existence of this material. These statements therefore fall short of the honesty requirement of the Seven Principles of Public Life and constitute breaches of the ministerial code. Mr Green accepts this. It goes on: The cabinet office investigation has not looked into the 2008 police investigation itself. That is a matter for the police, not for the cabinet office; and in any event has no bearing on Mr Green’s ability or conduct as first secretary of state. Mr Green continues to deny that he viewed the pornography found on his parliamentary computers and the investigation reaches no conclusion on this matter. Theresa May is prepared to challenge her Polish counterpart over his government’s controversial interference in the country’s judicial system, Downing Street said, as the prime minister flew to Warsaw on Thursday. Her visit will come in the aftermath of an unprecedented decision by the EU to censure Poland for a “serious breach” of its values, which could ultimately see Warsaw stripped of its voting rights in Brussels. May and senior cabinet ministers face a delicate diplomatic challenge for the visit, which had been intended to underline the UK’s defence and security cooperation with eastern Europe. Ministers see Poland and other eastern European countries as potential key allies in trade talks, given their desire to retain close security cooperation. In Warsaw, May will announce a new joint UK-Poland treaty on defence and security cooperation, only the second such treaty the UK has signed, after one with France. The governments will also jointly launch UK-funded offensives to combat alleged Russian state-sponsored “disinformation”. The UK has remained neutral in the growing rift between Poland’s hardline right-wing government and the European Union, concerned about the image of Brussels’ apparent interference with a country’s domestic affairs. However, May’s spokesman said she would not shirk a difficult conversation with the new Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, but stopped short of saying the UK would vote to censure Poland when potential action against the country is put before EU leaders. In what is presumably a pre-recorded interview for the Radio 4 Today programme, health secretary Jeremy Hunt will apparently have some harsh words for his former cabinet colleague: As noted earlier, we’re not anticipating a reshuffle today, or this year in fact, with Theresa May not expected to conjure up a new first secretary of state/minister for the cabinet office/de facto deputy prime minister until after the parliamentary recess. There is another administrative headache brewing as Green chaired nine cabinet committees, including the sub-committees for: European Union exit and trade (international trade) European Union exit and trade (domestic preparedness, legislation and devolution) European Union exit and trade (European affairs) National security council (threats, hazards, resilience and contingencies) Social reform (home affairs) And the implementation taskforces for: Housing Digital Immigration Employment and skills Some of his other duties have already been doled out to colleagues, according to the Sun’s political editor: Comments are now switched on, should you want to come and chat below the line. It seemed impossible that Theresa May could be rendered a lonelier figure than she has been of late, but with Damian Green now the first secretary of state as was she seems lonelier than ever. Her devoted lieutenants Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill were torn from her nest. Now Green, her anchor in a sea of Brexit, has gone. This was not a ministerial performance issue. That doesn’t happen. If performance and competence were salient these days May’s cabinet meetings would not be quorate. Rather, his fate was sealed by continuing questions about his alleged behaviour and character. And principally his failure to speak candidly about his knowledge of claims that pornography was found on his parliamentary computer – he still denies having downloaded or viewed pornography – and allegations that he made inappropriate advances to the young journalist Kate Maltby, a family friend. May had to part company with him. But without Green, she loses political balance and an ally as she stumbles towards Brexit. What is worse is the extent to which this shabby affair has further corroded our ailing politics. Green, though clearly damaged beyond usefulness or reasonable repair some time ago, was allowed to carry on as though nothing untoward was happening. While officials conducted formal inquiries and former police officers levelled explosive allegations, he was sent to the dispatch box as spokesman for the government. Commercial or even public entities in similar circumstances might have suspended him from normal duties or at least tucked him into shade. Instead May shone a light and said to the world – and his accusers – this is still our champion. With the de facto deputy prime minister gone, this is a reasonable question: No Christmas prizes for guessing what leads the front pages today. We get multiple takes on the ousting of the deputy prime minister, from Metro’s curt “Green out” to City AM’s careful “Theresa May ally Damian Green resigns amid pornography allegations”. The Guardian, the Daily Telegraph and the Sun agree that, despite the niceties exchanged in letters between May and Green, he was indeed sacked. The Times says he was “forced out over computer porn cover-up”, while the Mirror hits harder with: “May axes her deputy over porn lies.” The Daily Mail is a lone lamenting voice, sighing: “What a sad way to go.” The Financial Times has a nod to Green but leads on Bank of England promises of easy access for European banks in London post-Brexit. The i splashes on a report that the UK wants “total secrecy” for trade talks with the US. And the Daily Express says you can beat dementia by eating salad every day. Incidentally, if you’d like a roundup of the newspaper front pages in your inbox each weekday, along with the news headlines, do sign up for the Morning Briefing email. You can do that here: Kate Maltby, whose allegations of harassment prompted the cabinet office inquiry into Green’s behaviour, has not yet commented on his sacking. But her parents, Colin and Victoria Maltby, who were friends with Green, issued a statement on Wednesday night: We are pleased that the cabinet office has concluded its inquiry into the conduct of Damian Green. We are not surprised to find that the inquiry found Mr Green to have been untruthful as a minister, nor that they found our daughter to be a plausible witness. We have received many supportive messages from people near and far who appreciate Kate’s courage and the importance of speaking out about the abuse of authority. We join with them in admiring her fortitude and serenity throughout the length of the investigation and despite the attempted campaign in certain sections of the media to denigrate and intimidate her and other witnesses. We are proud of her. We have ourselves known of these incidents since they first occurred and have fully supported Kate in the responsible manner in which she has reported them. The inquiry said it was “not possible to reach a definitive conclusion” on the allegations of inappropriate behaviour against Green, but said it did find Kate Maltby’s “account to be plausible”. In his letter to Theresa May, Green said: I deeply regret the distress caused to Kate Maltby following her article about me and the reaction to it. I do not recognise the events she described in her article, but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and for this I apologise. May replied: You have expressed your regret for the distress caused to Ms Maltby following her article about you and the reaction to it. I appreciate that you do not recognise the events Ms Maltby described in the article, but you do recognise that you made her feel uncomfortable and it is right that you have apologised. (By “the reaction to it”, it’s likely both were referring to a much-criticised article about Maltby in the Daily Mail, which among other things accused her of being “one very pushy lady” with a “flair for self-promotion”.) However, it is not clear from this exchange whether Green has in fact apologised personally to Maltby, who has not yet commented publicly on his resignation. All the indications are that we shouldn’t expect a reshuffle today, this week or even this year. With May on her way to Poland this morning for a two-day trip, and parliament on its Christmas recess, the next first secretary of state/minister for the cabinet office/de facto deputy prime minister might not materialise until 2018. Which of course allows plenty of time to put together the runners and riders lists: An early start for today’s politics live blog, hot on the heels of the Wednesday night sacking of first secretary of state and key Theresa May ally Damian Green. News that the prime minister had asked her de facto deputy to resign – known in non-political circles as firing him – broke shortly after 8.30pm, just hours after the two had appeared side by side at the final PMQs of the year. (Here’s John Crace’s take on how that May-Corbyn festive showdown shook down.) He was the third cabinet minister to go in the last two months, after the ousting of Michael Fallon on 1 November for harassment, and of Priti Patel a week later for her unofficial meetings with Israeli officials. An inquiry was set up into whether Green had breached the ministerial code after Kate Maltby, a Conservative activist, said he had made inappropriate advances towards her; it was later broadened after claims surfaced that pornography was found on a parliamentary computer in Green’s office during a police raid in 2008. As so often, it seems it wasn’t the original allegations against him that secured Green’s fate but the untruths – or, as the inquiry report puts it, his “inaccurate and misleading” statements – about claims pornography was found on his work computer. In his resignation letter, Green also expressed “regret [for] the distress caused to Kate Maltby”, whose account the inquiry found to be “plausible”, though it did not make a ruling on whether his behaviour had been inappropriate.

The fate of HMAS AE1 had been one of the navy’s most enduring puzzles, sparking 13 different retrieval attempts since 1914, when the vessel vanished without a distress call off the coast of Papua New Guinea during the first world war. According to naval historians, ships could find “no trace” of AE1, not even “the tell-tale shimmer of escaping oil on the water”. But on Thursday the defence minister, Marise Payne, announced the submarine had been found. The 800-tonne vessel was discovered under 300 metres of water near Duke of York Island in Papua New Guinea. A commemorative service was held in memory of the 35 Australian and British crew who died on board, and Payne said the government had entered discussions with the PNG government to establish a lasting commemoration of the site. AE1 was the first Allied submarine lost in the first world war and the first ship lost by the Royal Australian Navy. The submarine, in operation for only seven months, had been sent from Sydney to capture what was then German New Guinea in 1914. On 14 September, a day after Germany surrendered the colony, it disappeared. It was “a tragedy for our then fledgling nation”, Payne said. “This is one of the most significant discoveries in Australia’s naval maritime history.” The chief of navy, Vice Admiral Tim Barrett, added: “We were a young navy at the time.” Payne and navy officials said the cause of the submarine’s loss would now be investigated. Retired rear admiral Peter Briggs, who worked on the search, told the Australian that he believed the cause was most likely “a diving accident”. “The submarine appears to have struck the bottom with sufficient force to dislodge the fin from its footing, forcing it to hinge forward on its leading edge, impacting the casing,” he said. The successful search, which began on Sunday, was funded by the government and the Silentworld Foundation. It was assisted by the Submarine Institute of Australia, the Australian National Maritime Museum, company Fugro Survey, the PNG government and the group Find AE1 – which is led by Briggs. The area in which AE1 disappeared was notoriously difficult to search. In 2014, navy sources described it as “one of the most wreck-strewn areas in the region”. Payne said the government had begun attempts to contact descendants of the crew. “I truly believe this will bring peace of mind to the family and descendants of the crew who lost their lives onboard,” she said. “Perhaps, in time, we may discover what caused the submarine to sink.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/commentisfree/2017/dec/21/now-damian-green-is-out-theresa-may-seems-lonelier-than-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T00:11:23Z","webTitle":"Now Damian Green is out, Theresa May seems lonelier than ever | Hugh Muir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2017/dec/21/now-damian-green-is-out-theresa-may-seems-lonelier-than-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/commentisfree/2017/dec/21/now-damian-green-is-out-theresa-may-seems-lonelier-than-ever","fields":{"headline":"Now Damian Green is out, Theresa May seems lonelier than ever","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It seemed impossible that Theresa May could be rendered a lonelier figure than she has been of late, but with Damian Green now the first secretary of state as was she seems lonelier than ever. Her devoted lieutenants Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill were torn from her nest. Now Green, her anchor in a sea of Brexit, has gone. This was not a ministerial performance issue. That doesn’t happen. If performance and competence were salient these days May’s cabinet meetings would not be quorate. Rather, his fate was sealed by continuing questions about his alleged behaviour and character. And principally his failure to speak candidly about his knowledge of claims that pornography was found on his parliamentary computer – he still denies having downloaded or viewed pornography – and allegations that he made inappropriate advances to the young journalist Kate Maltby, a family friend. May had to part company with him. But without Green, she loses political balance and an ally as she stumbles towards Brexit.

Instead May shone a light and said to the world – and his accusers – this is still our champion. Compounding that offence were backbenchers, who, on little more than knowing him in their own lights to be a good bloke, drew up a protective script and parroted to any news outlet that would listen. They might have been right: he may have been in some measure traduced, but they did not know. They just closed ranks. Reportedly, the Brexit secretary David Davis threatened to resign unless the prime minister gave him the protection to which they felt him entitled. What is that if not the ultimate manifestation of bubble politics? An approach that says I reject all claims as baseless because I know and like him. And what did the reported Davis threat to No 10 say about the authority of a PM who has now mislaid three of her senior ministers since November? Then there was the treatment accorded to Maltby. As the result of what many claim to have been briefings from actors loyal to the former first secretary of state, she found herself trashed in the tabloids and more recently on the web. One does not have to know the full truth of those contested accusations to be nauseated at how power and those who access it protect themselves. One need only set the smears against the Cabinet Office verdict that her account of the encounter seems “plausible”. And maybe the most dispiriting thing is the lack of learning. In the face of scandal, the wagons circle and leaders who would be strong and stable vow to tough it out. It never works. They merely lengthen the trauma for all involved and prolong their own agony. Perhaps, without Brexit in the background, the process would have played out more quickly. The Brexit fog clouds much in public life. Some might say that here it clouded decency.

While neither measure is a plausible course of action, the Greens say it reveals the significance of the gap left by the weak ambition of the government’s plans for the national energy guarantee. This week the government released projections for Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions to 2030. They showed that based on existing policies, far from any cuts being made, the country’s rising greenhouse gas pollution would continue to increase to 2030 and beyond. It revealed Australia needed to find ways to abate 868m tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions between 2021 and 2030. Those projections did not include the cuts that would be achieved if the government’s proposed national energy guarantee was implemented, or savings from vehicle emissions regulations, which have not been agreed to by the government. Australia has committed to reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030 and it is widely accepted the majority of cuts would need to be made in the electricity sector, as it is the easiest and most cost-effective place to make large emissions cuts. But the government has refused to consider emissions cuts in the national electricity market greater than 26%. Independent analysis conducted by the Greens shows that reducing emissions in the electricity sector by that much would still leave at least 583m tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas to be abated by 2030, through the rest of the economy. “The government’s own data shows the cost of caving in to the climate deniers on the backbench,” said Adam Bandt, Greens climate change and energy spokesman. “Because the government’s energy policy is now so coal-focused, it places an impossible burden on agriculture, transport and industry. “At some point the penny will drop with the Nationals and they’ll be livid. By dropping the ball on energy, the government has left agriculture and transport with ridiculously large tasks, like taking every cow out of every farm or taking every car off every road, just to meet our paltry Paris commitments.” Janet Rice, the Greens transport spokeswoman, said: “The Turnbull government’s commitment to reducing transport pollution has been woeful so far. For all his selfies on trains, the PM has taken no meaningful action on public transport, zero-carbon electric vehicles, setting strong vehicle efficiency standards, or unchoking our clogged cities.” Figures released today by the Carbon Markets Institute showed the low-ambition target in the electricity sector would threaten a massive 27 gigawatts of renewable energy projects proposed for development across Australia. Despite those projects being planned, the proposed emissions target in the national energy guarantee would not provide the policy incentive to get the projects built."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/21/thursday-briefing-may-stable-empties-before-christmas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T06:28:33Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: May stable empties before Christmas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/21/thursday-briefing-may-stable-empties-before-christmas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/21/thursday-briefing-may-stable-empties-before-christmas","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: May stable empties before Christmas","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: MP expresses ‘regret’ to Maltby Good morning to you all, Graham Russell here with the penultimate briefing of 2017. Damian Green – the old Oxford friend brought in by Theresa May to help steady the boat after the disastrous general election result – has been sacked by the PM after lying about his knowledge of pornography found on his computer. We will bring you the latest developments in our politics live blog here. In his resignation letter, the first secretary of state accepted he “should have been clear in my press statements” after an inquiry found his previous vociferous denials were “inaccurate and misleading”. In her lengthy written response, the PM reflected on their friendship before tip-toeing to the bit where “I asked you to resign” – a decision made “with deep regret, and enduring gratitude for the contribution you have made over many years”. He is the third cabinet minister to step aside since early November. Green also voiced his regret for the distress caused to Kate Maltby – following her claim that he behaved improperly towards her – but added “I do not recognise the events she described in her article”. “I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and I apologise,” he wrote. The investigation by the cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was unable to reach a definitive conclusion on Maltby’s allegations, finding only that her account of a disputed meeting was “plausible”. Hugh Muir writes that May cuts a lonely figure after the loss of an ally as she stumbles towards Brexit. Wednesday’s political demise was 10 years in the making: if you missed anything here’s a handy timeline. * * * Catalonia votes (again) – Catalans will have their say today in a poll that could determine the course of the bitterly contested issue of independence from Spain. It is broadly a competition between secessionists and unionists, who argue that Catalans are sick of the social unrest and economic uncertainty generated by deposed regional president Carles Puigdemont – who is campaigning from self-imposed exile in Belgium. The polls point to a hung parliament, so coalition talks loom. Here’s a handy Q&amp;A with all you need to know about the election. * * * Jerusalem divides – The US president has threatened to withhold foreign aid from those countries who disagree with his decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Speaking after all UN security council members except the US rejected Donald Trump’s call, the president said: “Let them vote against us. We’ll save a lot. We don’t care.” He added: “We’re not going to be taken advantage of any longer.” Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, has warned she will be “taking names” of countries that vote for a general assembly resolution on Thursday that criticises the US move. * * * The 24-year-old baby – A woman has given birth to a baby who developed from an embryo frozen in 1992, potentially setting a record length between embryo donation and delivery. “If the baby was born when it was supposed to be born, we could have been best friends,” said mother Tina Gibson, 25, from Tennessee. The National Embryo Donation Center, a faith-based organisation that carried out the procedure, encourages people to donate leftover embryos resulting from IVF. * * * Up she rises, eventually – A submarine that vanished 103 years ago with 35 Australian and British crew aboard has been found. The 800-tonne vessel, HMAS AE1, was discovered 300 metres down off Papua New Guinea, ending the Australian navy’s most enduring puzzle. The submarine had been sent from Sydney to capture what was then German New Guinea in 1914 before disappearing. Attention now turns to finding out why it sank and setting up a suitable commemoration site. * * * Billion-dollar brain drain – A pair of hedge funds are fighting to prevent a convicted Chinese analyst from being deported, fearing he will take memorised trading algorithms with him. A judge rejected their highly unusual case on Wednesday but the firms, Corbiere and Trenchant Ltd, are expected to appeal. Ke Xu was convicted in 2015 of stealing confidential intellectual property from his employers and sentenced to four years imprisonment, at the end of which the Home Office intends to remove him from the UK. Xu – nicknamed the billion-dollar brain – was accused of stealing computer codes said to be worth more than £30m. * * * Lunchtime read: Hinkley Point and the ‘dreadful’ deal The estimated total bill to build Hinkley Point C is £20.3bn, more than twice that of the London Olympics, making it – eventually – the most expensive power station in the world. The financing package puts the UK in hock for a generation to a Chinese state-run power company and another majority-owned by the French government. Progress has been glacial since its proposal almost 40 years ago and its controversial design has yet to start functioning anywhere in the world. Some experts believe it could actually prove impossible to build. Holly Watt explores how the UK government arrived at such a bad deal. Sport On a delirious night at Ashton Gate, Bristol City deservedly dispatched Manchester United for the first time since 1978, with a brilliant 93rd-minute winner teeing up a date with Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-finals. In the other quarter-final played last night, Chelsea left it late but Álvaro Morata’s injury-time winner sank Bournemouth. Swansea City are looking for their third manager in less than 12 months after Paul Clement was sacked. In rugby union, Dylan Hartley has rounded on the former Northampton players who criticised the club after a woeful run of form that cost Jim Mallinder his job as director of rugby last week. Matt O’Connor, the Leicester head coach, wants the game’s authorities to be held to account after Manu Tuilagi’s citing for a dangerous tackle was dismissed. Venus Williams will not face any criminal charges in relation to a fatal traffic accident she was involved in near her Florida home in June. And the Australian rugby league player Angus Crichton has had his troublesome middle finger amputated to avoid further injury layoffs and ensure he is ready for the 2018 NRL season. Business Agency workers are collectively underpaid by £400m a year compared with their full-time counterparts, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The pay gap costs temporary admin staff £990 a year on average, it says. Asian share markets were subdued overnight after the euphoria about US tax cuts – which incidentally look set to benefit Donald Trump personally by $15m – wore off and investors fretted about more US rate rises next year. The FTSE100 is expected to rise a fraction this morning, while the pound is buying £1.336 and €1.125. The papers No Christmas prizes for guessing what leads the front pages today.

Watching the power structures in the Labor party is a lot like watching patterns in a kaleidoscope – the dial shifts a couple of degrees and all of sudden you are looking at something else. At its simplest level, what’s happening in the Victorian ALP right now is one of those kaleidoscopic shifts, except it’s not hypnotic, gentle and mildly mesmerising, but brutal and highly disruptive. As one insider characterised the fracas on Thursday: “This is Bill’s brilliant strategy for keeping Malcolm Turnbull in the Lodge.” To understand what’s going on, we need to keep it simple, and we need to begin at the beginning. To maintain balance and harmony between the factions in Victoria there has been a stability pact in place for many years – a deal drawn up by the former Labor right faction powerbroker Steven Conroy with Bill Shorten, and the veteran Kim Carr’s socialist left faction. The Conroy/Shorten/Carr deal mapped out a plan for state and federal preselections up to 2022, and covered agreements on internal party positions. But in politics, even arrangements brokered to keep the peace and share the spoils create losers, and some people felt aggrieved and undervalued by the status quo. So now, a realignment. A breakaway group wants to tear up the old stability pact and replace it with a three-page agreement between centre unity (which is the right) and the industrial left (which includes the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union construction division; the Finance Sector Union; the Rail, Tram and Bus Union; and possibly, the Health and Community Services Union). According to the draft I’ve seen, after a stirring preamble about the proposed alliance being “based on respect for ideas and passions, on policy and solidarity, and on creating strong foundations that allow for a dynamic and diverse organisation” (yes, do try not to laugh) the document gets down to the transactional business. It commits the new group to cooperation in all Victorian Labor party forums, such as its state conference (including elections at the conference), and on internal party committees. It also commits the group to supporting its right and left factions on Labor’s national executive “to ensure state proportional representation is achieved by both groups”. The deal allows the factional blocs to “caucus separately in relation to all state ALP forums and policy” and to confer and share their respective positions on such matters prior to any formal ALP votes. “Nothing in this clause will prevent the CU (Centre Unity) and IL (Industrial Left) from agreeing to a single position on any matters described above.” I realise this is completely eye-glazing to anyone outside the ALP, but inside the Victorian party, the rebellion is explosive. The first point to make is that the new deal freezes out Carr, who has been a staunch supporter of Shorten’s to the point where he was shunned by his own faction at the national level. Other members of the Victorian left are also pointblank refusing to sign up to the rebellion because, to put it politely, they have significant reservations about the people spearheading it. To describe people in the Victorian ALP as agitated and infuriated would be an understatement. But bruised feelings in politics are neither here nor there. It’s a tough business and everyone on the losing side of a transaction has once put someone else to the sword. What matters if you are the leader of the federal Labor party is when internal power balances are sufficiently disturbed to threaten your own position. Turning allies into enemies is a risky roll of the dice, particularly at a time when you have already irritated the New South Wales right by demanding that Sam Dastyari, a significant figure institutionally, pack his bags. Party leaders are also supposed to be above such pettiness. If you are not above it, if you are in fact rolling around in factional muck like you’ve never left young Labor, then people will question your judgment. Leaders (as opposed to backroom kingmakers) face utterly reasonable questions, such as: who are you doing deals with, and why are you doing deals at all? So where does Shorten line up in all of this? Multiple Labor sources from both sides of the factional fence say the federal Labor leader has been supportive of the rebellion, despite the fact that it rips up his own stability pact. He has met the key protagonists, and some insiders say he has been lobbying personally and through proxies to get elements of the Victorian right to sign on. Some contend the Victorian gambit is in part about ensuring a measure of control at the ALP national conference due in July, given that the right, Shorten’s faction, no longer dominates that forum numerically, ending a hegemony which has prevailed since the 1980s – and the right is split in any case. I reported on Wednesday that the Victorian right faction had met to consider the proposed realignment, and deferred a decision about whether to sign on until the new year. Key right-aligned trade unions aren’t convinced the shift is a good idea, and given internal tensions, several small blocs on the right don’t want to sign on unless the entire faction is on board. Several Labor sources have told me a subsequent meeting took place where the Victorian right frontbencher Richard Marles and the Australian Workers’ Union state secretary, Ben Davis, met with representatives of the breakaway left group. The AWU is, of course, part of Shorten’s institutional power base, given he’s a former national secretary of the union. The story goes that during subsequent meeting two rightwingers – a couple of controversial characters, Adem Somyurek, who is positioning to assert himself as the key kingmaker in the Victorian right, and Kimberley Kitching, the Labor senator who is close to Shorten – tried to persuade Marles and Davis to sign up, invoking the leader’s imprimatur. At the time of writing, the document remains unsigned. A number of people within Labor are asserting that Shorten has been integrally involved in the boilover, both personally and through proxies, but others portray his role as more misadventure and foolishness than mastermind. People close to him insist he would never agree to a deal which would upend preselection agreements and declare open season on sitting federal Labor MPs, because to do that would be to invite his own demise. Reason is invoked as the principle reason why this wouldn’t happen but, sadly, we all know reason can be an overrated quality in contemporary political life. In any case, there are concerted efforts under way to hose down the idea of Shorten’s direct involvement in the breakout, and there is a lot of effort going on in both the right and the left to make sure no one signs the document now in circulation.

Sabo, a former US marine who considers leftism a “disorder”, told the Guardian on Wednesday he created the posters that show Streep with a red stripe across her face and the text “She knew”, a reference to accusations that she had knowledge of Weinstein’s alleged sexual abuse of women. Sabo, 49, said he and two collaborators conceived the campaign as retaliation for Streep using her latest Oscar-tipped film, The Post, to bash Trump. “She’s swiping at us so we’re swiping back.” About a dozen posters in the style of the conceptual artist Barbara Kruger sprouted across LA on Tuesday, including near Streep’s house, near the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists’ headquarters and near the studio lot of 20th Century Fox, which made The Post. Sabo has been called an “alt-right” version of Banksy. He says Republicans are the new punks, and makes a living selling inflammatory artwork at conservative events and through his website, plus contract work for the likes of Milo Yiannopoulos. Sabo said he did not know if Streep had in fact enabled Weinstein’s alleged decades of abuse. “I wasn’t sitting in a room with her. I can’t say 100%. But I’d say anyone in the (film) industry had a pretty good idea. I think she knew. Maybe she was providing Weinstein with the fresh meat.” The poster campaign caps a torrid week for Streep who was already on the defensive after fellow actor Rose McGowan, who says she was raped by Weinstein, accused the grand dame of Hollywood of silence and hypocrisy. McGowan made the accusation in a now deleted tweet which was prompted by reports that women will wear black at next month’s Golden Globes awards show in solidarity with victims of sexual misconduct. “Actresses, like Meryl Streep, who happily worked for The Pig Monster, are wearing black @goldenglobes in a silent protest. YOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You’ll accept a fake award breathlessly &amp; affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy.” Streep, who worked on several films produced by Weinstein and once jokingly referred to him as “God”, has denied any knowledge of his alleged rapes, assaults and harassment, allegations which the New York Times and New Yorker made public in October. In a statement, the Oscar winner expressed hurt at being assailed by McGowan. “But I want to let her know I did not know about Weinstein’s crimes, not in the 90s when he attacked her, or through subsequent decades when he proceeded to attack others. I wasn’t deliberately silent. I didn’t know. I don’t tacitly approve of rape. I didn’t know. I don’t like young women being assaulted. I didn’t know this was happening.” Several commentators have defended The Iron Lady star, calling it perverse that women should be faulted for men’s alleged predations. “Women aren’t responsible for men’s bad behavior. We’re not the sex police,” Heidi Stevens wrote in the Chicago Tribune. It is unclear if the attacks on Streep will dent her chances of an Oscar nomination for The Post, in which she plays Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham during the paper’s decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971, a free press milestone. Steven Spielberg, who directed, and Tom Hanks, who plays the Post’s editor, Ben Bradlee, have joined Streep in billing the film as a rebuttal of Trump administration broadsides against media villainy and “fake news”. It was initially unclear who was behind the Streep posters, which went up overnight and were not signed. Sabo said in an interview on Wednesday that he printed and erected the posters with an assistant. The artist, who has previously targeted Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and others on the left, said a fellow conservative collaborator, whom he declined to name, suggested a campaign against The Post because it was being “used as a platform” to attack Trump. “We wanted to take a swipe back.” However they ended up targeting just Streep, who used a Golden Globes speech almost a year ago to excoriate the president as a xenophobic bully. Sabo, who uses a pseudonym derived from a tank munition called sabot, is selling prints of the poster for $25 on his website. Another recent stunt was a billboard mocking Al Franken, the Democratic senator who resigned after groping allegations. The artist said he had no reason to target Trump over his boast, caught on Access Hollywood tape, about assaulting women. “I don’t know a man who I’ve had a beer who doesn’t talk shit like that. We don’t have proof of Trump doing it. Who am I to judge him on that?” Critics consider Sabo’s work crude, bigoted, racist and misogynistic. He disputed that criticism in an interview at his apartment-cum-studio last June: “The blacks, the Jews, the underdogs – no one has a bigger heart for them than me.” He works beneath a sign that says “Fuck Tibet”. Another says “Fuck peace”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/20/cliven-bundy-trial-mistrial-federal-government-land-use","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T20:51:32Z","webTitle":"Cliven Bundy: judge declares mistrial in case against Nevada rancher and family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/cliven-bundy-trial-mistrial-federal-government-land-use","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/cliven-bundy-trial-mistrial-federal-government-land-use","fields":{"headline":"Cliven Bundy: judge declares mistrial in case against Nevada rancher and family","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A judge declared a mistrial in the conspiracy case against rancher Cliven Bundy and his family, dealing a major blow to the US government and another victory for those who have long fought federal regulators over land rights. A Nevada federal judge ruled Wednesday that prosecutors willfully withheld evidence in the case against Bundy and two of his sons, who were facing a slew of felony charges stemming from a 2014 standoff with federal agents at the family’s ranch north of Las Vegas. The mistrial marks the latest in a series failures by the US government to prosecute the ranching family and their supporters, who were found not guilty in a surprise verdict last year surrounding an armed takeover of a national wildlife refuge in Oregon. The Bundys – who were accused of assault, threats against the government, firearms offenses, obstruction and a range of other charges – have become heroes in the American west and in rightwing militia movements after their high-profile protests of federal land regulations. “We’re just happy that the truth is finally coming to light,” said Angie Bundy, wife of Cliven’s son Ryan, who was also on trial. “We’re wanting to go back to our lives.” The mistrial means the government might have another chance to try the family next year, but nonetheless marks a significant defeat for the federal prosecutors, who have aggressively targeted the family and dozens of supporters over the last two years. The Bundys first received international attention in 2014, when the government attempted to seize the family’s cattle after the ranchers refused to pay public land grazing fees for years. That led to an armed standoff between federal agents and the family and hundreds of supporters who flocked to the Bunkerville ranch to defend the ranchers. The government eventually retreated. In early 2016, Cliven’s sons Ryan and Ammon helped lead a similar standoff at the Malheur national wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon to protest the government’s prosecution of local ranchers. After that conflict ended, following law enforcement’s fatal shooting of one of the protest leaders, the federal government arrested the Bundys and their followers across the country, eventually filing conspiracy charges surrounding both the Oregon and Nevada conflicts. After the Bundys were acquitted in Oregon last year, the Nevada case provided a high-stakes second opportunity for the US attorney’s office to convict and imprison the family. But the second trial recently fell apart surrounding prosecutors’ decision to withhold documents that could have bolstered the defense’s case, including records about the conduct of federal agents and the government’s surveillance and use of snipers during the 2014 standoff. The prosecution’s missteps speak to the government’s eagerness to secure a conviction that would strengthen federal control of land, said Bret Whipple, Cliven’s attorney. “It’s a very high priority for the government. They are under so much pressure,” he said in an interview after the decision. “It really comes down to who controls the range and who will have access to it in the future … This is certainly a blow to anybody who believes in federal rights over states’ rights in my opinion.” Claims of federal misconduct have caused problems in both cases against the Bundys. Earlier this year, it was revealed that the FBI had posed as journalists in an effort to extract information from the defendants in the Nevada case. A key Bureau of Land Management agent in the case was also caught up in an unrelated ethics scandal. In Oregon, FBI agents were investigated for allegedly covering up facts about the killing of one of the protest leaders. Environmental groups and others supporting the prosecution have argued that the Bundys and their movement against federal regulations pose major threats to land sustainability and conservation and has emboldened militias and armed threats against the government. In January, the Nevada judge will determine whether the prosecution is allowed to bring another trial. US attorney Steven Myhre said in a statement, “We respect the ruling of the court and take very seriously our discovery obligations.” A US Department of Justice spokesperson also said that attorney general Jeff Sessions had directed an expert to “be deployed to examine the case and advise as to next steps”. Aaron Weiss of the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group that has opposed the Bundys, said the mistrial was only a setback: “We still fully expect Cliven and the rest of the Bundy family to be held accountable.” Ryan and Ammon were recently released from jail after nearly two years behind bars and have been living under house arrest. “It’s been the best thing in the world to have him home,” said Angie, adding that she hopes there will be no further trials. “I don’t know what kind of case they have to come against us.” Cliven chose not to leave jail on house arrest, arguing that he is innocent and should not have to be monitored in any form, said Whipple, who said he was seeking to now get him released without any conditions. “I’m trying to get him out for Christmas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/20/trump-tax-bill-savings-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T01:12:58Z","webTitle":"Trump will personally save up to $15m under tax bill, analysis finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/trump-tax-bill-savings-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/trump-tax-bill-savings-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Trump will personally save up to $15m under tax bill, analysis finds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump and six members of his inner circle will be big winners of the Republicans’ vast tax overhaul, with the president personally benefiting from a tax cut of up to $15m a year, research shows. The US president chalked up his first big legislative win on Wednesday with the $1.5tn bill, the most sweeping revamp of the tax code in three decades, slashing taxes for corporations and the wealthy and dealing the heaviest blow yet to Obamacare. But analysis by a leading Washington thinktank, the Center for American Progress (CAP), finds that changes to business rules will save Trump roughly $11m to $15m per year, while an amendment to the estate tax – the tax on the transfer of an estate of a deceased person – would potentially save his heirs $4.5m. Under current law, the first $11.2m of a couple’s estate’s value is excluded from taxation, and any amount above this is taxed at a 40% rate. The new bill doubles the exemption to $22.4m. Along with Trump himself, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary; Linda McMahon, administrator of the Small Business Administration; Betsy DeVos, the education secretary; Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary; and Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, will benefit to the tune of $4.5m from changes to the estate tax, according to the CAP. More than 90% of businesses in the US are “pass-through businesses”, meaning their income passes through to the owners’ individual tax returns, where it is taxed at ordinary income tax rates, instead of being filed on a separate business return like a corporation. The sweeping tax bill cuts the top rate on “qualified” pass-through business income from 39.6% under current law to 29.6%. Assuming the full benefit of this, the CAP roughly estimates a tax cut of $11m to $15m for Trump (based on an estimate of $150m of passthrough income from reviewing his financial disclosure, and the $109m in real estate/pass-through income on his 2005 tax return); $5m to $12m for Jared Kushner, White House senior adviser and Trump’s son-in-law; and $2.7m for Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. The bill that passed the Senate had a “guardrail” that prevented businesses with too few employees from claiming the full benefit of the deduction, the CAP noted. But at the last minute, a special exception was added that is especially beneficial to real estate firms. In addition, the biggest element of the tax bill benefitting the wealthy is the corporate tax cut. Again, members of Trump’s cabinet have substantial corporate stock holdings and will be among the winners. The CAP did not try to estimate this because it is hard to quantify the tax cut for any one corporation. Jubilant Republicans took a victory lap at the White House on Wednesday to mark what they called a historic day. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, praised Trump for “exquisite presidential leadership”. But in coming months and years, analyses such as the CAP’s could come back to haunt them. Seth Hanlon, a senior fellow at the thinktank, said: “I think that the American people, whether they receive a tax increase or tax cut from this bill, are outraged that President Trump, his cabinet, and members of Congress stand to receive big payouts from this tax bill. The extent of the self-dealing became especially apparent when a last-minute provision benefitting the real estate industry was inserted at the last minute.” Hanlon added: “Trump, of course, promised to release his tax returns, like every president since the 1970s, but has brazenly gone back on his word. Congress has the full power to obtain and release Trump’s tax returns, but the Republican majority has buried its head in the sand. “Still, there is no doubt that Trump is getting major new tax cuts from this bill – at the same time as it preserves special loopholes, like the deductions Trump reportedly takes on his golf courses. These are just one illustration of the venality and corruption behind this bill.” Despite White House promises that the tax overhaul would focus on the middle class, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a thinktank in Washington, estimates that middle-income households will see an average tax cut of $900 next year under the bill, while the wealthiest 1% will enjoy an average cut of $51,000. TJ Helmstetter, communications director of Americans For Tax Fairness, said: “This is not tax reform, it’s a money grab by the ultra-wealthy, including the multimillionaires in Congress and Trump’s own cabinet, who will benefit. When all is said and done, over 80% of the tax cuts will wind up in the pockets of the top 1%. Meanwhile, all of this will be paid for by the middle class and families who are struggling to get by.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/21/government-passes-bill-allowing-mps-push-back-brexit-date","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T00:21:01Z","webTitle":"Government backs down on Brexit date as bill clears key hurdle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/21/government-passes-bill-allowing-mps-push-back-brexit-date","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/21/government-passes-bill-allowing-mps-push-back-brexit-date","fields":{"headline":"Government backs down on Brexit date as bill clears key hurdle","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government has accepted a compromise over its plans to put the Brexit date into law as Theresa May’s flagship piece of legislation cleared a key hurdle in the House of Commons. After eight gruelling days of debate spread over several weeks, and an embarrassing defeat over the issue of a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal, MPs rejected a series of other amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, allowing it to pass on to its next stage. The widely-expected climbdown by the government was confirmed on Wednesday morning when Brexit minister Steve Baker put his name to a compromise drawn up by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin. Letwin’s amendment tweaked the government’s own amendment, leaving the Brexit date (29 March, 2019) in the legislation, but giving MPs the power to push it back if the EU27 agree. Paul Blomfield, of Labour’s shadow Brexit team, said: “After a humiliating defeat in the Commons last week, the government has now been forced into an embarrassing climbdown by amending it’s own amendment. Theresa May would be well advised to use the Christmas break to reflect on her chaotic approach to Brexit and stop putting party politics above the national interest.” The withdrawal bill is aimed at bringing EU law onto the UK statute book in preparation for Brexit, allowing ministers so-called Henry VIII powers to tweak it where necessary. During eight hours of sometimes fractious debate in the House of Commons, MPs clashed repeatedly about Britain’s future relationship with the European Union. The Commons passed both the amendment fixing the date of Brexit, and the change allowing MPs to amend this if needed. Shortly after 10.30pm the last of the amendments to be voted on was soundly defeated - a Liberal Democrat amendment requiring a second referendum on a deal attracted just 23 votes, with 319 against. With that the marathon committee stage of the bill’s progress through the Commons was finally completed. It will go into the next part, the report stage, in the new year. Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie sparked a rebellion among Labour backbenchers with an amendment he claimed would allow the UK to keep open the option of remaining in the customs union. Frontbenchers were privately infuriated by the amendment, which they called “defective”, blaming Leslie and his backers for airing the divisions in his party. A briefing note sent to Labour MPs ahead of the debate and seen by the Guardian said, “this amendment would not keep the UK in a customs union with the EU”; adding that it is “not possible to “unilaterally” remain in the customs union - or create a new customs union. This “can only ever be part of negotiations”. Leslie and his supporters, who include a well-organised caucus of senior MPs, such as Chuka Umunna and Heidi Alexander, are keen to maintain pressure on Labour’s frontbench to adopt a clearer position on continued customs union and single market membership. “We must be absolutely crystal clear about this: ditching the most efficient tariff-free, frictionless, free-trade area in the world is what we are on the brink of doing for something that will inevitably – inevitably – be inferior,” he said. In the end, Leslie’s amendment was easily defeated by 320 votes to 114. However, this saw 62 Labour MPs defy their party and vote with it, the biggest Labour rebellion of the bill’s passage. Earlier, May faced a tough quizzing over her Brexit plans from the Commons liaison committee, made up of the senior MPs who chair select committees. The prime minister was challenged over the precise means by which MPs will get to vote on a final Brexit deal. She dealt bullishly with the SNP MP Angus MacNeil, who asked if she had been obliged to “beg” the EU for a transition deal because she wasted time with June’s general election. “I haven’t begged the European Union for two more years,” she said. “This is not two more years to negotiate with the EU. This is two years when practically both businesses and governments will be able to put in place the changes necessary to move from the current relationship to the future partnership we will have.” She also insisted negotiations on a new trade arrangement with the EU could be completed before Brexit takes place in 2019, primarily because the UK was starting from a basis of already close links. “As you will know full well, we can’t legally sign the new trade agreement with the European Union until we’re a third country, until we’re out of the European Union – 29 March 2019 – but I believe we can negotiate that arrangement in that time,” she said. May’s upbeat assessment of the prospects for the negotiations came as the EU27’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned that the transition deal after Britain leaves the EU would have to end by 31 December 2020. Outlining plans for the next phase of Brexit talks, Barnier, who is negotiating Brexit on behalf of the other 27 member states, said it would be logical for the transition to end then because that was the last day of the EU’s current seven-year budget. “The transition period is useful and it will enable the public administration in Britain to get prepared for the challenges they have to face,” Barnier told reporters in Brussels. Theresa May has called for a two-year transition and agreed that the UK will continue to make annual payments into the EU budget until 2021. Barnier confirmed that during the transition the UK would have to apply all EU laws, including new ones agreed after 2019, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. Under the EU’s take-it-or-leave-it offer on transition, the UK would be subject to the enforcement powers of the European commission, EU agencies and the European court of justice. The EU withdrawal bill will next have to come back to the House of Commons for its report stage, where MPs will consider more amendments – before passing to the House of Lords."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/20/police-made-appalling-errors-in-using-internet-data-to-target-suspects","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T18:59:59Z","webTitle":"Police made 'appalling' errors in using internet data to target suspects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/police-made-appalling-errors-in-using-internet-data-to-target-suspects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/police-made-appalling-errors-in-using-internet-data-to-target-suspects","fields":{"headline":"Police made 'appalling' errors in using internet data to target suspects","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police have made serious errors getting search warrants for suspected sex offenders, leading to the targeting of innocent people and children being wrongly separated from their parents, an official report has revealed. The errors – highlighted by the interception of communications commissioner, Sir Stanley Burnton, in his annual report to the prime minister – had “appalling” consequences and related to some of the most intrusive powers the state can use against its citizens. In one example, two children were separated from their parents for a weekend while the parents were questioned as suspects in a child sexual exploitation case. It later emerged that police had raided the wrong address due to an error on the documentation and the parents were innocent. Digital devices belonging to innocent people were also forensically examined by police, Burnton said. The errors identified were mainly because details were wrongly entered into software that helps police work out the location where a specific IP (internet protocol) address has been used. But IP addresses are routinely reassigned by internet providers. Burnton warned investigators not to rely on them when trying to work out who is hiding behind the anonymity of the internet to commit crimes. He wrote: “These [errors] are far more common than is acceptable, especially in cases relating to child sex exploitation. The impact on some victims of these errors has been appalling.” Burnton said there were 29 serious errors by those entitled to use intrusive powers – not just police – making up 0.004% of the total number of applications. “The impact of these errors has, in some cases, been enormous. People have been arrested for crimes relating to child sexual exploitation. Their children have been taken into care, and they have had to tell their employers.” Innocent people were treated as suspects and detained or had their homes and devices searched on seven occasions. In other cases, two innocent people were arrested and interviewed under caution by officers investigating child sexual exploitation due to similar IP address errors. An investigation into a paedophile ring saw the wrong person detained and interviewed after communications data was wrongly interpreted. In one murder investigation, officers obtained a telephone number, but recorded it incorrectly in a database and contacted the wrong person."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-theresa-may-year-still-there-still-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T19:31:41Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Theresa May’s year: still there, still wrong | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-theresa-may-year-still-there-still-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/commentisfree/2017/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-theresa-may-year-still-there-still-wrong","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Theresa May’s year: still there, still wrong","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May is still prime minister as parliament breaks for Christmas. Back in June, when she lost the Conservatives’ majority in a wholly unnecessary election, she would probably have bitten off the hand of anyone who offered that to her. Since June, each week has been a survival exercise. Dangers have loomed – the DUP deal, the Queen’s speech, party conference. But she has survived. In an otherwise traumatic year, that probably counts as a success. She has survived, above all, because of two reasons. First, there is no alternative candidate around whom the Tory party can coalesce. Most of those whose interest in her job is little disguised have had difficult 2017s of their own: Philip Hammond, Boris Johnson and David Davis among them. As a result, the Tory grassroots has flirted with the idea of Jacob Rees-Mogg as leader, an outcome that could destroy the Tory party for a decade. A more plausible outsider, Ruth Davidson, waits wisely in Edinburgh for now. If Mrs May marks her own survival with a 2018 cabinet reshuffle, her party may become more febrile, as she knows best of all. The second reason is that most of those who matter think Mrs May is the least worst person to be in charge of Brexit. Mrs May won the Tory leadership because she was supposedly a safe pair of hands and because she straddled the party’s divisions over Brexit. The latter remains true. Any successor would struggle to hold things together better. Most would crash the car early on, bringing Jeremy Corbyn closer to Downing Street. Mrs May is sufficient of a Brexit realist to persuade Tory remainers to stick with her for want of worse and sufficient of a Brexit fantasist to keep the leavers mostly in line. Brussels prefers her to the alternatives. Yet the May premiership remains a high-wire balancing act, above all on Brexit. Wednesday, the Commons’ last full day until January, was full of evidence of the essentially fantastic nature of her policy. Appearing before the Commons liaison committee, the prime minister repeated her intention to seek a sector-by-sector free trade deal with the EU, in flat contradiction of the EU’s unchanging insistence that cherry-picking is not on offer. She also repeated her pledge that there will be no hard border in Ireland even though the UK intends to leave the customs union. This too is impossible within the EU guidelines published on Wednesday. Mrs May can go on making these wishful claims, and doubtless will. That does not make them one jot more likely or more attainable. Saying a thing is so does not make it so, no matter how often you repeat it. The UK’s position, laid down by Mrs May without sufficient thought or consultation when she became prime minister, is that Britain is leaving the EU, exiting the single market and customs union, will not permit free movement, refuses to make a substantial financial contribution, seeks regulatory autonomy, will not accept European jurisdiction and will pursue an independent trade policy. That is incompatible with anything the EU is offering or likely to offer. Michel Barnier repeated on Wednesday what British ministers continue to ignore, that a sector-by-sector access deal after Brexit is not on offer, not least for the financial sector. The most the EU will agree to is a free trade deal along Canadian lines. That will mean an end to the pretence that Nissan will go on assembling cars for the EU market in Sunderland. It will mean that major UK companies could relocate to the EU. And it will mean that there will be a hard border in Ireland. Not may be. Will be. All this will be the battleground of British politics in 2018. If these baleful outcomes are to be avoided, something big must change. In the short term that must mean the Brexit policy. When push came to shove in phase one of the talks, Mrs May compromised. The same must happen in phase two. But Mrs May will have to be a bolder leader than she has been so far. As a dire year for Britain ends, there is little sign of that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/20/donald-trump-threat-cut-aid-un-jerusalem-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T09:26:28Z","webTitle":"Trump threatens to cut aid to countries over UN Jerusalem vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/donald-trump-threat-cut-aid-un-jerusalem-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/donald-trump-threat-cut-aid-un-jerusalem-vote","fields":{"headline":"Trump threatens to cut aid to countries over UN Jerusalem vote","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump has threatened to withhold “billions” of dollars of US aid from countries which vote in favour of a United Nations resolution rejecting the US president’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. His comments came after the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, wrote to about 180 of 193 member states warning that she will be “taking names” of countries that vote for a general assembly resolution on Thursday critical of the announcement which overturned decades of US foreign policy. Speaking at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump amplified Haley’s threat. “Let them vote against us,” he said. “We’ll save a lot. We don’t care. But this isn’t like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. “We’re not going to be taken advantage of any longer.” The warning appeared aimed largely at UN members in Africa, Asia and Latin America who are regarded as more vulnerable to US pressure. Egypt, which drafted Monday’s UN security council resolution which the US vetoed, is particularly vulnerable, receiving $1.2bn in US aid last year. But Trump’s comments may also resonate elsewhere – including in the UK, which is hoping to negotiate a quick post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. The emergency UN general assembly meeting was called for Thursday to protest against the US veto at Monday’s security council meeting on a resolution to the Jerusalem issue – which was supported by all other 14 members. The security council resolution demanded that all countries comply with pre-existing UN security council resolutions on Jerusalem, dating back to 1967, including requirements that the city’s final status be decided in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Key US allies Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Ukraine were among the 14 countries in the 15-member council that voted in favour on Monday, and were expected to do the same at the assembly on Thursday. Diplomats expect strong support for the resolution, which is non-binding, despite the US pressure to either abstain or vote against it. However, a council diplomat said Canada, Hungary and the Czech Republic might bow to US pressure and not support the draft resolution. Critics point out the the Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem – as well as the US veto – are both in opposition to numerous security council resolutions. Trump’s extraordinary intervention marked the latest escalation of diplomatic tensions over a decision that has seen the US widely criticised and isolated. It came after a day of high drama. In a letter to UN ambassadors, Haley told countries – including European delegations – that she will report back to the US president with the names of those who support a draft resolution rejecting the US move at the UN general assembly on Thursday, adding that Trump took the issue personally. The new draft resolution for Thursday’s general assembly is very similar to Monday’s defeated security council resolution. Unlike the security council, however, where permanent members can wield a veto, there are no veto rights in the general assembly. The resolution reaffirms 10 security council resolutions on Jerusalem, dating back to 1967, including requirements that the city’s final status must be decided in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. It “affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the holy city of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded”. The draft resolution “demands that all states comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the holy city of Jerusalem, and not to recognize any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions”. Referring to Haley’s letter, which was disclosed by the Guardian and other media organisations on Wednesday morning, Trump said: “I like the message that Nikki sent yesterday at the United Nations. “Our great citizens who love this country are tired of this country being taken advantage of – we’re not going to be taken advantage of any longer.” In her letter, Haley wrote: “As you consider your vote, I encourage you to know the president and the US take this vote personally. “The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those who voted against us,” she continued. Haley followed the letter by tweeting: “At the UN we’re always asked to do more &amp; give more. So, when we make a decision, at the will of the American ppl, abt where to locate OUR embassy, we don’t expect those we’ve helped to target us. On Thurs there’ll be a vote criticizing our choice. The US will be taking names.” Responding to the US threats, the Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, and the foreign minister of Turkey – a co-sponsor of the UN vote – Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu told reporters at Istanbul’s Atatürk airport that they believed UN member countries will ignore “pressure” from Haley. “No honourable state would bow to such pressure,” Çavuşoğlu said. “The world has changed. The belief that ‘I am strong therefore I am right’ has changed. The world today is revolting against injustices.” A senior diplomat from a Muslim country said of Haley’s letter: “States resort to such blatant bullying only when they know they do not have a moral or legal argument to convince others.” A senior western diplomat, described it as “poor tactics” at the United Nations “but pretty good for Haley 2020 or Haley 2024”, referring to speculation that Haley might run for higher office. “She’s not going to win any votes in the general assembly or the security council, but she is going to win some votes in the US population,” the western diplomat said. A senior European diplomat agreed Haley was unlikely to sway many UN states. “We are missing some leadership here from the US and this type of letter is definitely not helping to establish US leadership in the Middle East peace process,” the diplomat said. The tabling of the resolution followed a weekend of negotiations aimed at securing the widest consensus possible on the issue. The vote has underlined once again the widespread international opposition to the US move, even among some of its closest allies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/21/weak-energy-target-threatens-27gw-of-renewable-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T23:03:02Z","webTitle":"Weak energy target threatens 27GW of renewable projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/weak-energy-target-threatens-27gw-of-renewable-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/weak-energy-target-threatens-27gw-of-renewable-projects","fields":{"headline":"Weak energy target threatens 27GW of renewable projects","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Weak targets suggested for the proposed national energy guarantee will threaten a massive 27 gigawatts of renewable energy projects proposed for development across Australia. Were they to go ahead, these projects would produce as much capacity as 17 Hazelwood power stations and mean half of Australia’s electricity was supplied by renewables. But many are likely to never get the finance they need, since the government’s 2020 renewable energy target is already set to be exceeded by projects now under construction, according to the latest renewable energy index produced by Green Energy Markets and funded by GetUp. The government’s target is for 33,000GWh to be produced by large-scale renewables by 2020 but wind, solar and bio-energy projects already under construction are likely to produce almost 40,000GWh of electricity by then. The further 27GW of large-scale renewable projects proposed, combined with the expected growth in rooftop solar, would mean just over half of Australia’s electricity supply could be met with renewables by 2030. “Most of these projects will remain dormant until the government puts its long-term Paris agreement commitments into a legally enforceable policy,” the report, authored by Tristan Edis from Green Energy Markets, concludes. The proposed emissions target in the national energy guarantee – a mere 26% cut in emissions from the national electricity market below 2005 levels by 2030 – would not provide the policy incentive to get the projects built. It is estimated they would deliver 13,443 jobs during construction, were they to go ahead. “There’s going to be another investment drought in renewables unless we get better targets than those proposed under Malcolm Turnbull’s NEG,” said Miriam Lyons, energy campaign director at GetUp. “These are projects that are already under development, that could be sabotaged by our own government’s lack of vision.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/20/damian-green-resigns-as-first-secretary-of-state-after-porn-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T09:20:53Z","webTitle":"Damian Green sacked as first secretary of state after porn allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/20/damian-green-resigns-as-first-secretary-of-state-after-porn-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/20/damian-green-resigns-as-first-secretary-of-state-after-porn-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Damian Green sacked as first secretary of state after porn allegations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Damian Green has been sacked as first secretary of state after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. An investigation by the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, found that Green’s vehement denials after a Sunday newspaper reported that porn had been found on his computer were “inaccurate and misleading”. His departure is a personal blow for Theresa May, who brought him into Downing Street after her majority was wiped out in June’s general election to help shore up her authority. He is the third cabinet minister to step aside since early November, following the departures of Michael Fallon and Priti Patel. In a letter responding to his resignation, the prime minister said she was “extremely sad” about losing Green from government. May said it was “with deep regret and enduring gratitude for the contribution you have made over many years that I asked you to resign from the government and have accepted your resignation”. In his resignation letter, Green continued to maintain that he did not “download or view” the pornography, but added that he “should have been clear in my press statements”, that his lawyers were informed about its presence in 2008 – and that he discussed it with the police in 2013. Heywood found Green had twice breached the ministerial code, because his misleading comments had fallen short of the “seven principles of public life”, one of which is honesty. He was unable to reach a definitive conclusion on separate allegations, made by the Tory activist Kate Maltby, that Green had behaved improperly towards her. The cabinet secretary’s report found that Maltby’s account of a disputed meeting was “plausible”, but “with competing and contradictory accounts of what were private meetings, it is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion”. In his letter, Green said: “I deeply regret the distress caused to Kate Maltby following her article and the reaction to it. I do not recognise the events she described in her article, but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and I apologise.” Maltby did not comment publicly on Wednesday evening, but her parents, Colin and Victoria Maltby, released a statement: “We are pleased that the Cabinet Office has concluded its inquiry into the conduct of Damian Green. We are not surprised to find that the inquiry found Mr Green to have been untruthful as a minister, nor that they found our daughter to be a plausible witness. “We have received many supportive messages from people near and far who appreciate Kate’s courage and the importance of speaking out about the abuse of authority. We join with them in admiring her fortitude and serenity throughout the length of the investigation and despite the attempted campaign in certain sections of the media to denigrate and intimidate her and other witnesses. We are proud of her.” In her letter to Green, May welcomed the fact that he had apologised to Maltby. Speaking on Thursday morning, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, acknowledged that Green had been sacked for lying, adding: “I think lots of people who understand the context would appreciate why that might have happened. But that doesn’t make it any more acceptable.” He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the episode showed that cabinet ministers were held to the “very highest standard of conduct”. But, he said: “I think we should probably remember that those are standards that would probably not apply in other countries.” Labour’s Jess Phillips told the same programme the decision had taken too long and that the allegations made by Maltby were still hanging over Green. “The investigation said that Kate Maltby was credible and plausible and what they found that they couldn’t prove was the sexual harassment charge. “However, I’m not convinced by that. I’ve seen all of the evidence that’s in the public domain: text messages between Damian Green and Kate Maltby, text messages between Kate Maltby and her friends at the time, saying how uncomfortable she’d felt, whether she felt she had to report it.” She said that, although it was not officially acknowledged, she believed those allegations had contributed to May’s decision to sack Green. The prime minister also used her letter to criticise the conduct of police officers who carried out the raid on Green’s parliamentary office in 2008, when the pornography was discovered, and revealed aspects of the case to the media in recent weeks. “I shared the concerns raised from across the political spectrum when your parliamentary office was raided in 2008 when you were a shadow minister holding the Labour government to account,” she said. Green’s office was raided as police investigated a series of leaks from inside the Home Office. The allegations about porn being found on his computer were the latest chapter in a long-running feud between Green and Bob Quick, the former assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, who oversaw the raid almost a decade ago. Following a Sunday Times report last month claiming there was “extreme” pornography on his parliamentary computer, which quoted Quick, Green issued a hard-hitting late night statement branding him “a tainted and untrustworthy source” who had been trying for some time to cause him political damage. He dismissed the porn allegations as “false, disreputable political smears from a discredited police officer acting in flagrant breach of his duty” and “little more than an unscrupulous character assassination”. Quick subsequently threatened to sue Green for libel. May was handed Heywood’s report on Monday, and subsequently sought a second opinion from Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests. A summary of the investigation, released by No 10 on Wednesday night, said: “Mr Green’s statements of 4 and 11 November, which suggested that he was not aware that indecent material was found on parliamentary computers in his office, were inaccurate and misleading, as the Metropolitan police service had previously informed him of the existence of this material.” As first secretary of state, Green effectively acted as deputy prime minister, standing in for May at prime minister’s questions and sitting alongside her on the frontbench in the Commons. Green was a friend of May’s from when the pair were at Oxford University together, and one of a handful of older ministers she brought back into government when she arrived in Downing Street in July last year and dispatched many of David Cameron’s allies to the backbenches. May flies to Poland at the start of a two-day foreign trip on Thursday, and is not expected to appoint a replacement for Green until parliament returns from its Christmas recess in the new year. She is then expected to carry out a wider reshuffle, bringing some of the new generation of Conservative MPs into the cabinet in order to refresh the government. The allegations about Green emerged as women began to share their experiences of sexual misconduct in political life after the revelations of inappropriate behaviour by media mogul Harvey Weinstein. Fallon stepped down as defence secretary after admitting he had not met the standards required of the armed forces of which he was in charge, after the journalist Jane Merrick said he had lunged at her after a lunch. Several other investigations are continuing, including that into trade minister Mark Garnier, who admitted asking an assistant to buy sex toys. Green has continued to carry out his ministerial duties since the investigation was announced, and colleagues – including the Brexit secretary, David Davis – supported him in the face of the allegations made by the police officers. A retired Met detective, Neil Lewis, went public with claims that “thousands” of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found. Following Lewis and Quick’s interventions, Cressida Dick, the Met’s commissioner, said former officers who spoke out about investigations could face prosecution. Labour said it was right that May had “finally been forced to sack” Green. A spokesperson said: “The public deserve the highest standards from ministers, which begs questions around the prime minister’s judgment and why she delayed this decision for so long. To lose her number two in government in such a way, and so soon after two other ministers, leaves her further weakened.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/21/guardian-observer-charity-appeal-passes-750000-in-a-fortnight","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"Guardian and Observer charity appeal passes £750,000 in a fortnight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/21/guardian-observer-charity-appeal-passes-750000-in-a-fortnight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/21/guardian-observer-charity-appeal-passes-750000-in-a-fortnight","fields":{"headline":"Guardian and Observer charity appeal passes £750,000 in a fortnight","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Guardian and Observer charity appeal in support of young homeless people and destitute asylum seekers has burst past the £750,000 mark, less than a fortnight after its launch. The success of the appeal comes on the back of an ongoing series of special reports highlighting the work of our three appeal charities and their volunteers in helping to change the lives of vulnerable people who find themselves without anywhere secure to live. This year’s appeal, which runs throughout the festive period, is raising money for Centrepoint, Depaul UK and the No Accommodation Network (Naccom), all of whom deliver and support work on the frontline of homelessness and destitution in the UK. “The incredible generosity of Guardian and Observer readers is commendable,” said Depaul UK interim chief executive Ian Brady: “We cannot thank them enough for passing this amazing milestone which will make a major difference to homeless young people.” Centrepoint chief executive Seyi Obakin, praised readers’ overwhelming support. “It has been hugely heartening to see how people have refused to stand by as the cold winter closes around those homeless young people in dire need of help.” Hazel Williams, national director of Naccom, said: “The response to this year’s appeal has been incredible, and is coming at a time when funding is desperately needed for homelessness services like those in our network. “Our members are rooted in local communities, often run by volunteers, and because of the nature of their work, the vast majority aren’t eligible for government funding. It can be a real uphill struggle to keep afloat and ensure this essential lifeline is offered to those in urgent need.” Launching the appeal a fortnight ago, the Guardian and Observer editor in chief, Katharine Viner, said the campaign was a response to the “increasingly visible and distressing” rise in homelessness and destitution in recent years. The issue of homelessness rose to the top of the news agenda again this week after a cross-party committee of MPs described homelessness as a national crisis and said the current government’s approach to tackling the problems had been “an abject failure”. Highlights of the Guardian and Observer series include columnist Sali Hughes’account of her own experience of homelessness when she was younger, reports by Simon Hattenstone and Helen Pidd on the work of Depaul UK’s Nightstop network volunteers, and a Guardian short film on homeless youngsters. Last week the appeal was boosted by the annual charity telethon, during which Guardian and Observer journalists took a record £53,000 in donations from readers over the phones. Centrepoint and Depaul run services aimed at providing shelter and support to homeless 16-25 year olds. Naccom represents a network of more than 40 local charities and projects which specialise in housing destitute asylum seekers, refugees and migrants who have no recourse to public funds. Naccom will use its share of the Guardian and Observer appeal donations to capacity-build the network and support frontline projects via a selective grants process that will be open to its full members. The 2016 Guardian and Observer charity appeal raised £1.7m for three refugee charities.

The swarm of sexual misconduct allegations continues to unleash aftershocks that will reverberate through the Oscars. Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and other once-revered figures are banished from award contention while films centered on women are tipped to prosper. The question is whether the jolts will effect lasting change in an industry still dominated by men and driven by money. Hollywood scandals, after all, have come and gone for over a century. “Boss’s sexual harassment a lot more cautious lately,” said a recent headline on the satirical website the Onion. But interviews with industry figures, including actors, writers, producers and analysts, yield a surprisingly hopeful belief that the tremors will indeed alter the way Hollywood works – and, eventually, the type of stories it tells. “It’s been the most remarkable year. There’s never been a period in history like this,” said Lorien Hayes, who wrote the 2016 documentary An Open Secret, about child abuse in Hollywood. “Things are on the right track. Just the fact that people aren’t afraid to tell the truth is such a marvellous progression.” Simon Hatt, a producer of big-budget blockbusters, agreed. “People just aren’t going to tolerate the way things were done in the past. So I can feel a lot of hope.” He added a caveat. “We’re not just going to wake up in 2018 and say: ‘Awesome, it’s all better now.’ It’ll be constant work. Abuses will still happen. But from the look of things, people have the courage to speak up, because the community is listening.” Alyssa Milano, the actor and activist whose tweet popularised the #MeToo movement, thinks storytelling will become more inclusive. “Roles for women will be different, the way women are portrayed in media will be different,” she told the Guardian last month. “I hope women will have the opportunity to be film-makers, producers and writers. By the very nature of that, the industry will shift.” Hannah Chequer-Queiroz, a production assistant, said the scandals had increased scrutiny of the way women were depicted on screen, such as the Amazons’ skimpy costumes in Justice League. “I feel like everything is more tactful moving forward for both film and television.” The industry, already chastened by previous controversy over gender pay inequality and the #OscarsSoWhite movement, is trying to formalise new norms. Leading industry figures and institutions have established a Commission on Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace, to be chaired by Anita Hill. “The commission will not seek just one solution, but a comprehensive strategy to address the complex and interrelated causes of the problems of parity and power,” the Star Wars producer Kathleen Kennedy, who got the commission rolling, said in a statement. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, has issued a new code of conduct to its 8,000 members. “There is no place in the Academy for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognized standards of decency,” Dawn Hudson, its CEO, said in a statement. Sceptics warn that establishing a code of conduct without clear ways to investigate complaints and enforce punishment is storing up trouble. But few doubt the industry is serious. Revenues and reputations, after all, are at stake. Ridley Scott expunged Spacey from All the Money in the World, which cleared the way for the film’s Golden Globe nominations. Award tipsters think Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird, starring Saoirse Ronan, will benefit from a desire to recognise and reward well-crafted stories focused on women. Four LA-based advertising professionals have launched a site to help audiences track which films and TV shows are associated with alleged predators. It is called Rotten Apples, borrowing from Rotten Tomatoes, a venerable site that ranks films according to reviews. Richard Rushfield, who publishes an entertainment industry newsletter, the Ankler, said studios and production companies faced a new reality. “What will have changed for evermore is that when people come forward with problems, HR departments will no longer be able to brush them under the rug, or do so at their own risk.” The caveat: “Where there are billions of dollars sloshing around I think there will forever be ways to protect the people at the top of this pyramid, but it will no longer be automatic that everyone gets away with everything.” The actor Christian Bale, speaking to the Guardian to promote the film Hostiles, predicted Hollywood would never be the same. “I can’t see that this will become a footnote and be swept under the rug. It does feel like it will change.” The continued stream of men accused of misconduct - Dustin Hoffman, TJ Miller, Gary Goddard and Jeffrey Tambor deny wrongdoing, Morgan Spurlock and Louis CK admit it – seems relentless. Is there no end to it? A senior female executive at one studio, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had an optimistic response: in recent years many more women had climbed Hollywood’s corporate ladder, a feminisation which had helped tamp down brazen abuses common in the 80s and 90s. “Many of the allegations coming to light now date back to that period.” Hollywood’s creative side – directors, producers, writers, crews – remained male-dominated but was succumbing to pressure from the lawyers, HR executives and others on the corporate side, she said. “Look at how fast people get fired – it can happen within days, even hours of complaints.” Sceptics, however, point to the “complicity machine” of publicists, executives, assistants, lawyers and others who facilitated Weinstein’s alleged abuses, some unwittingly, and attempted to cover up until the New York Times broke the story in October. Dan Marshall, a screenwriter, said the new climate should help women and other marginalised voices tell their stories on screen but cautioned that exploitation would endure. “It’s a very desperate town. People have dreams and hopes and want to see those dreams happen, and only a few people hold the keys. I don’t think we’re done catching yet.” Peter Mehlman, an author and Seinfeld writer, said dinosaurs still roved Hollywood, but perhaps not for long. “The completely unjustifiable confidence that normally pervades this place is really shaken. You hear a lot of dinner conversation about where the lines are and what are the nuances of inter-office socializing. The saner, more decent people are asking questions like: ‘Is that it for flirting?’ The dimmer, more entitled dinosaurs are saying: ‘This business isn’t even fun any more.’ Mehlman continued: “This may be the most Pollyanna thing I’ve ever said, but I really think this is going to change things. A lot. It’s hard to imagine anyone in power sizing up a woman and saying: ‘I’m all over her.’ Everyone’s getting conditioned to think twice, even the most predatory among us – or maybe especially the most predatory. I may be anthropomorphising here, but I really think the animals have no choice but to be civilized.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/25/tens-of-thousands-of-young-people-affected-by-homelessness-data-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T15:00:22Z","webTitle":"Tens of thousands of young people affected by homelessness, data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/25/tens-of-thousands-of-young-people-affected-by-homelessness-data-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/25/tens-of-thousands-of-young-people-affected-by-homelessness-data-shows","fields":{"headline":"Tens of thousands of young people affected by homelessness, data shows","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Councils across England, Scotland and Wales have released statistics that show tens of thousands of young people have come forward to say they are either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless over the past year. Figures from 234 councils obtained through a freedom of information request have lifted the lid on a hidden epidemic, with almost 45,000 18- to 24-year-olds approaching their local authority over the past year. However, with more than 100 local authorities not providing information, the real statistic could well be above 70,000. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, which carried out the research, said the revelation exposed a “national scandal”. “These figures reveal the hidden homelessness crisis affecting young people, with an estimated 70,000 18- to 24-year-olds across the country turning to councils for help,” he said. “The situation is being made worse by the government’s heartless decision to strip young people of housing benefit.” Charities have said that the government’s decision to keep housing benefit frozen has exacerbated the problem, with the gap growing between funds and rent levels. But there are also fears about the move to block single 18- to 21-year-olds from receiving any help with housing costs, unless they can prove they are particularly vulnerable, within universal credit that is rolling out across the country. Jean Templeton, the chief executive of St Basils, an organisation that works with young homeless people, said the benefit change had left many facing a “catch 22” situation. “The underlying presumption that 18- to 21-year-olds are not entitled to support with housing costs places them in an impossible situation whereby they are unlikely to receive an offer of accommodation, as landlords who have several tenancy options presume their rent is at risk,” she said. But without an offer, people cannot apply for housing support nor the necessary exemption if they are aged between 18 and 21, she said, warning that this placed more young people at risk of rough sleeping and unsafe housing options. The figures show that many more young people are turning up at their local council to warn of a risk of homelessness than are actually being accepted as in need of urgent support. Of the 45,000 presenting as at risk of losing their home in the year up to September 2017, only 10,000 were classified as statutory homeless. The data shows the highest numbers were in Bradford (1,828), followed by Manchester (1,297), Cornwall (1,127), Nottingham (1,091) and then Telford and Wrekin (1,051). Manchester city council said homelessness was a national problem “being stoked by welfare changes and the ongoing impact of austerity” and said young people were far from immune. It said the government had dismantled safety nets that used to exist, but insisted it was working hard to tackle the issue, including through prevention. In Cornwall, a spokeswoman stressed that young people with partners and children did qualify for more support, but said the council worked hard to prevent homelessness among single people as well. One drive is to offer “mediation and whole family support” to help secure a place to live with loved ones, she said. She said the council had put money in to help reduce rough sleeping. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: “It is a tragedy when anyone becomes homeless.” He said councils worked hard to prevent people losing their homes, or find new accommodation, and that a chronic shortage of affordable housing was making it very difficult to find emergency solutions. Charities expressed deep concern about the plight of young people, with Paul Noblet of Centrepoint saying the most alarming thing about the figures was that they were likely to be a serious underestimate given that not all councils responded. Moreover, many young people would not know to turn to the council for help, he said. “As a country, if we want to break the cycle of homelessness we need to be honest about the scale of the problem and decide if we are serious about solving it,” said Noblet. Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said losing a home was a terrifying prospect.“At the very point when [young people] should be full of hope and looking forward to starting out in life, many are instead threatened with homelessness,” she said. A government spokesman said: “Councils have a duty to help those most in need of temporary accommodation, and we continue to spend £24bn a year helping people across the UK with their housing costs. “Government is providing over £1bn up to 2020 to reduce all forms of homelessness and we are investing in a Fair Chance Programme to support 18- to 25-year-olds with specific needs to help them find suitable accommodation and support their needs.” He also pointed to the implementation of the Homelessness Reduction Act."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/20/banks-olive-branch-increases-chance-of-brexit-deal-city-can-live-with","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T19:43:06Z","webTitle":"Bank's olive branch increases chance of Brexit deal City can live with","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/20/banks-olive-branch-increases-chance-of-brexit-deal-city-can-live-with","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/dec/20/banks-olive-branch-increases-chance-of-brexit-deal-city-can-live-with","fields":{"headline":"Bank's olive branch increases chance of Brexit deal City can live with","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Smart move by the Bank of England. While Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, is warning about UK banks losing their passporting rights to operate in the single market, Threadneedle Street is trying to position itself as a model of sweet reasonableness. All being well, EU investment banks operating in the City will be able to carry on after Brexit almost as if nothing has changed. EU wholesale banks will still have to fill out a form shifting the status of their current UK branches from “passported” to “authorised,” but the process sounds straightforward. The Bank doesn’t want to be heavy handed and insist that EU banks’ lightly regulated branches in the UK are changed into subsidiaries, which are costlier to operate since capital has to be ringfenced. The one big condition is that the Bank assumes “an appropriate degree of supervisory cooperation” from EU countries and regulators. If the Brexit negotiations turn out horribly, expensive subsidiaries will be back on the table. Is this a case of the Bank taking the moral high ground, or is it just acting in the UK’s interests? Actually, both. Self-interest lies in the fact the City’s chief attraction is its openness to global capital. At this stage in the negotiations, it would be absurd to tell EU wholesale banks that they will be treated more harshly than counterparts from the US, Japan and Switzerland, all of which are allowed to operate branches in the UK. And it would even sillier to tell EU banks to erect subsidiaries, just in case, and then, if the Brexit negotiations proceed happily, allow them to dismantle their new vehicles. That would waste everybody’s time. The moral high ground factor is this: the Bank is saying it wants to cooperate with EU regulators on data-sharing and supervision and so on, and is inviting a return in kind. This carrot comes with a stick, naturally. Carney, in front of the Treasury select committee, repeated his line about the UK being “the banker for Europe”, meaning there are cost benefits for EU companies and governments in having bond-clearing, equity-underwriting and currency-trading concentrated in London. What happens if EU negotiators and politicians decide the UK’s stance is weak, as opposed to cooperative? What if they would be rather clobber the City and create rival financial centres in Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg? What if technical squabbles – over the EU cap on bankers’ bonuses, for example – are inflated into deal-breakers that make even loose agreement on regulatory equivalence impossible? At that point, all bets would be off. But, from a negotiating perspective, the Bank’s position on “branch status” is surely correct. Start by assuming cooperation and openness, and advertise the advantages of keeping things orderly. The strategy certainly doesn’t guarantee a free-trade deal that includes financial services – far from it, given Barnier’s comments – but it costs nothing at the outset and increases the chances of getting arrangements the City can live with. If the Bank had a free hand, we would probably have seen Wednesday’s announcement six months ago. Our technocrats are better at this stuff than the politicians. It ain’t how it used to be for BT Here’s another sign that BT’s standing with government is falling fast. Only a few months ago, ministers’ big idea to get fast broadband to 1.1m hard-to-reach homes in rural areas was to put BT’s Openreach subsidiary on the job. This, supposedly, was quickest way to deliver a Tory manifesto pledge. The company submitted its proposal and all seemed set fair. Now BT’s plans have been rejected. Instead, the government will create a legal right for consumers to request a decent broadband connection, defined as 10Mbps or better, by 2020. Matt Hancock, minister for digital policy, did a terrible job of explaining on the Today programme who customers are supposed to make their demands to, and how the funding mechanism for this new universal service obligation will work. One assumes those details will follow. The main point is that government clearly wants to get other providers into the market. Over-dependence on BT and Openreach is seen as dangerous for the economy. You can see the same process at the regulator, Ofcom. The chief executive, Sharon White, made a stinging speech this month that called on BT to “act in the interest of all of its customers who rely on it, as well as its shareholders” when rolling out full-fibre broadband. She sounded more impressed by the efforts of Virgin Media and Vodafone, and more convinced that real competition in full-fibre is materialising. BT, and its new chairman Jan du Plessis, have a problem: the company’s lobbying power is not what it used to be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/20/police-charging-deadline-extended-over-suspected-uk-terrorist-plot","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T20:28:25Z","webTitle":"Police charging deadline extended over suspected UK terrorist plot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/police-charging-deadline-extended-over-suspected-uk-terrorist-plot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/police-charging-deadline-extended-over-suspected-uk-terrorist-plot","fields":{"headline":"Police charging deadline extended over suspected UK terrorist plot","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police officers have been given until Christmas Day to decide whether to charge four men held as part of an operation to foil a suspected Christmas terrorist attack. Chip shop owner Andy Sami Star, 31, and three other men, aged 22, 36 and 41, are being questioned by police after raids in Derbyshire and South Yorkshire on Tuesday morning. Specialist teams returned on Wednesday to the scene of one arrest in Chesterfield to help with ongoing searches, the north-east counter-terrorism unit said. The force has asked residents to be “alert but not alarmed” after Tuesday’s raid on Mermaid Tradition Fish Bar which involved an army bomb squad. In Sheffield on Wednesday, counter-terrorism officers flew a drone back and forth over the Fatima community centre in Burngreave which, along with a mosque, had been sealed off. Some officers later climbed on to the flat roof of the centre to take a closer look at targets identified in the drone’s video footage, while others donned protective clothing to search through bins outside the building. Residents had reported being woken early on Tuesday by a series of loud bangs and seeing camouflaged officers with guns. Witnesses said a man was later taken from the property. The four men being questioned by police at a station in West Yorkshire are being held on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Police said the arrests were “intelligence-led and pre-planned” as part of an ongoing investigation. Amar Ghaman, the volunteer manager at the Fatima, which is located in a semi-industrial area north of the city centre, said there was nothing “strange going on here and nothing for the Muslim community to worry about”. One resident of a four-storey block of flats opposite said police had advised him and other residents to evacuate on Tuesday evening. “We went to our daughter’s for a couple of hours but then came back,” said Terry, aged 67. “Nothing has happened since the raids. I heard three loud bangs and then saw lots of police in military fatigues. “I saw them bring one guy out. He was between two policemen so I couldn’t see him clearly.” He described the area as a mix of different cultures. “It’s very friendly, everyone gets on,” he said. “We’ve got Somali neighbours, it’s all good.” Around three miles south in the Meersbrook area of the city, residents said they were woken on Tuesday by police blowing open the door of a run-down terrace house as armed officers in protective gear swooped in the early hours. A further raid is understood to have happened at a property in Stocksbridge, just north of Sheffield. Counter-terrorism teams are running about 500 live investigations involving 3,000 individuals at any one time, while there is also a wider pool of 20,000 people who were the subjects of previous inquiries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/21/poland-brussels-law-and-justice-eu-voting-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T09:00:02Z","webTitle":"Poland can thumb its nose at Brussels as long as the cash keeps rolling in | Remi Adekoya","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/21/poland-brussels-law-and-justice-eu-voting-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/21/poland-brussels-law-and-justice-eu-voting-rights","fields":{"headline":"Poland can thumb its nose at Brussels as long as the cash keeps rolling in","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The EU has triggered a process that could potentially strip Poland of its voting rights in Brussels. This is a response to the Polish government’s efforts to assert party political control over the judiciary via “reforms” it claims are needed to purge the country’s courts of ex-communist judges. The triggering of article 7, referred to in Brussels as the “atomic option”, is an unprecedented act against a member state, signalling the EU’s frustration with the intransigently anti-democratic course Warsaw has taken since the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power in 2015. The European council president, Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, stated: “This decision results from the changes proposed by PiS, which will result in the government being above the law, rather than the law above the government.” A few hours later, Polish president Andrzej Duda, of PiS, defiantly signed into law the very changes Tusk and the EU expressed concerns about, enabling the ruling party stack the judiciary with political appointees. Even Theresa May, usually quick to duck difficult issues on foreign trips, has promised to raise the UK’s “concerns” about the Polish government’s actions against the judiciary during her trip to Warsaw tomorrow. “We place importance on respect for the rule of law and we expect all our partners to abide by international norms and standards,” the PM’s spokesman said yesterday. Mateusz Morawiecki, the new prime minister appointed by PiS last week, will likely nod politely, assure May everything is fine, and proceed to ignore her just like Poland’s ruling party has ignored all international concerns raised about its anti-democratic policies in the past two years. In fact, it is already trying to turn this situation to its advantage domestically by ramping up its propaganda machine, led by state-controlled media, to foster a siege mentality, suggesting Poland (not the current government, but the country) is being attacked by the EU just because it is asserting its sovereignty in national affairs. Party spokeswoman Beata Mazurek reacted to the EU’s decision by saying “this move does not strike at PiS, it strikes at Poland”. She also blamed the liberal opposition party, Civic Platform, which Law and Justice regularly portrays as a party of traitors working with Brussels against Polish interests. As the main state-controlled television station declared after the EU announcement: “Poland’s sovereign stance riles Berlin, Brussels and the opposition.” Ever since Law and Justice came to power it has portrayed itself as a resistance movement fighting against the domination of Poland by powerful western nations and corporations that have been imposing their will on the country ever since its economic transformation from communism started in 1989. In a 2016 interview, Mateusz Morawiecki, the new prime minister appointed last week largely to deal with Brussels-Warsaw tensions, said “today we see more and more that the invisible hand of the market has weakened us [Poland] through these many, many years … to a huge extent, we are dependent on foreigners”. It is the resentment at this feeling of dependence, of being subject to the will of foreigners, that is the driving emotion behind many of Law and Justice’s policies and its openly antagonistic rhetoric towards western Europe and EU officials. This is its way of publicly asserting its resistance to foreign domination. Considering Poland’s ruling party is currently supported by 40% of Poles, compared with the 17% who back its closest rival, the economically liberal Civic Platform. Law and Justice has clearly tapped into a national sense of resentment and desire to resist this perceived foreign domination. Of course, there are other reasons it remains popular, most notably its unprecedentedly generous social spending, in complete contrast to former governments, which generally argued Poland couldn’t afford generous welfare like its richer western European peers. However, it is undeniable that Law and Justice has been able to inspire widespread feelings of national pride and dignity thanks to its public displays of assertiveness towards Brussels, which tap into national resentments and give many Poles the feeling, however illusory, of empowerment and control over their nation’s destiny. The parallels to Britain’s leave campaign, and its emphasis on “taking back control” from a bullying Brussels, draw themselves. The big difference is that Law and Justice does not want Poland to leave the EU. At least not as long as it remains the largest beneficiary of EU funds. Between 2007 and 2013, Poland received roughly £60bn in EU development funds. Add to that the £76bn earmarked in the current 2014-20 budget timeframe and Poland will have received a windfall significantly exceeding the value of the post-second world war Marshall Plan for the whole of western Europe, calculated in today’s dollar figures. So long as this cash keeps flowing, even the most anti-Brussels politicians in Poland will want to keep it in the EU. The only thing that would really worry Law and Justice would be a credible threat of these funds being withheld or even significantly delayed as that would jeopardise its spending plans. Moreover, were Poles to learn less money was flowing into the country directly due to Law and Justice’s policies, all that national pride could very quickly turn into anger at the ruling party for not being more pragmatic with Brussels. In any case, Poland’s government does not need to be unduly worried about the triggering of article 7 for this is merely the first step in a long process that would eventually require the approval of all other EU members for actual sanctions to be imposed on Poland. Law and Justice’s equally authoritarian Hungarian ally, prime minister Viktor Orbán, has already vowed to veto any sanctions on Poland. EU institutions are in a lose-lose situation here: doing nothing means Law and Justice continues dismantling democratic norms undisturbed, but reacting with the measures currently at Brussels’ disposal only serve to strengthen the party’s hand domestically and are thus unlikely to force it to change course. Brussels clearly needs to rethink the rules by which the EU is governed. Those currently in place lack any realistic provisions for dealing with a member government that rubbishes the fundamental principles the union was built on … while continuing to take its cash, of course. • Remi Adekoya is the former political editor of the Warsaw Business Journal"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/21/changes-to-eu-working-rules-will-put-patients-lives-at-risk-say-medics","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Changes to EU working rules will 'put patients' lives at risk', say medics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/21/changes-to-eu-working-rules-will-put-patients-lives-at-risk-say-medics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/21/changes-to-eu-working-rules-will-put-patients-lives-at-risk-say-medics","fields":{"headline":"Changes to EU working rules will 'put patients' lives at risk', say medics","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Representatives of British doctors, psychiatrists and nursing staff have warned that weakening working time regulations as part of the Brexit process would put the lives of patients at risk. Changes to the current EU rules on a working week, rest entitlements and paid leave in the UK, with the option of opt out, have been mooted by members of Theresa May’s cabinet when discussing their vision of post-Brexit Britain. But leaders from the British Medical Association (BMA), along with 12 royal colleges and trade unions, have urged Theresa May to stand firm against Brexiters who want to scrap European laws, warning of risks to patient safety. In a letter to the prime minister, medical leaders ask May to put her promises to protect British workers into pre-Brexit written guarantees to head off a simmering campaign within the cabinet, reportedly being led by environment secretary Michael Gove and other Brexiters, to relax the law. “Twenty-five years ago, the phenomenon of health professionals working 90-hour weeks, and the attendant risks this posed, was all too common in the NHS. The worst excesses of these working arrangements were only curtailed following the arrival of EU-derived legislation limiting hours,” reads the letter from the BMA and other medical organisations. The EU working time directive (WTR) is incorporated into UK law and protects the right to restricted hours of work, regular rest breaks, health and safety protection and paid holidays. Medical professionals say in their letter that they are concerned patients’ safety would be put at risk if there was any diminution of the WTR. It says that even with the EU regulations in place, “fatigue, caused by excessive overwork, remains an occupational hazard for many staff at the NHS” – a point echoed in a statement by the head of the Royal College of Nursing, a signatory to the letter. Janet Davies, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, said: “Nurses are driven to do the best they can for their patients, but however dedicated, clinical staff overtired from working excessive hours could become a risk to the very people they are trying to treat. “Working time regulations put an end to the excessive hours of the past, and in doing so made care safer. “It should be clear to the government that removing or weakening working time regulations would put patients at serious risk.” Earlier this week, May dismissed claims that the government was planning to ditch the directive, insisting she intended to “not only maintain but also enhance workers’ rights”. She was responding to reports that Gove and others wanted to return the power to employers and to give the “ordinary British worker” the opportunity to do more overtime and make extra money. Other signatories to the letter are the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, Royal College of Anaesthetists, Royal College of General Practitioners, Royal College of Midwives, British Dental Association, Royal College of Opthamologists, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The medical profession associations call on May not to renege on her promise, made at the Conservative party conference to guarantee workers’ rights in law. Many doctors, particularly junior doctors, work more than 48 hours a week because of shift patterns, the BMA said. Many will work at least between 48 and 56 hours and many will stay over to finish paperwork or see a clinic or patient through. Recent reporting data from within the NHS showed that one doctor in a trust in Croydon worked 81 hours in one week this year. But the BMA says the WTR has reduced significantly the amount of incidents like this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/29/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-blockchain-what-they-really-mean-for-our-future","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-29T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies – what digital money really means for our future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/29/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-blockchain-what-they-really-mean-for-our-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/29/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-blockchain-what-they-really-mean-for-our-future","fields":{"headline":"Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies – what digital money really means for our future","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"What is a cryptocurrency? Is it like bitcoin? In a word, yes. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and is still the biggest, but in the eight years since it was created pretenders to the throne have come along. All of them have the same basic underpinnings: they use a “blockchain”, a shared public record of transactions, to create and track a new type of digital token – one that can only be made and shared according to the agreed-upon rules of the network, whatever they may be. But the flourishing ecosystem has provided a huge amount of variation on top of that. Some cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin or Dogecoin, fulfil the same purpose as bitcoin – building a new digital currency – with tweaks to some of the details (making transactions faster, for instance, or ensuring a basic level of inflation). Others, such as Ethereum or Bat, take the same principle but apply it to a specific purpose: cloud computing or digital advertising in the case of those two. What exactly is a bitcoin? Can I hold one? A bitcoin doesn’t really exist as a concrete physical – or even digital – object. If I have 0.5 bitcoins sitting in my digital wallet, that doesn’t mean there is a corresponding other half sitting somewhere else. What you really have when you own a bitcoin is the collective agreement of every other computer on the bitcoin network that your bitcoin was legitimately created by a bitcoin “miner”, and then passed on to you through a series of legitimate transactions. If you want to actually own some bitcoin, there are exactly two options: either become a miner (which involves investing a lot of money in computers and electricity bills – probably more than the value of the bitcoin you’ll actually make, unless you’re very smart), or simply buy some bitcoin from someone else using conventional money, typically through a bitcoin exchange such as Coinbase or Bitfinex. A lot of the quirks of the currency come down to the collective agreement about what constitutes “legitimacy”. For instance, since the first bitcoin was created in 2009, the total number in existence has been growing slowly, at a declining rate, ensuring that at some point around 2140, the 21 millionth bitcoin will be mined, and no more will ever be created. If you disagree with that collective agreement, well, there’s nothing stopping you from splitting with the wider network and creating your own version of bitcoin. This is what’s known as a “fork”, and it’s already happened multiple times in the past (that’s what competitors such as Litecoin and Dogecoin are). The difficulty is persuading other people to follow you. A currency used by just one person isn’t much of a currency. What can I actually do with cryptocurrencies? In theory, almost anything that can be done with a computer could, in some way, be rebuilt on a cryptocurrency-based platform. Building a cryptocurrency involves turning a worldwide network of computers into a decentralised platform for data storage and processing – in effect, a giant hive-mind PC (that this no longer sounds like it has much to do with “currencies” is part of the reason some instead suggest the name “decentralised apps” to cover this sector). We’ve already seen proposals for YouTube clones, collectible card games and digital advertising exchanges built on top of cryptocurrencies: “x but on the blockchain” is the new startup pitch du jour, now that “Uber for x” and “x but on the iPhone” are passé. There’s already Dentacoin (Yelp for Dentists but on the blockchain), Matchpool (Tinder but on the blockchain) and even Cryptokitties (Tamagotchis but on the blockchain). In practice, however, the available uses are rather more limited. Bitcoin can be used as a payment system for a few online transactions, and even fewer real-world ones, while other cryptocurrencies are even more juvenile than that. The excitement about the field is focused more on what it could become than what it actually is. Why does it matter that it’s decentralised? At their heart, cryptocurrencies are basically just fancy databases. Bitcoin, for instance, is a big database of who owns what bitcoin, and what transactions were made between those owners. In its own way, that’s little different from a conventional bank, which is basically just a big database of who owns what pounds, and what transactions were made between those owners. But the distinction with bitcoin is that no central authority runs that big fancy database. Your bank can unilaterally edit its database to change the amount of money it thinks you have, and it does so often. Sometimes that’s to your advantage (if your debit card gets stolen and used, for instance, your bank will just return the money) and sometimes it’s not (if your bank thinks you’re money laundering, it will freeze your account, potentially crippling your business). With bitcoin, no one can do either of those things. The only authority on the network is whatever the majority of bitcoin users agree on, and in practice that means nothing more than the basic rules of the network are ever enforced. Is this all about crime? It is … a lot about crime. The flip side of cryptocurrencies being decentralised databases is that for most people, most of the time, there’s no downside to a centralised database. If you trust the financial system to store your funds, or Dropbox to store your files, or YouTube to host your videos, then you don’t need to use less efficient decentralised versions of those services. But if you are planning to commit financial crime, store illegal downloads, or host pirated videos a decentralised version of those services becomes much more appealing. That’s why bitcoin, for instance, has become the currency of choice for online drug dealers and cybercriminals demanding ransoms to restore hacked data. “Crime” is a broad term, though. In many countries, having a political opinion contrary to that of the ruling regime is considered broadly criminal; many more limit the freedom of their citizens in ways that citizens of liberal democraciesmight view as unethical and inhumane. If cryptocurrencies allow those limitations to be overcome, it may technically be promoting crime, but not in the way most cryptocurrency critics mean. You keep saying “blockchain”. What does that actually mean? The concept of the blockchain lies at the heart of all cryptocurrencies. It is the decentralised historical record of changes in the ownership of the asset, be it simply spending a bitcoin or executing a complex “smart contract” in one of the second-generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. Whenever a cryptocurrency transaction occurs, its details are broadcast throughout the entire network by the spending party, ensuring that everyone has an up-to-date record of ownership. Periodically, all the recent changes get bundled together into one “block”, and added to the historical record. And so the “blockchain” – a linked list of all the previous blocks – serves as the full and complete record of who owns what on the network. So what do miners actually do? They build the blockchain. How precisely they do that varies from cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency, but bitcoin is a good example: every 10 minutes or so, one miner is semi-randomly selected to do the work of taking all the transactions they’ve heard about, declaring them confirmed and bundling them up into one block of transactions, which they then add to the chain. In return for doing the work, the winning miner is also allowed to “print” some new bitcoin to pay themselves a reward in bitcoin, currently worth about $140,000. Anyone can be a miner – all you have to do is run the bitcoin software in mining mode. The tricky part is being a profitable miner. The actual work of bundling the transactions together is easy, but the real expense comes from the way the winner is selected. Think of it as a raffle, where buying a ticket involves using your computer to solve a very complex, but ultimately useless, arithmetic problem. To be in with the most chance of getting that $140,000 reward, you need to solve those problems thousands or millions of times a second to enter the raffle with as many tickets as possible, and that means building specialised computers, negotiating cheaper sources of electricity, or just hacking innocent people and using their hardware for nothing instead. How are people making so much money? That’s the $190bn question – the value of all the bitcoin in the world at the time this article was published. The short answer is “buying low, and selling high”: the value of one bitcoin has increased from essentially nothing eight years ago, to $1,200 eight months ago, to a high of almost $20,000 in December and settling at $11,000 now. Anyone who got hold of enough bitcoin early enough is now really quite wealthy – on paper, at least. The real question is why one bitcoin is worth $11,000 (and why Ethereum is worth $1,040, and why one particular Cryptokitty is worth $100,000). There, you can find two answers. The sympathetic one is that all these cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, scarce assets – only a certain amount exist in the world. If they are to be widely adopted for real-world use, then people will need to buy those scarce assets, and so their value will necessarily be higher than they are today. The current price, in that story, simply reflects the probability that any particular cryptocurrency will actually be widely used. Is there trouble ahead? There is if you take the more hostile, second answer to be correct: that collective greed has fuelled a speculative bubble that will eventually come crashing down. As people hear stories of others making money from cryptocurrencies, they buy their own – which inflates the price, creating more stories of wealth and more investment. The cycle continues until eventually the price of the underlying asset is out of kilter with reality. Eventually, the bubble bursts, and a lot of people look around to find they’ve lost everything. What next? Takeoff Cryptocurrencies could achieve their ambitions, and become a widely used facet of daily life. A few people will become very rich as a result, but not really more so than early investors in other foundational technologies such as computing or the internet. Hard landing Or this speculative bubble could end with a crash so severe that it destroys faith in the entire sector, driving the investors out, bankrupting the miners who’ve spent thousands or millions on single-purpose hardware that requires a high bitcoin price to turn a profit, and leaving cryptocurrencies as a technological dead-end alongside cold fusion and jetpacks. Cruising altitude But maybe things will continue as they have done for the past five years. Cryptocurrencies’ actual use stays stable, mostly illegal, largely underground, and completely disconnected from a market price that fluctuates wildly based on the whims of a class of financial speculators with little link to the ground truth. Instability, it turns out, is an oddly stable and predictable state of affairs.

It’s New Year’s Eve! Let’s party","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Here’s an idea: a New Year’s Eve camp for the children of parents who still love a party. Not just drinks, a dinner, but a party party, you know, a thing that starts gently with a plastic glass and chatter about school catchments and then joyfully descends. A New Year’s Eve camp that starts today, lunchtime, where children collect by the campfire in full excitement and coats, and their parents, vibrating with guilt, cover them with weighted kisses before dashing off to shave their legs and put a record on. The camp could be in Elstree. Somewhere like Elstree. Somewhere suitably green and anonymous, but accessible by motorway. The children would have structured play for the first two hours, while parents made their ways home, relaxing a little more at every petrol station. And they’d get home, rushing now, steaming up the bathroom, a spritz of something citric maybe, the door to the kids’ room slightly ajar, its contents of Stickle Bricks and puddled tights like a conquered landscape. The music is important, the kitchen Sonos pumping out songs that remind them how to be the people they were when they met, with ambition and mopeds and all their hair. At some point they close the kids’ room door. At camp, the muddied children would sit in a circle and drink hot chocolate, while the parents arrive at their friends’ house a little too early, too excited, wielding a bottle like a passport. In the hall they’d Facetime the children, who are anxious to get back to their midnight feast, and when they hang up the parents kiss with a passion that at first feels performative, but eases into something real. Then the party would start to wobble slightly, they’re on a boat that’s leaving shore. The kitchen would become a ballroom, someone’s DJing from their phone, at one point a podcast about the ethics of euthanasia comes on and everyone keeps dancing. A cat sleeps furiously on the pile of coats, a marriage breaks down in the garden, 1,000 intimacies are forged in the smoking area. At camp, the midnight feast would be held in the bunks, with clumsy flirting as the new year dawns, and sleep would come slowly, under slightly itchy blankets. The real beauty of the camp, however, would not be in the New Year’s Eve activities, but the accommodation for up to four days following – climbing, firepits, swimming, song. Each hour following a parents’ party is crucial. Home at four, ordinarily they would be woken again at seven, and chucked face first into a pit of toast and cartoons. When, of course, at this age, halfway to death, a hangover needs at least three days to bed in, to carry its owner through the tepid shallows of fear and loneliness, through to the depths of agony beyond. The memories of spilling red wine on their host’s carpet, and brilliantly covering it with ground pepper. The inevitable suggestive dance with the person who by day is a clumsy letch but by fairy light suddenly seemed like the one that got away. Oh God the vomit, the vomit in the plant, and the argument about Uber, and the standing on the table with arms outstretched shouting: “Please Has Anybody Got Any Drugs Please.” Let’s say one day for just lying with their hands over their eyes like they’ve seen too much, heaving themselves to standing only to accept a Deliveroo. Let’s say another day to gently phone around, researching the truth, rehydrating the relationship. Then two days – full days – to ease back into the reality of their identity, and all the responsibilities and repayments, both emotional and fiscal, owed. To slither back into the skin of a person that goes to bed at 10.30, that has a whole thing about bin collection times, that goes into her son’s school to talk about stranger danger and the environmental impact of plastic bags. At camp, the children would be protected from the raw reality of their parents as people, from seeing the awful fallout from cocktails made at dawn and shoes that need practice. Returning from Elstree, somewhere like Elstree, ruddy-cheeked and vital on 4 January, the children would smell nothing, see nothing, it would be almost spring, and they’d have learned how to make flapjacks, and their parents are alive, and that’s all they’d need to know.

For self-preservation, we train our eyes to dull the slogans that cover the buildings that gentrification means many can no longer afford to enter, but the white words painted on a wall in Shoreditch, east London, will stay with me: “Sex with refugees is jasmine-scented and beautiful”. The words, which have now been painted over, stunned me. Artist Robert Montgomery says that the words were ripped from another piece of his. This reads: “The refugees are beautiful, they bring ancient music and desert sweets and jasmine-filled sex”, which he happily posted for us all to see. On Facebook he denied creating the Shoreditch graffiti. But either version of the sentiment shows ignorance over the words and social misconceptions about the current refugee crisis. It is with a deep bitterness that it has to be spelled out that neither love nor sex is the solution. My mother was born in Malaysia, and this language echoes the colonial narrative that makes me feel sick. Throughout history, women of colour have been presented as alluring and tantalisingly exotic. The repercussions of this are felt through porn, advertising and experiences that women of colour have while dating. This piece of art mirrors that. The choice of language presents sex with another human as essentially different, foreign or fetish. This is not a great basis for relationships nor a way to bring about racial equality. As Jinan Petra, a campaigner against immigration detention, tells me: “To write such racist, orientalist, harmful bullshit about people who have been through so much – including sexual violence – in migration ... there are very few words. I’m a Syrian woman and in my professional and personal life I know that these views exist; the sentiment and the entitlement don’t surprise me.” From my own work with female refugees, I am painfully aware of the sexual violence that vulnerable people face. While preparing to teach film-making to young asylum seekers and undocumented youth, we were faced with the grim reality that assault and rape were common. Not only is the journey notoriously perilous, the dangers don’t stop when you arrive in Britain. Without secure status, you are at the whim of those around you. For some, this has meant staying in abusive “romantic” relationships, while others have faced sexual violence from guards inside detention facilities. Even if you do happen to be in a loving relationship, Theresa May’s “hostile environment” can make it difficult. One evening, as the sun set, I awkwardly looked away as a man told his wife he loved her inside Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre. “Don’t touch her,” a guard barked. They dropped their hands, wondering if this is what intimacy meant now. All the love in the world means nothing without money for a visa. While the Shoreditch “artwork” is disappointing, its obliviousness comes as no surprise. In British schools, we are not taught the true legacies of colonialism nor how people’s livelihoods have been damaged by our warfare. This accounts for people’s shock over the treatment of migrants in Libya. Often, the charity campaigns surrounding the refugee crisis are no better. Take the Save the Children advert that attempted to garner sympathy through the narrative of a white young girl, asking what if this happened in Europe. It ignored and erased the historical reasons as to why this is not happening here. Similarly, statements such as “refugees are welcome” is a powerful rallying cry but ignores that the UK has one of the biggest and most cruel detention facilities in Europe. Refugees can be held indefinitely. This is how our government “secures” our borders; it isn’t something we can shag away. From the perspective of Aleksandra Bilic, a film-maker who came to this country as a child refugee herself: “It is hard to realise that problems cannot be solved without confronting the greater factors at play and that these issues are beyond ourselves. But this is not a topic for artists to literally fuck with, as these are real issues. If you are going to speak on them, you should try and understand them.” This isn’t to say artists shouldn’t tackle political causes in their work. We need political art with teeth. But our talk of politics comes at a high cost. We have a responsibility to do our research, know the context that our work operates in and be genuinely informed about the cause we seek to amplify. If you do, it’ll prevent wasting time painting over shallow and harmful statements that nobody asked to see. • Jade Jackman is a documentary film-maker and writer based in London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/22/japan-boosts-defence-budget-to-record-levels-with-eye-on-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T04:51:37Z","webTitle":"Japan boosts defence budget to record levels with eye on North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/22/japan-boosts-defence-budget-to-record-levels-with-eye-on-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/22/japan-boosts-defence-budget-to-record-levels-with-eye-on-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"Japan boosts defence budget to record levels with eye on North Korea","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Japan’s government has approved a record defence budget, with money earmarked for costly missile defence systems and, controversially, weapons that could be used in pre-emptive strikes against North Korea. The 5.19tn yen ($46bn) budget, up 1.3% from last year, is the largest ever and marks the six straight annual rise in defence spending under Japan’s conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Abe, who ended a decade of defence cuts soon after becoming prime minister in late 2012, has described the threat posed by North Korean ballistic missiles as a “national crisis”. The regime has launched two missiles over northern Japan this year, and several others have landed inside its 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. In September, North Korea threatened to “sink Japan into the sea” with a nuclear bomb after Tokyo and Washington spearheaded a new round of UN security council sanctions against the regime. Defence officials say Japan needs to drastically and quickly upgrade its missile defence in response to Pyongyang’s rapid development of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons. The defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said this month: “At a time when North Korea is beefing up its ballistic missile capability, we need to strengthen our capability fundamentally.” The new budget, which has to be approved by parliament, came days after Japan said it would buy land-based Aegis Ashore missile defence systems from the US to improve its ability to locate and destroy incoming North Korean missiles. About 730m yen ($6.4m) was set aside to prepare for the introduction of the systems, which will be operational by 2023 and are expected to cost at least 200bn yen. Amid pressure from hawkish members of Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), Japan will also acquire cruise missiles that could be used in pre-emptive strikes against North Korean military sites. The budget includes more than 2bn yen for a Norwegian-built cruise missile with a range of 500km that can be fired from F-35 stealth fighter jets. Japan also plans to buy US-made cruise missiles with a range of 900km. In addition to the land-based Aegis radar stations, Japan will invest in a new, longer-range interceptor, the SM-3 Block IIA, designed to strike ballistic missiles in space, and upgrades to Patriot missile batteries – the last line of defence against incoming warheads. The heavy spending on US military hardware comes after Donald Trump vowed to boost arms sales by pressuring Japan and South Korea to play a bigger role in their own defence. “It’s a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan,” Trump said during a visit to Asia last month. Critics say possession of a first-strike capability violates Japan’s constitution, which bans the use of force to settle international disputes and has restricted the country’s military to a purely defensive role since the end of the second world war. Onodera and other senior LDP officials say Japan would target North Korean missile sites only if it believed an attack was imminent – a move they insist would not violate the country’s “pacifist” principles. But Yukio Edano, whose Constitutional Democratic party of Japan fought October’s general election vowing to defend Japan’s postwar constitution, said the acquisition of cruise missiles would be a “fairly big point of dispute” when MPs debate the budget next month. Akira Kato, a professor of international politics and regional security at JF Oberlin University in Tokyo, said the Abe administration was exploiting the North Korean crisis to bolster Japan’s defences. “Japan is expected to continue strengthening its defence power for the time being,” Kato told Agence France-Presse. While the budget’s focus was on North Korea, it included more than 55bn yen for the construction of military facilities on two outlying islands to boost the ability to respond to Chinese activity in the East China Sea. The islands are not far from the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands – uninhabited outcrops that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, whose vessels regularly enter Japanese waters near the territories."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/22/deontay-wilder-i-want-to-fight-anthony-joshua-but-eddie-hearn-doesnt-want-to-risk-his-gravy-train","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T15:36:31Z","webTitle":"Deontay Wilder: 'I want to fight Anthony Joshua, but Eddie Hearn doesn't want to risk his gravy train'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/22/deontay-wilder-i-want-to-fight-anthony-joshua-but-eddie-hearn-doesnt-want-to-risk-his-gravy-train","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/22/deontay-wilder-i-want-to-fight-anthony-joshua-but-eddie-hearn-doesnt-want-to-risk-his-gravy-train","fields":{"headline":"Deontay Wilder: 'I want to fight Anthony Joshua, but Eddie Hearn doesn't want to risk his gravy train'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Skyy boxing gym outside Tuscaloosa is hard to spot from the end of the dirt road, tucked into the rear of the nondescript aluminum-sided building on a quiet offshoot of Route 30 not far from the banks of Black Warrior river. There’s little outward indication the two converted units in the rear are the training headquarters of one of the world’s most accomplished prizefighters, but there’s no mistaking the sense of occasion when Deontay Wilder peels up in a customized Lamborghini Aventador with a faux gator-skin wrap, an audacious choice in any context but positively extraterrestrial against west Alabama’s modest backdrop. It’s two days after Thanksgiving and this normally bustling college town is mostly deserted, the University of Alabama student body having decamped either home for the holiday or to Auburn for the annual Iron Bowl grudge match that divides communities, friendships and families across this football-mad state. But the champ is here. There was a time when Wilder would have been one of his country’s most famous sportsmen, which makes the 32-year-old among the biggest casualties of boxing’s gradual retreat toward the margins of American life. At one time the heavyweight championship of the world was the most prestigious and coveted title in all of sports, but the fight game’s lack of central authority has wrought four major sanctioning bodies that have served to create confusion among casual observers while cheapening the currency of a championship. Wilder holds the WBC’s version of the long-fractured heavyweight title and has for nearly three years, while Britain’s Anthony Joshua owns the IBF and WBA belts. These days, a fighter needs a special something to cross over into the cultural mainstream in America, whether it’s a hyperkinetic, made-for-YouTube style (like Manny Pacquiao) or a built-in fanbase (like Oscar De La Hoya). There’s no reason Wilder, a charismatic knockout machine in a chiseled 6ft 7in, 220lb package who is undefeated in 39 professional fights with 38 wins inside the distance, can’t fit that bill. And there’s every reason to believe a much-fancied unification fight with Joshua next year will serve as his launchpad to crossover stardom. The pair have been on a collision course for years and their eventual meeting could end with the unification of a heavyweight championship that’s been divided since Lennox Lewis retired more than a decade and a half ago – and the sorely needed clarity it would mean for boxing’s bellwether division. Wilder splits time in Atlanta with his fiancee and four children, with a fifth due next year. But Tuscaloosa, the state’s fifth-largest city whose name almost rings onomatopoeic for southern, will always be home. He still owns a house in town and the memories come forth in torrents as he speaks fondly of his formative years as a multi-sport standout for nearby Central high school, getting in the occasional schoolyard scrap and goofing off with his team-mates on bus rides to away games and harboring dreams of playing basketball or football for the University of Alabama. After graduating he followed those ambitions to Shelton State community college, where he worked on his grades to gain eligibility and eyed a transfer for a chance to play for the hometown Crimson Tide. That all changed with a routine visit to the doctor’s office in 2005, when he learned his unborn daughter with his then girlfriend would be born with spina bifida, an incurable birth defect in which there is an incomplete closing of a fetus’s developing backbone and membranes around the spinal cord, leaving it exposed. Right then Wilder, only 19, knew he needed money and he needed it immediately. “We could have terminated the pregnancy,” he recalls quietly in an easy Alabama drawl. “We could have just left this whole thing alone. Let everybody go about their business, but I felt like it was the right thing to do. I felt like my daughter deserved to live, no matter what the conditions were, no matter how old I was. No matter what I don’t have, I was going to make a way.” He pauses. “If I don’t make any right decisions no more in my life, I can say at least I done it one time.” Wilder considers the prenatal diagnosis a blessing, since it gave the young couple a window of time to prepare for Naieya’s arrival and the requirements for a child with special needs. The most pressing concerns were financial, which prompted Wilder to pick up a series of jobs: waiting tables at IHOP and Red Lobster and driving a truck for Budweiser. It was never the most fulfilling work, though Wilder never batted an eye: “I will never let my pride get in front of nothing I do. I’m not going to let my family suffer because of my pride.” But it was the gnawing memories of his athletic prowess that led him through the Skyy doors on 19 October 2006: three days before his 21st birthday. There the gangly youngster was initially rebuffed by gym owner Jay Deas, but his persistence and raw ability soon won over the trainer and their partnership has since flourished. He is not the first decorated boxer to take up the gloves at an advanced age – Rocky Marciano, Earnie Shavers and Sergio Martínez all started after 20 – but fighters who succeed at the highest level after starting so late are rare. His debut also came so far into the Olympic cycle that he, a total fistic novice, found himself taking aim at the Beijing Games within months of his first visit to the gym. “I didn’t know anything about the Olympics,” he admits. “My whole mentality was to walk in this gym and turn pro. I was going to be a journeyman. I needed money for my daughter like now. One thing we knew is that if we kept winning, that we couldn’t be denied. I’m three months in the gym talking about the Olympics. Miracles happen.” He surveys the modest gym, festooned with posters and memorabilia from throughout a career with no shortage of doubters, not least because Tuscaloosa is hardly a boxing hotbed. “A lot of people don’t understand, up in here is where it really hurts, where you really got to get it,” he says, gesturing toward the ring in the corner. “This is where all your decision-making comes from. The mental game. Do you really want to do this or do you not? And if you don’t, then go home.” Wilder’s crash course of an amateur career – a scant 35 fights in total which included upset wins at the national Golden Gloves and US championships – ended in Beijing with a bronze medal and he signed with a promoter immediately after. Another busted misconception soon followed with the paltry $5,000 check he earned for his professional debut: “I felt like every guy made a lot of money that stepped in the ring. I didn’t know there was levels to get to the big prize, the big money. But I knew what I was going to do whatever it took to get to that point.” Learning a lifetime trade in a few short years was not without challenges, but Wilder’s unique cocktail of work ethic, innate athleticism and boundless confidence kept him on course and he’s not lost a bout since: “I love fighting, I’ve been doing it for a while, even when I was young. It might not have been boxing, but I polished the street-wise mentality of fighting and turned it into an organized thing. It’s like basketball, you play street ball then you join a school team and it becomes organized. Same way as fighting. You start in the streets somewhere: protecting yourself, not being a bully. All fighters have a story of coming up from a rough spot. Most of your best fighters fight their way out of poverty. That’s just the way it works.” All the while he kept his job with Budweiser, a job he loved due to the camaraderie, physical activity and, not insignificantly, the health insurance: “I’m lifting, I’m pulling, I’m tugging. All day long. You’ve got 1,200 cases on your truck. Seventeen-hour shifts and going to the gym afterward.” Since graduating to the paying ranks Wilder has been brought along with extreme care. Too carefully, some critics have alleged, but few can quibble with the results. He’s won each 39 of his fights, all but one by stoppage, frequently in spectacular fashion. He fulfilled his promise to Naieya, who after a battery of surgeries remains catheterized but gets around without crutches and lives an otherwise normal life, when he captured the vacant WBC heavyweight title with a win over Bermane Stiverne in January 2015, becoming the first American heavyweight title-holder since Shannon Briggs eight years prior. He’s since made six successful defenses and now finds himself within touching distance of a unification bout with Joshua that would elevate his profile, and that of his beleaguered sport, to levels untold stateside since Mike Tyson’s heyday. But even more than fortune Wilder is intrigued by the unique cultural heft a unified heavyweight championship would bring. He counts himself as a deep admirer of Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback whose protest of the national anthem has thrust issues of social injustice into the spotlight even as it cost him his career. “That was a big sacrifice,” he says. “He may have regrets because of the heartaches and pains that he’s done been through, but he put himself in the position and he’s going have to stick through it. “He’s one of the woke black people, he’s not brainwashed. That’s what I like about him. It’s only going to get stronger from here. He took a stand, he did the things that some would be scared to do, say the things that some wouldn’t dare to say because they were afraid of losing their jobs. I support him. Why stand for something that’s not for you or talks about killing your ancestors? Who would stand for something like that? How many people stand at home?” “Once you obtain power in the heavyweight division, especially as the heavyweight champion, you can check the president and people will feel it. It’s a different platform because we don’t have a commissioner, we don’t have nobody. We’re our own boss. If [Kaepernick] was the champion of the world, then it would be easy. His career could still go on. That’s why if you can do this, this sport at the top level, especially reaching stardom, the sky’s the limit.” When we meet at the gym it’s been three weeks since Wilder’s one-round destruction of Stiverne in a rematch before a charitably announced crowd of 10,294 at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center – and four since Joshua stopped the stubborn Carlos Takam before an estimated crowd of 78,000 at Cardiff’s Principality Stadium, smashing the world attendance record for an indoor boxing event previously held by Muhammad Ali. While both rivals have similar résumés, Joshua is a household name at home and one of Britain’s most celebrated athletes while Wilder, for all his success and promise, remains familiar only to hardcore boxing fans. It’s clearly a sticking point for the American, who becomes more animated when discussing the factors undercutting the sport’s domestic visibility. “The problem with America is we got media downing American fighters, we got analysts and so-called experts downing American fighters, you got former champions that have made their mark in the sport but don’t want to see their legacy passed down to American fighters. “I never understand that, especially as a champion. You should want somebody to come and pass you. You should want someone to keep the sport alive and build it up. Even the champions don’t want their legacy passed because they don’t want to be forgotten, but if you did it right the first time you’ll never be forgotten. Casual fans come into boxing and listen to the so-called experts downing our fighters but praise the foreigners. We adopt the foreigners but down our own. That’s a huge problem. In other countries, they praise their fighters. “A lot of people don’t want to pull the race card but let’s be real: I’m a realist, I’m a woke realist, I’m not brainwashed at all. I see what’s going on. If I was any other ethnicity, any type of person that’s not a black man, it would be different. If I was any other color but black, it would be different.” He cites the mania surrounding former middleweight champion Kelly Pavlik as a testament to America’s enduring obsession with great white hopes. When I mention that Tyson’s comically lopsided first comeback fight with Peter McNeeley is to this day the second-highest grossing heavyweight promotion in history, his eyes widen and he lets out a guttural laugh. “It’s just the time we live in,” he says. “Black people have always been strong people. We’ve been doing it for years and years and we’re going to continue to do it. We’ve always had to be people to fight out of situations and it’s made us strong along the way.” Inevitably, the discussion turns to the big fight. Wilder says he’s only crossed paths with Joshua once before when he was in London as a member of Sky Sports’ broadcasting team for the Briton’s heavyweight title defense against Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium this year. Their interaction was brief and one of mutual respect, Wilder says, but the opportunity to finally size up Joshua in person did nothing to dent the Alabaman’s supreme confidence. “I think he respects me a hell of a lot,” he says. “Same here. But when it comes to boxing, I know I’m the best. I know it. They know it. It’s just matter of time. They can say what they want in public, they can try to stall and make people believe certain things. But people are getting tired. They’re getting restless. They’re not trying to hear all this stuff. Don’t make excuses, make the fight happen.” Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Boxing, has suggested Wilder should first fight British contender Dillian Whyte, reportedly offering a $3m purse plus the US television rights to the American with a handshake deal to fight Joshua next, but Wilder wants it in writing: “They’re stuck on this Dillian Whyte because Dillian Whyte gave Joshua somewhat of a time. They want to compare, use Dillian as a measuring stick. That’s an easy fight. Of course that’s an easy fight. “At the same time we’re not going to be looking like we’re chasing. When you’re talking about the best fighting the best, champion fighting champion, it shouldn’t be like a circus. Let’s make this fight happen, no matter what the terms are. It ain’t like I ain’t done nothing. I’m the longest reigning [heavyweight] champion in the game, so put some respek on the name. “But they know I’m a risk. They don’t want to risk their gravy train. They can make money off turds not doing nothing. What does that tell you? You’re really just running it as a business. You ain’t no champion. In that case give up the belt and you can still do that. Give me the belts. Or fight.” Wilder was taken aback by the intoxicating atmosphere of Wembley on the night and confesses to imagining himself fighting on that stage. He also learned a thing or two about Joshua, who came off the floor and survived a series of thorny moments to score an 11th-round stoppage that sent Klitschko into retirement. “One thing we did learn about him is he overcame adversity that night,” he says. “We seen him get knocked down and get back up. We see him go through the fatigue, very tired, and somehow gain a second breath. No matter what Klitschko did or didn’t do, it happened. Being able to get back up through a hard time and finish the job. “Some guys get fearful of big crowds but I love it. The more the better for me. When I’m in the ring I don’t hear them or see them. It’s more quiet inside the ring no matter how many people are in the stadium. You get that tunnel vision.” Wilder is in talks for a March fight with Luis Ortiz in Brooklyn with Joshua reportedly close to announcing a date with Joseph Parker, who holds the WBO’s version of the title. Should both make it through unscathed, it would set the stage for the unification of all four major belts: “One face, one champion, one name. That’s what the heavyweight division needs.” It’s an outcome that might have seemed impossible when Wilder first walked through the Skyy doors just over a decade ago, but after the improbable journey that’s followed only a fool would write him off. “When I was five, six years old, there was a poster that my mother gave me with a bear he was running a race and he was about to cross the line,” he says. “And it said you don’t know what you can do until you try. It stuck with me, always to this day and probably till I die: You don’t know what you can do until you try.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/22/un-condemns-australias-forced-return-of-asylum-seeker-to-sri-lanka","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T05:29:50Z","webTitle":"UN condemns Australia's forced return of asylum seeker to Sri Lanka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/22/un-condemns-australias-forced-return-of-asylum-seeker-to-sri-lanka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/22/un-condemns-australias-forced-return-of-asylum-seeker-to-sri-lanka","fields":{"headline":"UN condemns Australia's forced return of asylum seeker to Sri Lanka","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The United Nations’ refugee agency has condemned Australia’s forced return of an asylum seeker to Sri Lanka without any assessment of his claim for protection, saying the man is at serious risk of persecution in his homeland. The UNHCR had sought assurances from the Australian government the man would not be removed from the country and would be allowed to apply for protection. But on Wednesday, the man was forcibly removed, in handcuffs, from Villawood detention centre and flown back to Sri Lanka. The Australian government has maintained that the man was removed because he missed its October 1 deadline to apply for protection, and was deemed not to be seeking protection. However, lawyers for the man said he had a “credible claim” for protection, based on his Tamil ethnicity, and familial connection to the now-defunct separatist army the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil Tigers. It is not suggested he was a member of the LTTE. The man had struggled to fill out the 41-page protection application form in English unassisted, and was not able to access legal assistance before the deadline. With assistance from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, he lodged an application for protection during October but was told he had missed the deadline and his claim would not be assessed. Asylum seekers returned to Sri Lanka are routinely arrested at the airport, and jailed at Negombo before facing court. “The use of torture … [remains] endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds,” the UN says. Lawyers and advocates for the returned man have not been able to contact him since he was returned. A spokeswoman for the UNHCR, Catherine Stubberfield, said the UN was aware of a number of asylum seekers who were unable to meet the government’s deadline of 1 October to submit their applications for asylum. “Since July 2012, people who sought asylum by sea were excluded from lodging an application in Australia for up to four years. “While they were all invited to apply by October 2016, some asylum seekers have been unable to complete this process within the time frame for a range of valid reasons, including a lack of access to legal representation. This was the case for the asylum seeker forcibly returned to Sri Lanka this week.” It was a worrying breach of Australia’s international legal obligations, Stubberfield said. “In this context, the return of an asylum-seeker - whose claim for international protection was not considered on its merits - presents a serious risk of return to danger or persecution.” Regardless of ministerial deadlines, Australia is still legally bound by its non-refoulement obligations under the refugees’ convention. It cannot return a person to a place “where [their] life or freedom would be threatened”. The return of Tamils to postwar Sri Lanka, by Australia and other countries, remains controversial. There has been widespread reportage of the mistreatment and torture of prisoners by Sri Lankan security forces, including the systematic use of rape. In July the UN’s special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights Ben Emmerson visited Sri Lanka and reported that “the use of torture, has been, and remains today, endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds”. “Entire communities have been stigmatised and targeted for harassment and arbitrary arrest and detention, and any person suspected of association, however indirect, with the LTTE remains at immediate risk of detention and torture,” Emmerson wrote. The 1 October deadline was announced in May by then immigration – now home affairs – minister Peter Dutton, who accused asylum seekers of being “fake refugees”. Seven thousand asylum seekers, many of whom had lived for years in Australia without ever being allowed to apply for protection, were told they must meet the October 1 deadline. It is understood all but 71 met the deadline. Australia’s department of immigration declined to comment on the specific case of the man deported on Wednesday, but has commented on the return of Tamils generally, and its non-refoulement obligations. “Australia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australia’s non-refoulement obligations,” a spokesperson said last week. “Australia takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/29/prisons-at-breaking-point-but-australia-is-still-addicted-to-incarceration","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T20:00:10Z","webTitle":"Prisons at breaking point but Australia is still addicted to incarceration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/29/prisons-at-breaking-point-but-australia-is-still-addicted-to-incarceration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/29/prisons-at-breaking-point-but-australia-is-still-addicted-to-incarceration","fields":{"headline":"Prisons at breaking point but Australia is still addicted to incarceration","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last winter, for the first time in years, there was a stirring behind the towering sandstone walls of the old Berrima jail in New South Wales. The 178-year-old, heritage-listed prison in the sleepy southern highlands village was being brought out of retirement, not long after it officially closed in 2011. The building had already seen more than its fill of history. It was used to hold 329 German prisoners during the first world war and, before that, detained some of Australia’s most notorious bushrangers, including the infamous “Captain Thunderbolt” and the serial killer John Lynch, who was hanged there in 1842. Now, it was an emergency, of sorts, which required use of the prison’s 75 beds yet again. The ballooning incarceration rate has filled the state’s prison system to breaking point. The average occupancy of NSW jails was 122% of the system’s official capacity in 2015-16. The number was 112% the year before that. Nationally, prisoner numbers have also continued to break records, rising 40% in the five years from 2012. The incarceration rate climbed from 187.2 prisoners for every 100,000 Australian adults in 2014 to 216.2 in the third quarter of 2017. Australia, like our US and British cousins, is fond of locking people up. This has led to a perplexing problem. Even as general crime rates trend ever downwards, prisons all over the country are experiencing significant overcrowding. With this comes vast costs to taxpayers. It makes it harder for corrective services to meet basic human needs of healthcare, food and suitable accommodation, according to Penal Reform International, a global non-governmental organisation focused on justice reform. Overcrowding threatens the effectiveness of rehabilitation, vocational and educational programs, and is associated with higher rates of violence and mental health problems. With some exceptions, Australian governments have responded to overcrowding by building more prisons. Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory, and Victoria have all embarked on prison building or expansion programs. In NSW, along with the reopening of the 75-bed Berrima facility, the government has announced a $3.8bn program of new prisons and expansions, designed to add almost 3,000 beds to the system’s capacity. In many states, the rush for new prisons has benefited private operators, including the multinational Serco, which will help build and run Australia’s biggest correctional facility in Grafton, NSW. For Eileen Baldry, a leading criminologist and University of New South Wales deputy vice-chancellor, it’s a hard-headed approach, one that sucks up billions of dollars that could otherwise go towards addressing the root causes of criminality through early intervention, diversion, prevention or rehabilitation programs. Baldry says prison overcrowding is a product of failed political leadership, and shows governments are unable to withstand the populist compulsion to incarcerate and appear tough on crime. “I think it’s also a failure of intellectual or evidence-based leadership,” Baldry says. “I have talked to a number of treasurers over decades in NSW, for example, and laid out in front of them the cost of doing this. “In many ways, many people in the public service understand this and do put these kinds of arguments forward. But, you know, treasurers and other ministers, when I talk to them, and this is both sides of politics, they say, ‘Look, I know that, I understand that, but it will just not fly with the public. It just will not fly with the cabinet.’” Berrima’s jail is a literal stone’s throw from the village pub. One can sit, beer in hand, admiring the golden wash of its sandstone walls, wondering what those on the other side must make of the sounds of the hotel’s drunken revelry. Most locals here welcomed the decision to reopen it, according to the Berrima residents association president, Eric Savage. The inmates work in the community and the continued usage protects and preserves the historic building. “If it wasn’t a prison, it may be open to development,” Savage explains. “Now Berrima is a very important historic place … so development pressures are something we’re very worried about.” To experts like Baldry, the reopening of old prisons like Berrima is a sign that Australian governments are continuing down a well-trodden road of failure in criminal justice. Even in 1937, a short history of Berrima’s prison described it as a “grim relic of the past”. Much of its history had involved the cruel and degrading treatment of prisoners, beginning with the convict labour used to quarry sandstone in the 1830s. The workers were shackled by their ankles as they worked under British guard. William Ullathorne, a Catholic bishop from England, gave a graphic description of their condition. “They are fettered with heavy chains, harassed with heavy work, and fed on salt meat and coarse bread,” he said. “Their faces are awful to behold, and their existence one of desperation.” In 1843, a man thought to be mad was detained in Berrima on accusations he had murdered a Bungendore police constable. To test his sanity, prison authorities flogged him, starved him and kept him in a dark cell, before stretching his naked body in a spreadeagled position using ring bolts. He was kept in the position for two days. The man later confessed to a murder. It was the wrong one. He said he’d killed Napoleon Bonaparte. The man was declared insane and sent to an asylum. It’s ancient history now. But some experts believe this obsession with punishment, regardless of its efficacy in preventing offending and reoffending, has not left the Australian approach to criminal justice. “Virtually all of our governments are kind of punishment-oriented, or lock-them-up oriented,” Baldry said. “They seem to be driven by the belief that the general population requires them to lock everybody up. That it gives people in the population a sense of safety. “This is nothing new, this has been going on for decades. And of course the reality is that this is not the case.” The current approach is simply not working to prevent the same people from committing more crime. The recidivism rate in Australia has continued to increase, as we lock more and more people up. In 2015-16, 44.6% of all Australian prisoners returned to jail within two years of release. That is up from 39.5% in 2011-12, according to the Productivity Commission. Attempts to find alternatives to imprisonment have met with early success. In NSW, a policy of justice reinvestment has been trialled in the small town of Bourke, the first major trial of its kind in the country. It’s aim is to address the strong correlation between disadvantage and the high rates of young people in the criminal justice system, particularly young Indigenous Australians. The program, run by the independent not-for-profit Just Reinvest NSW, redirects prison spending to fund community services and support. The money is used, for example, to build trust between community and the police, and to help young people avoid breaching bail. Former NSW director of public prosecutions, Nicholas Cowdrey, is one of those championing justice reinvestment. He is lobbying the NSW government to invest in the program in the 2018-19 budget. He agrees the overcrowding problem is a failure of political leadership, and an inability to see past short-term electoral cycles. “Sensible policy, especially in this area, takes more than three or four years to bear fruit and politicians prefer to stick with the tried and tested approach of ‘tough on crime,’” Cowdrey said. “There doesn’t seem to be much room for ‘smart on crime’. The community bears the cost and the consequences of such tunnel-visioned policy.” Prison has long been considered an option of last resort in the criminal justice system. But Cowdrey believes it is no longer being applied in that way. The rising incarceration rate, he said, is largely a product of increases to maximum sentences and tougher restrictions on bail. “Despite the lip service paid to the requirement that imprisonment be the punishment of last resort, it is not so used,” he said. Quite aside from the cost, judges and magistrates understand the impact imprisonment can have on an individual’s prospects for rehabilitation. Repeated studies, including one on NSW offenders, have suggested the crimogenic tendencies of prisons. In other words, sending someone to prison can increase their chance of reoffending. It can connect them with more hardened criminals, isolate them from their friends and family, and end their employment prospects. This becomes particularly problematic when one considers the impact of holding prisoners on remand. The latest data shows 33% of Australia’s prison population, or 13,182 people, is unsentenced. The number of people on remand has grown exponentially in recent years, a sign that more people are being refused bail or are being kept inside longer owing to court delays. The rates are particularly bad for Indigenous prisoners. In 2014 the rate of unsentenced Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander prisoners was 568.5 for every 100,000 people. That jumped to 773 prisoners for every 100,000 people by the third quarter of 2017. In some cases, the consequences of prison overcrowding can be disastrous. It can force the mixing of prisoner classifications, including the mixing of sentenced and unsentenced prisoners. Steven Freeman, 25, was an Indigenous man who was taken into custody in the ACT, which has just one prison for all classification types, aside from juveniles. The overcrowding crisis at the ACT’s jail was reaching its crescendo when Freeman was denied bail when charged with a string of crimes in April 2015. Freeman, like many others on remand, was placed with sentenced prisoners. He was beaten within four hours of arriving. The attack was so severe that he was placed in an induced coma for a week. His family begged the courts not to send him back to prison. They feared he would not leave the place alive. Their fears appear to have been well-founded. Roughly a year later, Freeman would die while in custody owing to a methadone overdose."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/22/friday-briefing-division-reigns-in-catalonia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T06:33:11Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: division reigns in Catalonia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/22/friday-briefing-division-reigns-in-catalonia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/22/friday-briefing-division-reigns-in-catalonia","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: division reigns in Catalonia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: separatist parties win most seats Good morning everyone, Graham Russell here with the final morning briefing of 2017. Its government was sacked, its leading figures were thrown in prison and its supporters were beaten by police yet Catalonia’s secessionist push appears as strong as ever. Last night three separatist parties won a total of 70 seats in the 135-seat regional parliament, retaining their majority if they can form a coalition. The centre-right, pro-unionist Citizens party was however the single biggest winner in the election, taking 36 seats. The result – you can see a full breakdown here – is a major blow for Spain and the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, who used article 155 of the constitution to seize control of the region after its unilateral independence referendum. Speaking from Brussels, the deposed Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, said: “As Catalan president I wish to congratulate people for delivering an indisputable result. We have won this election in exceptional circumstances, with candidates in prison, with the government in exile and without having the same resources as the state.” However, Inés Arrimadas, the leader of the Catalan Citizens party, said of its strong showing: “We have sent a message to the world that a majority in Catalonia is in favour of the union with Spain. For the first time, a constitutionalist party has won a Catalan election.” Much will now depend on what the pro-independence parties agree. Puigdemont still faces arrest if he returns to Spain. * * * Cold shoulder for surgery patients – Tens of thousands of patients in England have had their surgery pushed back into the new year as the NHS seeks to avoid a winter meltdown. The only exceptions are cancer operations and “time-critical procedures”. Trusts that are already struggling have been told to convert clinics and day-surgery areas into makeshift wards to avoid running out of space when the winter weather starts to bite. Theresa May has made the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, “personally responsible” for how the service performs this winter. Last year, a winter crisis led the British Red Cross to declare “a humanitarian crisis”. * * * The most awful time of the year – Shortly before the good bit (the Christmas holiday) comes the bad bit (the journey there). Motorists have been advised to leave before lunch today or face one of the worst travel days of the year. More than a million motorists are expected on the roads, with holidaymakers combining with commuters, fog and train strikes to create merry hell. The M25 tops the blackspot list, along with the M6 between Merseyside and Staffordshire, plus the M1 and M4. And don’t forget the the A303 around Stonehenge: beautiful but you risk having plenty of time to admire it. * * * Cyber war games – The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, is to tell his Russian counterpart the UK will retaliate in kind if Russia continues to use cyber-attacks to disrupt the west. “I can assure you that the UK is a world leader in this field. We don’t conduct malign or disruptive cyberactivity, but the logic of deterrence is clearly something we appreciate in the cyber field,” he said during his visit to Moscow to met Sergei Lavrov. “There are areas in which Russia is behaving in a more hostile way towards our interests than at any time since the end of the cold war. I will make clear to Lavrov that there are things that we find extremely difficult to accept, and we can’t accept.” * * * The price of Jerusalem – The UN general assembly has voted overwhelmingly to reject Donald Trump’s unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, further isolating the US and discomforting America’s closest Middle East ally. Yet, as our diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, explains, this could turn into an expensive symbolic clash for the UN as a whole. In 2016, the US was its largest donor, contributing more than $10bn (£7.5bn) – roughly one-fifth of its collective budget. Of this, $6bn was voluntary. * * * ‘Madam Brexit’ – What does Brexit mean? Well Theresa May has found that to some it’s just a name, or rather a surname. During the prime minister’s trip to Warsaw for talks with Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki, the translator described her as “Madam Brexit”, drawing a smile from May. * * * Warren, Martin and my good self will brush off the mince pie crumbs and detach ourselves from the sofa to bring you the next briefing early in the new year.

Lunchtime read: winter in one of Greece’s worst refugee camps For the men, women and children forced to call Moria on the island of Lesbos their home, life in the refugee camp is a daily battle for survival in conditions so desperate even the Greek migration minister has warned they could be life-threatening. Most of its nearly 6,000 occupants live in flimsy tents and their only preparation for winter has involved using wooden pallets to elevate tarpaulins above the mud. For human rights groups, the vastly overcrowded camp is a tragedy waiting to happen and an embarrassment for Europe. “I’ve run out of ways of describing conditions that are beyond deplorable,” says the mayor of Lesbos, Spyros Galinos. “I recently compared what they are doing here to Guantánamo but of course I’ve never been to Guantánamo. Perhaps concentration camp would be better.” Sport “Our sin? We appeared to take our task at Fifa too seriously.” Miguel Poiares Maduro, Navi Pillay and Joseph Weiler were enlisted to help clean up football’s governing body after years of scandal, but now they say their path was blocked. The England and Lions three-quarter Elliot Daly will miss the Six Nations Championship after sustaining an ankle injury playing for Wasps last weekend that will rule him out for three months, even though he may not need surgery. Brisbane International tennis organisers are confident Andy Murray will play in their tournament, which starts on New Year’s Day, despite media reports that the British No1 might struggle to make that date owing to his well-publicised hip problem. And Peter Wright firmly brushed aside any fitness concerns as he beat Diogo Portela in the first round of the William Hill World Championship at Alexandra Palace.

The papers The papers today are a mix of love and loathing, with the official Prince Harry and Meghan Markle engagement photographs sitting next to splashes about a backlash against police over the leak revealing details of pornography on Damian Green’s computer, Russian hacking and a struggling NHS. The Guardian has a bleak story about the NHS postponing thousands of surgeries to avoid a winter crisis, alongside Theresa May’s pain at having to sack Green, a lifelong friend. The Telegraph and Times both lead on criticism of the officers who brought down the former first secretary of state, with Boris Johnson weighing in in the Telegraph, claiming police had a vendetta against him. Johnson is also on the front of the Mail, warning Russia that Britain is ready to “hit back” against the Kremlin’s cyber warriors.

The void will never be filled completely but the addiction continues and must be satisfied. That is why, despite feeling he has aged considerably during six months in charge of Liverpool Under-18s, nothing has doused his ambition to descend into “the madness” of top-level management. The cravings clearly remain in the 37-year-old as he laments the absence of training from his Christmas Day routine. “I actually miss it,” he says, sipping an orange juice on a miserable December day at Liverpool’s academy in Kirkby. “It only used to be an hour and I only like Christmas Eve anyway. The rest is too long. I’d hate it if there was no football now for a few weeks.” What is also clear is that Gerrard’s appointment as under-18s manager came without privileges. The job is not about Liverpool indulging their illustrious former captain but, with Jürgen Klopp’s instruction, ensuring he has the best possible grounding before returning to the spotlight as a manager, wherever that may be. It has been a challenging, rewarding introduction. “I’m definitely feeling it,” Gerrard says. “I’ve aged about two years in six months. Jürgen’s advice when I came back was: ‘I only want you to shadow for a short time because you need to have a couple of years of making mistakes, of picking your own team, of deciding tactics. You need to find your philosophy, a way of playing, you need to deal with individual problems, you need to praise individuals, help individuals, you need to feel disappointment and setbacks and then after a couple of years you’ll know if this gig is for you.’ He painted a real picture of how it is. “For the last five months I’ve felt all the highs and lows and experienced all the daily stuff that managers deal with, albeit at youth-team level. It will definitely prepare me for wherever I end up. It is not scaring me or putting me off. I know the further I go there is more scrutiny, more attention, more opinions, more criticism, more praise. I get all that. For me it was important to get a taste of it away from the cameras and experience all these things before you go into the madness.” The latest chapter in Gerrard’s Liverpool career consumes him, just like the one before. He works six days a week at the academy – “I had to show the players my work ethic was right and get their trust,” he explains – and the demands have been an eye-opening experience. Top of that list is, he says: “The hours you have to put in.” Gerrard explains: “As a player I could switch off when the game was done. That is very difficult as a coach. That has been the main difference. Now after a game I’m thinking what went well, what didn’t go well, what individuals do I need to work on this week, who do I need to praise, who do I need to speak to, who’s been naughty at school? Having to handle that side of it has been very different for me, not that I was an angel at school, but we have a guy here, Phil Roscoe, who works on the education and welfare side of things and he is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. I would be lost if I didn’t have Phil’s help and support. The staff have been a huge help. “There is a lot more to it than you think when you’re a player. I have more respect for coaches and managers now even though as a player I always respected the ones I worked with. I didn’t realise how much was involved in their roles until I tried it myself.” Gerrard also manages the under-19s in the Uefa Youth League where, in both matches against Spartak Moscow this season, he had to deal with Liverpool players being racially abused; Bobby Adekanye in Moscow, Rhian Brewster in the return at Prenton Park. “I’ve had experience in my playing career of team-mates being subjected to that abuse,” he says, “but when it is your player and you are leading the team it is a real eye-opener and a learning experience. I care for these kids, they are playing for my club, they are playing for my team. I need to show them support and I will do.” What Liverpool’s former midfielder does not show players is footage of himself in action. Gerrard is acutely aware of the pitfalls that can await top players who turn to management and discover, to their detriment, that the next generation are not up to their own exalted standards. He therefore made a conscious decision to separate Gerrard the Champions League-winning captain from Gerrard the fledgling coach. “I never bring up my playing days and I never bring up footage of when I was involved,” he says. “If I want to show them something tactically I’ll always use Liverpool’s first team now or someone else’s first team now. I don’t think it’s right to say: ‘Look at this’ and I’m running around. Don’t get me wrong, if there’s something blatantly obvious that happened to me – good or bad – and I thought it’d benefit them, then I’m not going to hide it from them. But I just don’t think it’s right to be saying: ‘Look at what I done and look what we did’. My career as a player is gone. It’s about what’s happening tomorrow, not yesterday.” The approach has paid dividends though Gerrard is wary of premature praise. As he points out: “You get nothing at Christmas apart from a pat on the back.” At least a pat is deserved. Liverpool sit top of the Premier League under-18s table having maintained their unbeaten campaign with a 2-1 win at Wolves. They trailed 1-0 with five minutes to go before staging a Gerrard-like recovery. “I made a mistake in that game that nearly cost us points,” he admits. What was it? “I can’t tell you. One of the reasons I decided to take this job was that I could make mistakes without getting judged in every newspaper and social media site.” Gerrard’s under-19s topped their Uefa Youth League group with five wins from six games, cruising into the last 16 with a seven-point advantage over Spartak in second. Gerrard says: “I’m not one of those academy people who say it is all about development and results don’t matter. You’ve got to teach players about winning, about what you’ve got to do to win and create that attitude and that mentality that surround the club. You can’t say to a player at 18 years of age: ‘It’s all about winning now, it wasn’t from seven to 17.’ Of course it is about winning. If you asked me whether I wanted to win the league or get two players through to the first team, I’d say getting the players into the first team. Really I want both.” Liverpool’s decorated academy graduate believes it is harder for today’s generation to succeed as Premier League players. “Clubs are a lot richer so can go out and buy players for big money,” he says. “Ten or 15 years ago you could get through if you were a decent footballer. Now you’ve got to be sensational to get in and stay in. I look at the players on the fringes like Brewster, [Manchester City’s Phil] Foden and [Dominic] Solanke. They are good but can they go to the next level so that when they get in, they stay in? The standards are higher than they were all those years back.” As for his next step, Gerrard will explore options with Klopp, academy director Alex Inglethorpe and others at the end of the season. “I’m not sitting here thinking I’ve done it for five months so bring the job interviews on,” he says. “In six months or a year or two years’ time there might be an opportunity where I think I’m much better prepared than I was five months ago. The MK Dons job, for example, which came up just after I had finished playing, was like a smack in the face. There was no way I was ready to lead a club or a team. Am I closer to that now? Of course, but I am happy where I am right now. “I could get a first-team job and get sacked after four or five games. It might put me off for life. I might take my first job and win a league and that might set me up for the next 10 or 20 years. I can’t predict the future. All I can do is make myself as prepared as I can be for whatever roles I take down the line. In a year’s time I might have three opportunities and three of them might not be here. I can’t sit here and say ‘Oh no, I only want to work for Liverpool Football Club’. In an ideal, perfect world everyone knows what I want but right now it’s not worth thinking about.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/27/the-year-in-nazi-propaganda-images-of-white-supremacy-in-trumps-america","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T12:24:01Z","webTitle":"The year in Nazi propaganda: images of white supremacy in Trump's America","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/27/the-year-in-nazi-propaganda-images-of-white-supremacy-in-trumps-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/27/the-year-in-nazi-propaganda-images-of-white-supremacy-in-trumps-america","fields":{"headline":"The year in Nazi propaganda: images of white supremacy in Trump's America","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In May, a few dozen white supremacists gathered after dark in a park in Charlottesville, Virginia. They had brought garden torches and candles, and they set them aflame while posing in front of a statue of confederate general Robert E Lee that Charlottesville was trying to remove. The demonstration in front of the statue lasted about 10 minutes, according to one local report. But before the police arrived and dispersed the provocateurs, who were led by Richard Spencer, a white nationalist most famous for getting punched in the face, the flames had attracted the attention of local TV news cameras and a local newspaper reporter, who took a photograph of the men with their flaming torches and shared it on Twitter. The photo, with the outline of the slave-owning general rising out of the smoke, was widely republished around the world. The May torch rally was one of the first of a series of increasingly violent white supremacist provocations that culminated in an 12 August rally that brought hundreds of white supremacists to march in the streets of Charlottesville and engage in open clashes with counter-protesters. By the afternoon, a car attack on peaceful demonstrators left 32-year-old Heather Heyer dead and dozens more injured. A young white man who marched with the white nationalists was charged with murder. The violence in Charlottesville forced city leaders and law enforcement officials to re-examine what they did, and failed to do, to prevent neo-Nazis from terrorizing an entire town. The city’s police chief resigned in December after a public report faulted the police for making choices that failed to keep the city safe. Media organizations have faced their own reckoning over their coverage of white supremacist groups. Some critics have argued that it is dangerous and unnecessary to give fringe racists prominent coverage, and that simply ignoring their public stunts would be a safer choice. Others have argued that in a country where the president responded to a violence neo-Nazi march by condemning the violence of “both sides,” and suggested that there were “very fine people” who marched alongside the Nazis, media organizations have treated open white supremacists too much as freaks or aberrations, failing to investigate their ties to America’s systemic racism and its more circumspect and powerful racists. For the past year, news organizations have struggled to strike the right balance: when is covering of fringe far-right groups necessary, and when does coverage serve only to heighten the profile, and the influence, of conspiracy theorists and racist extremists? The coverage of the August rallies in Charlottesville – which clearly documented the extremism and the violence of white supremacist groups – was widely seen as newsworthy. On 11 August, a coalition of white supremacists led a larger torch march across the University of Virginia’s campus, chanting “You will not replace us!” and “Jews will not replace us!” By August, the young white men with torches were not posing briefly in the shadows. They were marching so openly that they could be easily identified – and many were, prompting some families and employers to publicly repudiate their racist advocacy. But the photograph of the earlier torch protest in May, which was reproduced almost universally by major news outlets, including The Guardian, provides a more complex case study in the difficulties of covering media-savvy extremists. The May rally clearly invoked the flaming torches wielded by the Ku Klux Klan, even though Spencer tried to claim in an interview that the torches were simply “a beautiful aesthetic” and “kind of mystical”. It was an image of resurgent racist violence, and it spoke to one of the biggest news stories of the year, the way that Donald Trump’s presidency had energized far-right racist groups. The photograph was also an expert piece of white supremacist propaganda, an image staged by a racist provocateur to generate exactly the kind of media coverage that it received, said Joan Donovan, a researcher at the Data and Society Institute who studies media manipulation. By spreading that image across the world, Donovan argues, news organizations were not simply covering white supremacists, they were amplifying their message – and helping to fuel their later protests. Jessie Daniels, a sociologist who has studied American white supremacist groups for decades, said she believes it was important for news organizations to feature the May photo of the torch protest around the Lee statue in Charlottesville. “Run the photo. How could you not?” she said. “To me, it makes the case that this is dangerous, that they’re dangerous, that they’re a threat to a democracy and a threat to other people.” Michael Shaw, the publisher and founder of Reading the Pictures, a site that analyzes news photos and media images, drew a similar conclusion. Shaw has repeatedly criticized media images that present neo-Nazi activists as just ordinary folks, which he calls “mainstreaming hate by casting it in a softer light”. Unlike feature stories about the everyday lives of neo-Nazis, the image of a torch-wielding mob clearly invoked white supremacists groups’ long history of terrorism and murder. What was essential about the Charlottesville photo from May, Shaw said, is its context and its timing. The torch protest was not a random provocation. It came after a victorious presidential campaign fueled by nationalistic and xenophobic rhetoric, after the White House’s immediate move to temporarily ban visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries, and after repeated celebrations of Trump’s presidency by neo-Nazi and white supremacist leaders. A gathering of white men with torches to deliberately invoke Klan violence “is an extraordinary, incendiary scene”, Shaw said. “The fact that they felt like they could really do that in an open way – I think it had to be covered.” But analysts like Donovan, who study how news coverage fuels extremist movements, pose thorny questions about the impact of disseminating images of carefully staged white supremacist protests, no matter how newsworthy they might be. The issue here is the effect of “amplifying” white supremacist images and messages across major media channels, even if the images were presented with the appropriate context, highlighting their inherent threat of violence. Did the major media coverage the May photograph received embolden and energize white nationalist activists? Was the widespread news coverage of the May photograph even a factor in making the August rallies there so large, so intense, and ultimately so violent? White nationalists and neo-Nazis greeted the media attention to the May photograph as a victory, and reportedly cited the coverage of the photograph as an inspiration as they planned a much larger rally in August, Donovan said, based on leaked “Unite the Right” planning messages. “They’re saying in their conference call and in their email messages, in their Facebook posts and podcasts, ‘We’re going to do a torch march, we’re going to do something similar to what we did that got all that attention in May,’” Donovan said. The racist organizers were “depending on the media” to want to reemphasize that shocking photo “and give more attention to them”, she said. In the civil rights era, detailed media coverage of lunch counter sit-ins to protest racial segregation was an important vehicle for spreading sit-in tactics from one town to the next, Donovan said. As she put it, “The press is always implicated – and has always been implicated – in recruitment for all movements.” One of the things that’s different about white supremacist organizing – a political movement with a history of murder and genocide – is that their protests are designed to spread fear as well as awareness, Donovan said. “Those photos are terrifying. They’re staged to look intimidating, and that’s where the trouble really lies,” Donovan said. “Taking the picture and placing it on the front page of the news and circulating it online is amplifying that terror.” Since the violence in Charlottesville, Spencer has focused on events at university campuses, where the universities have been forced to pay for elaborate security measures, and in “flash mob” events, where he and his followers show up briefly, take photographs to share on social media, and then vanish. He staged one of these flash mobs in Charlottesville in October, which was again widely covered by media outlets, though this torchlight rally again lasted only minutes. Donovan said she hopes media organizations will develop a consensus around what to do with carefully staged scenes of white supremacist protest – perhaps a consensus not to publish certain kinds of images, something media outlets have done in other contexts. Back in May, she suggested, news editors could have chosen to run an article about the white nationalist protest in Charlottesville without using the provocative and frightening and iconic photo. They might also have decided that a brief rally by a small group of white nationalists in a local park was not international news. “How many rallies have happened in that park that nobody’s covered before or since then?” she said. Charlottesville’s mayor, Mike Signer, has long denounced Richard Spencer as an attention-seeking troll. But he said that the May torch protest photograph also captured a day of real fear and anxiety for Charlottesville citizens. While it was clear that the mainstream media could sometimes be used an “an instrument for trolls and terrorists”, Signer said, there was no “clear cut” answer for what coverage would transcend trolling. “It’s not for me to lecture them on how to do it,” the mayor said. “It’s just a clear challenge.” “I think we all are involved in a complicated struggle right now which is to denounce hatred and elevate unity while also not allowing ourselves to be trolled,” he told The Guardian. “The mainstream media has a choice whether they’re being used for this sort of trolling.” After the white supremacist violence in August, Charlottesville staged counter-protests, with hundreds of people lifting up candles instead of torches. The street where Heather Heyer died, now dedicated to her, was covered with messages praising Heyer’s heroism in marching against white supremacy: “Heyer Purpose.” “You magnified her.” “Love will prevail.” A month after she was killed, local Charlottesville businesses displayed signs emblazoned with Heather’s name inside a heart. Her face and her name have become powerful icons used globally in the fight against white supremacy and neo-Nazi groups. When Spencer spoke at the University of Florida this fall, an audience members asked him about his responsibility for Heyer’s death. “It’s your fault!” the crowd chanted. “It’s your fault.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/21/long-stay-liverpool-all-party-support-jurgen-klopp","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T22:30:36Z","webTitle":"Long stay at Liverpool would need all-party support, says Jürgen Klopp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/21/long-stay-liverpool-all-party-support-jurgen-klopp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/21/long-stay-liverpool-all-party-support-jurgen-klopp","fields":{"headline":"Long stay at Liverpool would need all-party support, says Jürgen Klopp","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp has said he hopes to be “the perfect fit” for Liverpool for many years but could leave after winning a trophy unless there remains room for improvement at Anfield. The Liverpool manager served seven years at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund, his only previous managerial roles, and could do likewise on Merseyside having signed a contract extension to 2022. Klopp believes another long reign is possible with Liverpool but, reflecting on criticism of Arsène Wenger, whom he faces at Arsenal on Friday, he insists all parties must be committed to an extended stay. “I think Arsène gets a lot of criticism,” he said. “I’ve seen it since I’ve been in England and for sure it’s not right. He’s still there and he’s doing a brilliant job again. Top five, six, fighting for fourth and being involved in different cup competitions – he’s obviously still very ambitious and as long as you feel that, you can stay. “If you are the only part who likes it, that’s wrong. It needs to be a perfect fit. We feel that here at this moment and I’m sure for the next few years but you cannot force anything to happen. It needs to feel right for everybody. It feels really good at the moment and hopefully it can stay like that long term.” Klopp doubts it will be possible to replicate the longevity of Wenger or Sir Alex Ferguson in the current Premier League era. He would, however, be content to remain at Liverpool for as long as he felt improvement in the team was possible. He said: “Could I stay here 20 years? I don’t know. So far after seven years I’ve felt maybe I should move on. A few weeks ago I saw a statistic for the longest-serving coaches in the Bundesliga and I’m the record coach at two clubs: Mainz and Dortmund. “It would be quite difficult to become the record coach at Liverpool. [I plan to stay] as long as it works really, really well. That means as long as there is space for improvement, because even if you win something, which everyone here is desperately waiting for, it could be the moment I say: ‘OK, but now we have to leave it.’ “So far I think I have a very good feeling for these moments. In both situations I think it was the right moment for both parties, the clubs and me. I don’t feel I am close to that moment and everything is fine but if anyone thinks they can make a career similar to Alex Ferguson or Arsène Wenger at a club, I’m not sure it would be possible with the media of today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/radical-conservation/2017/dec/22/failing-our-forests-in-two-years-weve-lost-enough-trees-to-cover-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T13:16:14Z","webTitle":"Failing our forests: in two years we’ve lost enough trees to cover Spain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2017/dec/22/failing-our-forests-in-two-years-weve-lost-enough-trees-to-cover-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/radical-conservation/2017/dec/22/failing-our-forests-in-two-years-weve-lost-enough-trees-to-cover-spain","fields":{"headline":"Failing our forests: in two years we’ve lost enough trees to cover Spain","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Two years ago the world signed the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. It included specific pledges to “conserve and enhance” the world’s forests in order to combat rising temperatures. But in the last two years – 2015 and 2016 – we’ve lost enough trees to cover 493,716 square kilometres, according to satellite data recently released by Global Forest Watch (GFW). This is nearly equal to the entirety of Spain – or about four Englands. Currently, deforestation accounts for around 10-15% of annual global carbon emissions. Even as combating deforestation has long been seen as one of the cheapest ways to tackle global warming, GFW’s data shows just how far we have to go. “Forests are fundamentally hard to protect – they are in remote frontiers or in countries with weak governance,” said Liz Goldman, a Research Associate at GFW. But she added that the rising forest loss “doesn’t mean deforestation pledges are not having an impact – many of these agreements are still at an early stage.” 2015 – The assault on New Guinea In 2015, the world lost enough trees to blanket 198,295 square kilometres, an area around the size of Uganda. On the plus side, this was a slight dip from the year before. But it still represented a worldwide trend of rising deforestation since GFW started tracking tree loss in 2001 – even as governments and corporations (increasingly and repeatedly) pledged to do something about it. Arguably, the most shocking data in 2015 came from the island of New Guinea, which is considered the third largest block of intact rainforest on the planet, after the increasingly fractured Amazon and the Congo. Deforestation on the island jumped an astounding 70% in 2015, threatening the island’s thousands of species found no-where else – think birds of paradise and tree kangaroos – and its local people who have lived closely tied to the forests around them for millennia. The island of New Guinea is split into two distinct political entities. The western half is a remote – but large and rich in natural resources – region of Indonesia, governed by faraway Jakarta. The eastern half of the island is its own country, Papua New Guinea. Both areas, however, saw significant jumps in forest loss beginning in 2015. “Visual inspection of the data shows that industrial agriculture and logging are the major players in Papua,” Mikaela Weisse, a Research Analyst with GFW, said. “Data from Greenpeace Indonesia shows that 48 palm oil companies have permits in Indonesian Papua, some as large as 45,000 hectares.” The satellite imagery shows what many have long warned: that the island of New Guinea has become the newest frontier for forest destruction. Logging and palm oil companies, among others, are infiltrating the island, viewing it as a lucrative place to expand operations in an increasingly resource-scarce planet. The numbers in 2016 were hardly any better for New Guinea. Tree loss dipped slightly in Papua New Guinea but rose in Indonesian Papua – potentially pointing to a new trend of high deforestation across one of the most intact tropical forests we have left. 2016 – World aflame As bad as 2015 was for the world’s forests, last year was far, far worse. In 2016, tree loss jumped 51% globally from the year before taking out a total of 297,000 square kilometres. “Clearly this is a sign that we need to do more,” said Goldman. Experts at GFW say the jump in 2016 was driven largely by one thing: fire. In temperate forests, fire is often a natural part of the ecosystem’s life cycle and can even bring about renewal to forests. But fire has no place in tropical forests where it is nearly always caused by humans trying to clear land for planting. “These large-scale fires [in the tropics]…damage the forests’ natural structure, affect the habitats of plant and wildlife, and release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air,” said Goldman. Such fires can even lead to international crises. In 2015, blazes across Indonesia resulted in a toxic haze that at times covered several Southeast Asian neighbours, cost up to $35 billion and, according to one analysis, likely lead to the premature deaths of 100,000 people due to respiratory issues. Indonesia– which has taken the unenviable spot of the world’s largest forest destroyer from Brazil –has tried for years to combat such fires. In 2011 Indonesia installed a moratorium on new logging or plantation concessions on primary forest and peatlands. But it’s not proven as successful as hoped, according to many experts. “Our data show that the moratorium has not had much of an impact on forest protection,” said Weisse. “Forest loss within moratorium areas has continued to increase in 2015 in all areas except Sumatra, which [has] little primary forest left.” She added the moratorium may be ineffectual because it’s essentially toothless. Companies defying the moratorium don’t face “legal consequences,” according to Weisse. Already, some are warning that Indonesia won’t be able to meet its climate pledges which hinge largely on reducing deforestation. Today, even fires in temperate areas – see California’s epic conflagrations this year – appear to be exacerbated by rising temperatures worldwide. “There is mounting scientific evidence that climate change is heating up our forests,” Goldman said. Hotter, drier forests are more prone to fire and harder to put out. It was no coincidence that 2016 was not only a major fire year, but also the warmest year on record. Moreover, the constant cuts we are making into intact forests are leaving them more vulnerable. Decades of research shows that forest fragments are hotter, drier and more prone to fire than intact forests. “There is increasing evidence that climate change, coupled with land use change and fire could lead to forest dieback in places like the Amazon,” said Goldman. Already, we have lost around one third of the Amazon Rainforest to deforesters like the cattle and soy industries. Experts increasingly believe that regional rainfall in Brazil is being negatively impacted by carving away at the world’s greatest tropical forest. After peaking in 2004, deforestation slowed in Brazil. Indeed, Brazil’s successful efforts in stemming deforestation have long been pointed to as one of the major wins in combating climate change and protecting forests. 2016 changed that. A new government in Brazil views the Amazon not as a region worth protecting, but largely as a resource to exploit. Last year saw forest destruction rise in Brazil to the highest level yet measured by GFW, easily eclipsing 2004. Whether this is a one-off incident or a new trend remains to be seen. Together Brazil and Indonesia accounted for nearly a quarter of all forest loss last year. Prioritising forests GFW – which is run by a partnership of University of Maryland, Google and the World Resources Institute – analyses satellite data to track tree loss worldwide at a scale of 30x30 metres. They state that they do not measure true deforestation – the loss of forest to human activities – but tree loss. “We refer to the data on GFW as tree cover loss because it can’t distinguish plantations from natural forest, or human-caused forest loss from natural loss,” said Weisse. In other words, to a satellite natural forests and plantations look the same. So, when a plantation is cleared, GFW measures that as tree loss, even though it will shortly be replanted. However, GFW is working on changing how to tracks tree loss. The group has developed a map of primary forests versus plantations for Indonesia in order to come up with more accurate numbers of forest destruction in the country. Despite current limitations, the GFW has become instrumental in measuring our impact on the world’s forests, even in near real-time in some places. The Food and Agriculture Organization also tracks deforestation, claiming in 2015 that deforestation had slowed worldwide. However the FAO, a UN agency, depends on self-reporting from each country, leading to different measurements in different places and a dependence on self-reporting. The FAO also counts monoculture plantations – such as pulp and paper and rubber (though not oil palm) – as forest, despite the fact that ecologists have been arguing for years that monoculture plantations are in no-way true forests. “They’re about as biologically similar to native forests as my front lawn,” William Laurence, a forest ecologist at James Cook University, said last year in Ensia. Plantations contain fewer species, retain significantly less carbon, and often result in soil erosion and water pollution from inputs of herbicides and pesticides. “The truth is that neither GFW nor FAO is perfect or complete, and each has their strengths and shortcomings,” said Weisse. “Rather than see the two systems as contradictory, we believe that we need to rely on both sources to have a complete understanding of the world’s forests.” The ongoing scale of forest loss means that far more action is required, according to Goldman and Weisse. They say that nations and corporations need to speed up the process of decoupling deforestation from commodity supply chains like beef, palm oil, rubber and wood. At the same time, governments must increase enforcement efforts on-the-ground and make sure companies that defy laws and regulations are adequately punished. Finally, local and indigenous communities need to be given rights to their traditional land. Research has shown that the best forest protectors are indigenous groups – so long as they have secure rights to the forests they depend on. But first the world really has to make forests a priority, and not just another issue drowned in meetings, proposals and pledges. Governments have to stop paying lip service while turning a blind eye and more forest funding is needed from wealthy nations. “We want to do more than watch [forests] disappear,” said Weisse. “Our hope is that governments, companies, and civil society organisations can use the information we provide on when and where forests are changing to make better decisions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/21/stalls-handler-used-syringe-wolverhampton-arena-racing-company-bha","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T18:42:15Z","webTitle":"Stalls handler had used syringe in hand before start of Wolverhampton race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/21/stalls-handler-used-syringe-wolverhampton-arena-racing-company-bha","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/21/stalls-handler-used-syringe-wolverhampton-arena-racing-company-bha","fields":{"headline":"Stalls handler had used syringe in hand before start of Wolverhampton race","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A stalls handler produced a used syringe from his pocket as the runners approached the starting stalls moments before a race, the Guardian can reveal. The incident, which raises fresh concern over racecourse security, happened at Wolverhampton in early 2014 and was dealt with quietly by the Arena Racing Company (ARC), on the grounds that the handler concerned had made a mistake and did not intend to affect any of the horses with which he was working. The handler, whose name is known to the Guardian, told his stunned colleagues that he had been working with sheep that morning. It is believed the syringe, which was intended for oral dosing and had no needle, had been used to administer a worming medication. “I’ve worked in the industry all my life and I couldn’t believe it,” said Don Corr, who was also working as a stalls handler that day. “I went to the team leader and said: ‘Bloody hell, that guy’s got a syringe in his pocket.’ You just don’t do it. “It was the seven-furlong chute. We were waiting at the back of the stalls and the horses were on their way down. There were cameras on us.” Corr says the starter and assistant starter, who are employed by the British Horseracing Authority, were at the start but did not see the incident and were not made aware of it. The ARC, which employs stalls handlers at a number of its tracks including Wolverhampton, confirmed on Thursday night that the incident had occurred and the man in question had been given a verbal warning. The incident appears especially relevant in the week of the BHA’s Hughie Morrison hearing, which has been puzzling over the question of how an anabolic steroid could have got into the low-rated filly Our Little Sister. Morrison has suggested she could have been “got at” while away from his yard at a racecourse, a line of inquiry which BHA investigators were slow to pursue. For Corr and another stalls handler who witnessed the incident, the lesson to be drawn is the importance of hiring the right people. Handlers have complained before about the ARC’s hiring policies and say that standards are higher at Racetech, which employs stalls handlers at most British Flat-racing tracks. Corr said: “If you asked some of those [ARC] guys what racing yards they worked in, they couldn’t tell you. They say they have equine experience but these racehorses are different. When they come down to you at the start, they’re fire. This game is a different ball game.” He said the syringe incident illustrated “the kind of mentality of the people who have been taken on”. His colleague said: “Any racing lad would have known that was a complete no-no.” According to Corr, the handler who brought a syringe to work was subsequently made into a full-time handler by the ARC, having been working on a casual basis at the time. The ARC issued a statement saying: “This incident involved an empty plastic syringe with no needle. The incident was made aware to ARC management and was a genuine mistake by the individual involved. The safety and welfare of any horse, jockey or other person was not compromised.” It appears the matter was never reported to the BHA, whose spokesman said: “The BHA is not aware of this incident and therefore cannot comment on the specific details. More generally, when horses are down at the start of a race they are overseen by the starter and his assistant, who would be in a position to prevent or report any activity which is contrary to the rules of racing or a horse’s welfare.” Morrison expects to learn his fate on Friday morning, following a two‑day hearing this week. His barrister argued that no punishment should be imposed on an innocent man but the trainer is at risk of a ban running into several years if the panel decides he was probably to blame for the positive test.

The Tottenham Hotspur midfielder stepped up his rehabilitation after a knee injury with contact work in training and his manager, Mauricio Pochettino, said it had gone well. Tottenham were keen to avoid surgery for Wanyama and they have followed what the assistant manager, Jesús Pérez, described as a programme of “conservative measures”. They did the same thing with Danny Rose, who also had a serious knee problem but, in the end, the left-back was not able to push himself in training and he had an operation. He was out for eight and a half months. Spurs believe their decisions over Wanyama will be vindicated, even if he has not played since the second game of the season against Chelsea. The issue has been with the lining in his knee joint capsule and it first flared up during pre-season training in July. According to Pérez, Wanyama twice reported discomfort on the same day. The Kenyan travelled on the tour of the United States and he played for 45 minutes in the first friendly against Paris Saint-Germain. The knee did not feel right. Wanyama did not feature again in pre-season and he suffered a bad reaction after the Chelsea match. “He came back to training with the team on Wednesday,” Pochettino said. “Now we need to see how the knee reacts but it’s a very good feeling from him.

As the prime minister weighs up an undoubted personal loss after forcing a close friend to resign over pornography claims, MPs said she should take comfort in winning over a section of her party who want to see decisive leadership. Instead, MPs have turned their ire on the former police officers whose notes from a confidential inquiry brought down May’s de facto deputy prime minister. The first secretary of state was made to resign on Wednesday night after he was found to have misled the public with statements about pornography found on his computer in 2008. Green, 61, insisted twice last month that no pornography was discovered during a controversial police raid of his parliamentary office that year. He is said by friends to be sad but not surprised by May’s decision to ask him to resign. MPs said they were relieved that Green’s sacking was timed for Wednesday night so that the prime minister did not have to face a baying House of Commons in its aftermath – and was executed quickly. One former cabinet minister said: “She will look across that table and will no longer see a single person she can guarantee will watch her back. That is unfortunate, it is isolating, and not a problem that you can remedy easily. “However, there will be many MPs who will be glad to see her taking a bold decision and sticking to it. Damian’s sacking will play well with some members and with the electorate.” May must now decide whether to replace her longstanding ally with an individual who holds down the same two roles as Green, who was first secretary of state and Cabinet Office minister. The latter role will need to be filled, but the former – which renders the incumbent the de facto deputy prime minister – could be left vacant. Possible replacements for Green, according to party sources, include Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary; Amber Rudd, the home secretary; and David Lidington, the justice secretary, each of whom are seen as relatively safe pairs of hands. Hunt, 51, appeared to rule himself out on the Today Programme this morning by insisting he wanted to stay on in his current role. But he has gained support by managing to straddle the Brexit divide within the party. Rudd, 54, is an ally of May and a strong media performer. But as a remainer, her promotion could cause ripples among the hard Brexiteers such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson. Lidington, 61, is known to enjoy chairing meetings and getting to grips with detail – a necessary skill in Green’s former job. A reshuffle is not expected before Christmas, granting May breathing space over the festive break to consider her next moves and how extensive a shake-up she wants. There is less of a pressing need to replace Green than the other two cabinet ministers May has lost in recent weeks – the defence secretary Michael Fallon and international development secretary Priti Patel – because Green does not have the same departmental responsibilities. MPs said they hoped May would use this opportunity to bring more fresh faces in to the cabinet. One relatively new Conservative MP said May should use Green’s departure to plan a wider reshuffle and promote new people. “The cabinet team she has now is largely inherited – she’s never really had a chance to forge the team in her image,” he said. “But most important, it would give the party a shot in the arm. Theresa’s legacy will not just be Brexit, it will also be about trying to renew the party. Although we’ve had a good couple of weeks we’ve had a tough year, and she could bring new ideas and new faces.” Tory MPs, rather than turn their fire on May, have instead hit out at the two retired police officers involved in publicising the claims about pornography on Green’s computer. Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP for North East Somerset, told the Sun: “I’m deeply concerned that as far as I can tell the reason for his resignation is some questionable behaviour by retired policemen based on a deeply questionable search of his office when he was an opposition spokesman in 2008.” He added: “I think this raises more questions about how the police behaved then, and how the retired policemen behaved since, than it does about Damian Green.” Andrew Mitchell, a former cabinet minister, said: “These two admitted breaches of the ministerial code are dwarfed by the extraordinary behaviour of the police.” The Metropolitan police announced on Thursday that it had referred the leaks inquiry on to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). It concerns Neil Lewis, 48, a former detective constable who revealed this month that he had assessed the pornography on Green’s computer. Lewis spoke out to back Bob Quick, the Met’s former head of counter-terrorism, who told the Sunday Times in November that his officers had reported finding pornographic material on a computer from Green’s office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/22/good-marriage-dream-wedding-inner-barbra-streisand-middle-aged-love","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T10:00:50Z","webTitle":"My advice for a good marriage?

Don’t start with a dream wedding","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“What people fail to realise,” my newlywed friend remarked as we discussed my upcoming nuptials, “is that when women say they want to get married, they generally mean they want a wedding.” To which I would add: or security, or reassurance, or even – whisper it – status. Somewhere within a lot of young women – and we were young, barely into our 30s – there’s a Barbra Streisand singing Sadie, Sadie, Married Lady (“Oh how that marriage licence works / on chambermaids and hotel clerks”). Even if they’ve never seen Funny Girl. The trouble is that these notions of marriage are as obsolete as the wedding veil – or should be. Matrimony may make you wealthier, but the power isn’t vested in any institution to make you happier, or more secure in the psychological rather than the custodial sense. Only the right partnership can do that. And – surprise, surprise – here is a study that tells us that this is exactly what the right partnership does. Data taken from more than 350,000 people in two UK surveys, analysed by researchers from the Vancouver School of Economics, informs us that married people are happier than single ones, that those in committed relationships, even without the paperwork, are as happy as those who have put a ring on it – and that the middle-aged are the most happily hitched of all. There’s a cognitive dissonance here. When we think about marriage, it’s mainly about two pretty young people, splendidly dressed, floating up the aisle. We are replicating the mistake my friend and I made so long ago, of confusing marriage with a wedding. Prenuptial bliss has about as much to do with long-term commitment as a New Year’s Eve party with the 12 months that follow: one is all promise and champagne, the other is – everything else. If you consider that a lot of the young (and by young I mean 20s and early 30s) are either uncoupled or loved-up on hormones and honeymoons, and that many of the old are divorced or widowed, a truth becomes obvious: marriage, particularly good marriage – the kind that improves your life, the kind that lasts, the kind that couldn’t care less for rings or presents or altered surnames, the kind that inspires someone to refer to their life partner as their best friend – is predominantly the province of the middle-aged. I’m 45 now and very happily married, although we have never bothered with either the legal shenanigans or the big party. As for that man I did officially marry – reader, I divorced him. My clear-sighted friend is also divorced. Both of us had absolutely brilliant weddings; it was the aftermath that didn’t work out so well. Young people buy into the fairytale, the happily ever after; and if they’re lucky, they learn and grow as a couple, whether or not they spend a year’s combined income on a ceremony first. If not, never mind: they have time to do things differently. My current partner also had a previous long-term relationship, complete with shared property and four children: if that isn’t marriage bar the tuxedo and the certificate, I’d like to know what is. By the time we met we were already middle-aged. We had figured out a few things we wanted and a few others we decidedly did not. We had also, by that point, encountered enough people to recognise that finding somebody else who knew a Gevrey-Chambertin from a Volnay, loved reasoned argument and loud laughter, regarded the dinner table as a sacred space, and viewed “pedant” as an endearment was an extraordinary stroke of luck. And that keeping hold of that feeling of incredible good fortune would take work: consideration, communication, and generous helpings of judicious apology. Watch the sequence from Funny Girl again. Streisand cannot believe her good luck either. This man is showering her with diamonds and money, a big house and pretty clothes, status, security and, finally, a baby. It’s the oldfashioned dream of marriage – or at least, of a wedding. He’s not her best friend; he’s not her friend at all. He is the giver, and when the giving ends, so does the marriage. You don’t have to be a feminist to find that galling, although it helps. These days, now that dowries are (mostly) out of fashion, the marriage ceremony is actually pretty egalitarian: promises are exchanged, obedience is off the menu, and ring-giving and name-changing are negotiable. But the basic premise, that this day is all about a girl who wants a big day, still lingers in our culture like decades-old confetti. Smug Marrieds in their middle years, whether they got it right first time or later, got hitched or didn’t bother, know that long-term love is about old slippers, not glass ones, and that plonking down the morning coffee can be even more romantic than raising a champagne glass – if you’re drinking with the right person. • Nina Caplan’s is a wine and travel writer.

The swift hour and 40 minutes of Belleville, Amy Herzog’s play, first seen in the States in 2011, is directed with clever claustrophobia by Michael Longhurst, aided by a finely detailed Paris apartment design by Tom Scutt and a shiveringly reverberating soundscape by Ben and Max Ringham. The intense acting of James Norton and Imogen Poots is seen so close up in the compressed space of the Donmar that each drop of blood or corrugation of a forehead, every wincing away from confrontation, looks seismic. But this drama about a young couple fighting their way through and perhaps out of a marriage is more full of violent twists than psychological surprises.

Wait – Church of Christ? I have no idea. Just regular Christian.” As with everything in America, there are simultaneously too many choices and nothing that quite fits the bill, which is rural Church of England circa 1984. I want a structure with large chunks of grey masonry, a lych gate, holly, ivy, a draught round my ankles, and insufficient lighting. I want my kids to be bored and cold, and forced to remember the words to the Coventry Carol while someone in authority regards them crossly from the nave. The church we are going to, by contrast – and with a wonderful history, rich in social justice and guest speakers such as Martin Luther King – has heated pews and a children’s service. Thanks to the “war on Christmas”, there is no nativity play at my children’s preschool and, while I’m fine with that, it does mean that any instruction on Mary and Joseph falls to me. It also exposes those biases that having children flushes out: the gravitational pull towards one’s own experience that, in the case of religion, even for those of us who have barely set foot in a church since we were made to as children, has an irresistible moral force; a combination of God and discomfort surely guarantees it will be Good For Them. A few weeks ago we sat through a two-hour service at Park Avenue Synagogue. It was great for a while and then basically unbearable, which seems to me exactly what a religious service should be. It was also a long way from home. I want angels with crooked wings and a kid with a dishcloth on his head and a terrified eight-year-old speeding through “wrapped-him-in-swaddling-clothes-and-laid-him-in-a-manger”, and a donkey that keeps wandering off. The church of my youth appears practically swathed in dry ice in my memory and I realise what I want isn’t worship but nostalgia. To bitcoin or not to bitcoin? I had a few hours to kill between kids, work and shopping this week and, instead of ploughing through admin, sat at my desk and indulged in a growing obsession: dithering over whether to buy bitcoin. I know the answer is no (probably). It’s gambling. You can’t put down anything you’re not prepared to lose, and you probably will lose it, say experts who may understand these things. But the numbers are so eye-popping it is hard to resist – an increase in value of 900% in 2017. Several times I’ve logged on to Coinbase, the online broker, almost completed my registration, then logged off muttering at my foolishness. “Should I buy bitcoin?” I ask Google. Yes, it says; and no. At this point, I should probably put down 50 bucks just for the recreational value of watching it soar before the crash – and in the unlikely event the crash never comes, as a tiny piece of insurance against future regret. O tip all ye faithful An online guide to tipping at Christmas urges us to “remember the little people” this holiday season, then offers this handy list: “Crossing guards, lunch staff, accountants, after-school staff, tutors, and therapists.” School support staff, babysitters and maintenance staff I’m down with. But I think my accountant would be a bit taken aback if I tried to tip him this Christmas. As for the inclusion of therapists on the list, perhaps service providers who charge upwards of $350 an hour really do qualify as “little people” in Trump’s America. • Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/22/diana-abbott-asks-for-explanation-over-denied-access-to-yarls-wood","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"Diane Abbott asks for explanation over denied access to Yarl's Wood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/22/diana-abbott-asks-for-explanation-over-denied-access-to-yarls-wood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/22/diana-abbott-asks-for-explanation-over-denied-access-to-yarls-wood","fields":{"headline":"Diane Abbott asks for explanation over denied access to Yarl's Wood","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Diane Abbott has written to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to ask why she has been refused permission to visit the controversial Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre despite at least a dozen requests over more than a year. The shadow home secretary said getting access to the centre in Bedfordshire, which has regularly seen concerns raised about inappropriate treatment of highly vulnerable detainees, was a necessary part of her job. Yarl’s Wood, where foreign nationals are detained before being deported, faced criticism last month after the chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, said he had found increasing numbers of women held there despite evidence they were victims of torture, rape and trafficking. Clarke said he was concerned to find that the Home Office had refused to accept that rape came within the legal definition of torture. In July a Kenyan asylum seeker won a court victory, with the Home Office found to have acted unlawfully by locking her in a “punishment room” at Yarl’s Wood for an excessive time. In her letter to Rudd, Abbott said she had made repeated requests from November 2016 to go to Yarl’s Wood and visit “some of the most vulnerable women in your care and control”. The letter, which Labour has released publicly, states that while Yarl’s Wood permits social and legal visits for detainees, Abbott was “not seeking to visit a specific individual but rather to see for myself the general conditions in which people are detained and to listen to any of those wishing to share their experiences with me alongside those working in the institution”. Abbott wrote: “You will appreciate that such visits are both my constitutional and ethical responsibility.” Her letter ended: “The Christmas period can be a particularly difficult time for both incarcerated people and those working in places of detention, so I hope you will grant my request for a visit as a matter of urgency.” The notoriety of Yarl’s Wood has seen up to 2,000 people protest outside it, while campaigners have repeatedly called for it to be closed. In a separate statement, Abbott said: “It is of critical importance that we are able to scrutinise the conditions in which people are held, especially given the allegations of appalling treatment, abuse, and a lack of legal advice and medical support in this centre. “It is completely unacceptable that I have been refused access to Yarl’s Wood for more than a year and it would be extraordinary for the home secretary to continue to ignore my reasonable request by fobbing me off with false assurances.” The Home Office said: “Independent scrutiny is a vital part of ensuring our immigration removal centres are safe, secure and humane. They are visited and inspected regularly by organisations including Independent Monitoring Boards, Her Majesty’s chief inspector of prisons and the chief inspector of borders and immigration. Requests to visit the centres must be carefully considered and planned to preserve the privacy and dignity of the people detained there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/21/nfl-catch-rule-steelers-patriots-nba","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T17:39:15Z","webTitle":"The end is sigh: why US sports are somehow at their worst in the final reel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/21/nfl-catch-rule-steelers-patriots-nba","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/21/nfl-catch-rule-steelers-patriots-nba","fields":{"headline":"The end is sigh: why US sports are somehow at their worst in the final reel","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Do you have an idea for a new sport that would feature some of the greatest athletes in the world, but instead of having the athletes decide the outcome in the final minutes, the game falls into the hands of officials and coaches? Then the American market is right for you. Yes, the United States, home to more than 300m people, seems to love sports that are at their worst at the very end. Sunday night’s Steelers-Patriots matchup brought in the biggest TV ratings of the 2017 season, with 27m people tuning in to see which AFC power would get the inside track on homefield throughout the conference playoffs. It ended with 27m people, approximately a tenth of the entire US population, being reminded again that they have no idea what it means to catch a ball, one of the most elementary elements in sport. With 28 seconds left in the game and the Steelers trailing 27-24, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger spotted tight end Jesse James across the middle and hit him in stride with a pass. James caught – excuse me: “caught” – the ball and then lunged forward into the end zone for a game-winning touchdown. Apologies again. I meant: a “game-winning touchdown”. Because upon review, we were all told that what we saw we did not actually see. Due to the NFL’s byzantine catch rules, it was determined James’ “catch” was in fact not a catch, and the “touchdown” was taken off board. The flummoxed Steelers then blew a shot at a tie two plays later when Roethlisberger threw an interception in the end zone. Game over. And, instead of 27m people talking about the game of the year, we got at least that many discussions on why the NFL continues to shoot itself in the foot. The Patriots have been on the fortunate side of the NFL’s wheel-o-catch rulings so far this season. The James’ ruling broke in their favor. They squeaked by the Jets in back in Week 6 in no small part to another tight end’s touchdown catch, that of Austin Seferian-Jenkins, being determined to not be a catch. And they beat the Texans in the final minute in Week 3 on a Brandin Cooks reception that debatably was less clear of a catch than those by James or Seferian-Jenkins. This is in no way to say that the Patriots get all the breaks. It’s just that it’s easy to think of catch rulings that have swung games all season, and that’s just for one team. There are 31 other teams with similar tales. Ask Dallas Cowboys fans about the Dez Bryant (non-)catch in the playoffs against the Packers in 2015. Or Detroit Lions fans about Calvin Johnson and the many other instances of Lions receivers being robbed of what are clear catches – at least what is considered to be a clear catch everywhere in the world outside of NFL stadiums. Forty years ago, in Super Bowl XII, this was considered a catch: Passing has skyrocketed in the last 40 years, while the understanding of what a catch is has plummeted right into the ground like a football in an overturned reception. That Butch Johnson reception from Roger Staubach? It would never stand now. And maybe it shouldn’t. But a multi-billion dollar league with a commissioner making more than $30m a year should be able to hit on a happy medium between that and what we have today. Something between that and replays, referees and rulebooks deciding so many games. Something that melds logic, common sense and the spirit of the game. Something that makes the NFL feel more like a sport than court. While the American right wing makes the case that NFL ratings are down because of Colin Kaepernick and others kneeling, there’s an argument to be made that others are tuning out because it’s foolish to invest three hours watching a game only to see the outcome determined under the replay hood. If the NFL can’t even explain what a catch is, it’s hard to explain why tens of millions should watch. The NBA – the second-most popular league in the US – is not experiencing a ratings decline, but basketball does have a similar late-game problem. Unlike in football, video reviews in basketball are usually quick and painless. Officials check a monitor to see if a shot was released before the buzzer and that’s pretty much the end of it. There’s mercifully no debate about whether a player made a “basketball move” before releasing said shot. But the final minute of basketball games is often an excruciating watch. High-flying skill and athleticism starts the game, while the end is a rolling misery of timeouts, intentional fouls and free throws. The NFL’s catch rule is confusing, but basketball’s flagrant foul rule might even be worse. On page 58 of the NBA’s rule book you find this sentence: “A flagrant foul – penalty (2) is unnecessary and excessive contact committed by a player against an opponent.” But then in every NBA game in which a team is trailing by a few possessions late, you see quite a lot of unnecessary and excessive contact in obviously flagrant attempts to stop the clock and send the other team to the line. All of the timeouts halt the action even more. NBA teams are allowed six one-minute timeouts per game and one 20-second timeout, with only three eligible to be used in the fourth quarter. But that’s three a team, of course, meaning it’s not rare to see the final minutes of a game hacked apart by six timeouts and an unlimited number of free throws. If a basketball coach doesn’t trust his team to get through a single late-game possession without drawing something up in a timeout, what exactly is the coach doing in practice? Do the coaching in practice. Let the players play during the game. As great as Gregg Popovich or Steve Kerr are, no one is tuning in to see them draw on a whiteboard. While basketball and football have so much entertainment value from start to almost-finish, the sports can’t get out of their own way in the final minutes. Yet despite that anti-climax that comes far too often, here’s the catch: because the NFL and NBA remain massively profitable businesses, they have little impetus to fix their late-game issues. That’s a catch we can all actually understand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/21/cabinet-inquiry-finds-mark-garnier-did-not-breach-ministerial-code","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T16:56:04Z","webTitle":"Cabinet inquiry finds Mark Garnier did not breach ministerial code","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/21/cabinet-inquiry-finds-mark-garnier-did-not-breach-ministerial-code","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/21/cabinet-inquiry-finds-mark-garnier-did-not-breach-ministerial-code","fields":{"headline":"Cabinet inquiry finds Mark Garnier did not breach ministerial code","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The junior trade minister Mark Garnier has been formally cleared of wrongdoing for asking his former assistant to buy a sex toy and calling her “sugar tits”, with no action being taken against him, Downing Street has said. Garnier did not deny the accusations about the events in 2010, made by his former assistant Caroline Edmondson, which prompted a one-month investigation by the Cabinet Office to see if he had breached the ministerial code. Summarising the findings, a Downing Street spokesman said in a statement there was no evidence Garnier had done anything wrong since becoming a minister in July 2016. The investigation also heard evidence “in relation to an incident that happened before Mr Garnier was a minister, between Mr Garnier and a member of his parliamentary and constituency staff”, the statement said. “The Cabinet Office concluded that there was no dispute about the facts of the incident, but there was a significant difference of interpretation between the parties, and that the member of staff in Mr Garnier’s office was distressed by what had occurred. “It was not his intention to cause distress, and Mr Garnier has apologised unreservedly to the individual. On that basis the prime minister considers that a line should be drawn under the issue.” According to a report in the Mail on Sunday in October, Garnier gave Edmondson money to buy a sex toy for his wife and another for a woman working in his Wyre Forest constituency office. Edmondson said: “He suggested to me in a Commons bar one evening that we went shopping for sex toys in Soho. The next day, he said: ‘Come on, let’s do it.’ He took me to Soho and gave me the money to buy two vibrators. He stood outside the shop while I did.” Garnier, a former City fund manager, is married with three children and was elected as MP for Wyre Forest in 2010. Garnier also admitted he referred to Edmondson as “sugar tits”, saying this was a reference to the BBC comedy Gavin and Stacey. He added: “It absolutely does not constitute harassment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/02/tuesdays-best-tv-prince-last-year-of-a-legend-inside-no-9","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T06:20:20Z","webTitle":"Tuesday’s best TV: Prince: Last Year of a Legend; Inside No 9","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/02/tuesdays-best-tv-prince-last-year-of-a-legend-inside-no-9","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/02/tuesdays-best-tv-prince-last-year-of-a-legend-inside-no-9","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday’s best TV: Prince: Last Year of a Legend; Inside No 9","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Prince: Last Year of a Legend 10pm, Channel 4 The death of Prince in a lift – admittedly his own lift, in his own nine-acre studio complex/folly/compound – was a slightly prosaic end to this extraordinary life.

Her lyrical surname is of British origin and comes from her adoptive parents, Minneapolis liberals Sera and Glen Songmaker. Meanwhile her forename reflects their celebration of her ethnicity, as Cedar recalls: “Native girl! Indian Princess! An Ojibwe, Chippewa. Anishinaabe.” A young pregnant woman living in a world that is “running backwards”, she is a neat embodiment of the complexity of race, identity and the matriarchal line. Adoptions into and out of nuclear and extended families are a recurring theme in Erdrich’s novels; love is a gift that does not depend on blood, but blood ties are nevertheless hard to break. Here, Cedar’s baby is due on the 25 December, and she is determined to seek out her birth parents and discover their medical history. And with good reason. Evolution is reversing; animals, birds and insects are gradually reverting to their prehistoric forms. Humanoid babies look increasingly less human, live births are dwindling, women are dying in childbirth and “perfect” children are becoming rare. Cedar narrates the novel in a diary intended for her child, “a record and an inquiry into the strangeness of things”. Her tone shifts between girlish self-absorption, excitement at the forthcoming birth, irritation with her parents and increasing terror at the jeopardy she finds herself in. Erdrich has credited the Planned Parenthood organisation with helping her to realise her potential as a novelist: “If I hadn’t been able to choose when to have a baby, I would not have been able to put in those crucial years of growth as a writer.” She started writing Future Home of the Living God during the George W Bush era, prompted partly by the use of fear to limit debate following the 9/11 terror attacks and partly by his stance on reproductive rights. Having set the book aside for more than a decade, she only returned to it after the 2016 US election. The image of evolution going backwards is now an apposite political metaphor, the reduction of women to vessels that produce babies is all too easy to imagine. Cedar considers her body her own. She has converted to Catholicism, partly as a means of rebelling against her adoptive parents, but is what Muriel Spark described as a chocolate box convert, picking and choosing the tenets which suit her. Cedar does not regret the abortion she had a decade ago and has no intention of marrying her baby’s father. When she finds her birth family, they are initially an “immense disappointment”. “It was a shock to realise that on the reservation I was even more ordinary … My family had no special powers with healing spirits or sacred animals. We weren’t even poor. We owned a Superpumper.” A tribal member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota, Erdrich explores magical and religious realities in a contemporary, political world. Cedar’s half-sister – “nightmare kitten”, “cutie-pie vampire” – works hard on her “Goth-Lolita” look. Her mother works hard in the family petrol station; her stepfather works hard at not killing himself. Grandma Potts is a character that fans of Erdrich will recognise: a determined ancient, repository of sacred and profane stories including “The Nun Who Swallowed a White Ribbon and It Came Out the Other End White Too”. Evolutionary reversals may offer the Ojibwe people an opportunity to regain stolen land – but the apocalypse is not all good news. As the crisis progresses, fertile women are encouraged to become “womb volunteers” and gestate embryos from in-vitro clinics. Things get worse: pregnant women are rounded up and imprisoned in hospitals, their newborn babies taken from them. The mystery of what happens to the confiscated babies adds to the terror. It is only a matter of time before Cedar is imprisoned: rather than await her fate, she goes on the run. As baby Songmaker’s birth grows near, the tension ramps up. The self-selected new authorities are determined to continue the human race despite the cost to women’s freedom. Dangerous pregnancies, strange births and threatened reproductive rights haunt speculative fiction by female writers: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Doris Lessing’s The Fifth Child, Octavia Butler’s Blood Child and Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale are classics of perilous propagative fiction. Pregnancy is the perfect vehicle for body-horror. Birth is dangerous; you do not know what you might be harbouring in your womb or who might try to take it from you. Erdrich is a prolific novelist, a star of North American literature who should be better known in the UK. Her storytelling and political insight make Future Home of the Living God a new classic of the genre.

In it are the sea-caves that Robert Graves inhabited with the “Things never seen or heard or written about” of his poem Welsh Incident (1929). A dull winter’s afternoon intensified their gloom. The bright orange flash of a kingfisher whirred around sombre overhangs until it found shelter among deep shadow. I turned to face seawards. This dark time of year has a discreet beauty. Outflow from the silted inlet of Ystumllyn gushes across the sand, spreads and gathers light from sea and sky. Streaming clouds are coloured like shot silk. Beneath them combers collapse and retreat with a sound that brought to Matthew Arnold’s mind “the turbid ebb and flow / Of human misery” (Dover Beach). We project on to landscape what is within, seek what TS Eliot called “the objective correlative” to our own state of being. Even around the midwinter solstice, there is much to be seen here. I catch at a strange, writhing, black line moving fast across the middle distance, imagine it for a moment to be one of Graves’s monstrous things. It resolves into black specks as a low-flying flock of scoter settle on the water and begin to dive for food. Here, between Morfa Bychan and Criccieth, has for a century or more been one of the reliable places to see these large ducks, their lovely blackness accentuated by flashes of bright orange on the upper mandible. Comparatively rare this far north, they stay offshore, sight of them obscured and then revealed by the swell, adding anticipation to their mysterious presence. Overhead a kestrel sears past, intent on the huge starling roost among the withies at Ystumllyn. To the west, the sun stretches down into the sea beyond Ynys Enlli. Silence is disturbed only by the cries of gulls, by the oystercatchers’ shrill vehemence, and a pulsing of small waves into the pebbled shore.

Police officers and stewards had to separate up to 20 players and members of staff from the clubs after a bust-up in which bottles and punches were thrown and Mikel Arteta, one of City’s coaches, was left with blood streaming down his face. The FA said in a statement: “Following a review of the evidence provided by the clubs and independent eyewitnesses the FA will be taking no formal action.” Each club believed the other to be culpable and it is thought the FA received contrasting accounts of what happened. The FA initially asked for background reports, then asked for further information from several witnesses. A spokesman said: “We spoke to quite a lot of people in the end, before satisfying ourselves there was no need to take the matter further.” José Mourinho will also not face FA action over comments he made before the derby but has been warned that “any further public comments about match officials may result in disciplinary action”. The FA did not specify which remarks it was investigating but it is understood to have been concerned by the United manager calling on the referee to be alert to what he described as City’s “tactical fouls”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/22/gordon-gino-fred-christmas-roast-review-absolutely-champers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Christmas Roast review – a seasonal feast for a good cause","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/22/gordon-gino-fred-christmas-roast-review-absolutely-champers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/22/gordon-gino-fred-christmas-roast-review-absolutely-champers","fields":{"headline":"Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Christmas Roast review – a seasonal feast for a good cause","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I was going to start with Edina and Patsy decanting to champagne country, but actually this – Gordon, Gino and Fred’s Christmas Roast (ITV) – is more fun. It has a trip to France, as well, and bubbly, but it also has slebs and heroes, swearing and farting. Fred is First Dates maitre d’ and comedy-bearded Frenchman Fred Sirieix; Gino is handsome Italian charmer Gino D’Acampo; Gordon is Gordon effing Ramsay. With help from a few famous faces, they are putting on a banquet at the splendid Merchant Taylors Hall in the City of London for some not so famous faces – unsung public heroes; emergency services crews who went to the terror attacks in London and Manchester, residents of Grenfell Tower etc. And Gordon, Gino and Fred also do a little road trip – in France, in a motorhome – to get the wine. So it’s kind of Hell’s Kitchen meets The Pride of Britain Awards meets The Trip. In the kitchen, Gordon does his thing. He’s the panto villain, oh yes he is. So he shouts and throws his toys out of the pram, and a plate of scallops across the room (Fred says he hasn’t seen that since the 80s – it was all airborne scallops in the 80s, wasn’t it?). And Gordon tells Martine McCutcheon her bangers and mash looks like a massive dog’s turd. And he gets a little thing going with Geri Horner née Halliwell. “Get me Victoria Beckham’s number, please, let’s get a proper Spice Girl in here,” he says. (To which the correct response would, of course, have been: “Get me Jamie Oliver’s number, let’s get a proper cook in here.” But, sadly, Geri misses her cue.) Anyway, Gordon’s bullying is good news for Gino who, it turns out, is not just a smiley pretty mama’s boy with a nice accent – he fights back. “No more Mr Nice Gino,” he says. Yeah, and be more like that on your own programmes, Gino, while you’re at it. The wine, then. They head to France, the three of them, more Stooges than Wise Men. An Englishman, a Frenchman and an Italian; it sounds like the start of a joke, and it kind of is; they certainly have a laugh. They are in an RV; maybe they could cook up some crystal meth while they’re at it – I can definitely see Gordon Ramsay going the full Walter White … Sadly not, this time, though there will be chemistry of sorts – the emission of gas. They go to an amazing cave in the Ardèche. It’s 80 metres down to where the wine is stored, says Fred. “Eighty feet down?!” says Gordon. No Gordon, 80 metres, listen! They have to abseil down; now it’s Running Wild with Bear Grylls. They are packing an awful lot into this show. They row a boat to an island, still bickering, to get some other wine. And then they park up the motorhome in a layby for the night, where Gino drops his booty bomb. I think it’s Gino, it’s after lights out. It’s very puerile, and very boysy, but undeniably amusing. All of it. Plus it’s for a good cause – they make a lovely tea for a bunch of heroes. Well done everyone. After which, Joanna &amp; Jennifer: Absolutely Champers (BBC1) is a bit, well, flat. Lumley and Saunders pop off to north-east France to find out how their favourite tipple is made, touring champagne country in a lovely old Citroën DS. Everyone knows that visiting wineries, finding out whether this grape is a pinot noir or pinot meunier, or what wood the cask is made of and how long the wine is in bottles for and at what temperature, and wine people, and wine talk, are all deeply boring, and that the only joy in it is actually drinking the stuff. Joanna and Jennifer do this, starting at the bar at St Pancras station, in London. And they get the giggles, which is nice. You would think, though, that the famous French champagne houses of Épernay would be fertile ground for two very funny people to take the piss, and to uncork themselves a bit, too, froth and fizz. But they are surprisingly – disappointingly – deferential, and reserved. There’s a slight hint of self-congratulation about it, too ... Well, I guess they have earned it. I think I am just disappointed it’s not Edina and Patsy swerving around champagne country, sloshed, falling out of the Citroën on to the road, when the gendarmes pull them over.

They said 8 million people in 32 districts had been affected by floods, with 307,000 people staying in emergency shelters and 1,945 medical teams deployed. In addition, 103,855 houses had been destroyed, with a further 633,792 partially damaged, and 4,636 schools – and several hundred thousand acres of farm land – had been flooded. A house sinks into the water in the district of Lalmonirhat, Bangladesh, where flooding triggered by torrential rains has displaced hundreds of thousands of people Saber Saladas and his family were the human face of the government’s dry statistics. They had lived as fishers and farmers for generations on the south-west coast of Bangladesh, near Cox’s Bazar, but in recent years had struggled to adapt to increasingly strong storms and coastal erosion. Other families had moved to the city as saltwater encroached on their rice fields, but they had clung on. The monsoon floods were severe in 2017, but it was steady, incremental sea-level rise, which sent brackish water further into Saladas’s village than ever before, that finally forced the family to move. With water ankle deep in the family home – their well contaminated, their rice crop failing and no other land to go to – they bowed to the inevitable and left their village, possibly for ever. “God knows what will happen. We know the end is coming,” says Saladas, in a makeshift shelter on the side of a road near Cox’s Bazar. Three hundred and fifty miles away, on the other side of the Bay of Bengal at the edge of the Sunderbans mangrove forests, Gopal Munda (left), from Kara Mura district, is preparing to move as his crops fail. “Once, this village was green with paddy fields. But now the water is salty and the trees have died. We can only farm shrimp. I am devastated when I think that I will have to move,” he says to researchers from the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF). “This land was made by my father and grandfather. We are people, poor people living here in the countryside. We want to breathe, to live a long life.” An aerial view of Bangladesh’s countryside Both families are now climate migrants. Saladas expects to go to Chittagong, where many people from his village have gone, and Munda is likely to move to Dhaka. An Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) report says that tens of thousands of Bangladeshi families face becoming refugees in their own land. “Ever more frequent storms, river erosion and salinity intrusion are forcing people from their homes and destroying their lands. And as with so many of the effects of climate change we are seeing today, this is just the start of something far larger,” says the report. A fisherman in the Sundarbans, the vast mangrove forest that protects low-lying southern Bangladesh from the worst of the region’s cyclones Dhaka and other large cities are already home to a growing number of environmental refugees. “We lost everything to river erosion. We escaped with just our lives,” says Renu Bibi, an 80-year-old woman now living in a slum in the Mirpur district of Dhaka. “Today, boats pass over the place where our land was. Sometimes three or four entire villages will be destroyed.” Renu Bibi, left, and Ruma Begum, who both lost their homes to river erosion Ruma Begum, from Mehendiganj, was forced to move to Dhaka with her family and now lives in Mirpur. “There were between 100 and 150 families along the riverbank. All their homes were washed away. We lost everything,” she says. The EJF report says the number of people living in slums has increased by more than 60% in the past 17 years in Bangladesh. “Many of the new arrivals are ‘climate refugees’ – people forced to leave their homes due to extreme weather events related to climate change,” it adds. No one knows exactly how many Bangladeshis are forced to move each year by temporary flooding caused by extreme storms, or by permanent flooding caused by a rise in sea level. But it could be up to 250,000 people a year, says the EJF. “Families arrive into Dhaka’s Sadarghat ferry terminal at dawn with only the possessions they could carry when the floodwaters came. While catastrophic storms like Aila [in 2009] or Sidr [2007] make headlines, so many of these families are being forced from their homes by … relentless, ever rising tides. This is everyday climate change at work: a slow-onset shift in environmental conditions that is destroying lives and livelihoods before our eyes,” says the report. ‘I jumped into the water to try to save the cattle, but I could not,’ says Komola Begum, recalling the floods that forced her family to flee their home Linking migration directly to climate change is difficult, say academics, because people move for many reasons. But Bangladesh, officially, expects 25-30 million people to move within the next 50 years, or nearly one in six of its present population. “We are a state that is greatly threatened by the impacts of climate change,” says Munir Muniruzzaman (left), chair of the Global Military Advisory Council on Climate Change and a former military adviser to the president of Bangladesh. “It has been estimated by the UN IPCC’s reports and analysis that a one-metre sea level rise in the south of the country will entail a 17-20% loss of territory to the sea, meaning that Bangladesh will lose up to 20% of its current landmass. It is going to create a very large climate refugee population.” He warns that the country will be unable to cope. “The internal capacity of the state, given its size and resources, to absorb such a large displacement of the human population and large number of climate refugees, certainly does not exist in the country. Therefore, we are not only going to see internal destabilisation due to large-scale displacement of people, but there will be transboundary migration of climate refugees into the neighbouring countries,” says Muniruzzaman. Mossammat Akhter from Charilmabad, southern Bangladesh, and his family. ‘All the land is under water … we had to move very quickly. We were left with nothing. I feel like a refugee.’ Below right, Monowara Begum had to leave Dhonia, south-central Bangladesh, after flooding destroyed her home and her possessions But environmental migrants are not recognised as refugees and have none of the legal protections guaranteed by the UN’s 1951 Refugee Convention. This, says the EJF, needs to be addressed urgently. According to the World Health Organization, global climate change could contribute to an extra 250,000 deaths worldwide a year between 2030 and 2050, as warmer temperatures lead to more malaria, dengue fever and diarrhoea. The EJF and others are now pressing for a new UN agreement that would force countries to recognise people displaced by deteriorating environmental conditions linked with climate change. Only legally distinct protection like that conferred on refugees fleeing persecution can effectively address the scale of the problem now growing in places like Bangladesh, it says. “We must help build resilience and assist those communities for whom conditions have deteriorated to such an extent that they have no choice but to move; communities which have been forced from their homes and land and left divided and scattered with nowhere to go and no means to survive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/observer-sudoku","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T00:01:36Z","webTitle":"Observer sudoku","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/observer-sudoku","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/24/observer-sudoku","fields":{"headline":"Observer sudoku","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fill the grid using the numbers 1 to 9.

He was phoning and phoning but I said: ‘I’m not going to play.’” The calls came, the president on the line, but José Paulo Bezerra Maciel Júnior – better known as Paulinho, hardly known at all then – had made up his mind. He had headed home to São Paulo, yet rather than returning to his boyhood club he was giving up on the game. He had had enough, aged 19. “In Lithuania they had racially abused me, in Poland they hadn’t paid me, and I thought: ‘I don’t need this,’” he says. “I said to my family: ‘I’m not playing football again.’” Which was when his then-wife intervened, telling him to think about his parents – a council worker and a supermarket manager who had supported him since he started playing at the age of five. Ditching it all would, she said, show a lack of respect to them. Paulinho and his wife had just had a baby daughter too and, besides, she asked: ‘What else can you do?’ It is a good question. What would he have done? Paulinho smiles. “I really don’t know,” he says. “She said: ‘The only thing you know how to do is play football.’” And so that is what he did. About a month later, Paulinho rejoined Pão de Açúcar in the fourth division, effectively an amateur. Almost a decade on, he is preparing for the world’s biggest club game, a starter for Barcelona in Saturday’s clásico. The highest-scoring midfielder in Spain, his team are six points clear at the top and 11 ahead of their rivals, and this summer he will be in the heart of the Brazil team who are favourites in Russia. “If someone had said then that I would be preparing to play in the World Cup and at Barcelona, I would have said: ‘Never!’” he grins. “Never, ever.” However the “then” Paulinho is talking about is not 2008, it is 2015. It is not that he gave up once a long time ago; it is that others routinely gave up on him. He tells his story steadily, dating every decision. “It’s been a rollercoaster,” he says. He has played in six countries in three continents, been a Copa Libertadores champion and relegated too, suffered the greatest humiliation in Brazil’s history and been abused, unpaid, written off. And now look. Paulinho’s professional career began when, aged 16, he left home for Lithuania; it ended aged 26 when he left London for China. Or at least it was supposed to, Guangzhou his particular graveyard. “When I went, everyone said that was it: my career was over,” Paulinho says. The question is simple: why go? The answer is simple, stark too: there was a prospect worse – staying at Tottenham. After a year at Vilnius, Paulinho left for Lodz, returning to Brazil in the summer of 2008. He won promotion with Pão de Açúcar before joining Bragantino in the second division. From there he headed to Corinthians, where he won the Brazilian title, the Libertadores and the Club World Cup. Having turned down Internazionale, he joined Tottenham the following year for a club-record £17m. The Premier League should have suited him, he admits, but within two years he was desperate to go. “I wouldn’t say it was a relief to leave Spurs but it was clear I had to,” he says. “It was a difficult time. “[André] Villas-Boas bought me in July 2013 and in December Villas-Boas goes. He’d wanted me, we’d spoken a lot, and then six months later Tim Sherwood was in charge. There was no problem with him – he was very young, a good coach – but the team wasn’t doing well and he came under pressure to change things. He did things a little differently but I still played the last eight or nine games that season. Then came the change from Sherwood to Mauricio Pochettino.” Something else came too. As Paulinho sets the scene, Belo Horizonte comes into view. He was brought on at half-time in the semi-final of the 2014 World Cup with the hosts 5-0 down to Germany and, as he discusses his return to Spurs afterwards, it is clear how much of an impact Brazil’s 7-1 defeat had. “The problem was that this came after the World Cup, with me trying to get back to some normality. I was the last back and to have gone out of the World Cup that way with Brazil at home …” he says pausing, his train of thought lost a little. “I’ve never talked much about that game: maybe once or twice, that’s it. There’s no point. You can lose a game by two or three and say: ‘Oh we made this mistake, we made that mistake, we lost.’ But if you lose 7-1 what can you say? It is something that can’t happen. But it happened. And after that, I had to go back to my club. You have a full season ahead of you when [you hope] you can recover from losing a World Cup semi-final 7-1 at home.” It did not work out that way. Paulinho had started 28 league games in his first season in north London; in his second it was three. “My first game [under Pochettino] is in my position but after that I played in every position apart from my own,” Paulinho says, marking out roles with his fingers. “If we play in a three, I’m here. If we play in a two, I’m here. “He had a different system, and if you’re not in your position in a football as competitive as England it’s difficult. “I was playing on the left wing: the míster put me there and I had to play there, because I wanted to play. I had no problem with Pochettino. I told him: ‘This position is not mine but if you want I can play there.’ But in the long term you’re not going to be at your best and over the last six months I wasn’t playing regularly. “I thought the moment had come to leave. Where? I didn’t know. But I wanted to leave. The coach wasn’t trusting in me so there’s no reason to stay. It was April, May 2015, a month left. I’d spoken to the president [chairman Daniel Levy] and asked him if he could help. He was a buenísimo person and he said: ‘Let’s wait and see if you have anything.’” What he had was China. And that was pretty much that. “There were two more offers in Europe but they were loans and I didn’t want that,” Paulinho says. Luiz Felipe Scolari wanted him at Guangzhou so he left London behind, not returning until the international friendly at Wembley last month. He says he went without bitterness. “I’m not going to say bad things about England just because I had a bad time; it was a pleasure to play the Spurs players recently. I speak to Kyle Walker sometimes and it was nice to see Danny Rose and Eric Dier.” Going to China is where the story is supposed to end. Although Paulinho insists he has not got a bad word for Guangzhou, a city of more than 13 million people that he describes as “perfect”, he knew there was a risk, as if his career no longer counted. Was the football there too easy? Did the players actually care? It is tempting to see players as complicit in their own demise but his case contradicts that. China turned out to be a restart. “It’s not the same,” he concedes. “The level didn’t compare with Spain, Italy, England, Germany; it’s totally different. But in 2016 more players arrived: Gervinho, [Ezequiel] Lavezzi, Jackson Martínez – then Oscar and Hulk arrived and the league grew. There are new laws making it more difficult to buy players and another one obliging teams to have three under-23s, so I imagine it will drop again a little, but the standard rose after 2015. “It’s not top, top, top but there are games that are very physical and teams like Guangzhou and Shanghai who have very good Chinese players and foreign signings. We had eight or nine Chinese national team players. And as a player, the motivation is the same because it comes from [within] you, whether you’re in front of 4,000, 5,000 or 100,000. I also had the national team to play for.” Six titles followed, including the Asian Champions League. Tite, the national coach, managed him at Corinthians and believed in him but still: he was in China. And yet Brazil did call – and so, unexpectedly, did Barcelona. Paulinho was preparing to take a free-kick when Brazil were facing Argentina and Lionel Messi sidled up. “Are you coming to Barcelona?” he asked. “If you’re taking me, I’m going,” Paulinho replied before telling Willian to take the free kick: his head had gone. “My representative called. My attitude was: ‘When you have something concrete, let’s sit down and decide, [but] I don’t need anything crazy in my career right now.’ I had three or four years’ contract left. I was clear: either I go to Barcelona, or I stay, nothing else. We were in the knockout phase of the Asian Champions League and Scolari wanted to keep me but he knew it was a unique opportunity. I’m 29, it’s Barcelona. I kept saying that to him: ‘This is Barcelona. We’re not talking about any club here: this one, that one, the other. No, we’re talking about Barcelona.’” Guangzhou resisted and Barcelona had to pay his full buyout clause on the final day of the Chinese market. Supporters were furious – not so much in Guangzhou as in Catalonia. In the wake of Neymar’s departure, Barcelona were in the midst of a crisis, the catalogue of mistakes and problems growing, and some saw Paulinho’s signing as the culmination – definitive ‘proof’ the club was adrift and the board incompetent. Few came to his presentation and much was made of a miscontrol as he performed the obligatory kick-ups. It was as if he symbolised everything that was wrong. €40m. For a 29-year-old. From China. Who failed at Spurs. And who did not fit the Barcelona model. That, though, was part of the point, while he also admits that he has talked often with team-mates about the way Barcelona play – especially with Messi, Sergio Busquets and Luis Suárez. “We didn’t have a player of his profile,” the coach, Ernesto Valverde, said. “He has important technical and physical qualities. He arrives in the area from deep; we needed someone who breaks through lines.” Paulinho says: “I’ve always been this kind of player: since youth level I’ve been a midfielder who can arrive and finish. I’ve almost never played in Busquets’ position. My way of playing is similar to Lampard.” Under Valverde, Barcelona remain unbeaten in 24 matches across all competitions and Paulinho has played his part. After his first start, in which he scored one and provided an assist, the Brazilian Football Federation joked: “Is he bad?”; Dani Alves suggested Paulinho would end up proving “cheap”. He has six goals and two assists in the league. His name has been chanted at the Camp Nou. “I’m happy I’m playing well and helping,” he says. “I didn’t expect things to go so well. “I’ve heard it said that I’m silencing the critics so many times but it’s not that: I don’t have to prove myself to anyone. I don’t play for the critics, I play for my team-mates. For three, four years I haven’t listened to anything,” he says, sounding rather like he might have done. “People always talk and always will. ‘He’s good now because he’s at Barça’, ‘He was only good then because he was in China’, blah, blah, blah. When I was at Bragantino and I went to Corinthians it was the same; it was the same at Tottenham and in China. I’ve had that since the beginning.” Paulinho once again reflects on the beginning of his career. “It was hard leaving everything behind at only 17 but I went. And then after the problems with racism, having to fight to be paid, I didn’t want to carry on. I was fighting for things that should have been my right. I wasn’t asking for a lot, for something I wanted – just to be respected and paid. “My family didn’t have a lot but we were OK, we could live, so I thought: ‘I don’t need this.’ It wasn’t that I didn’t like football but I didn’t want to play any more. After a while they persuaded me. We laugh about it now: ‘You see! Imagine if you’d stopped back then.’ I’ve had a lot of experiences and I wouldn’t change a thing. I went from there to Spurs and from Spurs to China, because I wanted to play. 2014 was a very difficult year; 2015 was hard too, with everyone talking: ‘Bah, Paulinho’s career is over.’ Everyone said that was it; they said the level was no good, but I won six trophies and within a year I was back in the Brazil team. Now this. That’s football. It was a rollercoaster; no one gave me a chance, but here I am.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/21/internet-giants-such-as-facebook-and-twitter-must-be-made-accountable-for-content-they-publish","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T18:57:57Z","webTitle":"Internet giants such as Facebook and Twitter must be made accountable for content they publish | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/21/internet-giants-such-as-facebook-and-twitter-must-be-made-accountable-for-content-they-publish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/21/internet-giants-such-as-facebook-and-twitter-must-be-made-accountable-for-content-they-publish","fields":{"headline":"Internet giants such as Facebook and Twitter must be made accountable for content they publish","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Uber is officially a transport company and not a digital service, the European court of justice (ECJ) has now ruled (Report, 21 December), making it assume greater responsibility for its business methods and duty to employees and customers. In addition to emphasising the important role played by the ECJ in looking beyond national parochiality, may I suggest that the principles should now be examined in the wider context of online communication. The likes of Twitter, Google, Facebook and YouTube argue from a similar standpoint as Uber has done – namely that they are a mere platform, with limited or no responsibility for what happens as a result of their (lucrative) commercial activity. So death threats, instructions for bomb-making, abusive messages, sexting, hate mail and the like can be published with relative impunity under the “freedom of the internet” banner. I suggest these organisations are publishers, not mere platforms, and must therefore take greater responsibility for the content that they, well, publish. Just like newspapers and broadcasters. Yes, they may be scrabbling to increase the number of moderators and checkers to close stable doors, but that merely underlines the scale of the problem. If they and others were to be made fully accountable for the content that they happily put out, that problem is likely to be dealt with far more effectively, to the benefit of society as a whole.

For the first two years on the show he was still Alan Sugar’s right-hand man on The Apprentice. Best thing about your job? I genuinely think that the team we’ve got is brilliant. It’s a big team, about 40 people, and a really well-oiled machine. No Autocues, none of that. Also the contestants love it so much. They don’t win a trip to Miami, they get a bloody teapot. And yet, that’s all they want. It’s the absolute enjoyment of the contestants actually. Why are you a good quiz host? If I do have a talent, it is the ability to talk to people. Some people shy away from people in the street but I like them. I make them comfortable. Kindness is part of the role. I’m always terrified that somebody won’t score – my heart goes into arrhythmia. It hasn’t happened yet but someone can get a bit beaten up. They can get agitated. But it’s OK, because we have breaks. Then I can say: “Don’t worry, we’ll look after you, it’s fine.” What advice would you give to contestants? Be calm and enjoy it. They all say: “I’m brilliant at home”, and I say: “Listen, everybody is brilliant at home.” But they don’t have all those lights, they don’t have that bloody big clock. They haven’t got all those people. Generally speaking though they love it. It’s been what they’ve been wanting to do for years, to get on Countdown. It has an extraordinary following. And, for what? A teapot? Some people have got a tremendous ability in that area [word and number puzzles]. They can just see things. Who is your inspiration? I think Paxman is great on University Challenge. Though he can be hard. Best and worst moments on the programme? The best moments come with having a great rapport with the [special] guests who appear [in Dictionary Corner]. That’s so important, it livens the show up. We have some wonderful people. I loved Michael Whitehall, Jack Whitehall’s dad. He is terribly funny. Ranulph Fiennes is good. Jo Brand – she’s such a sweet, decent woman. The worst is when guests don’t prepare their anecdotes. Some people try to wing it. What’s your favourite quizshow? I love Mastermind. What would be your specialist subject? I was at the same school as James Joyce but I don’t think I’d want to be questioned about Finnegans Wake – too complicated. I could hone up on Jack Kennedy – my generation loved him. And he had a short life too. I was at school when he was elected and of course it was a huge thing if you were Catholic. He was Irish. He was a great man. Are you any good at quizzes? I’m quite good at general knowledge. Do you do pub quizzes? I don’t. I’m not a pub sort of bloke. When I can I do the Dimbleby Cancer Care quiz, which they do every year. It’s great. Do you have any favourite board games at Christmas? From childhood? In the old days we used to play Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit, which is great fun. Quick-fire round Turkey or nut loaf? Turkey! It’s traditional. But actually turkey is pretty boring, you can get stick to death of it. We had goose for a little while, but there’s nothing on them, and they’re terribly expensive. But turkey is a visual feast as much as anything. Queen’s speech or family games? Queen’s speech. She’s fantastic, extraordinary. No, I’ve never met her. I have met Philip, who was fun. Midnight mass or Christmas Eve pub crawl? Midnight mass. We’ve got a beautiful Norman church in our village and it’s only used for that service. Do you prefer to give or receive? It depends who you’re giving to, doesn’t it? I love to give to children. Christmas jumper or a sharp suit? Never a Christmas jumper. They’re horrible. What is all this crap about Christmas jumpers? From the wool industry, undoubtedly. So no, but probably not a smart suit on Christmas day. Somewhere in between, I think. White Christmas or barbecue on the beach? White Christmas. I’ve never been away at Christmas. And certainly not on a beach. Lesley-Anne Brewis The Code, BBC One Co-host with Matt Allwright of BBC One gameshow The Code, in which contestants answer questions to crack a three-digit code, Brewis is also the founder and director of QuizQuizQuiz, a company that hosts corporate quizzes and writes quiz questions. She studied history but after graduating decided her calling was to be a professional quiz mistress. Best thing about your job? I like watching other people succeeding. When people aren’t getting the answers to questions I really want to nudge them in the right direction. Advice for guests on your show? Take a deep breath, keep calm and read the question. If a question has been written well, no word is redundant, there will be breadcrumbs in it, signposts, to help people towards the right answer.. If they miss those clues they may pick the wrong path. Best moment? Every time anyone’s won. There was one contestant called Paul, who was on the show for such a long time, for so many questions. He’s a pilot so we nicknamed him Long Haul Paul. We were all willing him along. When he won it was such a relief. Worst moment? When people are talking themselves out of the correct answer – especially when they’re in pairs or threes. Often the dominant person will lead the others astray. What makes you a good TV quiz host? I often call myself a professional explainer. I like finding the right words and analogies to explain things to people. Matt Allwright, who’s the primary host of The Code, he’s a journalist. He’s great at finding a way into a conversation with people really quickly. I lack those skills. Mine are in facts and information rather than people and personalities. Are you any good at quizzes? I’m not bad. I’m pretty handy at pub quizzes because when there’s no time pressure I am able to examine the question. If you put a buzzer in front of me I fall to pieces. What would your specialist subject be? I was a contestant on a quizshow many years ago where I needed a specialist subject and it was the novels of Jane Austen. This was A Question of Genius. I don’t go on quizshows as a contestant much any more. There was a period when I was at university when I was applying for them all the time. And I’ve won a lot of money from quiz machines. I paid my way through university for a while with pound coins. I once paid a term’s bill with them. I plonked them down at the bursar and said: “I won these in a quiz machine, here you go.” Do you go to pub quizzes? Yes. I met my husband at a pub quiz. He was on my team and we were introduced by mutual friends. It took me a while to warm to him. They used to say when I was at university that in order to go out with me you had to pass a general knowledge test. He definitely did. We have a young son now but before starting our family if we weren’t running a quiz then we were at one every night of the week. Who would be on your dream pub quiz team? I have to say my husband – that’s the rule of marriage, isn’t it? He’s a king quizzer. I’d ask people I know. Someone like David Stainer, one of the highest-ranking quizzers in the UK. Then a mixture of Chasers and Eggheads. Also the comedian Tim Vine. I worked with him several years ago. If he weren’t already a comedian I’d try to employ him as one of my quizmasters… Tips for festive family quizzes? Don’t fall out over the answers! Leave the questions themselves to the professionals, either by buying a quiz pack or something like Trivial Pursuit Family Edition. Balance the teams out: don’t put all the children on one side against the grownups. Quick-fire round Turkey or nut loaf? Turkey. But they can be a bit dry. I’d prefer a nice goose. Queen’s speech or family games? There’s time for both. The Queen’s speech is a tradition but we have our dinner and family games and then watch it on catch-up. You have to watch Doctor Who when it’s on telly though. Midnight mass or Christmas Eve pub crawl? What you want is a pub next to a church. Or midnight mass with a festive quiz. I have once done a Christmas Eve pub quiz. There was one on my road a couple of years ago. My husband and I wiped the floor with everyone so I’m not sure we’ll ever be invited again. I do go to midnight mass but if I knew there was a pub quiz on it would be really tempting. Prefer to give or receive? Oh, I like both. I particularly like to come up with something for my husband that he didn’t know he wanted. Last year I got him a personalised Lego figure that looked like him. He loved it. Christmas jumper or fancy frock? Christmas frock – I don’t often get the chance these days, with my little boy, to really glam up. White Christmas or barbecue on the beach? White Christmas. It may happen. Rick Edwards Impossible, BBC One Impossible involves contestants avoiding giving impossible answers and quizshow host Rick Edwards has also presented Tool Academy, Freshly Squeezed and the London 2012 Paralympics on Channel 4. Edwards studied natural sciences and is co-author with Michael Brooks of Science(ish): The Peculiar Science Behind the Movies (Atlantic), based on their podcast of the same name. Best thing about your job? Spending a lot of time with a bizarre, diverse group of people. We have contestants on for two weeks, so you get this real family atmosphere. The group dynamics are fascinating. What advice would you give guests on the show? There are certain tropes – you should probably know all the character names from The Sound of Music. But by and large you can’t do any useful preparation. I can’t guarantee you’ll win any money, but I can almost guarantee you’ll have a good time – contestants stay in touch and have big Whatsapp and Facebook groups together. Best moment so far on the show? In the first series we had a guy everyone really loved who kept getting through to the final question and not getting the £10,000. He must have been there four times, then on the fifth he got it. There was this euphoric mixture of relief and joy: the other players were glad that a) he’d won the money and b) finally someone else could have a chance. Worst moment? Very occasionally you have a player who none of the other contestants particularly warm to. There was one in particular who was just incredibly smug, and then went on to win £10,000, and was quite smug in victory as well. Everyone in the room was a bit like, [sarcastically] “Oh, yeah, well done.” How about in previous shows? In the first series of Tool Academy [in which men are tricked by their partners into attending a “charm school” to work on their personality], after the reveal, I think we underestimated how angry the “tools” would be. I had to hide in a basement while I could hear it kicking off upstairs. We had more security in subsequent series. What makes you a good TV quiz host? It’s just liking people. If you don’t like people, presenting is a mad thing to do. Who’s your inspiration? This is not a fashionable thing to say, but Michael Barrymore. He’s unbelievable at going into the audience and chatting to people: funny and warm and charming. He really does rip the piss out of them sometimes, but they love it. I’m basically doing my best to channel Barrymore. Favourite quizshow? I really like University Challenge, Only Connect, Pointless. But for nostalgia’s sake I’d go for Fifteen to One – when William G Stewart did it, it was an absolute mainstay in our house. Are you good at quizzes? Slightly better than average. But the first time I went on Celebrity Pointless I did terribly, I panicked – all the lights, the cameras – even though it’s my job. People always say this, but it is very different playing at home. When you’re actually there it’s tough. What would you choose as your specialist subject on Mastermind? Either Liverpool FC in the 80s and 90s, or the history of maths. Do you play quizzes at home? I love a quiz – we watch quizzes on telly and play along. And my friends like them as well, so we often compete against each other on online quizzes, particularly football or sport ones. How about pub quizzes? Yes, although at the moment I haven’t got a regular one. You’ve got to get into the pattern and go every week I think, and you’ve also got to find one at the right level. The last one I did was a bit too easy, and that’s no fun. What’s a good pub quiz team name? There’s a few absolute classics, like Quizzee Rascal. Personally I like Quiz Akabusi. Dream pub quiz team? I’ll have Barrymore, although I’m not sure he’ll offer much in terms of knowledge. Victoria Coren Mitchell – I feel like she knows loads of stuff. And my friend the poet and comedian Tim Key. Not a bad team. Any tips for festive family quizzes? My sister-in-law, Beth, runs their family quiz – she dedicates a good few days to getting the rounds right: some active, some singing. You need to have stuff that’s going to keep people interested. And there’s always going to be arguments, so you’ve got to be ready for that. Best board game to play with the family over Christmas? Scrabble is one of the greats – but with a chess clock to speed things along. Oddly, me and my mum and dad – who are working-class – play a game called Rat Race, which is a sort of capitalist class aspiration game. It is bizarre when you think about it. Quick-fire round Turkey or nut loaf? Turkey. Not that I have a problem with nut loaf but I have the opposite of a problem with turkey – I love turkey. Queen’s speech or family games? Family games. Just not that interested in the Queen. Sorry. Midnight mass or Christmas Eve pub crawl? I’ve done both. Prefer to give or receive? Give. I’m quite hard to buy for, and I’ve always liked getting people stuff. Christmas jumper or sharp suit? Oh Christmas jumper, definitely. Although last year my friend Tim lent me his suit that was made out of Christmas material, and I wore that over a Christmas jumper – so, again, both. White Christmas or barbecue on the beach? I’ve done hot Christmases before but it just feels a bit weird. You want to be snuggling up by an open fire in your Christmas jumper and Christmas suit. Victoria Coren Mitchell Only Connect, BBC Two Victoria Coren Mitchell is a writer, professional poker player and presenter of Only Connect, the quizshow in which contestants make links between apparently unconnected things. Best thing about your job? I don’t really think of myself as having a job. And that’s definitely the best thing about it. Whether you mean specifically Only Connect, or the column I write in this paper, or other TV and writing, or playing “professional poker”, basically it’s all just unemployment with an income. Why are you a good TV quiz host? Sparkly clothes and big boobs. Jeremy Vine tried that for a couple of episodes but it didn’t work for him. If you host a quiz, the viewers spend a lot of time looking at shots of you while the teams try to work out the answers. The more closely you resemble Danny La Rue, the more there is to look at. And, on the current quiz scene, I would say I am the closest. Merry Christmas! Best/worst moments? Best moment: a contestant shouting “COCK, COCK, COCK!” during the missing vowels round when the answer was “CUCKOO, CUCKOO, CUCKOO”. To be fair, he’d been shouting it since round 2. Worst moment: a picture of a pile of steel rods coming up, as a clue to one of the members of the Gang of Four. But David Steel wasn’t in the Gang of Four. It would have taken a seriously good quizzer to figure out that a pile of steel rods was supposed to indicate Roy Jenkins. Your inspiration? Humphrey Lyttelton. He was clever and funny and odd, and you could believe that the quiz wasn’t the most important thing in his life. A quiz shouldn’t be the most important thing in anyone’s life. And he conjured up the filthiest images in the minds of listeners, while never saying anything that couldn’t be repeated in church. Favourite quizshow? I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue. I wish those panellists would come along to play Only Connect; if they did, I’d make sure it was a very difficult episode. Regular viewers will know I like nothing better than to get my hands on a wrinkly old chap and make it as hard as possible. What would your specialist subject be on Mastermind? I would never go on Mastermind. If you’re a quizshow host, you get all the answers in advance and can trick people into thinking you’re clever. Why risk whisking the curtain away? Who would be on your dream pub quiz team? It’s not safe to answer that. Over the course of 13 series of Only Connect I have had about 100 favourites, and they’re all brilliant, so I can’t risk naming three of them. I will say that there is a particular person on the winning team of this year’s OC who I think is very special, and it becomes pretty clear over the course of the series how much I admire them, but the final episode won’t be on TV for some weeks yet so I’d better not say. Tips for festive family quizzes/games? People don’t play Cluedo enough these days. It may be the greatest game of all time. Also, in any game or quiz, it doesn’t matter who wins. It’s amazing how easy it is to forget that in the heat of battle. Quick-fire round Turkey or nut loaf? Turkey. I aspire to be a vegetarian, while secretly hoping I don’t achieve that goal in my lifetime. Queen’s speech or family games? I would say family games but my family don’t play games. Other than idiomatically. Midnight mass or Christmas Eve pub crawl? Ideally, both. Unfortunately I have a two-year-old child. So, neither. Prefer to give or receive? I refuse to answer this question because, as you’ll see from above, I despise innuendo. Christmas jumper or sharp suit/posh frock? A posh frock, which nobody sees all day because I’ve got my apron on. Only Connect: The Official Quiz Book by Jack Waley-Cohen and Victoria Coren Mitchell is out now; the show returns to Monday nights from New Year’s Day Jeremy Vine Eggheads, BBC Two Best known for hosting his own Radio 2 show, since 2008 Vine has also presented the long-running BBC2 quizshow Eggheads in which a team of five top quizzers (including the official world quizzing champion, Kevin Ashman) is challenged by a team of five contestants for prize money. Best thing about your job? Meeting members of the public who love to quiz. What advice would you give to guests who come on your show? Know your capital cities and your currencies, your states of the US and your presidents. Be aware particularly of stuff that’s happened in the past 12 months. We often have people on who are shocked when they’re suddenly asked, for example, who won the Olympic 400 metres two months ago. They assume quiz questions are things you keep in the box for 20 years. Also, if you want to win Eggheads, you’re going to have to take out Kevin. Best moment on the show? We had a period where Kevin didn’t lose a history round or even get a history question wrong for eight years. I began to pump this up, saying, “This is amazing, we’re watching one of the greatest miracles of modern quizzing…” When he then got a question wrong, lost a round and then lost a round again I realised I’d jinxed him. That was very funny. Worst/most embarrassing moment? The most embarrassing was when I mispronounced the name of the band ‘NSync as N-S-Y-N-C. Also, I don’t know whether the question setters were having a little prank day but they had this question which was impossible to read without laughing: “Which world leader was photographed bare-chested in Siberia in 2007 fishing in a river?” and the first choice was Angela Merkel. Your inspiration? Richard Whiteley probably because he managed to do something like seven shows a day and you did feel they were all the first time. He was wonderful. The one I remember watching a lot as a child was The Golden Shot with Bob Monkhouse. A guy had a crossbow and a blindfold on and the contestant had to go, “left a bit, right a bit and fire”, and he fired at an apple. It’s amazing that no one was killed. The idea of someone bringing a crossbow into the Eggheads studio… Favourite quizshow? I enjoy Only Connect without necessarily being able to answer anything. I haven’t got a cryptic crossword brain, my mum and sister have it. Are you any good at quizzes? I’ve got better since I started hosting Eggheads. I know what things come up in quizzes – for example, Greyfriars Bobby, the dog, comes up all the time. Also the fact that John Wayne’s real name was Marion. I’ve got a classic brain that finds something interesting and then digs and digs. The quizzer’s brain is different – they see every fact as being of equal importance because they could all become questions. They’re immersed in everything. What would your specialist subject be? Probably the albums of Joy Division. Do you play quizzes at home? This sounds like a plug, but the Eggheads brought out a book that has all the questions in and I took it on holiday. I was quizzing my family at this restaurant in France and I could see a British couple looking at me thinking: “Bizarre behaviour. He’s obviously not content with being a quizmaster on TV…” They started trying to take photos of me and I realised I mustn’t do that again, or I’ve got to put some brown paper round the book or something. The British have got an unnatural obsession with quizzing. It’s weird. I think British men particularly think that the knowledge of facts gives you social status. Do you go to pub quizzes? I was in a pub recently when a quiz spontaneously started and I hid. There are a couple of areas where I’m in a difficult position and one of them is history. You’ve got to know the order of kings and queens. I didn’t do enough history at school. I’ve got inner pain over it. Who would be on your dream pub quiz team? A celebrity team of women writers that we had on Eggheads about six months ago including the historian Kate Williams, Wendy Holden and Jenny Colgan. Through sheer quiz power they were one question away from beating the eggs. They were amazing. Quick-fire round Turkey or nut loaf? Turkey. If I had nut loaf I think I’d go into cultural trauma because every single Christmas I’ve had turkey. Queen’s speech or family games? You can’t miss the Queen’s speech. Midnight mass or Christmas Eve pub crawl? That’s a very hard question. Christmas Eve pub crawl. Sorry, Christians everywhere. I’d do the pub crawl and then Christmas morning get up and go to church, if I’m able. Prefer to give or receive presents? Always give, particularly when you’ve got young children. The excitement around Christmas now is fever pitch. Christmas jumper or sharp suit? Jumper because that to me says day off. White Christmas or barbecue on the beach? White Christmas every time. One of the many problems of climate change is that I feel I’ve not really had a Christmas Day with snow since I was a child. I also don’t really like people who have barbecues on beaches. That sounds like the beginning of a Radio 2 item… Susie Dent Countdown, Channel 4 Lexicographer Susie Dent is the longest-serving member of Countdown’s on-screen team (her Dictionary Corner is responsible for finding the best possible words each round), having first appeared on the show in 1992. She started working on the comedy spin-off show 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown in 2012. Best thing about your job? The people I sit next to. I have the best seat in the house because I get to sit next to a different guest every week. I have sat next to some of the best comic geniuses in the country. I love that these people have just achieved so many things in their lives. I could be sitting next to [the explorer] Ranulph Fiennes, who is telling stories of amazing feats up a mountain, or I could be sitting next to [science presenter] Liz Bonnin, who has been reporting back from the Galápagos islands. I genuinely never get bored on this show. Why are you a good at being on a TV quiz? Looking words up in a dictionary is not something that many people want to boast about, but I happen to be quite good at it. Before we had the laptop which we use now, we had a massive printed dictionary and I got very fast at looking words up. It’s not a very transferable skill and it’s probably the nerdiest one you can possibly imagine. Best/worst moments? There are often moments where we just collapse into giggles because I don’t know the rude alternative meanings of words. I’m quite prone to piping up and saying things like “Oh, you could have had blowie for six” without thinking about it, and some other things you wouldn’t be able to print. They’re not really bad moments though, they’re just ones where everybody else gets the joke and I don’t. Your inspiration? I am inspired by anyone who is so passionate about what they do, no matter how niche it is, and who doesn’t care if they get labelled as geeky or nerdy – as I’m sure I do all the time. So those people are my inspiration and you can find them in a lot of places. Favourite quizshow? Only Connect. Victoria Coren Mitchell is an inspiration. She is fantastic. It’s just one level up – really challenging – but fun at the same time. Are you any good at quizzes? Not brilliant. I remember going on Pointless and getting very nervous and being weirdly frozen to the spot. I do love quizzes, but I’m better at them when I’m not standing there with a camera looking at me. What would your specialist subject be on Mastermind? Probably trees of the British Isles. I have always been in love with trees. I had one ambition when I was growing up, which was that I would have a garden with a tree in it. And I do have a little fruit tree in my garden now. Do you go to pub quizzes? Yes. They’re a great excuse to get people together and there’s a real community spirit. I love pubs and they need to be celebrated as much as possible. They’re having a really hard time at the moment. What’s a good pub quiz team name? Thunderplump. It’s one of my favourite words, meaning a heavy downfall of rain, but it also sounds like a good team name. Your dream pub quiz team? Jo Brand, Joe Lysett, Richard Osman, Nigella Lawson and Jimmy Carr. Tips for festive family quizzes/board games? There are lots of good word games out there. Scrabble or Boggle or the Countdown one, which comes with real clock sound effects. With words games, be brave and go for it. There are so many words you think could never exist but they actually did four or five centuries ago. The language is vast and so is the dictionary. Quick-fire round Turkey or nut loaf? Nut loaf. I’m vegetarian. Queen’s speech or family games? Family games, though my mum loves the Queen’s speech. Midnight mass or Christmas Eve pub crawl? There’s something special about midnight mass. Prefer to give or receive? I like receiving, but definitely giving. Christmas jumper or posh frock? Jumper all the way. Mince pies or Christmas pud? Mince pies – with lots of brandy butter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/21/catalonia-election-set-to-give-victory-to-pro-independence-parties","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T07:23:03Z","webTitle":"Catalan pro-independence parties keep their majority in snap poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/21/catalonia-election-set-to-give-victory-to-pro-independence-parties","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/21/catalonia-election-set-to-give-victory-to-pro-independence-parties","fields":{"headline":"Catalan pro-independence parties keep their majority in snap poll","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Catalan pro-independence parties have held their absolute majority in snap regional elections, dealing a severe blow to the Spanish government, which had called the polls in the hope of heading off the secessionist push. The deposed Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, described the result as a “a slap to the face” to the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. The three separatist parties won a total of 70 seats in the 135-seat regional parliament even though the centre-right, pro-unionist Citizens party was the single biggest winner, taking 37 seats. Between them, the three parties will have enough seats to reassemble the parliamentary majority that put them into office after the 2015 elections if they can agree a new coalition. However, they once again failed to attract a majority in favour of independence: taking 47.7% of the vote and two seats down in comparison with the last election. Together for Catalonia – the party led by Puigdemont – took 34 seats, the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) took 32 and the far-left, anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy took four. The Catalan Socialist party took 17 seats, while Catalunya en Comú-Podem – the Catalan version of the anti-austerity Podemos party – took eight. Trailing them was the Catalan branch of Spain’s ruling People’s party, which won three seats – eight fewer than in 2015. Thursday’s snap election was called by the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, in October after he used article 155 of the constitution to take control of Catalonia and sack its government over its unilateral referendum and subsequent declaration of independence. The vote, which pitted secessionists against unionists, attracted a record turnout of more than 80%, dispelling fears that holding the election on a weekday rather than the usual Sunday would hit turnout. Puigdemont had been campaigning from Belgium after fleeing to Brussels on the grounds that he would not receive a fair trial in Spain over possible charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. His former vice-president, Oriol Junqeras, leader of the ERC, is in prison along with two prominent pro-independence leaders. Puigdemont said the results had demonstrated the strength of the Catalan people. “As Catalan president I wish to congratulate people for delivering an indisputable result,” he said in Brussels. “We have won this election in exceptional circumstances, with candidates in prison, with the government in exile and without having the same resources as the state.” Marta Rovira, number two on the ERC ticket, said the election showed that Catalans had voted for a republic. She said: “Now we have to reopen parliament and respect the democratic mandate.” But Inés Arrimadas, the leader of the Catalan Citizens party, said of its strong showing: “We have sent a message to the world that a majority in Catalonia is in favour of the union with Spain. For the first time, a constitutionalist party has won a Catalan election.” Xavier Albiol, the leader of the Catalan People’s party, congratulated the Citizens party on its results and conceded it had not gone well for his own party. “It’s been a very bad result for PP but also for the future of Catalonia,” he said. “We have warned of the dangers of a secessionist majority and although they have less support, they will be satisfied.” Miquel Iceta, the leader of the Catalan socialist party, called on whoever becomes the next Catalan president to “reject the unilateral path that has done so much damage”, adding: “What is clear and that the government has to recognise is that the laws can and should be changed.” His sentiments were echoed by the candidate for Catalunya en Comú-Podem. “This country needs to enter a new stage,” said Xavier Domènech. “These elections show that the central government has to enter into a real dialogue.” Much will now depend on what the pro-independence parties agree. Puigdemont is facing arrest if he returns to Spain and fractures have appeared between him and Junqueras, who has appeared to take a more moderate line on independence. The vote is the latest chapter in Spain’s worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago. The results will be bruising for Rajoy and will do nothing to heal divisions in the region, which remains deeply and evenly divided over the independence issue. Any solution to the vexed question of Catalan sovereignty remains as elusive as ever. The pro-independence movement, which has grown over the past five years, raised the stakes in June when Puigdemont announced that a unilateral referendum would be held on 1 October, with Catalans asked: “Do you want Catalonia to be an independent country in the form of a republic?” Despite warnings from the Spanish government and the country’s constitutional court that the vote was illegal, Puigdemont pressed ahead with the referendum, in which 90% of participants opted for independence on a turnout of 42%. The day was marred by violence when Spanish police, who had been instructed to halt the plebiscite, dragged voters out of polling stations, beat them with truncheons and fired rubber bullets. At the end of October, MPs in the regional parliament again defied the central government by voting for independence by a margin of 70 votes to 10 as dozens of opposition MPs boycotted the secret ballot. Rajoy responded by invoking the never-before-used article 155 to take control of Catalonia, sack the regional government and call the elections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/21/the-guardian-view-on-poland-brexit-will-worsen-eu-dilemmas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T18:41:52Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Poland: Brexit will worsen the EU’s dilemmas | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/21/the-guardian-view-on-poland-brexit-will-worsen-eu-dilemmas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/21/the-guardian-view-on-poland-brexit-will-worsen-eu-dilemmas","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Poland: Brexit will worsen the EU’s dilemmas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are no easy choices for European leaders in dismay at the Polish government’s turn away from liberal democracy. To ignore the ruling Law and Justice party’s incursions on judicial independence, signed into effect by President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday, would be to tolerate sabotage of fundamental treaty principles that member states signed up to when joining the bloc. But the sight of western states – above all Germany – berating Poland risks stoking a nationalist backlash that is cultivated by Law and Justice to advance their goal of monopolising power. Amid this tricky transcontinental row, Theresa May flew to Warsaw with senior cabinet ministers, seeking to develop a strategic alliance with Poland ahead of the second phase of Brexit talks. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki obligingly signalled that Poland would back the UK on a bespoke deal, including services. Mrs May offered a security partnership with a country anxious about an ever more assertive Russia. This bilateral bargain is complicated by the European commission’s deep suspicion of UK efforts to negotiate behind its back. It fears that London’s divide-and-rule strategy will work better in the second phase of Brexit talks than in the first, when it hit a wall of pan-EU solidarity. The Tories have made common cause with Law and Justice before. Many European leaders wanted Mrs May to signal her goodwill to them by transmitting in Warsaw their view that Poland has crossed a line. Instead, she described constitutional issues as “primarily a matter for the country concerned, not the EU”. The EU’s response to Poland has so far been gestural. The activation of an “article 7” admonishment does pave the way for material punishments, including the suspension of voting rights; but in practice those measures would be blocked by Hungary. There is a geographical and historical component to these tensions. Former Warsaw pact countries that joined the EU in 2004 feel patronised by longer-standing western members and see double standards. Silvio Berlusconi’s cavalier contempt for media plurality went unpunished. Only this week, Austria formed a government that includes a far-right party with roots in that country’s neo-Nazi movement. Yet the new administration is warmly treated in Brussels because it sounds enthusiastic about the European project. Also, Austria has the euro. The possibility of a premier league of EU states, based around single-currency membership, is much enhanced by Brexit. It leaves Poland as the biggest non-eurozone member. The UK was also a leading advocate of EU enlargement, partly because it wanted a wide and shallow union. Eastern expansion was partly intended as a brake on western-centred integration. Hardly anyone in Brussels welcomes the UK’s departure, but as talks get tough it might increasingly be seen as a blessed relief – the amputation of an infected limb, permitting less inhibited forward movement. British Euroscepticism has been an irritant to EU officials over the years, but it has also been a valuable component in the mix. Brexit is, by definition, a uniquely British phenomenon. But nationalist politicians blaming the EU for domestic woes is not. The Polish government’s undemocratic lurch deserves criticism. The unsolved riddle for Brussels is how to uphold the values on which the EU was founded, using methods that do not cultivate resentment and so further undermine those values."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/quiz-city-vikings-miklagard-caesium-fountain-donkey-jacket","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T07:00:51Z","webTitle":"Whose HQ is the George Bush Center for Intelligence?

Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, said “self-styled evangelicals” risked bringing the word evangelical into disrepute, and added there was no justification for Christians contradicting God’s teaching to protect the poor and the weak. Bayes told the Guardian: “Some of the things that have been said by religious leaders seem to collude with a system that marginalises the poor, a system which builds walls instead of bridges, a system which says people on the margins of society should be excluded, a system which says we’re not welcoming people any more into our country. “Whenever people say those kinds of things, they need to be able to justify that they’re saying those things as Christians, and I do not believe it’s justifiable.” He said he regretted that “people who call themselves evangelical in the US seem to be uncritically accepting” positions taken by Trump and his allies. “Some quite significant so-called evangelical leaders are uncritically supporting people in ways that imply they are colluding or playing down the seriousness of things which in other parts of their lives [they] would see as really important,” Bayes added. He stressed that not all evangelicals were Trump supporters, saying there were “many, many Christians who are trying to proclaim the gospel as we’ve received it, even if that means political leaders have to be challenged”. Last month, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said he could not comprehend the strength of support for Trump among conservative evangelicals in the US. “I really genuinely do not understand where that is coming from,” he told ITV’s Peston on Sunday programme. In his Christmas Day sermon at Canterbury Cathedral, Welby criticised “populist leaders that deceive” their people, in comments interpreted as being aimed at Trump. According to the Washington-based Pew Research Center, 80% of self-identified white evangelical Christians said they voted for Trump in the 2016 election, and three-quarters have since said they approve of his presidency. Bayes, who has been bishop of Liverpool since 2014, said: “If people want to support rightwing populism anywhere in the world, they are free to do so. The question is, how are they going to relate that to their Christian faith? “And if what I believe are the clear teachings of the gospel about love for all, the desire for justice and for making sure marginalised and defenceless people are protected, if it looks as though those teachings are being contradicted, then I think there is a need to say so.” Bayes was speaking to mark the launch of a new Christian charity, which he is chairing, aimed at eliminating discrimination based on sexuality or gender. The Ozanne Foundation will work with religious organisations around the world on LGBTI, gender and sexuality issues, as well as conflict resolution and education. It will be led by Jayne Ozanne, a prominent campaigner for equality within the C of E. Along with Bayes, the charity’s trustees and advisers include David Ison, the dean of St Paul’s Cathedral, Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans, and Martyn Percy, the dean of Christ Church, Oxford. Bayes has previously called for far-reaching change in C of E attitudes to LGBTI people, saying he had been “profoundly changed” by encounters with lesbian and gay Christians, including within his own family. “I have come to believe that we need to change the church,” he said last year. The Ozanne Foundation would provide “strong and clear advocacy, not only for LGBTI inclusion, but against other forms of discrimination and hurt in the church”, he said. “There is room in the church for people who strongly and clearly advocate for change, and I want to support them.” The church’s “institutional inertia” needed to be countered, Bayes added. “There is no doubt that the church at the moment is on a journey, and that journey needs to arrive at a place of inclusion further on than we are at the moment. “What matters to me in terms of my own responsibility and my own advocacy is that we don’t settle for second best, that we keep trying to move the organisation forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/21/very-merry-muslim-christmas-slogan-humanising-muslims-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T16:25:31Z","webTitle":"A very merry Muslim Christmas: the slogan for ‘good’ Muslims | Shaista Aziz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/21/very-merry-muslim-christmas-slogan-humanising-muslims-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/21/very-merry-muslim-christmas-slogan-humanising-muslims-industry","fields":{"headline":"A very merry Muslim Christmas: the slogan for ‘good’ Muslims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It makes a change from the “Muslims are cancelling Christmas” headlines. But “A very merry Muslim Christmas” – the social media slogan for the first report by the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims – still feels reductive: as we approach 2018, humanising Muslims is a trend that isn’t going out of fashion any time soon. The parliamentary group was set up to address Islamophobia, and its report – launched this week with the title Faith as the Fourth Emergency Service – highlights the work of Muslim charities, communities and individuals in helping vulnerable people across the UK. It tells the stories of Muslims volunteering at food banks and assisting in their communities. It draws attention to the sense of duty that many British Muslims have for their country, and how charitable work and giving is part of their faith. But why does this need highlighting? British people who happen to be Muslim have responded with humility and generosity to help people in need, because it is what human beings are programmed to do – including Muslims. We saw this in June, as the Grenfell fire took hold. A group of young Muslim men on their way back from praying in the al–Manaar mosque, during Ramadan, were among the first people to run into the tower to wake up residents and urge them to evacuate. Interestingly, the report made no reference to the British Muslim aid workers who, it emerged last month, have had their nationality stripped in near secrecy while working in Syria, after the Home Office deemed that they posed a security threat. The men deny all the accusations against them. And this is the problem. When the state decides which Muslims it wants to endorse with its rubber stamp and which it wants to reject, it becomes a flawed and dangerous political exercise. Why as a society do we need to humanise Muslims? It is a cottage industry that has come into this own in the past few years. As Islamophobia continues to be mainstreamed, humanising Muslims becomes more of a thing. And to what end? And what purpose does it really serve? As the spoken word poet Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan said in This Is Not a Humanising Poem (which went viral after she performed it at the Last Word Festival in London’s Roundhouse): “If you need me to prove my humanity, I’m not the one who’s not human.” When Muslims do “good things”, the humanising Muslims industry gets to work: we are celebrated and our goodness is pointed out to us and everyone else. We are pitted against those other Muslims – you know the ones who don’t want to integrate and be fully British. When we go surfing (with or without our hijabs) and make people smile and laugh, and when we bake cakes that are not shaped as mosques, we are turned into exceptional human beings and the face of British Islam. We are the good Muslims, the ones you don’t need to be terrified of, or avoid becoming friends with. Ultimately what these narratives are about are attempts to make us more relatable and normal. And this is why these narratives are part of the problem and not the solution. Last weekend I was on a train from Manchester to Oxford. The passenger next to me started spewing random racist comments towards the two Chinese passengers sitting opposite us. She then turned to me and said: “If I was in the country that you come from I would be stoned to death for being a Christian.” After I called her out for her racism she apologised and then asked me if I celebrated Christmas. I responded by telling her: “This is my country, I’m in my country.” And no, I don’t celebrate Christmas in the same way she does, but my family cook a big Christmas dinner with all the trimmings. As she stood up to leave the train I put my hand out and she shook it. I wished her and her family a very happy Christmas. It was my way of humanising a racist. • Shaista Aziz is a standup comedian and former aid worker"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/21/shell-to-supply-energy-to-uk-households-after-takeover-of-first-utility","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T17:31:04Z","webTitle":"Shell to supply energy to UK households after takeover of First Utility","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/21/shell-to-supply-energy-to-uk-households-after-takeover-of-first-utility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/21/shell-to-supply-energy-to-uk-households-after-takeover-of-first-utility","fields":{"headline":"Shell to supply energy to UK households after takeover of First Utility","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell will soon be selling electricity and gas direct to householders in the UK for the first time after buying one of the county’s biggest energy suppliers, First Utility. The acquisition of the largest supplier outside of the “big six” compounds a year of upheaval in the UK energy market, which is already being transformed by the proposed merger of Npower and SSE and the imposition of price caps. Shell has bought First Utility outright for an undisclosed sum, and will be supplying 825,000 households if the deal completes as expected at the end of February. Industry figures said the price was likely in the region of £200m-£300m. The move is the latest in a buying spree by Shell, which has acquired two electric car infrastructure firms in recent months as it diversifies beyond oil and gas. Mark Gainsborough, its executive vice-president of new energies, said: “The supply and demand of residential energy is rapidly changing, driven by new technologies that enable householders to better manage their energy use, and the need for a low-carbon energy system.” Experts said the entrance of Shell into UK energy supply would cause a significant shake-up. Robert Buckley, research director at analysts Cornwall Insight, said: “It clearly is a brand that is an order of magnitude bigger than any other brand coming to UK energy retail. It’s one that will make any competition sit up and take note.” Buckley said it would be a good thing for consumers. “One of the issues that has come up consistently is having confidence in the brand you want to switch to, and people will have heard of Shell and have regular interaction with them through a forecourt,” he said. First Utility, which launched in 2008 and has grown into the biggest independent energy supplier in the UK, has recently diversified, branching out into broadband supply earlier this year. The company said the takeover by Shell would enable it to develop new products for customers, including ones relating to electric car charging. Darren Braham, First’s co-founder, said: “First Utility has brought significant disruption and competition to the energy market and this move will help us to capitalise on all the opportunities provided by digitalisation, decarbonisation and the move to battery technology and electric vehicles.” Shell is entering a market which is under intense political scrutiny and faces the biggest change since privatisation with the introduction of a price cap on default tariffs in early 2019. Of the biggest energy suppliers, First Utility will be less affected by the measure because it has the lowest proportion of customers on tariffs that will be capped – 23% compared to market leader British Gas on 67%. Gainsborough said Shell hoped to increase market share. “We are moving in with ambition to grow significantly over time,” he said, adding that the company was undeterred by the threat of price caps. The reality is the UK is, counter to what many think, it’s a very competitive market for household energy.” Gainsborough continued that it was too early to say whether First Utility would rebrand but in terms of the management team it would be “business as usual” initially. Braham said the sector was in flux and Shell’s scale would help it take advantage of that. “I think there’s a big change in the market with price caps coming, and the big six are quite vulnerable.” He added that the company was also looking to expand internationally to other markets. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/02/trio-trafficked-girls-work-nail-bars-jailed-slavery-laws-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-02T16:29:03Z","webTitle":"Trio who used trafficked girls to work in nail bars jailed under slavery laws","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/02/trio-trafficked-girls-work-nail-bars-jailed-slavery-laws-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/02/trio-trafficked-girls-work-nail-bars-jailed-slavery-laws-uk","fields":{"headline":"Trio who used trafficked girls to work in nail bars jailed under slavery laws","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A woman and man who forced children trafficked from Vietnam to work in nail bars in the UK have been jailed under modern slavery legislation. Police say it is the first time a successful prosecution involving children has taken place since the laws were brought in two years ago. The case centres on girls aged under 18 who were smuggled into the UK and compelled to work for little or no money. Thu Huong Nguyen, known as Jenny, and Viet Hoang Nguyen, known as Ken, were found guilty of conspiring to arrange or facilitate the movement of people for labour exploitation and conspiring to require others to perform forced or compulsory labour at Stafford crown court. Jenny, 48, from Bath, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, while Ken, 29, from Burton-upon-Trent, was jailed for four years. A third defendant, Giang Huong Tran, known as Susan, was found guilty of conspiracy to require others to perform forced or compulsory labour. The 23-year-old from Burton-upon-Trent, was given a two-year suspended sentence. Officers said they believed many more girls and boys were at risk. They hoped the prosecution would send a message to nail bar owners who use children that they would be pursued, as well as alerting customers to the possibility that young people were being exploited. The investigation began when police, immigration officials and staff from the charity Unseen visited nail bars in Bath in February 2016. At the Nail Bar Deluxe premises, in the city centre, they found two Vietnamese girls working on clients’ nails. It emerged they were working 60 hours a week. One was being paid about £30 a month while the second was not paid. They were staying at the four-bedroomed home of the owner, Jenny, in Bath. One lived in a tiny room, while the other slept on a mattress in the attic. Because Jenny was out at the time, officers were able to talk to the girls. DI Charlotte Tucker, who led the operation for Avon and Somerset police, said: “They were extremely vulnerable. They were from impoverished backgrounds in Vietnam and had come to the UK seeking a better life.” The pair were brought into the UK in the back of a lorry. It is not known if they were collected by someone from the nail bar or simply dumped in Bath to seek out Vietnamese people such as Jenny. The nail bar was lucrative. When police raided Jenny’s home, they found £60,000 in £50 notes hidden inside a teddy bear and a cabinet full of designer handbags, some worth thousands of pounds. She also had a string of bedsits in Bath. Tucker said: “She was making a lot of money using cheap or totally free labour. Stashing money away in teddy bears suggests she didn’t know what do with all the cash she was making.” The teenagers were taken into emergency foster care but ran away. “Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence in trafficking cases, as victims are conditioned to feel reliant on those controlling them and compelled to return to them,” said Tucker. They were re-trafficked but were traced to a nail bar in Abbey Arcade, in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire. Two other victims were found there. Tucker said the girls spoke little English. “They were so vulnerable they had no chance of running away. They were not locked up but had nowhere to go. “We want to get the point across to the public that they are hiding their victims in plain sight. When people go and get their nails done there can be a victim there who comes here for a better life, sometimes with debt bondage connected to families back home. They are trapped here. “In the case of nail bars, warning signs could be very young-looking members of staff, low prices, a rapid turnover of staff or controlling behaviour by senior employees. If you have any suspicions, please contact the police.” The case was run as a “victimless prosecution” – more often used in domestic violence cases where the victim does not necessarily cooperate with the prosecution. “They are so conditioned to believe they are not victims. They didn’t see they had been exploited for gain,” said Tucker. Donna King, service delivery manager for the charity Unseen, which works with modern slavery survivors, said there were hundreds, possibly thousands, of girls – and boys – being put to work in a similar way. She said many felt they could not defy those exploiting them for reasons ranging from fear of violence to concerns they would be deported because of their immigration status. • The national 24/7 Modern Slavery Helpline is 08000 121 700"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/22/transplant-patients-christmas-plea-talk-to-your-family-about-organ-donation","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T07:01:46Z","webTitle":"Transplant patient's Christmas plea: talk to your family about organ donation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/22/transplant-patients-christmas-plea-talk-to-your-family-about-organ-donation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/22/transplant-patients-christmas-plea-talk-to-your-family-about-organ-donation","fields":{"headline":"Transplant patient's Christmas plea: talk to your family about organ donation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Families are being urged to talk about becoming an organ donor in the hope that more people on the waiting list for a heart transplant will be given the chance of life. Since last Christmas Day, 31 people have died on the heart transplant waiting list, according to NHS Blood and Transplant. To try to tackle the shortage of organs, the government has recently announced a consultation into an “opt-out” scheme. Everybody would be assumed to be willing to donate their organs unless they had signed up to a register to say no. But the situation is critical now for people like 22-year-old Jim Lynskey from Birmingham, whose heart failed as a result of meningitis, which he contracted as a child. He has an artificial pump to keep his heart going while he waits for a transplant. But last October, it unexpectedly failed. Jim was studying at Sheffield Hallam University when the alarm sounded on his pump. “I heard and felt the pump switch off and I thought ‘this is not good.’ It was shocking because you never expect it to happen. “After the shock wore off I started to feel dizzy and sick, just like I was going to pass out. I called for my friend around the corner to get an ambulance.” He had an urgent 12 hour operation to fit a second pump, called a Left Ventricular Assist Device or LVAD. Jim spent his 22nd birthday recovering from surgery and is temporarily off the waiting list while he recovers. “I can’t receive a transplant this Christmas, but there are around 300 people on the heart transplant waiting list who desperately need that ultimate gift,” he said. “I really want everyone to tell their families: ‘I want to save lives by donating.’ “It’s hard to think about a transplant for myself at the moment because I know it would be a massive operation and I feel it would be the final throw of the dice in a way. “I was told I’d have around three years with the LVAD before I got a transplant and it’s now three years later and to be getting another LVAD instead of a heart is pretty gutting.” NHS Blood and Transplant say it is very important that families discuss donation so that they know who is prepared to donate. Even in an opt-out system, the opinion of the family will be important. “Hundreds of people are spending Christmas waiting for a call that might never come. Their families will be spending the festive period living with fear and uncertainty,” said Sally Johnson, NHS Blood and Transplant’s director of Organ Donation and Transplantation. “We desperately need more people to agree to donation to help with the number of people waiting for hearts and organs of every kind. “Whatever the outcome of the opt-out consultation, if you support organ donation, please act today. Tell your family you want to donate and join the NHS Organ Donor Register.” Steven Tsui, consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and chairman of the NHS Blood and Transplant Cardiothoracic Advisory Group, said the waiting list for heart transplants was steadily growing every year. “A lot of people who could donate do not discuss their wish to be an organ donor with families and friends.

A series of “protected natural areas”, including four national parks, and five reserves for indigenous peoples living in “isolation” could ultimately be impacted. Local, regional and national federations - together with NGOs, relevant state entities and congresspeople - have spoken out against or expressed concern about the proposed law. The main claims: it poses serious threats to the forests, biodiversity and indigenous peoples living in “isolation” and “initial contact”, and it contravenes Peruvian and international laws, trade agreements with the US and European Union, Peru’s international climate change commitments, recommendations by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and a request made by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In addition, it is argued that it has been pushed through Congress with many relevant state entities not formally involved, or ignored, or both. These include the Environment Ministry, the Foreign Relations Ministry, the Culture Ministry, the Health Ministry, the Justice and Human Rights Ministry, the “protected natural areas” agency SERNANP, the ombudsman Defensoría del Pueblo, and the Congress’s Commission on the Environment, Ecology and Andean, Amazonian and AfroPeruvian Peoples. The law was proposed in April this year by congressman Glider Ushñahua Huasanga from the Fuerza Popular party, led by Keiko Fujimori. The aim is to declare “the construction of highways and the maintenance of tracks in the frontier zone of the Ucayali region to be a national priority and in the national interest.” The main stated reason is to make it easier for people living in remote areas to transport their agricultural products to market, thereby boosting trade and economic development. But Julio Cusurichi Palacios, president of indigenous federation FENAMAD and a former winner of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, believes that highways in remote Ucayali would be catastrophic for indigenous peoples in “isolation.” Their existence there and in many other regions has been documented officially by the Culture Ministry, other state entities, and many NGOs and other researchers. At an interview at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn last month Cusurichi said the highways would cause a “genocide.” In a video address published by Peruvian media outlet La Mula, he said that a “genocidal extermination” is possible. Cusurichi told the Guardian that although the proposed law doesn’t specify particular potential highway routes, it must be understood in conjunction with those that have been identified by the Transport and Communications Ministry. They include one running right through the Alto Purus national park and Madre de Dios reserve, both inhabited by indigenous peoples in “isolation.” “That means a highway would bring their deaths,” says Cusurichi, a Shipibo man. “It’s a severe danger.” Other opponents of the highways use similarly alarming language. At a meeting in Congress in October, another FENAMAD representative and congresswoman Tania Pariona Tarqui, from the Movimiento Nuevo Peru party, were both reported saying the highways could cause “ethnocide.” “It is not an exaggeration to talk of ethnocide,” Pariona told the Guardian. “Contact would not only expose the [indigenous peoples in “isolation”] to epidemics and illnesses which their immunological systems can’t cope with, but to dependency. Experience has shown that projects like these end up most benefitting illegal economies like narco-trafficking, timber and mining.” In a statement last month, national indigenous federation AIDESEP, which represents communities throughout the Peruvian Amazon, effectively warned that the highways could bring “extinction.” They argued that the proposed law is a “flagrant violation” of indigenous peoples’ rights and poses a “serious threat to the lives, health, subsistence, integrity and territories” of those in “isolation.” A similar warning was issued this week by the United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz. She released a statement saying that road construction in the past had led to “physical and cultural extermination”, and that the proposed law in Peru now threatens the “very survival” of indigenous peoples in the remote Amazon. Several civil society organisations wrote to congressman Ushñahua in October urging him to “reconsider” the proposed law. ORAU, an indigenous federation representing communities in Ucayali, together with FENAMAD and other groups, informed Ushñahua that the bill violates Peruvian and international law, and that highways can’t be built in national parks or reserves or other areas inhabited by indigenous peoples in “isolation.” Many opponents believe the real motive of some people behind the proposed law is not to encourage economic development in remote areas, but open up otherwise inaccessible indigenous territories to be logged for valuable timber species such as mahogany and cedar, or mined for gold, cleared for oil palm or other monoculture crops, hunted for game and settled. At the same time, it is argued that new highways would facilitate narco-trafficking and other illegal operations. Congressman Alberto de Belaunde, from the Peruanos Por el Kambio party, described the proposed law to the Guardian as “a dangerous incentive putting at risk areas rich in biodiversity and the home of many Peruvian citizens, hiding behind the noble objective of developing the border.” De Belaunde, president of the Congress’s Commission on Justice, says the relevant state entities haven’t been consulted and therefore no “serious analysis” of its impacts has been done. “According to the information I’ve received, the relevant experts, organisations and authorities agree in emphasising the particular importance of most of these border zones,” de Belaunde says. “The experience of the Inter-Oceanica Sur highway should serve as an example that we need to evaluate the impacts of these kinds of measures. I understand from the Culture Ministry that it will request that the Executive Power does not approve the law. I hope that this is what happens, and then parliament can properly analyse the consequences.” Several relevant state entities have expressed concern about the proposed law too. In August, before it was voted on in Congress, the Justice and Human Rights Ministry wrote to Congress’s president, Luis Galarreta Velarde, stating that 10 years ago the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights granted “precautionary measures” and requested that Peru’s government “adopt all the necessary means” to protect the “lives and integrity” of indigenous peoples in “isolation” in one particular region of south-east Peru. Since new highways in Ucayali could affect that region, the Ministry stated it was “necessary” to consider the opinions of the Inter-American Commission before moving forward with the law, as well as that of the Culture Ministry, SERNANP and the Congress’s Commission on the Environment. In early December the Culture Minister sent a report to Galarreta calling the proposed law “not viable” and emphasising the potential impacts on the indigenous peoples in “isolation.” After it was approved in Congress on 7 December, the president of the Congress’s Commission on the Environment, Marco Arana Zegarra, issued a statement saying the Culture Ministry’s opinion had been ignored and the Commission itself “totally rejects” the proposed law. Lorena Prieto, from the Culture Ministry, told the Guardian that highways are particularly dangerous for indigenous peoples in “isolation” or “initial contact” because of their lack of immunological defences, making disease transmission easy and any kind of contact with outsiders potentially fatal. Over the last few 100 years in the Amazon, indigenous peoples entering into sustained contact with “outsiders” have been repeatedly decimated by diseases. “Highways could bring epidemics, illnesses and colonisation in areas where there are people in isolation or initial contact, or other indigenous peoples,” Prieto says. “They could also encourage illegal activities and interrupt subsistence livelihoods, making it difficult for the people in isolation to obtain food.” Peru’s iconic Manu national park and the recently-established Sierra del Divisor national park are among the areas considered potentially threatened by the proposed law, but arguably the most immediately vulnerable are the Alto Purus national park and the Madre de Dios reserve, as FENAMAD’s Cusurichi has emphasised. Purus is the biggest national park in Peru, extending for more than 2.5 million hectares and including the headwaters of major Amazon tributaries. It is “one of the most important and best conserved refuges for different species of endemic and threatened animal and plant species among tropical forests on the South American continent,” according to the 2004 law establishing the park. It is also home to indigenous peoples in “isolation”, including the “Mashco-Piro”, who have attracted increasing media attention in recent years. The province of Purus is effectively cut off from the rest of Peru by different kinds of protected areas: the national park, the Purus communal reserve, and the Murunahua, Mashco-Piro and Madre de Dios reserves for indigenous peoples in “isolation.” The only way in is by small, irregular, expensive planes, or, from Brazil, upriver by boat. A highway would change all that, running from Purus’s capital, Puerto Esperanza, to a town on the border with Brazil, Iñapari. That would connect Purus to the Inter-Oceanica Sur highway and a continent-wide road network spanning Peru’s Pacific Ocean coast to the west and Brazil’s Atlantic Ocean coast to the east. It would also mean cutting right through the Purus park and the Madre de Dios reserve. For years, the most visible local promoter of the Purus highway has been the Catholic priest based in Puerto Esperanza, Miguel Piovesan. In the November 2017 edition of the Journal of Latin American Geography, academic researchers accused the priest of “exploiting his power” by issuing “pro-highway propaganda” in the parish magazine, on the parish website, on local radio, and on banners and placards, and by conflating such propaganda with the Catholic religion. “Jesus Christ, take pity on this town and give us a highway,” reads a message behind the altar in the Puerto Esperanza church reportedly photographed this year. Since 2005 several attempts have been made - and foiled - to legally declare that a Purus highway should be built. Ushnahua’s proposed law is the latest effort. “Purus province (the furthest from the regional capital). . . is only accessible by air or river,” it reads. “This has meant Brazilian influence on culture and education is deep-rooted. The population is mostly indigenous. . . Cashinahuas or Huni-kuy, Sharanahuas, Culinas, Mastanahuas, Ashaninkas, Amahuacas and Yines. . . At the local level, regular transport of both people and goods is done by river, although in many of the low population density areas, like Purus, connection is by air, which raises transport costs. Consequently, infrastructure for transport and basic services is a necessity and can’t be delayed.” Despite such attempts, it has been reported for years that only a minority of Purus’s population is in favour of a highway. Rafael Pino, from SERNANP, director of the Purus communal reserve, told the Guardian the “large majority” of local people don’t think a highway would solve the province’s problems, and only a “small group” - “above all, non-indigenous” - appear to think otherwise. “The majority are in favour of better connection and that’s why Ucayali’s regional government has a project to build a road to connect to Brazil,” Pino says. “But most people understand that a highway to Iñapari isn’t going to solve the basic problems we have in Purus, such as malnutrition or lack of drinking water. Drinking water won’t arrive with the highway. People see that there are better, more viable alternatives to that. There’s just a small group who say “Yes, there should be a highway to Iñapari”, but they only say that because they want to exploit the timber.” Arsenio Calle, also from SERNANP, director of the Alto Purus national park, agrees with Pino. He told the Guardian that FECONAPU, a Purus-based indigenous federation, and most indigenous communities in the region are against the highway. “For Peruvians in general or just a small group of businesspeople?” Calle asks, querying the claim that highways in remote Ucayali would be in the “national interest.” “This isn’t really about national interest. The majority of the local population is against a highway. [Ushñahua’s bill] shouldn’t advance like this. I see no consultation with the relevant authorities. I hope that the Executive Power does not approve it.” AIDESEP, FENAMAD, congresswoman Pariona, the UN Special Rapporteur and others are now urging Peru’s president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, and cabinet to block the proposed law. Kuczynski survived a vote in Congress yesterday to impeach him, following accusations connected to a major Latin American corruption scandal. “Together with the indigenous organisations we are requesting that the Executive Power does not approve the bill and sends it back to Congress for wider debate,” Pariona told the Guardian. Opponents of highways connecting to regions like Purus often emphasise that there are alternatives, if bringing sustainable development to remote parts of the Amazon really is the aim. As Emilio Montes, FECONAPU’s president, reportedly said at the meeting in Congress in October, “development for indigenous peoples doesn’t mean physical connection by road.” Montes, a Huni Kuin or Cashinahua man, was reported to say that there are other ways to connect Purus, either through a river and road network via neighbouring Brazil or subsidised flights. Congressmen like Ushñahua, Montes said, are more interested in promoting “dangerous highways” through indigenous territories than providing “essential basic services.” In a recent interview on Ucayali TV station, UTV, Montes emphasised that alternatives exist and the highway is mainly being promoted by certain congressmen. “We’ve been opposing this kind of development for a long time because of the negative impacts it would bring,” he said. Glider Ushñahua and Miguel Piovesan could not be reached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/31/mollys-game-review-jessica-chastain-aaron-sorkin-poker","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T09:00:26Z","webTitle":"Molly’s Game review – Jessica Chastain is phenomenal in Aaron Sorkin's poker drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/31/mollys-game-review-jessica-chastain-aaron-sorkin-poker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/31/mollys-game-review-jessica-chastain-aaron-sorkin-poker","fields":{"headline":"Molly’s Game review – Jessica Chastain is phenomenal in Aaron Sorkin's poker drama","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"We all know Aaron Sorkin can write. The one-man zeitgeist behind The West Wing, The Social Network, Moneyball, The Newsroom and more, his confrontational style blends skill, smartness and, particularly, showiness in a way that leaves no question about his talent. But can he direct? Having now watched his directorial debut twice, I am still not entirely sure that he can. Most certainly he can put together a slickly entertaining story: Molly’s Game, based on the autobiography of disgraced “poker princess” Molly Bloom, rattles along nicely. He can offer us a privileged vantage point from which to gaze into the closed world of the high-stakes poker games that Bloom runs. He can most certainly tell a story. But this is a story that is told primarily with words rather than pictures. This is film-making that is almost slavishly in service of the screenplay. It’s essentially a display cabinet for Sorkin’s dialogue. There is barely a shot or a cut that isn’t dictated by Molly’s silky narration. Cinema is, or should be, a visual medium. At times, it almost feels as though you could watch the film with your eyes closed and not miss out on much of its meaning. But if Sorkin is perhaps a little too in thrall to his own writing, that doesn’t change the fact that the writing is first rate. At his best he seems like the natural heir to the crackling screwball sensibility that powered 1940s classics such as His Girl Friday and The Lady Eve. Not so much in terms of comedy – although the film bristles with wit, it is rarely laugh-out-loud funny. But the screwball influence is present in the breakneck pacing of the line delivery, the intellectual cut and parry, and the brilliant female protagonist who runs rings around most of the men in the film. Like Rosalind Russell’s reporter Hildy Johnson in His Girl Friday, Molly is a fiercely ambitious woman who has carved her place, with biting charm and sharp fingernails, in a man’s world. Like Barbara Stanwyck’s card-sharp con artist Jean Harrington in The Lady Eve, she has found a way to profit from the weaknesses of others. In the central role, Jessica Chastain is, quite simply, phenomenal. If the screenwriting takes the starring role in this film, that’s only because so much of it is delivered by Chastain. She can take a line which is so written that you can subliminally hear Sorkin’s fingers tapping on his keyboard, and deploy it with such confidence and authority that we don’t even think to question its credibility. Molly Bloom is pretty much an archetypal Chastain role. She’s a human smart bomb who uses her intelligence as a weapon. High achieving doesn’t even come near the stellar ambitions that she harbours. Formerly a freestyle skier who hoped to compete at the Olympics, Bloom is driven to succeed. Her introduction to the world of high-stakes private poker games comes through her employer, a boorish bully of a Hollywood film producer who criticises her “ugly dress, ugly shoes”. She quickly realises that to make it in this world of spoilt super-rich boys and their ruinously expensive games, she needs to brand herself as the ultimate unattainable luxury item. With a face which is all hard angles, like the facets of a diamond, and hair with the shine of a jaguar’s pelt, Molly looks like money. Sorkin’s main skill as a director is that he is able to negotiate the complex structure of the narrative and keep all the juggled story elements aloft. We see Molly’s life through flashbacks, both to her childhood (Kevin Costner makes a forceful impression as Molly’s overbearing father) and to her days running the most exclusive poker games in town, first in Los Angeles and later in New York. Meanwhile, exposition is deftly delivered through Molly’s meetings with her attorney Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), who is representing her in the court case which is the result of an FBI investigation. And these are the moments in which the film fully ignites. Elba is as good as I have ever seen him. Jaffey has a peppery impatience, which makes him a perfect foil for Molly’s quicksilver intellect. Their sparking, firecracker scenes together are so deliciously bracing, you rather wish there were more of them. The thrill of watching two actors at the absolute top of their game is Sorkin’s winning card."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/22/uk-household-spending-slows-lowest-level-almost-six-years","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T10:28:11Z","webTitle":"UK household spending slows to lowest level in almost six years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/22/uk-household-spending-slows-lowest-level-almost-six-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/22/uk-household-spending-slows-lowest-level-almost-six-years","fields":{"headline":"UK household spending slows to lowest level in almost six years","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Spending by UK households slowed to its lowest level in almost six years during 2017 as the impact of higher inflation hit living standards and forced people to prioritise their basic needs. The latest official figures show that consumers spent less on restaurants and hotels in the three months ending in September, but more on food, rent, fuel bills and transport. The Office for National Statistics said household spending rose by 0.5% in the third quarter, but was just 1% higher than a year earlier – the slowest annual growth since early 2012. Living standards have been squeezed as a result of the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016. The annual inflation rate has risen from below 1% to more than 3%, while earnings have been growing at an annual rate of just over 2% despite a steady fall in unemployment to a 42-year low of 4.3%. Economists said there was some evidence from the ONS data of a rebalancing of the economy away from consumption and toward the other components of growth. Growth in business investment during the third quarter was revised up from 0.2% to 0.5%, while net trade – which measures the difference between import and export growth – ceased to be a drag on the economy. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK said: “The final figures for the third quarter paint a picture of a significantly weaker domestic economy but a more positive exports performance. Weaker government spending and a marginal downward revision to consumer spending were offset by an upward revision to investment and a rise in exports, as companies took advantage of the weak pound and bourgeoning growth momentum in many of the UK’s key trading partners. “Consumer spending was a key driver of growth in the third quarter, however the rise in spending centred on households’ basic needs such as electricity, gas and fuel, as well as housing rent and transport. Spending on discretionary treats like restaurants and hotels actually declined, as a squeeze on real incomes made consumers more careful with their spending.” In its latest update on the state of the economy, the ONS reported growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, unchanged on its previous estimates but slightly higher than the 0.3% recorded in each of the first two quarters. Revisions to previous data meant, however, that annual growth in the year to the third quarter has been adjusted up from 1.5% to 1.7%. The City is expecting the economy to expand by 0.4% in the final three months of 2017, making the UK one of the slowest growing members of the G7 group of leading industrialised nations. The eurozone grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of the year. The ONS said the 0.5% increase in household spending between the second and third quarters was the result of consumers running down their savings. Consumer spending was strong in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, growing by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2016, but has since expanded more slowly. Paul Hollingsworth, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, said the ONS figures revealed a more balanced growth picture, with household spending revised down but business investment revised up from 0.2% to 0.5%. “The economy looks to have maintained this pace in Q4,” he said. “This should mean that GDP growth for 2017 as a whole should come in at about 1.8%.” The ONS’s head of national accounts, Darren Morgan, said: “Today’s unrevised third quarter figures show most of the growth came from the dominant service sector, with accounting, recruitment agencies and retailing all performing well. “Manufacturing also boosted growth thanks to an increase in exports and the introduction of new car models. Meanwhile, household spending and business investment both grew steadily.” Britain’s balance of payments deficit with the rest of the world narrowed from 5.1% of GDP in the second quarter to 4.5% in the third quarter. The improvement was mainly the result of UK investors securing higher returns on their overseas holdings than overseas investors made on their holdings in Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/22/isis-crushed-in-iraq-and-syria-says-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T08:50:17Z","webTitle":"Isis crushed in Iraq and Syria, says Theresa May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/22/isis-crushed-in-iraq-and-syria-says-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/22/isis-crushed-in-iraq-and-syria-says-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Isis crushed in Iraq and Syria, says Theresa May","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Islamic State has been crushed in Iraq and Syria, Theresa May has said. She told troops at a Christmas address in Cyprus that the jihadi group nolonger held any significant territory thanks to efforts by British forces. Standing in front of a Typhoon fighter to speak to 100 servicemen and women at RAF Akrotiri, the prime minister was bullish about the military’s success in Operation Shader against Isis, or Daesh as it is known in the Middle East. “Let’s be clear just what a difference that has made,” she said. “Just three years ago, Daesh declared a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, a safe haven in which to carry out the most barbaric acts and in which to plot murder on our streets at home. “But today, thanks in very large part to your efforts, the so-called caliphate has been crushed and no longer holds significant territory in Iraq and Syria. You should be incredibly proud of that achievement.” The base in Cyprus is at the heart of the UK’s operations in Iraq and Syria. It is home to 2,000 military personnel and has been the launch point for more than 1,300 sorties to Iraq and more than 250 to Syria since the action against Islamic State began. Only the US has carried out more airstrikes. May said British military intervention was still needed in the region to ensure Isis didn’t regroup or a new similar force emerge. She referred to her recent visit to Baghdad to see the training of Iraqi security personnel. “While we need to deal directly with the threat they still pose in the region, we also need to focus on training the Iraqi security forces to keep Daesh out,” she said. “As conflicts and tensions fuel instability across the Middle East, it is not just the security of that region which is threatened, it is the whole international order on what global security and prosperity depends.” May said Isis would still seek “new ungoverned spaces from which to plot and carry out attack” and that it was vital for Britain to continue to support the stability of its allies in the Middle East. The prime minister said 2018 would be a special year because it marked the RAF’s centenary and the 100th anniversary of the armistice that brought the first world war to an end. She said today’s RAF personnel were “present day pioneers of the world’s most iconic air force”. “It is you, your professionalism, your courage and your sacrifices that give meaning to the pledges we make as a nation,” she said. “It is you who take down our enemies and stand by our allies when the going gets tough. “I hope that as a nation in this special year ahead we can collectively raise the national consciousness of the work you do and the sacrifices that you make in the service of others. As prime minister I will do everything I can to lead the nation in this endeavour.” Wishing the troops and their 3,000 family members on the base a merry Christmas, May said they were “the pride of our nation and that is how you should be treated”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/11/housing-association-merger-will-lead-to-social-cleansing-warn-tenants","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T14:39:53Z","webTitle":"Housing association merger will lead to social cleansing, warn tenants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/11/housing-association-merger-will-lead-to-social-cleansing-warn-tenants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/11/housing-association-merger-will-lead-to-social-cleansing-warn-tenants","fields":{"headline":"Housing association merger will lead to social cleansing, warn tenants","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tenants in west London have warned that a plan to create one of the UK’s biggest housing associations will lead to the social cleansing of poorer families from wealthy areas. The proposed merger between London-based housing associations Notting Hill Housing (NHH) and Genesis, would create a mega landlord with a combined annual turnover of £676m and 65,000 homes in management, many in sight of Grenfell Tower, which was destroyed by fire in June. But the associations have between them sold off 800 street properties in the last five years and used the proceeds to build more homes in cheaper areas, leading to fears that further sell-offs are planned. Residents from both organisations, including the Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, an NHH resident, fear the merged group will be less accountable, more commercial and intent on accelerating schemes that price out poorer families from inner London. The deal is being seen as a symbol of how far housing associations have drifted from their philanthropic origins, and there is growing unease about “forced gentrification”, which has been highlighted by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. In the last two years NHH and Genesis have also converted 1,322 homes let at social rents (typically well below half the market rate) into “affordable” lets (which charge up to 80% of market rates). As part of the drive to build more homes, housing associations must relet homes at these higher rents in order to qualify for housing grants. Campaigners say housing associations like NHH and Genesis are eager to comply with the requirement as it allows them to increase their portfolios and sell off, or “sweat”, their inner London assets. The associations say they are working to address residents’ concerns. In NHH’s case, when homes have switched to “affordable” status, the weekly rent on a two-bedroom property has risen by an average of 47% to £213.54 a week. But there is a growing political backlash. “No social cleansing. No jacking up rents,” Corbyn pledged in his speech to the Labour party conference. And the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has just blocked plans by Genesis to redevelop the Grahame Park estate in Colindale, north-west London, because the scheme would have involved a net loss of 257 homes on social rents. Dent Coad said: “Social cleansing is happening because people are moved out. The rate of conversion from social rent to affordable rent is proof of that.” She shares the fears of tenants such as NHH tenant Gemini Verney-Dyde and Genesis tenant Tim Baster, who claim this process will increase after the merger. “The merger will give them further power to carry on in the same vein but on an escalated level,” Verney-Dyde said. Baster said: “They are cross-funding their commercial operations by selling or converting existing social homes. This is social cleansing as they are selling homes in the richer parts of London.” He and Verney-Dyde claim tenant consultation on the merger has been a sham, with the associations determined to push ahead despite tenant unease. They have collected the names of 1,000 tenants opposed to it. Dent Coad cited the proposed merger and concerns about the reduction of social housing in her report about the growing inequality in the area around Grenfell Tower. The MP, who fought a five-year legal battle with NHH over her own shared-ownership home, claims housing associations are ignoring residents’ concerns. “They have been complicit in allowing housing to be seen as a financial asset rather than somewhere where people live. The attitude of disdain is long ingrained. Things have to change after Grenfell and they will, and the merger is a huge test of that.” Karen Buck, Labour MP in the neighbouring constituency of Westminster North, agrees. “One of the things that Grenfell revealed is the very strong disconnect between so many housing providers and their residents,” she said. Buck met managers at Genesis this month to convey her worries about the merger. She said: “I have had a concern for a long time that both Genesis and Notting Hill, both of which started as a response to the slum conditions in the 1960s, have lost their mission to meet housing needs among the low-income people in inner London.” Genesis managers insisted that the combined financial strength of the new group would allow them to slow or halt the sale of social rented homes in inner London. Separate statements from NHH and Genesis said the merged organisation would be able to deliver more new homes than they can separately. They gave no commitment about the tenure of homes. Both said they were committed to resident involvement. Genesis said residents opposed to the merger had rejected its offer of talks. NHH said: “We appreciate that some people are concerned – that’s not unusual when things change – and we are working hard to address and alleviate those concerns.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/14/i-need-my-family-how-a-refugee-held-on-nauru-is-struggling-to-make-a-new-life-in-cambodia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T21:05:26Z","webTitle":"'I need my family': how a refugee held on Nauru is struggling to make a new life in Cambodia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/i-need-my-family-how-a-refugee-held-on-nauru-is-struggling-to-make-a-new-life-in-cambodia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/14/i-need-my-family-how-a-refugee-held-on-nauru-is-struggling-to-make-a-new-life-in-cambodia","fields":{"headline":"'I need my family': how a refugee held on Nauru is struggling to make a new life in Cambodia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Abdullah leans against a scooter on a Phnom Penh backstreet and blows kisses into his smartphone. “Be patient, soon we’ll be together again,” he tells the video image of his wife and three children. But as soon as he hangs up his smile flickers away. He was detained for two-and-a-half years in an Australian-run detention centre on the island nation of Nauru and hoped that moving to Cambodia would enable him to be reunited with his family. That has not happened. Since he arrived in Cambodia in November 2016, he has settled down in the capital, opened a restaurant, started working out and looks ready to put a “hellish” chapter of his life behind him. Still, the prolonged insecurity weighs heavy on his already frail nerves. “I think I can have a good life in Cambodia,” he says. “But without my family I’m just drifting along, with no real control of my life.” Cambodia’s agreement to take refugees from Australian-run detention centres predates Australia’s deal with the US – the one agreed by the Obama administration that Donald Trump protested against. In 2014, Australia and Cambodia reached a $55m deal to transfer people whose refugee status had been determined. Three-and-a-half years later, only seven detainees have taken up the offer. Four of them left Cambodia within a year. Abdullah is focused on making Cambodia his home. For his first four months in Cambodia he stayed in a compound run by the International Organisation for Migration mission in the country. There he was taught about Cambodian culture and language. After that he got his own place from where he could roam around, get to know the locals and find a good place to set up his restaurant. He opened his restaurant in August. It took only a month to get his licence and his suppliers agreed to give him a few months to get started before they would expect repayments. “My children have all grown up without me being there,” he says. “I can’t understand how that’s happened. Our relationship is the same but my life is radically different. “I didn’t see any other solution than Cambodia. We had several meetings where we discussed different offers. My only condition was that they bring my family. Now it’s taken over a year and they’re still telling me to wait, without giving me any reason why. I can’t understand why Australia is doing this to me. “I can have a good life in Cambodia but I need my family.” Arranging for his family to come a considerable challenge for Abdullah to undertake on his own. Neither his wife nor children have passports and war is tearing up their home country of Syria. That is why they fled in the first place. From a neighbouring country (details are being withheld at Abdullah’s request), Abdullah went on, in search of a safer existence, leaving in early 2013. “When people told me about the journey to Australia I thought they were joking,” he says. “My brother lives there but he arrived the regular way. Travelling by boat without a visa sounded crazy.” After a terrifying journey and half a year’s detention on Christmas Island, Abdullah was transferred to Nauru. There, crowded tents awaited under a scorching sun. Time ground to a halt. “Everybody got pills to silence their minds and to sleep,” he says. “But at night I heard people trying to hang themselves. Two times I saw people burn to death. They said they were going to do it beforehand but the employees didn’t care.” On a calm Phnom Penh morning, Abdullah prepares a plate of hummus with minced meat. His movements in the kitchen are measured and experienced. Back in Daraa, in Syria, he used to be a baker. Now, with the help of private loans and aid from the Australian government, he has opened a Middle Eastern restaurant right next to a stretch of hip expatriate bars. It is off to a good start, even though someone started spreading malicious rumours he was actually an ex-inmate of Guantánamo Bay. But challenges like that pale in comparison to what he has been through. “I honestly don’t know how I made it through Nauru,” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/22/annus-horribilis-theresa-may-shrugs-off-talk-of-tough-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T22:00:04Z","webTitle":"Annus horribilis?

Theresa May shrugs off talk of tough 2017","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2017, Theresa May lost her majority and three cabinet ministers, and her Conservative conference comeback speech was dogged by a prankster and a coughing fit. But on Friday the prime minister shrugged off the idea that it had been her annus horribilis. On a visit to Poland and Cyprus, May also joked about a slip during her press conference in Warsaw when she was referred to as “Madam Brexit” and said she did not want her time in Downing Street to be known solely for Britain leaving the EU. Speaking before her final official visit of the year, to RAF Akrotiri, May brushed off the suggestion that 2017 had been the hardest year of her career. “If you look at what’s happened over the past couple of months, we have made sufficient progress on the Brexit negotiations, we have had a good budget that is building a Britain that is fit for the future,” she said. May said the budget had delivered new funding to the health service and housing, and she cited the government’s industrial strategy as an “absolutely crucial plan and part of actually ensuring that our economy does meet the needs of the future and is providing the jobs of the future for the people in the UK”. The prime minister, speaking on board an RAF Voyager en route to Cyprus, said she intended to make a number of key international trips in 2018, to emphasise both trade and defence and security cooperation. She is set to make her first official visit to China early in the new year. May said she was amused when she heard herself referred to as “Madam Brexit” in Poland. “You might have noticed I smiled when I heard the translation,” she said. “Look, I am going to deliver on Brexit. That is undoubtedly the case, but I am doing other things as well. If you look at the changes we are making on skills, education and training, for example.” May has previously insisted she plans to lead the Conservatives into the general election in 2022, and on Friday she said that was still her intention. “I’m in it for the long term,” she said. “I’m here to do the job that I believe needs to be done and that’s what I’m going to focus on. I’m doing the job that I believe is right for the British people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/25/ngv-triennial-an-arresting-exploration-of-identity-and-exile","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T21:00:01Z","webTitle":"Skull and bones: Ron Mueck's outsized installation gets under the skin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/25/ngv-triennial-an-arresting-exploration-of-identity-and-exile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/25/ngv-triennial-an-arresting-exploration-of-identity-and-exile","fields":{"headline":"Skull and bones: Ron Mueck's outsized installation gets under the skin","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If there’s one immediate theme of the National Gallery of Victoria’s Triennial exhibition, it’s an arresting exploration into the symbolic power of spatial relationships. It’s an appropriate concern to exhibit within the NGV International building. The visage of the NGV’s vast, flat-walled fortress rises from a dark corner of prosperous St Kilda Road, hoarding its treasury of precious objects as the visible corner of a triangle unites the green, organic expanse of the Botanical Gardens with the cold, pale bones of the War Memorial ahead. There’s more than a little symbolic consideration within the Triennial of how artistic intrusion into the creation of spaces can spawn new worlds, and how moving through the rooms created by artists can be an experience of both transformed perspectives and cultural instruction. There’s always been something Tardis-like to the layout of the NGV’s wings, multiple floors and unexpected corridors, and its spatial playfulness is well indulged by Triennial work. Shilpa Gupta and Pae White’s untitled installations, and Yayoi Kasama’s Flower Obsession, alternatively allow viewers to be absorbed into a sonic immersion, find themselves lost in a sudden wilderness of tricks with line perspective or become part of an artwork they’re empowered to cover in flowers. Reclining in the entrance hall is Xu Chen’s giant figure of an iconic sleeping Buddha. The sleeping godhead’s potential to recontextualise an artistic gallery as a recognisably religious one is frustrated by the presence of figurative sculptures styled from the western classical canon, who perch and pose on Buddha’s limbs. The questions provoked: is the Buddha a dream of the western canon, is classicism a dream of the Buddha, or does the juxtaposition of two aesthetic traditions harmonising within a gallery space speak to a dream from the artist or the viewers? It’s an appropriate visual welcome to an exhibition of 100 international artists, drawn from across diverse forms of artistic practice as well as identity, nationhoods, generations and experience. Yet the centrepiece of the exhibition, Mass, created by Australian/UK artist Ron Mueck, provides a staggering, simple, brilliant symbolic unification of the common humanity contained within. The artist, known for his hyper-real sculptural techniques, has created 100 precise, outsized replications of human skulls. A pile of these are “massed” in a room within the NGV’s heritage wing – their chalky, jawless bones gathered beside 18th century oil paintings that depict bewigged, white European people, represented at the height of their power and prestige. A portrait of the feted castrato, Farinelli. A painting by Tiepolo. Mueck’s inspiration for the work was a personal reverence for the visual unambiguousness of the skull. “The sight of a skull grabs us at an unconscious level,” he says. “Even as children we know what it is, what it means. It attracts and repels simultaneously. In archeology, forensics or investigative journalism, the image of a group of skulls begins to suggest a story. Often an unsettling one.” As a contrast to the objects celebrating the vanity of the imperial cultures that sit around them, the skulls radiate a potent narrative for their Melbourne context. The NGV may be a bone-house of western treasures but it squats on the land of an Aboriginal genocide. The catalogue notes remind us that Australia houses the world’s second largest proportional population of Jewish Holocaust survivors, as well as a considerable refugee population from the genocide in Cambodia. NGV director Tony Ellwood has identified that a repeating subject within the Triennial is “the movement of people across borders”, which he says is “the defining issue of our times”. Mueck’s Mass reminds the viewer that multiculturalism itself is created by forces of dispossession, resettlement and exile, and the wealth required to afford the self-flattery of 18th century portraiture was won by a colonial project of brutal expansionism that birthed a legacy of bone-piles throughout the world. It is a devastating artwork – monumental and polyphonic. In a Triennial of so many engaging and interesting contributions, Mass poses the harshest questions of the politics of the very notion of a gallery space in itself. The skulls offer a question implicit – and so often unacknowledged – within every collection of precious, guarded things: what terrible thing has happened here?. It’s a reminder echoed in full voice by the explicit protest of Triennial artists who have been renaming their artworks “Wilson must go” to protest that the same security service retained to guard the exhibition, Wilson, also provides the guards for Australia’s brutal offshore refugee camps. Here, in the country that created the camps, the empty eyeholes of Mueck’s skulls face outwards to the oil paintings that surround them, through the bodies of those who view them. “These images can stir fear and sympathy and guilt,” says Mueck of the fleshless, indistinct heads of human dead. “We think of disease, war and atrocity. Of terrible past events and those still to come.” “In these piles of human remains we recognise ourselves,” he says. “These were people. People like us. They are us.” The NGV Triennial runs until 15 April.

Perhaps more than any other living Australian, Chubb has dedicated his life to championing science. But now the neuroscientist, the former chief scientist, the tertiary education guru and the dedicated advocate for scientific research and education thanks Australian science for every breath he takes. “I was told that without treatment I had a few months,” Chubb says matter-of-factly. He had been diagnosed with stage-four metastatic kidney cancer. It had spread to both his lungs. With the standard treatment, only 8% of patients with that diagnosis live more than five years. But now, as far as he and his oncologist can tell, he is completely cancer-free. An experimental drug – one of a class of “immune checkpoint inhibitors” that unleash the body’s own killer immune cells on to the cancer – has wiped away any trace of Chubb’s previously very advanced cancer. Chubb’s experience, while still not representative of the majority of patients, is an increasingly common story from the world of cancer immunotherapy, which is revolutionising the field of oncology. In championing Australian science, Chubb has often mentioned the astounding insights researchers have gained by studying cancer. But now it is no longer an academic curiosity for him. Those insights he championed have saved his life. The story of how those very insights were leveraged into a potential cure for his own cancer can be traced back to the early work of one of Australia’s most celebrated living scientists, the nobel laureate Peter Doherty. If Chubb needed any more reason to continue championing science, this was surely it. From death sentence to reprieve In late 2015 Chubb was working as hard as ever as Australia’s chief scientist – travelling around the country and broader region delivering talks and meeting with politicians – when he found his life thrown under a cloud. During a relatively routine prostate examination, a strange mass was noticed on one of his kidneys. After a series of investigations it was found to be cancer and the kidney was removed. For a few brief months things looked good. But routine follow-up tests quickly showed that his cancer had returned, with several tumours in both his lungs. Yet further tests showed it was growing rapidly. Chubb’s oncologist told him about what chemotherapy would involve. It wasn’t a good prognosis. The standard chemotherapy for metastatic kidney cancer (kidney cancer that has spread around the body) has no significant effect on a patient’s survival. Most live for about two years after diagnosis. After five years, about 92% of patients have died. The treatment – a chemotherapy drug called Sunitinib – does delay the cancer’s progression, often improving quality of life. It’s undoubtedly a grim outlook. While telling Chubb about the chemotherapy treatment, his oncologist called Howard Gurney, the director of medical oncology and clinical trials at Macquarie University in Sydney to find out what trials might be available. Chubb was admitted to a trial of an experimental immunotherapy treatment called Atezolizumab or Tecentriq, manufactured by the pharmaceutical giant Roche. In this trial, the drug was combined with another of Roche’s drugs, Bevacizumab, also known as Avastin. But one day, shortly before the trial began, Chubb found he couldn’t walk more than 100 metres without running out of breath. It turned out his lungs were filling with fluid. Chubb had 2.5 litres of the fluid drained to alleviate the symptoms, and Gurney told him there was a chance the first treatment of his experimental drug would put an end to the fluid build-up. He was right – within weeks of the first treatment, Chubb was free of all his cancer-related symptoms and would soon be in complete remission. “Cure” is not a word oncologists use lightly. But Gurney lets the word pass his lips. “For the first time, we’re getting patients where the cancer is just gone – you can’t see it any more,” Gurney says. “So the big question is whether people are going to be cured. We think probably some will be. “Is Ian cured? Maybe he is.” But Chubb’s experience is far from universal. As he explains, he is one of the lucky ones. Unless accepted into a clinical trial, the costs of these revolutionary treatments are prohibitive for most. And even when people do get free access to them through a trial, previous studies suggested perhaps only about one in 10 would be as lucky as Chubb, and find themselves in complete remission. Some others would see some improvement, while many see no benefit at all. But patients like Chubb are some of the first to be given these medications, and represent the first demonstration of the potential power of using the immune system to fight cancer. It was a long road to get here but researchers say there is reason to hope their effectiveness could be increased further. The trial Chubb is on is part of the next stage of discovery, with combinations of two or more drugs, including immunotherapy, holding promise to help more patients. Taking control of killer T cells As a former Australian chief scientist and former vice-chancellor of the Australian National University, Chubb regularly mixes with many of Australia’s most impressive minds. And, not long after he had started treatment, he was at an event marking the 20-year anniversary of the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine being awarded to the Australian veterinarian and medical researcher Peter Doherty. As he greeted and spoke with Doherty, running through Chubb’s veins was a drug that owed its existence to the work that won Doherty the Nobel prize. “I said to him, I have just started getting treatment that very much builds from the work that he did decades earlier,” Chubb says. Doherty is humble about his role in the revolution that is now taking place in cancer treatment but there is no doubt that his work, conducted in Canberra in the 1970s, allowed all the work that followed and eventually resulted in these drugs being produced. “What they’re doing with Chubb, they’re switching on the killer T cells that are already in his body,” Doherty says. T cells, or T lymphocytes, are a type of immune cell that travels around the body and kills off infections. Doherty’s big breakthrough was working out how the body alerts T cells to viral infections, allowing them to kill infected cells. “If infected by a virus, they carry a bit of the virus to the cell surface – a peptide – which tells the killer T cells that they have been modified and need to be killed,” Doherty says. He says that turned the previous understanding of how the immune system worked “on its head”. Until then, most researchers thought T cells’ major role was in killing cells from a foreign individual, or perhaps cells that were significantly mutated. That was hinted at by the way they were known to kill tissue transplanted from one person into another. But Doherty’s work revealed they were a surveillance system that could distinguish between “self” and “non-self” cells, including “altered-self” cells, which is what happened when viruses infected a cell. The mechanisms Doherty and his colleagues discovered that allowed T cells to do that have since led to an understanding of how some cancer cells avoid triggering killer T cells and, in turn, to these new medicines, which manually trigger them. Later developments discovered a number of ways that T cells are turned on or off, including one mechanism, called “programmed cell death 1”, which some healthy cells use to switch off, and sometimes even kill, T cells. Researchers discovered that some cancers, as they mutate and evolve, have stumbled on that same mechanism and avoid the immune system by calming killer T cells using this programmed cell death 1 mechanism. When that happens, the T cells recognise the cancer cell as foreign but, when they approach it, they are switched off by a molecule sitting on the cancer cell’s surface. The drug Chubb has been on, Atezolizumab, blocks the molecule on cells, including the cancer cells, that causes this truce with the T cells. Called a “checkpoint inhibitor”, it blocks a checkpoint the body sometimes uses, to tame the immune system. The risk with doing that is that T cells might then attack healthy cells in the body, causing an autoimmune disorder. The advantage of Atezolizumab, compared to earlier drugs that acted in a similar way, is that early signs suggest it less commonly causes severe autoimmune symptoms. “The most common side-effect is a rash,” Gurney says. “In that case, the immune system is attacking the skin.” It quite often causes tiredness and a number of other relatively mild side-effects. Chubb, for example, says he has lost some of his sense of taste and initially experienced severe tiredness. Gurney says fewer than 5% of people require steroids to manage those side-effects, which usually solves the problem. But in about 1% of patients severe autoimmune reactions can occur, where the heart, kidney, brain – or any other important organ – can become inflamed. But the bigger problem is the limited number of people for whom the drug has such a dramatic effect. Only about 10% of people appear to go into complete remission and, depending on the precise cancer and the exact drug used, as many as 30% get some benefit from immunotherapy. Doherty says the way to solve that may well be to combine different drugs, perhaps different immunotherapies. “A lot of the research at the moment is focusing on how to improve the success rate up from 20% or 30% up to 100%,” he says. “Perhaps they will have to be combined with cancer vaccines.” Chubb’s trial involves the use of the checkpoint inhibitor and a drug that limits the growth of new blood vessels. It is hoped that will slow the growth of the existing tumours and also help killer T cells better infiltrate the tumours, exposing them to more of the target. “The trials are now all moving to combination therapies,” Gurney says. “And that’s where we’re starting to see these massive responses.” The champion’s champion After years of practising science, and then championing it, Chubb is now the subject of a scientific experiment. “What I see is that some of the advantages of science to the world is something I’m getting the advantage of right now,” Chubb says. Perhaps surprisingly for someone so versed in the language of science, and indeed the very sort of cell biology one needs to understand his own condition, Chubb says he didn’t delve too deeply into studying his cancer and the various treatment options. “I stayed away from it. In my life’s experiences, I’ve learned that a little bit of knowledge is often worse than none … It comes back to having confidence in the people who are treating you, which I did have. “In a situation like this, I felt I will never know as much as them. I will read some paper and it will say something, and I won’t know whether it’s current, whether it’s still right or contestable. So I thought I’d put Google to one side – and instead I talked with them and asked them questions.” But Chubb was excited by the new drugs he was taking. “The science behind them is, I think, it’s really pretty exquisite,” he says. And he was interested in taking part in a trial of something relatively new. “I was really quite pleased to be able to participate in the state-of-the-art stuff,” he says. “But the state-of-the-art stuff had less information about it because it’s a trial … We could have predicted more readily what the chemo would have done for me.” Chubb says that didn’t scare him so much, though. What scared him was the lack of symptoms until his cancer was very advanced. “My new mantra is ‘take nothing for granted’. “Not that I dwell on the downside of this, I don’t. But I had no symptoms at all until this just dropped out of the sky. “I must have had these things growing in me for at least a year before I got symptoms and was treated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/dec/28/va-museum-nijinsky-ballet-costume-leon-bakst","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T16:45:46Z","webTitle":"V&A museum acquires Nijinsky ballet costume designed by Léon Bakst","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/dec/28/va-museum-nijinsky-ballet-costume-leon-bakst","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/dec/28/va-museum-nijinsky-ballet-costume-leon-bakst","fields":{"headline":"V&A museum acquires Nijinsky ballet costume designed by Léon Bakst","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A silk costume designed by Léon Bakst and worn by Vaslav Nijinsky, one of the greatest ballet dancers, has been acquired by the V&amp;A museum. The costume was one of many Nijinsky left in Russia after he moved to the west. It was inherited by his sister Bronislava Najinska, who was also a renowned dancer and choreographer, though not to the level of her famous brother. Jane Pritchard, curator of dance at the V&amp;A, travelled to the Rocky Mountains in the US to view the costume, also acquiring a trove of other outfits and artefacts that had been in the family for more than a century. They include several personal objects, such as Nijinsky’s graduate diploma, and a lapel badge he wore as a student at St Petersburg’s Imperial School. “I got a phone call one day asking if we would be interested in a Bakst costume worn by both Nijinsky and his sister Nijinska,” recalls Pritchard. “Would we? Would we!”The green and yellow silk costume was remodelled for one of Nijinska’s experimental performances of abstract choreography in 1919 by radical young artists in Kiev, who darkened the bright colours and added a jagged Constructivist-style overskirt. Nijinska brought many costumes with her when she moved to the US at the outbreak of the second world war. Nijinsky’s most glittering period was with the Ballets Russes, a company created by the impressario Sergei Diaghilev, often working with the choreographer Michel Fokin and the artist and designer Bakst. The company’s glamorous productions were viewed as sensational – and in the case of the sensuous L’Apres Midi d’un Faune, and the radical Rite of Spring, shocking to the point of provoking riots. Nijinsky spent most of the first world war under house arrest in Bulgaria, formed his own unsuccessful ballet company, and in 1919 suffered mental health problems that lasted until his death in London in 1950. Nijinska died in California in 1972. The Bakst costume was sold to the V&amp;A with other costumes and memorabilia by the widower of Nijinskaya’s grand daughter. “The Nijinksy family archives had already been sold to the Library of Congress but they don’t do costumes and we very much do,” Pritchard said. “They knew we have one of the greatest Ballets Russes collections in the world, and they were delighted that these would join it.” Some questions about the costume remain: the story in the family was that it was created for a character called the Moth, from a ballet in which Nijinsky danced with another legendary figure, Anna Pavlova. “There are two problems with this,” says Pritchard. “It doesn’t look at all like a moth, and would a pas de deux by Nijinsky and Pavlova have been entirely forgotten by ballet history?” The restored costume – “the tights were particularly difficult; there were more ladders than fabric” – is now on display along with Nijinsky’s Imperial School artefacts. He only managed to graduate from the prestigious academy because his dancing was so dazzling it made up for his lacklustre academics. The certificate is creased because when Nijinski’s mother left Russia, she folded it tightly to hide it among her possessions. At Pritchard’s insistence, the many creases have been conserved as a reminder of its poignant history."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/20/french-businessman-bernard-tapie-charged-with-embezzlement","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T15:41:03Z","webTitle":"French businessman Bernard Tapie to face trial for embezzlement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/french-businessman-bernard-tapie-charged-with-embezzlement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/20/french-businessman-bernard-tapie-charged-with-embezzlement","fields":{"headline":"French businessman Bernard Tapie to face trial for embezzlement","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Bernard Tapie, the French businessman and former Socialist minister, is to stand trial for embezzlement and misuse of public funds alongside the current head of the French telecommunications company Orange, in the latest twist in a longrunning scandal over a huge taxpayer-funded payout of €400m (£350m). In the soap opera of French political personalities, few are as colourful and controversial as Tapie, a rags-to-riches businessman who began as a failed popstar and wannabe racing driver, hosted TV shows, and became a minister under François Mitterrand. His ownership of Olympique de Marseille football club led to a jail sentence for match-fixing, before he reinvented himself as an actor and press baron, buying the newspaper La Provence. In 2007, when Tapie switched sides to support the rightwing Nicolas Sarkozy, he had already spent 20 years pursuing legal action through the courts for compensation from the state, accusing the former state bank Crédit Lyonnais of ripping him off in a business deal to sell the sports brand Adidas, which he once owned. Once Sarkozy was in office, his finance minister Christine Lagarde, now director of the International Monetary Fund, moved to stop the court action and instead authorised three judges to approve an out-of-court settlementof €400m from the French treasury – more than €280m of which Tapie pocketed, after tax and costs. The deal outraged opposition politicians, who claimed Lagarde had deliberately authorised an advantageous settlement procedure to reward Tapie for his support for Sarkozy during the 2007 election campaign. Last year, Lagarde, who denied wrongdoing, was convicted by a special tribunal of negligence regarding the payout but escaped punishment and kept her IMF job. Tapie, who is now seriously ill, has already been ordered by a court to pay back everything he was awarded. He and five other people are to stand trial on charges of embezzlement and misuse of public funds. They include Stéphane Richard, who is now head of Orange but was chief of staff to Lagarde at the time of the payout. Tapie’s defence lawyer Hervé Temime told Reuters: “I’ve been eager to fight this one out … Now all the cards will be on the table and we will be able to establish the truth. Not only was there no fraud but we will also see who was robbed and who did the robbing.” An Orange spokesman said lawyers had received notice of the trial order but declined to comment further."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/28/from-alden-ehrenreich-to-zazie-beetz-the-40-rising-film-stars-of-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T12:00:16Z","webTitle":"From Alden Ehrenreich to Zazie Beetz: the 40 rising film stars of 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/28/from-alden-ehrenreich-to-zazie-beetz-the-40-rising-film-stars-of-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/28/from-alden-ehrenreich-to-zazie-beetz-the-40-rising-film-stars-of-2018","fields":{"headline":"From Alden Ehrenreich to Zazie Beetz: the 40 rising film stars of 2018","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lena Waithe In September, Lena Waithe became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing, for the “Thanksgiving” episode of Master of None, based on her own coming-out story. Her upbringing on the southside of Chicago also informs new TV drama The Chi, which she wrote, produced and stars in. Look out for her, too, in dystopian sci-fi Ready Player One. Lucas Hedges Already Oscar-nominated for his role as troubled teen Patrick in Manchester By the Sea, Lucas Hedges features in two more films currently garnering Oscar buzz in the form of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird. His first big lead role is to follow, in Joel Edgerton’s gay conversion therapy drama Boy Erased. Stardom seems pretty much assured. Alden Ehrenreich Han Solo was the role that catapulted Harrison Ford into the major league, and it could do the same for Alden Ehrenreich, who plays the young galactic buccaneer in Solo: A Star Wars Story, Lucasfilm’s latest Rogue One-style spinoff. Discerning cinemagoers will have already seen him in the Coen’s Hail, Caesar!. A universe of new opportunities awaits. Vicky Krieps Jean-Claude Juncker, Andy Schleck … now you can add Vicky Krieps to that list of famous Luxembourgians. With a filmography including Hanna and A Most Wanted Man, she should break through to the mainstream with a role opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in Paul Thomas Anderson’s upcoming 1950s London fashion-world drama, Phantom Thread. Chadwick Boseman The Marvel Universe may be close to bursting point, but first there’s room for a Black Panther movie, with Chadwick Boseman reprising the role he first played in Captain America: Civil War. Boseman has described Black Panther as a “super antihero” with “swagger” – qualities he is more than familiar with after playing James Brown in Get On Up. Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler and Alek Skarlatos These three friends are already news-famous, for foiling an armed gunman and suspected terrorist on a train from Amsterdam to Paris in 2015. Now they are about to become movie-famous, too, because, in an unorthodox move, Clint Eastwood has cast them to play themselves in his film about the incident, The 15:17 to Paris. Daniela Vega Several commentators have tipped Chilean Daniela Vega to become the first trans actor to be nominated for a best actress Oscar on the strength of her bravura performance in Sebastián Lelio’s A Fantastic Woman. The film, about a trans woman coping with the prejudice unleashed when her older male lover dies, is getting an international release in 2018. Awkwafina New York rapper and comedian Nora Lum – AKA Awkwafina – has been going places since her track My Vag went viral on YouTube. Next up, she will be seen alongside the likes of Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Rihanna playing a scrappy wingman in Ocean’s 8. “I was just rapping about my genitalia, not making a feminist message,” she told the Guardian before what is sure to be a whistlestop 12 months. Read a full interview here. Justin Chon You may recognise him as Eric Yorkie from the Twilight saga, but Justin Chon has refused to be defined by his teen movie fame. A prolific vlogger and member of parody K-pop boyband BgA, he’s about to find a whole new audience as director and star of the provocatively titled Gook, focusing on the story of two Korean-American shopworkers during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Anya Taylor-Joy Half-British, half-Argentinian, US-born actor Anya Taylor-Joy is making a name for herself as the star of intelligently spooky fare. She follows up her leading roles in The Witch and M Night Shyamalan’s Split with Thoroughbreds, a drama about boarding school girls gone bad. She is also one of The New Mutants, a kind of X-Men: The Next Generation. Storm Reid A Wrinkle in Time is Disney Pictures’ big beast for 2018, a fantasy adventure based on Madeleine L’Engle’s novel and directed by Ava DuVernay. Leading the impressive ensemble cast (Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Zach Galifianakis) is 14-year-old Storm Reid, already a veteran of 12 Years a Slave and Sleight. Millicent Simmonds After winning the lead role in Todd Haynes’ Wonderstruck at an open audition, Utah teenager Millicent Simmonds – a deaf actor who lost her hearing at the age of one – will follow that up with A Quiet Place, a supernatural horror that also stars John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. Robin Campillo The French-Moroccan film-maker’s 120 Beats Per Minute tells the tale of his time with Aids activists ACT UP Paris in the early 90s. After what has been a banner year for LGBT cinema, from the Oscar triumph of Moonlight to the global success of Call Me By Your Name, A Fantastic Woman and his own film, Campillo is one of many queer storytellers courting mass attention, while sticking to his own terms. Read a full interview here. Johnny Flynn He has done Shakespeare, he has done heartwarming TV comedy (Scrotal Recall/Lovesick, Comedy Central’s Brotherhood) ... he has even released four albums of accomplished indie-folk. Now Johnny Flynn has found his breakthrough film role – as a belligerent Jersey loner suspected of multiple murder in Michael Pearce’s compelling directorial debut, Beast. Josie Rourke The artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse since 2011, Josie Rourke has overseen acclaimed productions of Coriolanus, City of Angels and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. In 2018, she is diversifying into film with an upcoming biopic of Mary Queen of Scots, starring Saoirse Ronan in the title role. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom As the man behind the camera for the gorgeous Call Me By Your Name, Thai cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom received almost as many plaudits as the film’s lead actors. Look out for his elegant work on the Suspiria remake, in which he continues a fruitful relationship with director Luca Guadagnino. Zazie Beetz Zazie Beetz was the breakout star of Donald Glover’s Atlanta, playing Glover’s on-off girlfriend, Vanessa. She has been rewarded with her first blockbuster movie role – as mercenary mutant Domino in Deadpool 2. Disasterpeace In 2014, Rich Vreeland – AKA Disasterpeace – made the impressive leap from chiptune composer via acclaimed videogame soundtracks (Fez, Hyper Light Drifter) to scoring cult supernatural horror It Follows. Director David Robert Mitchell has retained his services to soundtrack noir thriller Under the Silver Lake, starring Andrew Garfield and Riley Keough. Hong Chau Born in a Taiwanese refugee camp after her parents fled Vietnam by boat, this Vietnamese-American actor’s own story feels deserving of the big-screen treatment. Instead, Chau is gaining a reputation for stand-out appearances in other people’s stories – after turns in David Simon’s New Orleans TV series Treme and Paul Thomas Anderson’s stoner noir Inherent Vice, she’s currently appearing as a Vietnamese dissident in Alexander Payne’s shrink-ray comedy Downsizing, a role that has already earned her a Screen Actors Guild award nomination. Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani are a France-born couple living in Brussels who express their love for each other through the medium of ultraviolent exploitation horror films. As you do. They co-directed the psychedelic giallo homages Amer and The Strange Colour of Your Body’s Tears; look out for their heavily stylised retro crime caper Let the Corpses Tan. Daniel Kokotajlo Big things are expected of this Manchester-born film-maker, whose directing debut Apostasy – a film he also wrote, based on his own experiences growing up as a Jehovah’s Witness – helped land him the IWC Schaffhausen film-maker bursary award, worth a handy £50,000. Claes Bang Now 50, actor Claes Bang is little known outside his native Denmark. That should change with the worldwide release of Ruben Östlund’s The Square, in which Bang plays a seemingly dapper and assured museum director, whose underlying insecurity spills out in a series of bizarre and audacious set-pieces. His performance helped the film win 2017’s Palmes d’Or at Cannes. Vanessa Taylor Having previous worked on Alias and Game of Thrones, Taylor is currently one of Hollywood’s most in-demand screenwriters. She has co-written Guillermo del Toro’s latest empathetic fantasy, The Shape of Water – rated by critics as his best since Pan’s Labyrinth – and her next project is Disney’s live action Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie. Florence Pugh Oxford’s Florence Pugh has certainly crammed a lot into her short career. Just 21, and she has already starred in a multi-award-winning series (Lady Macbeth), appeared opposite Anthony Hopkins in King Lear and been taught to punch by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (for her part in a forthcoming wrestling biopic). Proving her best days are still ahead of her, she’s also been cast in Little Drummer Girl, an adaptation of a John Le Carré tale currently being made by the team behind The Night Manager. Read a full interview here. Nakhane Touré South African Nakhane Touré first rose to prominence as a singer-songwriter, influenced by Radiohead and Ali Farka Touré. In 2015, he published his first novel; now he’s added acting to his list of accomplishments, starring in The Wound – a film that has proved controversial for its depiction of homosexual desire at a traditional Xhosa initiation ritual. Bria Vinaite Plucked from Instagram to become the star of one of 2017’s most celebrated films, The Florida Project, Bria Vinaite has keeping it indie with a role in Harmony Korine’s latest weirdo stoner comedy, The Beach Bum, alongside Matthew McConaughey, Isla Fisher and Snoop Dogg. Trevante Rhodes The heartwarming, award-snaffling success of Moonlight has opened doors for many of its cast and crew, including former sprinter Trevante Rhodes. He will play a Predator-hunting marine in Shane Black’s update of the classic sci-fi shooter and a sergeant in Afghanistan war drama 12 Strong, alongside Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth, and Michael Shannon. Yeon Sang-ho After its success with Okja, Netflix has returned to South Korea to sign another offbeat comedy. Psychokinesis, about a man whose accidentally acquired superpowers turn out to do more harm than good, is directed by Yeon Sang-ho, who previously won international plaudits for his animated drama The King of Pigs. Ashton Sanders Another Moonlight alumnus – he played the teen version of protagonist Chiron – Sanders can next be seen in Captive State, a new sci-fi thriller from Rise of the Planet of the Apes director Rupert Wyatt. He has also been tapped for the sequel to Denzel Washington vehicle The Equalizer. Mamoudou Athie Mamoudou Athie is the son of a Mauritanian diplomat who got his break as Grandmaster Flash in noble TV failure The Get Down, following that up with a role in Patti Cake$. In 2018, look out for him in coming-of-age drama 100 Percent More Humid (with Juno Temple) and The Frontrunner, about Gary Hart’s ill-fated 1988 presidential bid. Cynthia Erivo All eyes are on Steve McQueen’s Widows, a female-fronted heist movie based on a 1983 Lynda La Plante TV serial. Sharing top billing with Viola Davis, Elizabeth Debicki and Michelle Rodriguez is newcomer Cynthia Erivo, previously best known for playing Celie in the Broadway version of The Color Purple. Erivo has also scored a part in Drew Goddard’s new thriller, Bad Times at the El Royale. Haifaa al-Mansour Saudi Arabian film pioneer Haifaa al-Mansour – her 2012 directorial debut Wadjda was the first full-length feature shot entirely in the country – has now turned her attention to a biopic of Frankenstein author Mary Shelley, starring Elle Fanning and Douglas Booth (as love interest Percy Bysshe). Perhaps less promising is a romcom called Nappily Ever After ... Tim Kirkby The director of Fleabag, My Mad Fat Diary and Veep makes the leap to Hollywood with Action Point, a comedy thriller starring Johnny Knoxville as a daredevil who opens his own lo-fi theme park – with disastrous/hilarious consequences. Mark Stanley A busy TV actor, you may recognise Mark Stanley from Loves, Lies &amp; Records, Broken, Dickensian or as a loyal brother of the Night’s Watch in Game of Thrones. He plays a frazzled farmer in Dark River, a new slab of balletic social realism from The Selfish Giant director Clio Barnard, which also stars Ruth Wilson and Sean Bean. Constance Wu Riding high on the success of ABC comedy series Fresh Off the Boat, Constance Wu was recently named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine, complete with an endorsement from Lena Dunham. She heads the cast in an opulent adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s comic novel Crazy Rich Asians, coming later in 2018. Vanessa Kirby A star of British theatre and TV, currently stealing the show as Princess Margaret in The Crown, Kirby is making a lunge for Hollywood via a part in Mission Impossible 6. Christian Rivers It has been a long apprenticeship – but having storyboarded all of Peter Jackson’s films since 1992, Christian Rivers is finally getting the chance to direct his own, in the form of steampunk adventure Mortal Engines. His name is also still attached to Jackson’s long-mooted Dam Busters remake, but whether that will ever happen is anyone’s guess."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/26/piano-exam-test","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-26T08:00:43Z","webTitle":"I’m going back to piano lessons - but not to pass exams | Hugh Muir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/26/piano-exam-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/26/piano-exam-test","fields":{"headline":"I’m going back to piano lessons - but not to pass exams","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Were you travelling this Christmas? If so, how was your journey? I have always hated journeys. I like arrivals. I see the journey as merely the means to an arrival. This can manifest itself in any number of ways. It means driving or running through the countryside and checking a watch rather than the scenery. It means speed-reading a book so as to finish it. It means completing any number of potentially diverting tasks with the sole focus of progressing to the next one. Better to travel hopefully than arrive, the saying goes. I was never big on that. But I’m rethinking, and this year the catalyst for that was a piano exam. A few years ago, as a lover of jazz and an admirer of musicians, I decided to take up the piano. In relative terms, it was all a bit late. I didn’t expect much. I merely nursed the hope that one day, for a few fleeting seconds, I would be proficient enough to play a quiet sombre tune on a grand piano in a top-floor penthouse overlooking central Manhattan. As occurs in the best films. That aim seemed modest enough, But then I was told about the exams. You should do exams, came the advice, it focuses the mind. And suddenly the playing wasn’t the thing, it was the exams. You can pass them, and that’s great, but you can fail them too. That’s bad, very bad. That’s like a journey with no end point. A maze, an endless spinning carousel. Arrive, you must pass. You must arrive. But I didn’t. Instead at the Blackheath Conservatoire, in southeast London – a place that, as its title suggests, nurtures artistic excellence – I stupendously failed to reach the destination of piano grade two. Yes grade two. The one that 10-year-olds and precocious five-year-olds on YouTube pass with merits blindfolded in their sleep. Instead I had a meltdown: arms immobile, brain clouded by fog, eyes seeing notes as mosquitoes pirouetting on the page. It lasted 12 minutes and that might not sound long. But picture 12 minutes of helplessness; 12 minutes of drowning. Twelve minutes of smiles from an examiner who knew the shambles he saw left little room for doubt and even less for lenience. The result, when it came weeks later, brought no surprises, but it did provide a reassuring clarity. Not failure by a hair’s breadth or the single mistake that might haunt one’s sleep. This was overwhelming deficiency, failure to reach the destination by a country mile. What’s an arrivophile to do after that? I abandoned the trip entirely. And for a month or two I actually truly enjoyed the freedom of not having to practice, and of not feeling guilty when doing something else. I read a bit more, soaked in the bath, watched sport while sitting close enough to the piano keys to see them gathering dust. But all the while there was a voice in my head, an amalgam of responses I had when I first wrote about my exam debacle this summer. Just keep playing, said the emails and tweets. Forget the exam. Forget the destination. Just travel. And one evening, waiting for the second half of a Premier League game to begin, I inexplicably drifted over to the keyboard and started fumbling a D minor scale. Then E major. Then, from memory, one of the pieces that so spectacularly crash landed in the examination: I’m an Old Cowhand from the Rio Grande. None of it passed muster. Certainly there was nothing to match the smart-alecky kids on YouTube. But there was something else in the re-engagement: a spiritual sort of comfort, like the meeting of two people who have been through trauma and later reconnect. And so that’s what I have been doing. Just travelling. That doesn’t mean I have no interest in what happened before and why. Piano TV, a YouTube channel, says adult would-be pianists intent on reaching the promised land of garlands and cardboard certificates fail to reach it all the time. There are as many as 12 common problems they encounter, according to Piano TV’s Allysia. One is that they immediately demand to be better than they are. That was me. Sometimes, without parents or figures of seniority to chivvy them on, they get lazy. That was me too. They get waylaid by the “drill sergeant” of the mind: that inner voice that gathers up a lifetime’s doubts to tell you that you’re over the hill and in over your head. I often met him halfway through the accurate playing of a piece. A mistake would quickly follow. They suffer performance anxiety, playing not with childish insouciance but with all the pressure of their own self-worth. A mistake is never just a mistake. It becomes “a reflection of you as a person”. Yep, yep, yep. But that was then. So off we go again. Maybe to a destination – maybe even Blackheath – but maybe just on a journey that doesn’t go any place. Might as well try to enjoy life’s excursions. Too soon, they all end up in the same place. • Hugh Muir is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/20/what-alternative-christmas-message-would-you-like-to-broadcast","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T17:39:20Z","webTitle":"What alternative Christmas message would you like to broadcast?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/20/what-alternative-christmas-message-would-you-like-to-broadcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/20/what-alternative-christmas-message-would-you-like-to-broadcast","fields":{"headline":"What alternative Christmas message would you like to broadcast?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As well as the annual Queen’s speech, children who survived the Grenfell Tower fire will tell the public to cherish their families and appreciate their homes in a message to be broadcast on Christmas Day.

The comments were made after the Guardian and ITV News revealed on Tuesday how Tesco food standards inspectors had unearthed a series of “major” process issues at a second 2 Sisters Food Group factory, on the same weekend that separate concerns prompted the temporary closure of the firm’s Site D in West Bromwich in October. Tesco conducted a series of emergency inspections of 2 Sisters chicken factories as a direct response to a Guardian and ITV undercover investigation into Site D at the end of September. Having unearthed process problems at the Coupar Angus plant in Perth and Kinross – which were all distinct from what was filmed at Site D – Tesco “insisted these were addressed immediately to prevent any food safety issues”. During his appearance in front of the environment, food and rural affairs committee on Wednesday, Gove was told how the FSA was not being informed “of what’s happening in [meat] factories” following inspections conducted by the supermarkets and food standards assurance schemes, such as Red Tractor. John Grogan MP asked: “Do you think they should be informed, secretary of state?” Gove replied: “Yes.” Tesco said it “works closely” with the regulator and had shared “the key findings from our inspections at 2 Sisters Food Group with the FSA”. The grocer handed the full Coupar Angus report to the FSA after being contacted by the Guardian and ITV. The exchange follows leaked documents showing how Tesco’s auditors gave the Coupar Angus plant what they described as a “red” rating because of five “major” process failings. Fewer than 1% of Tesco supplier sites receive a “red” audit rating. The audit did not find the food was unsafe or that food safety regulations had been breached. A spokesman for 2 Sisters, which pledged on Tuesday to publish audit findings from its sites, said: “ITV and the Guardian are referring to standard inspection audits and appear to be trying to damage the reputation of our factories and potentially the livelihoods of 23,000 colleagues by misrepresenting them. There is and never was any risk to food safety at Coupar Angus. This is using old news to highlight issues which were resolved with our customer two months ago.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/tim-dowling-home-with-sons-football-trivia-sitcoms-family","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: my children are staring at me with a complex mixture of awe and disgust","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/tim-dowling-home-with-sons-football-trivia-sitcoms-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/tim-dowling-home-with-sons-football-trivia-sitcoms-family","fields":{"headline":"Tim Dowling: my children are staring at me with a complex mixture of awe and disgust","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is a dark winter afternoon, and my three large sons are sitting in the kitchen while I cook, occupying themselves by trying to name every football team suffix in England. It’s the sort of charming scene that causes my wife to leave the room and take to bed. This she has already done. “Rovers,” the youngest one says. “We’ve got Rovers,” the middle one says. “And Hotspur, United, Wanderers, City, Town, Rangers, Athletic, Wednesday and County.” “North End,” the oldest one says. “Oh yeah, good,” the middle one says, typing the answer into his laptop. I am desperate to join in, but can think of only one thing to say: that suffix is not the right word for the thing they are talking about. I don’t think this will earn me the kind of credibility I’m after. “Orient,” the youngest one says. “Yes,” the middle one says. “How many are left?” I ask. “There are, like, 11 more,” the middle one says. “Of Midlothian,” I say. “We’re not doing Scottish ones,” he replies. “Why not?” I say. “Because they’re not included!” he says. “Albion,” the oldest one says. “Ooh,” the middle one says, typing. As I poke a boiling potato with the point of a knife, something occurs to me. “And Diamonds,” I say. “You can’t have that,” the oldest one says. “I can,” I say. “Rushden &amp; Diamonds.” “It’s the second of two team names, clearly the result of a merger,” he says. “It’s not a suffix.” “None of them are suffixes!” I say. “A suffix is an ending added to a root word.” “Actually, it’s letting him have And Diamonds,” the middle one says. “Thank you, the internet,” I say. “It’s ridiculous,” the oldest one says. “Argyle.” “Nice,” the middle one says. I slip into a graceless silence while they polish off the last few: Stanley, Vale, Forest, Alexandra. My sons move on to other football trivia, way beyond my limited understanding of the game. After a while, I stop listening. I consult the chicken in the oven and poke the potatoes again. “This’ll be ready in 15 minutes,” I say. “You need to clear all your crap off the table.” “In a minute,” the middle one says. “Do another one,” the youngest says. “Now!” I say. “Get plates, set the table, call Mum.” “There’s one for sitcoms – should we do that?” the middle one asks. “Fine,” the oldest one says. “Seriously,” I say, “if you expended a 10th of the effort applying your tiny brains to something useful, you’d be…” “Which classic sitcom starred Shirley Booth in the title role?” the middle one says. “Who the hell is Shirley Booth?” the youngest one asks. “Hazel,” I say. “Never heard of her,” the oldest says. “It is Hazel,” the middle one says. “I know it is,” I say. “OK, which series starred Bea Arthur in the title role?” “Maude,” I say. “Good Times was a spinoff of what series?” “Also Maude,” I say. “Are these, like, historical American sitcoms?” the youngest asks. “Correct,” the middle one says. “But what series was Maude actually a spinoff from?” “All In The Family,” I say. “Maude was Edith’s cousin or something.” “He’s four out of four,” the oldest one says. “The theme of what series contains the lyrics ‘Got tired of packing and unpacking, moving up and down the dial’?” I pretend to think about this for a few seconds, raising an eyebrow and scrutinising the floor. But it’s all for show. “WKRP In Cincinnati,” I say. “Whoa,” the middle one says. When I look up, all three of my children are staring at me with expressions betraying a complex mixture of awe and disgust. There are some things you shouldn’t have to know about your father. The middle one turns back to his laptop screen: “The cast of which series included Barry Williams, Florence…” “The Brady Bunch,” I say. “Get out some forks and stop wasting my time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/31/are-you-civic-minded-and-what-does-that-say-about-you-personality-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"Are you civic minded and what does that say about you? – personality quiz | Ben Ambridge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/31/are-you-civic-minded-and-what-does-that-say-about-you-personality-quiz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/31/are-you-civic-minded-and-what-does-that-say-about-you-personality-quiz","fields":{"headline":"Are you civic minded and what does that say about you?

To find out, give each of the following statements a score between 1 (not at all true) and 4 (very true). (a) I volunteer my time for community activities (b) I regularly donate to charitable causes (c) I vote in elections If you scored (a) 2, (b) 2 and (c) 3 then you are about as civically engaged as the average person (at least according to a large American twin study); higher or lower scores indicate that you are more or less civically engaged than average. Where does civic engagement come from? You will probably not be surprised to learn that the answer is “your parents” (who, in most cases, would give similar scores to your own). However, you probably will be surprised to learn that they passed these attitudes on to you genetically, rather than by being a good role model. The American study found that identical twins – who share almost all of their genes – were much more similar in their civic engagement than non-identical twins – who share almost all of their environment and upbringing. In fact, these findings suggest the environment in which you are raised has almost no effect at all on whether you are involved in volunteering, donating or voting, whereas genetic factors affect all three.

It's beginning to look a lot like Elvis","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Christmas albums are tricky things. Strike gold and you’ve got a pay cheque for life. Get it wrong and it’s forgotten by the time the season rolls around again. They can be charmless, phoned-in collections of standards (the Michael Bublé route), shameless attempts to add new songs to the canon (Leona Lewis and Kelly Clarkson both tried recently; Mariah Carey has a pop every couple of years), or a genuine celebration of the season (Sufjan Stevens writes a low-key Christmas album every year for family and friends). Whatever the motivation, stars make an annual grab for the tinselly pound, and you suspect most musicians reckon there’s a Christmas classic inside them. Will the class of Christmas 2017 still be soundtracking the sherry this time next year? Probably not, if we’re honest. Gwen Stefani’s You Make It Feel Like Christmas justifies its title only because it’s both cloyingly sentimental and charmlessly tacky. The fun in Jingle Bells is in singing it, not listening, and no amount of faux rat-pack swing is going to make it any more appealing. Her Santa Baby, like versions by Kylie, Madonna and Ariana Grande, bloodlessly retreads Eartha Kitt; Let It Snow tries to swing but misses; and adding a 60s girl-group sheen to Wham!’s Last Christmas and a key change to Silent Night (which has rubbed along fine without one for 200 years, thanks) is more evidence of Stefani’s tendency to over-fig the pudding. Thank the baby Jesus, then, for Sia’s Everyday Is Christmas. If Stefani’s album was a phoned-in Holiday Special, Australia’s top pop export takes things the other way with no standards and a bare minimum of sleigh bells. It succeeds by funnelling the turkey and trimmings through its star; this isn’t just a Christmas record, it’s first of all a Sia record. There’s joyful bounce aplenty in singles Ho Ho Ho and Candy Cane Lane, while Snowman, in which the singer tries to stop her literally frozen boyfriend from melting, and Underneath the Mistletoe are as good as any ballad Sia has delivered. Stefani’s record could have been made by anybody. This one is uniquely Sia. Back in 1997, the Hanson brothers, riding high on their Mmmbop! fame, released their first Christmas album, Snowed In. Though rarely bothering the charts since, the trio have never stopped making music, and mark the anniversary of their commercial peak with Finally It’s Christmas, an album as forgettable as the past two decades of their career. There’s a passable run at the Eagles’s Please Come Home for Christmas, a too-sugary take on All I Want for Christmas Is You, and a chirpy version of Wonderful Christmastime that shoehorns in a brand new chorus. You’d admire the chutzpah of rewriting Paul McCartney if the result weren’t so bland. At least Chicago rock veterans Cheap Trick know how to have a good time. Their album Christmas Christmas swings for the same sonic space as Hanson but does it with far more unpolished fun. You can feel the proper, boozy cheer as the band jam the faders up and rock out unashamedly on Chuck Berry’s Run Run Rudolph and the Ramones’s Merry Christmas (I Don’t Want to Fight Tonight). American audiences aren’t generally familiar with the British glam classics, so the band allow themselves faithfully joyous takes on both I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day and Merry Xmas Everybody. It’s an unselfconscious blast. People ask for lots of strange things for Christmas, but you’d be surprised to find anyone wishing desperately for the singer from Keane to cover East 17’s Stay Another Day. Yet here we are. Tom Chaplin’s Twelve Tales of Christmas is likable enough, though his original songs will exit your brain as quickly as they enter it. His pleasant and plaintive vocal works on a stripped-down Walking In the Air, but the Pretenders’s 2,000 Miles is charmless, and his voice lacks the depth needed to do justice to Joni Mitchell’s classic River. Ultimately, it’s thin stuff. If Hanson’s cover of All I Want for Christmas Is You isn’t enough, the soundtrack album to Mariah Carey’s animated movie of the same name adds another two – Carey’s original and a near identical version taken from the film. A handful of Carey’s Christmas songs, including an unremarkable new one and a few sub-High School Musical tunes from the movie, are harmless enough, but this is inessential for anyone over the age of seven. Finally, there’s Elvis Presley’s Elvis Christmas, showing us how it’s done. The sentimentality of the season lends itself to tracks that use Presley’s original vocals over a new score by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. There’s not much levity, save for the opening swing of Santa Claus Is Back in Town, but Presley’s voice on the gospel carols is untouchable. Whether the new arrangements really add much is up for debate, but as a soundtrack to dinner on the big day, you won’t find much finer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/brother-abusive-cut-contact-mum-will-money-issues-advises","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"My brother hurt me, and I want to cut contact, but Mum’s will left money issues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/brother-abusive-cut-contact-mum-will-money-issues-advises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/29/brother-abusive-cut-contact-mum-will-money-issues-advises","fields":{"headline":"My brother hurt me, and I want to cut contact, but Mum’s will left money issues","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I am the youngest, female child of a second marriage with one brother and a half-sister (another half-brother died some years ago). My parents were unhappily married and my father had mental health problems. They divorced when I was at primary school and I lived with my mother. She began a relationship with an alcoholic, who used to attack me physically and was emotionally abusive, too. After a few months of terrible and neglectful parenting, I went to live with my father. Contact with my mother was scarce and difficult for most of my teenage years and into adulthood. She was emotionally distant, selfish and quite cruel. My father was demonstrative and I always knew he loved me, but he was a difficult and troubled man. My older half-brother died when I was a teenager. I remember him fondly. I was sexually bullied and emotionally abused when I was under 10 by my brother (not the one who died) and the trauma has dogged me for most of my life. I have had therapy and counselling and, as a young adult, had the courage to tell my mother and my half-sister about it. They shut down and refused to accept it and tried to get me to forget all about it. Fast forward to today, and our mother has died. The abusing brother lied to her and manipulated her into cutting me out of her life. He partially succeeded – by getting my mother to change her will in favour of him and his family – but he did not succeed fully and I was able to look after my dying mother for most of last year. Unfortunately, he had power of attorney and controlled my mother and her finances. He lied and manipulated and continues to try to get at me. He does this by withholding money from my mother’s estate (my mother appointed him and my sister as executors). He would not let me see her will until I paid a solicitor and then he had to let me see it. He game-plays by making himself seem like the victim and me the “mad” evil sister. This is hugely damaging for me emotionally as I feel this is another rejection and denial of me by my mother and half-sister. What I want to do now is protect the little girl in me and cut off all contact with my siblings who deny me. This has been difficult to do because of unresolved money issues and my mother’s recently altered will. I would also like my brother and sister to own up, apologise and, finally, not deny me as a person. I really want to cut off all ties as they are so harmful. I have explained this to my husband and kids who seem to understand. What should I do? Exactly what do you want? You are not, unfortunately, going to get your siblings to admit anything or apologise, but what you can do is pull up the drawbridge and have nothing more to do with them for a while, or ever. You don’t have to make any hard and fast rules. You are in charge. What seems to be holding you back, however, is the will/money, and that’s something only you can decide to relinquish (incidentally, anyone can see anyone’s will if it’s gone through probate; you pay £10 and can request a copy here: gov.uk/search-will-probate). I consulted the psychotherapist Gail Walker (childpsychotherapy.org.uk). She found your (longer) letter quite muddled and said that “that in itself can be a sign of trauma”. And your upbringing was traumatic. Walker wondered why you had written in now – and thought that perhaps, and understandably, your mother’s death had brought a lot of rejection to the fore again and that the alteration to the will “was another rejection”. Walker thought you had made “remarkable achievements” in your life that were not to be underestimated. And the traumas your mother and father had suffered in their own upbringings (which you mentioned in your longer letter) would have greatly affected their ability to parent. “Your ability to come through this,” says Walker, “speaks volumes about your resilience.” She explained that the only person who “can validate you, is not your siblings, not anyone else, but you, and you can do that by making sense of your history”. I know you’ve had therapy, but if you could find someone to “put heads together with” as Walker put it, again, now that your mother has died and stirred up feelings, you may be able to move forward. “Whatever happens in our past,” says Walker, “gets ploughed into who we are now, but in order to be a coherent personality the trauma has to be ‘digested’, or it can take us by surprise and we can find ourselves thrown by something unexpected happening.” This is why we can sometimes completely overreact to things. No one had stood up for, believed in, or protected the little girl you were (indeed, you mention it, which is very astute of you) and now you want to do that yourself. Sometimes we reach a point in our lives where we’re adult enough to look back at our childhood selves and say: that wasn’t OK. Enough now. I think you are at that point.

Like the Call the Midwife Christmas Special (BBC One). “We unwrap so much at Christmas,” says Vanessa Redgrave as the voice of Jennifer Worth. “We uncover and expose such a great deal to the light. We examine our hearts’ desires …” Oh, do pipe down, with your cheap greetings card messages. We’re up to Christmas 1962, the start of the Big Freeze. Which means frozen pipes and loos, the milk’s not being delivered, and Trixie can’t go on holiday. Skiing cancelled because of snow. The good women of Nonnatus House – armed with and aided by a lot of community spirit, goodwill, God (optional), tea, pluck, knitting a soaring string score – set to work to make things better. Put some antifreeze in the tear ducts while you’re at it, will you? It can’t be long before they will be needed. Here we go: a man, the nice old chap who came to see Dr Turner, is found in a snowdrift. He became disoriented and froze to death. Hang on, though, Sister Julienne finds out that he was actually horrid, abused his wife and his daughter: good riddance to him. Don’t put the violins away, though, because this baby Valerie has delivered to an unmarried woman in a caravan is stillborn. He is bundled into Valerie’s bag and taken to the undertaker … Hold the bus! The bag’s crying – he’s alive! Valerie just didn’t realise. (What kind of midwife is she? Don’t call Valerie is my advice.) Brilliant news, but I’m feeling a bit manipulated emotionally. The news gets better. Nurse Crane sorts the milk, abused mother is reunited with abused daughter, as they were always going to be. Happy strings, a panto, snowdrops! The only bummer is that Tom and Barbara are going to Birmingham, but only for six months. “There will always be another Christmas, and all will be well …” Oi, Vanessa, shut it! Next. Victoria: Comfort and Joy (ITV) is both jollier and more momentous. It’s 1846 and Albert is busy introducing Christmas trees to England: hung from the ceiling, interestingly. And Victoria has presents from Africa: a grey parrot, and a black child named Sara, originally called Aina. Sara was due to be a human sacrifice, but nice Captain Forbes persuaded King Ghezo of Dahomey to give her to Queen Victoria as a present instead. The Queen is much taken with her, certainly more so than with the parrot. But poor Sara is not happy – well, her family were all killed and she’s a long way from home. It’s a very sad story – also true. Miss Skerrett has inherited some slaves in America, which is awkward. And – also awkward – Albert’s brother has picked up a venereal disease in Paris. Merry Syphilis. And Albert has invited a lot of ghastly, unwanted rellies for Christmas, so tensions are running high around the palace (maybe he brought that, too, as well as the trees). Victoria’s cross, Albert’s skating on thin ice. And then literally! On the palace pond, to cool off. And he falls through, of course. You can see him down there, his terrified face pressed up against the underside of the ice. Bloody hell, it’s like that bit in Damien: Omen II. No raven, though, and a happier outcome: Victoria saves him. It seems there may be a flake of truth in that story, too, and then it was allowed to snowball out of control. Fun, though. In The Great Christmas Bake Off (Channel 4), four ghosts of Bake Off past come back to haunt the tent … Actually, it is not much of a reunion, because Paul is the only one of the new team who knows these former contestants. Anyway, to play on her yule log, Beca has made a gingerbread squirrel, the famous Bake-Off squirrel from 2011 but with a fine set of nuts dipped in caramel. Ha, good one Beca. Then Pru says what the technical challenge is (latticed mince pies) before she’s meant to. That’s unlike you, Pru, to blurt it out too early. Maybe she’s in a different time zone. The showstopper is to make eight snow-globe cakes. When they’ve done that, Paul tells Beca that, overall, he thinks her globes are stunning, and everyone has a jolly good laugh. However, Christmas Bake Off’s star baker is the other Paul, the prison governor. But no one really cares about that. We’ve had innuendo, a boob from Pru, and Paul Hollywood tucking into squirrel balls. It’s perfect, happy Christmas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/25/death-magazines-overplayed-titles-fight-back-facebook","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-25T13:00:20Z","webTitle":"Death of magazines 'overplayed' as titles bid to fight Facebook effect","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/25/death-magazines-overplayed-titles-fight-back-facebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/25/death-magazines-overplayed-titles-fight-back-facebook","fields":{"headline":"Death of magazines 'overplayed' as titles bid to fight Facebook effect","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The death of magazines has been overplayed, according to a leading media agency, despite a torrid year that has featured the British title Glamour ending its monthly print run and Rolling Stone appealing for a deep-pocketed buyer. There has been a precipitous slump in advertising in UK magazines this year with, an 11% fall representing the biggest since the advertising recession of 2009. In addition, in 2017 almost 1 million British consumers stopped buying print magazines or gave up their subscription. Despite this gloomy picture, Group M, which buys more than $75bn (£60bn) of advertising space on behalf of clients globally, believes that the UK consumer magazine market has been “seriously undervalued” by marketers looking to cut back their budgets as a weakening economy has hurt their businesses. “It is too early to call the death of magazines,” said Adam Smith, a director at WPP-owned Group M. “The decline in ad investment is disproportionate to the loss of magazine circulation. This is regrettable and probably not based on the evidence. The single biggest factor [in magazine ad decline] is probably the growth of Facebook. Google and Facebook both continue to grow strongly, and Facebook has been remarkable and is affecting every medium.” The Silicon Valley giants already account for 65% of the $6.5bn spent on digital display ads in the UK annually, according to eMarketer. This dominance is eating into a market that is the lifeblood for publishers seeking a digital future for their traditional print brands. Smith says that 2018 will see a fightback by magazine publishers as ongoing issues – such as brand safety concerns from ads running next to inappropriate content such as extremist websites and fake news – provide a platform to get advertisers to reassess where they spend their money. “There are increasing concerns from advertisers, loudly voiced, around issues including trust, fake news and ad fraud and some of the slightly more nefarious activities going on in digital,” says James Wildman, the chief executive of Good Housekeeping’s publisher, Hearst UK. “We are seeing the word trust increasingly appear in ad briefs [from advertisers]. Having spent decades building up a level of trust – Harper’s Bazaar is 150 years old this year – advertisers are increasingly intent on accessing and benefiting from that. I think there is going to be a correction.” While pressure remains intense on mid-market titles – women’s weeklies and celebrity titles such as Heat and Grazia suffered double-digit sales declines – the luxury magazine market is proving resilient. According to industry sources, the December issue of Vogue, the debut of the new editor, Edward Enninful, prompted a sales rise of 40% compared with a regular month (190,000). Ad revenue was up 29% year-on-year and it had the most ad pages in a December issue in a decade. Vogue’s circulation is down a comparatively resilient 3% and other strong titles such as Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping are down just 1% to 2%. “I think we are going to go more upmarket,” says Alex Bilmes, the editor of Esquire. “Us and other magazines in the sector will drive that, it’s what advertisers and readers want. You need a beautiful physical object that offers respite from social media and constant digital churn – although we are of course available digitally too. I hear a lot of doom and gloom but I don’t feel it. There is no cause for complete panic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/blog/2018/jan/23/why-the-climate-of-game-of-thrones-is-about-more-than-the-arrival-of-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T08:00:03Z","webTitle":"Why the climate of Game of Thrones is about more than the arrival of winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/jan/23/why-the-climate-of-game-of-thrones-is-about-more-than-the-arrival-of-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/blog/2018/jan/23/why-the-climate-of-game-of-thrones-is-about-more-than-the-arrival-of-winter","fields":{"headline":"Why the climate of Game of Thrones is about more than the arrival of winter","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For fans disappointed that the next series of Game of Thrones won’t be on our screens until 2019, here’s some food for thought: an attack on Westeros would be most likely to come from the south in winter and north in summer, according to a climate model of the world of Game of Thrones. Furthermore, the model also sheds light on many mysteries surrounding the climate of the lands of Westeros and Essos – including the likely hibernation zones of White Walkers and the similarities between The Wall and Lapland. You might well wonder why I and other climate science colleagues from Cardiff and Southampton universities have recently spent some of our spare time creating climate models of a fictional world. After all, is it helpful to know, as the model suggests, that due to the nature of the winds between Westeros and Essos, an attack on Westeros (whether by dragons, ships or both), would probably come via the south (from Dorne or Storm’s End) in winter, but more northerly (Vale of Arryn, or direct to King’s Landing), in summer? And what of the revelation from the model that that the Iron Fleet’s naval prowess can be explained by very strong winds in the region of the Iron Islands? Or the knowledge that the temperatures predicted by the model indicate that in summer, the only places north of The Wall that are below freezing are the high-altitude regions of the Frostfangs, perhaps indicating the likely summer hibernation zones of White Walkers? Apart from the fact that we found it fascinating to flesh out this fictional world with our model, it’s also a nice way to illustrate how climate models work and to highlight some fascinating climate science going on in the real world. For example, the SWEET project is currently using novel techniques to reconstruct the climate of super-warm states of Earth’s past – which in turn will help to test state-of- the-art climate models under conditions of high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations similar to those expected by the end of this century. In our Game of Thrones model, by comparing the climate of places in the real world with those predicted by the model for the world of Game of Thrones, it could be seen that The Wall, where the land of Westeros is guarded from the White Walkers, has a climate in winter similar to that of Lapland. In contrast Casterly Rock, the stronghold of the scheming Lannisters, has a climate similar to that of Houston, Texas, and Changsha in China. But how did we create the model in the first place? When carrying out this “work”, which is written up in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of King’s Landing and the Twitter account of @ClimateSamwell, the first step was to modify a “normal” climate model so that the land and ocean was laid out as in the maps provided by George RR Martin in the Game of Thrones books. The model was then modified to have the characteristic “extended seasons”, which the books and TV series describe as lasting several years. In the real world, the tilt of the spinning axis of the planet is at a fixed angle throughout the year, resulting in our characteristic four seasons. One way that seasons can be made to last longer is to allow this tilt of the spinning axis to change throughout the year, so that the Earth “tumbles” on its axis – a bit like a spinning top. If the Earth tumbles exactly once in a single year, then the spin axis always points towards (or away) from the sun, and the winter (or summer) is then permanent. Interestingly, a very similar tumble – but occurring on much longer timescales of tens of thousands of years – causes major changes to the climate of our own planet. For example, 6,000 years ago it resulted in plants in the middle of what is today’s Sahara desert, and contributed to the ice age cycle that caused much of the UK to be covered in thick ice 20,000 years ago. We also modelled the global warming that would occur if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were to be doubled, perhaps due to increases in CO2 and methane emissions from dragons and the excessive use of wildfire. The model estimates a global warming of 2.1C for a doubling of CO2 in the world of Game of Thrones. The work illustrates that because climate models are based on fundamental scientific processes – many of which have been known since the days of Isaac Newton – they are able not only to simulate the climate of the modern Earth, but can also be easily adapted to simulate any planet past, present, future, or imagined, as long as the underlying continental positions and greenhouse gas concentrations are known. Furthermore – and this is what I do in my “day job” – for some super-warm time periods in Earth’s past, there is geological data available that indicates what the climate actually was like, so we are able to test the climate models under high carbon dioxide conditions, similar to those we might expect by the end of this century if we continue emitting greenhouse gases at the current rate. Such testing of climate models under super-warm greenhouse conditions is crucial if we are to have confidence in their predictions of the future – either for Earth or Westeros.

Like Marmite, it wasn’t an occasion I cared for much; family dysfunction and this most twee of festivals are not a happy pairing. Christmas was a sore point underscoring absences and pain I was still grappling with. Becoming a Scrooge seemed an inevitability. Bah-humbugging my way through November, when Christmasphiles become ever more vocal about their planning for the big day, was necessary protection. To counter the mirth and good cheer I’d (in a manner not too dissimilar from a stroppy teenager) harrumph about commercialisation, the vacuity of sentimentality and the blandness of a traditional Christmas meal. I might, from time to time, remind my interlocutor that divorce rates doubled over Christmas as though it were proof positive of the season’s inherent awfulness. Only for the benefit of my younger siblings would I give all this a rest. They were too young and fragile themselves to withstand my observation that Christmas, like winter, is a time when poverty is at its starkest. And this all held true until I had children. At first I resisted. Our Nigerian parents hadn’t raised us with the myth of Santa Claus and yet here I was, a functioning adult. My own children, I surmised, would grow up fine without the pretence. Then my son turned three, the age at which children desperately care about having a birthday party and, unfortunately for me, about yuletide too. In the run-up to that Christmas and in the course of several conversations with my in-laws, it had become clear that not actively taking part in the Santa myth-making was tantamount to eating babies. Intimating that adults shouldn’t normalise the idea of a stranger creeping into children’s rooms unbeknown to them or us didn’t work either. I found myself press-ganged into begrudgingly playing along. No, I hadn’t heard of the mince pie and carrots under the bed tradition but yes, since these were available in my mother-in-law’s fridge, I would be OK with this being done. And so ’twas the night before Christmas. My three-year-old’s excitement was barely contained. As he carefully helped me set out the snacks for Santa and his reindeer, I couldn’t help but wonder how I, the same person that had struggled to contain her contempt at stories of parents dipping shoes in flour to make footprints in the garden, had arrived here. Yet in that moment my son’s anticipation released me from my curmudgeonly self. His innocence warmed my heart and I allowed myself to ask, what could be so wrong with enabling him, however briefly, to believe that magic existed in this world? The next morning our son bounded in at ungodly o’clock to tell us it was “CHRISTMAS!” We mustered enough energy to appear enthused, if bleary-eyed. “Has Santa been?” he asked. We croaked that we didn’t know. Together we stumbled back to his room and peered under the bed. The mince pie was half-eaten, as were the carrots, and our son gasped the way children did in the Coca-Cola adverts of old. Wide-eyed, full of joy and wonderment he declared: “Santa HAS BEEN!” That was the Christmas I decided I would embrace rather be haunted by absences I could do nothing about. No longer do I notice the exact moment in October when a Christmas playlist can be heard tinkling in the background, disturbing the poise of a Saturday stroll around Sainsbury’s. I am still not a fan of sending cards, and refrain from using “Santa only visits good boys and girls” as a disciplinary tool. But this year my tree was up and decorated on 2 December. Rainy weekend mornings have been taken up with making paper chains with my children while listening to George Michael, Frank Sinatra and Mariah Carey. In spite of the long list of reasons to hate it, gone are the days of dreading Christmas. • Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and award-winning columnist focusing on race, politics, education and feminism"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/21/thousands-of-uk-toys-r-us-jobs-saved-after-last-minute-pension-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T17:34:43Z","webTitle":"Thousands of UK Toys R Us jobs saved after deal with pensions body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/21/thousands-of-uk-toys-r-us-jobs-saved-after-last-minute-pension-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/21/thousands-of-uk-toys-r-us-jobs-saved-after-last-minute-pension-deal","fields":{"headline":"Thousands of UK Toys R Us jobs saved after deal with pensions body","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thousands of jobs at Toys R Us have been saved after the ailing toy retailer agreed to pump more than £9m into its pension plan over the next two years in a last-minute deal with the state-backed pensions lifeboat.

While up to 800 people could still lose their job as a result of the restructure, more than 2,000 more will be saved as Toys R Us tries to turn its remaining UK business around. Steve Knights, managing director of Toys R Us UK, said: “We are pleased to have secured the support of our creditors and will be working closely with them in the months ahead. The vote in favour of the CVA represents strong support for our business plan and provides us with the platform we need to transform our business so that we can better serve our customers today and long into the future. “All of our stores across the UK will remain open for business as normal until spring 2018. Customers can continue to shop online and there will be no changes to our returns policies or gift cards across this period.” The PPF said earlier this week that it would not back the restructure unless Toys R Us agreed to increase its support for its pension fund. Talks on a deal lasted until 1.30pm on Thursday, more than two hours after the creditors’ meeting to approve the restructure was intended to start. The company agreed to pay £9.8m into its pension plan, composed of £2.2m by March 2018 £1.6m in October next year and a further £3m a year in 2019 and 2020. Previously it had committed to paying only £1.6m a year into the pension for the next three years. The deal will also result in the pension deficit recovery plan being shortened to 10 years, while the company has undertaken to seek additional support from its US parent company for the new plan for the pension scheme. As part of the deal, pension fund trustees will have greater powers to call in administrators if any of those conditions are not met. The compromise deal comes after the PPF initially demanded an up front payment of £9m in the coming months. Malcolm Weir, its director of restructuring and insolvency, said: “This offer goes a long way to addressing the PPF’s concerns and in de-risking the pension scheme, offering greater protection for the current and retired members in the pension scheme.” The PPF was keen to secure better up front payments for pension schemes to protect its levy payers from having to pick up the bill for deficits after a series of high profile failures of businesses shortly after securing CVA deals, including BHS. Graham Barker, chair of the trustees, and Tom Lukic, director with Dalriada Trustees, who was recently appointed as professional trustee to the scheme on the advice of the PPF, said: “Whilst the trustee board very much appreciate the impact of the CVA on a number of employees and stores, we are pleased that agreement has been reached for the PPF to vote for the CVA. “We will be writing to update all scheme members as soon as the result of the vote is known.” Toys R Us suppliers attending the meeting on Thursday in central London told the Guardian there was relief that the deal had gone through. Chris Robinson, managing director of Suki Gifts International, a soft toy supplier which is owed thousands of pounds by Toys R Us, said he was pleased the CVA had been approved and that it was “a common sense deal that was what everyone wanted”. He added: “It’s the most sensible arrangement for staff and suppliers.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/21/homeless-man-who-killed-mother-and-son-has-sentence-increased","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T23:08:02Z","webTitle":"Homeless man who killed mother and son has sentence increased","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/21/homeless-man-who-killed-mother-and-son-has-sentence-increased","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/21/homeless-man-who-killed-mother-and-son-has-sentence-increased","fields":{"headline":"Homeless man who killed mother and son has sentence increased","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Three senior judges have increased the sentence handed down to a homeless man who turned on the woman who tried to help him and killed both her and her teenage son. Aaron Barley was originally told he would spend at least 30 years in prison for the murders of Tracey and Pierce Wilkinson at their home in Stourbridge, West Midlands in March. Following an appeal by the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, however, the three judges ruled that the sentence was insufficient in what they described as a “most exceptional and grave case” and increased Barley’s minimum term to 35 years. Barley, 24, admitted the two murders and the attempted murder of Tracey Wilkinson’s husband, Peter. He was taken into their family home and given a fresh chance in life after Tracey Wilkinson spotted him sleeping rough outside a supermarket. Sentencing in the original trial, Mrs Justice Carr had told Barley he had carried out “a vicious and unprovoked attack” on people who had shown him “extraordinary kindness and generosity”. She said she had decided not to impose a whole-life tariff principally because of his age. In the appeal court on Thursday, Lord Justice Holroyde said Carr was entitled to conclude that the circumstances of the crimes, truly dreadful as they were, did not require a whole-life order. He added, however, that the only significant mitigating features were Barley’s psychological problems - which did not prevent his ability to plan and meticulously carry out the attack - and his admissions. “The brutality of the stabbings and the terror which the victims must have felt were very grave aggravating features,” he said. Peter Wilkinson and his daughter Lydia, who was away at university at the time of the attack, were at the high court in London while Barley watched from prison via videolink. Speaking after the hearing, Buckland said: “Aaron Barley’s attack on the Wilkinson family was a truly despicable crime. “The Wilkinson family had gone out of their way to help him and he repaid their kindness with a brutal attack which devastated their family. “My thoughts are with Peter and Lydia Wilkinson particularly and I hope they can find some comfort in the increased sentence today.” Barley stabbed Tracey Wilkinson 17 times and inflicted eight knife wounds on Pierce after sneaking into their home dressed in a balaclava. Birmingham crown court had heard that Tracey Wilkinson took pity on Barley, when she found him huddled in a cardboard box outside a supermarket in September 2016. She drove him home and gave him her husband’s dinner. The family helped Barley find accommodation and made sure he had a hot meal every night. Peter Wilkinson gave Barley a job at his company but had to sack him after he began taking drugs. Last year, Barley spent Christmas Day with the family and wrote Tracey Wilkinson a card addressed: “To the mother that I never had.” When he lost his accommodation, the family allowed him to stay with them for two weeks. At the end of March, Barley arrived at the family home dressed in black and armed with a knife. He killed Tracey Wilkinson in her bed and her 13-year-old son in his room. When Peter Wilkinson returned, Barley leapt out of a garden shed, where he had been hiding, and attacked him. Barley stabbed Wilkinson six times before fleeing in his victim’s Land Rover. Barley’s motive remains unknown. He refused to give an explanation to the police and would not allow toxicology tests to be done, meaning it is not known if he had been drinking or taking drugs. Barley had 21 previous convictions for offences including an assault on a former partner were read out. Volunteers at an alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre have reported that Barley said he wanted to kill someone with a knife – with his “two aims in life” being to kill a police officer and a prison officer. But his remarks were dismissed as bravado caused by drug abuse. The 35-year sentence will be slightly reduced because of time Barley spent on remand and it will be 34 years and 178 days before he can be considered for release on licence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/29/oh-dear-john-majors-mild-mannered-notes-on-briefing-papers-revealed","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T00:01:15Z","webTitle":"'Oh dear': John Major's mild-mannered notes on briefing papers revealed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/29/oh-dear-john-majors-mild-mannered-notes-on-briefing-papers-revealed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/29/oh-dear-john-majors-mild-mannered-notes-on-briefing-papers-revealed","fields":{"headline":"'Oh dear': John Major's mild-mannered notes on briefing papers revealed","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Trouble ahead!” has emerged as John Major’s favourite handwritten response to the contents of the Downing Street files that filled his red box every night as prime minister. While Margaret Thatcher regularly responded to proposals with “No, no , no!” underlined up to three times, Major’s responses were somewhat calmer. On a note proposing an elaborate menu of scampi provencale and glazed courgettes during a flight to Zimbabwe, he simply wrote: “As long as I have soup and cheese and biscuits I will be all right.” As for the proposed itinerary: “Yes please. Plenty of travel pills.” On a memo informing him of developments in the 1992 summer coup against Russia’s Boris Yeltsin, he noted: “Illegal coup. Calm. Put the clock back.” A briefing about nuclear weapons in the disintegrating Soviet Union was met with “Oh dear.” To one of his private office civil servants who was trying to rush him into letting the LSE take over the old London County Hall: “Barry. Hang on! Treasury aren’t signed up and the chancellor won’t want a meeting today.” A speech by the then home secretary, Ken Clarke, to the Police Federation on police pay provoked Major to reply: “It reads like a chocolate-coated poison pill!” The Man Who Never Was Ewen Montagu, the British naval intelligence officer who devised the Operation Mincemeat deception plan against the Germans, made a 1984 plea for the fifth volume of the official history of British Intelligence in the second world war to be published. Margaret Thatcher had blocked publication of Prof Michael Howard’s book detailing the deception work of Britain’s secret “double cross committee” on the grounds that “too much has been said and written about intelligence and less should be said”. Montagu, whose own 1953 book, The Man Who Never Was, detailed the deception plan that involved a dead British soldier washing up on the coast of Spain with fictitious plans to invade Sardinia in a briefcase, appealed to the cabinet secretary for publication of the official history, saying that the doctors had given him only a very few months to live. “I was astounded to learn that the publication was officially banned some years ago, since when there has been no move. This must be an oversight.” He told the cabinet secretary in December 1984 that having spent more than five years of his life in attempting to deceive the enemy, he “was intensely keen to know what the official verdict is”. Thatcher refused to lift the ban on publication but she did permit Montagu to be shown Howard’s typescript on the condition that he read it, returned it and did not show it to anyone else. Montagu died, aged 84, on 19 July 1985. • Corrected 29 December 2017: The location where the corpse, dressed as a British soldier, washed ashore was on the coast of Spain, not Portugal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2017/dec/31/2017-eyewitness-our-summary-of-the-defining-images-of-the-year","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T00:05:15Z","webTitle":"2017 Eyewitness: our summary of the defining images of the year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/dec/31/2017-eyewitness-our-summary-of-the-defining-images-of-the-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/dec/31/2017-eyewitness-our-summary-of-the-defining-images-of-the-year","fields":{"headline":"2017 Eyewitness: our summary of the defining images of the year","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"20 January: Donald Trump’s inauguration – singer Beau Davidson recalls performing for the president I had sung for the then candidate Donald Trump in March 2016 at Mar-a-Lago for a Lincoln’s Day dinner. I thought I was performing a patriotic duty, but I received quite a bit of vitriol afterwards, people treated me as if I had killed someone’s daughter. Then in December 2016 I was asked to perform at the All American Ball on the eve of the inauguration in January. At this particular ball, Buzz Aldrin was being honoured and so was Oliver North. The next day, I went to the swearing-in ceremony to watch the historic transfer of power. To get there, I walked through two areas of protest. They were loud, but there was respect between both sides. I’d never been to a swearing-in ceremony before. It was wonderful to see past presidents there. Inside, the people around me were polite and respectful. There were times, such as when Hillary Clinton was announced, that there were boos from my area, but I didn’t see the level of vitriol that was reported. The rain started to fall. But most people wanted to see the spectacle. It’s something everyone should see. It felt extremely full to me. I saw people to the north, south, east and west of me. But that’s not to say I knew the numbers. Afterwards, I went to the diversity luncheon for the GOP. It was a small luncheon, maybe 50 people or fewer. I said: “You don’t know what it’s like to be a singer for conservative events, for the GOP,” and they looked at me, and said: “We’re black” – meaning you think it’s hard for you, try being a black Republican in the south. There are some good things about this presidency, some bad things and some unfortunate things. But I believe that his spirit and his heart are in the right place. Beyoncé had the great honour of performing for President Obama and I had the honour of performing for President Trump. 21 January: Women march around the world – Sandi Toksvig remembers a day of joyful chaos At one point, standing onstage in Trafalgar Square, I heard what I thought was a helicopter. In fact, it was the roar of the crowd coming down Whitehall. Nobody expected anything of this scale – no streets were closed, the police were panicked, but everyone was quite joyful, holding placards saying things like: “We Shall Overcomb,” and “My Pussy Bites Back.” Compared with the excitement outside, backstage was rather different, warmed by fire from a single gas canister in a flapping tent. It felt like a bit of a shambles, actually. There were lots of high-profile speakers we couldn’t introduce because they were lost in the crowds, still marching. But in that British way, we made the best of it. Until, at 2.45pm, we were told we had to shut everything down due to an “incident”, which was rather worrying – Jo Cox was very much on our mind. But the incident turned out to be the fact that we’d closed down London. It was miraculous and wonderful. And necessary, too. The day before, the Financial Times had run a piece unpicking Theresa May’s style. Again, coverage of a powerful woman that was all about what she looks like. So it felt important that not only were we all seen, but heard, too. It was the most moving experience of my life. Looking back, it’s clear that that collective voice led to these individual voices coming forward today, about sexual harassment or the gender pay gap. The World Economic Forum worked out it would take 170 years to achieve gender equality, but I’m an optimist. Also, I can’t wait that long. The Women’s Equality Party is focused on persuading political parties to change, and we’re the fastest-growing political party in the country. There was a time when feminism was the new F word – now people are proud to claim it for themselves. The roar of that crowd continues to echo. 8 February: Hockney’s exhibition is a sensation – designer Celia Birtwell on the record-breaking Tate show David normally goes home before the end of his exhibition openings. Everybody wants a bit of him when he’s out and he’s exhausted by the end of it really, but after his Tate exhibition he stayed for the dinner. The tables were lined up, a huge banquet, but it was so damn hot and going up the escalator I remember looking around at all the people melting in the heat, and thinking: “This is all so crazy.” I don’t go to all of David’s exhibitions but we’ve been friends since the 60s, and I’m a big fan, too. When he’s around I see him and also he emails me all of his ideas that he’s working on. I think nothing else in David’s life has been as important as his work. He’s amazing and I don’t know anybody else like him. If you start selling your paintings from a young age and people love them, it’s an explosion in your mind and it just keeps going. It’s addictive, it feeds you. David’s done very nice drawings of me over the years and he’s a great pal of mine – he’s life enhancing, actually. When he painted me and my husband Ossie Clark he couldn’t get Ossie’s feet right, so he covered them up with a shag-pile carpet. I never could bear to look at the painting, though. And I don’t know why it became as famous as it did – it’s a strange combination, Ossie sitting down, me standing up and all the psychological conversations that people have about it. Of course, one’s always a bit vain or has an idea of how you look. Sometimes he draws you and you can’t see what he’s doing, but he’s very intent and serious, and you’re just hoping that you’re going to like it. I think he can tell by your face whether you do or not. He’s got quite a good take of me now and he’ll say: “I don’t always flatter you, you know,” and you have to shut up and get on with it because you can’t do anything about it. 26 February: The wrong film ‘wins’ an Oscar – Moonlight’s producer Andrew Hevia remembers the moment of the announcement Moonlight was a small, personal and independent film – the sort of movie you make because you fall in love with it. When the reviews started coming in, and then the award nominations, it was extraordinary. It’s all you can ever hope for, that the thing you love will be loved by others. On the night of the Oscars there was a real sense that we were going to win something. Best Supporting Actor was on the table, Best Adapted Screenplay, too. As it had been nominated a record-matching number of times, we all knew La La Land was the odds-on favourite for Best Picture. Award after award went to them, and with two wins for Moonlight I wasn’t even disappointed – I was delighted. When Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty stepped out onstage, and there was a pause before the announcement of a winner, I thought they were playing the crowd. Faye read out La La Land, as I expected. It was only when La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz yelled through the mic that there had been a mistake, that Moonlight had actually won, that things got confusing. As we collected the award I tried to stay calm, but when we arrived backstage everyone was shellshocked, the teams from both movies squeezed into an area built for one. I turned to [playwright] Tarell McCraney and said: “Did that really just happen?” It would have been incredible if the awards had gone without a hitch, but this was certainly memorable! I’ve heard people say that it must be frustrating to have had Moonlight’s moment overshadowed, but I don’t see it that way. This had never happened in the history of the awards, so it’s Oscars trivia now. And to be forever linked to La La Land in this way is no bad thing. I’m grateful that the movie got recognised and I’m thrilled we had our moment, even if it didn’t happen as it was supposed to. 10 March: Toddler trouble – Robert Kelly on being upstaged on TV by his kids I was doing an interview for the BBC in my study and my wife was filming me with her phone on the TV in the next room. After a while, my four-year-old daughter recognised who I was on the screen. After screaming “Daddy, Daddy!” at the TV and getting no response, she set off to find the real me in my office. It had been a long day and I had forgotten to lock the study door, so my daughter came bursting in, followed by my one-year-old son. My wife noticed my daughter had come into the room by seeing it live on TV in the other room and came sprinting after them. I remember willing the BBC presenter to pull the switch and pretend that we’d lost signal, but he didn’t so I had to keep going. As soon as it was over, my wife and I just sat there in horror, we had a sleepless night thinking that was the end of my career. But then after about two hours my Twitter feed starting flashing and I got notifications from all around the world. The next morning the BBC called back wanting to do another interview because of the response the video had had online. Afterwards, it was super intense. There was a lot of sexual and racial critique, which we didn’t want to get involved in. We’re just a normal family trying to raise a couple of kids. I never know when I go up to speak at professional things if people are going to bring it up or play it before I speak. There are two or three places I have spoken at where it has been discussed. I don’t say anything because I don’t want to be over-sensitive, but it’s a little ridiculous. 9 April: United Airlines evicts Dr Dao from the flight – fellow passenger Jason Powell recounts how it happened I was flying home to Kentucky, bringing history students back from a trip to Europe. When we boarded the plane, we did not imagine we’d see a man dragged from his seat, bleeding, with broken teeth. United Airlines had overbooked by four seats and offered people $400 to get off. Two people accepted, but no one else wanted to move so they used a computer to randomly generate the names of two more passengers. A woman left so they just needed Dr David Dao, who was five rows behind me. He refused to leave. That’s when the aviation police came on. They argued. Dao said he was a doctor and had patients to see the next day. At first, the police were just talking to him. But then an officer ripped Dao out of his chair and dragged him down the aisle, smashing his head against an armrest. There was blood everywhere and people were yelling at the security. It was brutal. After he had been removed, Dao came running back on to the plane. At this point, I had seen enough. My students were seated at the back of the plane where Dao was bleeding, and the same security crew were coming towards him. I yelled: “Pick up your stuff, we’re leaving.” I got them off and then other people started to leave the plane, too. The whole time I felt disbelief. There was an eight-year-old crying and her dad went up to the police. He said: “You ought to be ashamed of yourselves, we’re traumatised and you are just laughing it off!” Has this changed anything in the airline industry? I kind of doubt it. 2 May: Taxi drivers take on George Osborne – cabbie Sean Day on the taxi demo When I saw George Osborne ushered in to start as editor of the Evening Standard I thought: “He looks like he’s been up all night.” Clearly he needed to get into the office as quickly as possible. We found out he’d be there and we did a flash demo. He seemed unnerved by the sight of us – around 300 black-cab drivers. It was under the banner of Dads Defending Daughters (DDD), a pressure group set up to highlight corporate and government injustice. We felt vindicated even if no one was listening. It wasn’t getting reported on and felt like a bit of a blackout. But this protest was different. We knew Osborne had taken a job at BlackRock investment bank earning £650,000 for just one day a week, and found out that they invested in Uber. When he became editor of the Evening Standard, we saw it all fall into place. It felt like the government and regulators were against us. It’s shocking he was given that editorship: a very credible senior journalist could have done a fantastic job and he gets it, and keeps his position as MP. It’s not in the spirit of London, especially with the government saying we were all in it together. Coming together makes everyone feel good, but it doesn’t change anything afterwards; most of the working class don’t have that resilience to keep going because you soon run out of the resources you need to sustain a protest. I was told the other night that a black cab picked up George Osborne. I wish he’d get into my cab – I’d have had a few choice words for him. 3 June: London Bridge is attacked – journalist Geoff Ho on tackling the terrorists and being stabbed I had finished work and spent the evening going from pub to pub, watching the Champions League final and having a few drinks. At about 9.45pm I was going to call it a night when I saw a fight break out outside a pub between two drunk men and a bouncer, so I held one of them off and waited for the police to come. Afterwards, I decided to go to the restaurant Black &amp; Blue in Borough to catch up with friends. That’s when the terrorists attacked. We saw three men walking towards the restaurant. They had what looked like suicide bombs attached to them. It was strange how they walked so slowly and calmly. They were like wild animals stalking people. One of the waitresses locked the door, but they kicked it in. Everyone panicked and hid under chairs and tables. If I had just laid down like everyone else we probably would have all died. I wanted to make sure everyone had the chance to get out. I decided to try talking to them while everyone got away. As I approached them they attacked me. One stabbed me twice in the throat and tried to stab me in the stomach, but missed. I hit the floor and they ran off. Everyone else managed to make it out without injury, thankfully. I picked myself off the floor. A friend called the police. I got him to keep the operator on the line and tell them what was going on so I could look for something to stop the bleeding. Soon, armed police arrived and radioed for an ambulance. When I got to hospital I was rushed into emergency surgery. I spent a 12 days in hospital. I couldn’t eat or speak because I had a tube down my throat. The experience has changed my outlook. I am more appreciative of everything now. Above all, I was relieved I had distracted the terrorists. Seeing my friends and family rally around, I couldn’t help but feel better about the world. If it had to happen to someone, better me than someone unable to survive it. 4 June: Ariana Grande’s One Love benefit concert – PC Paul Taylor on dancing at the Manchester concert It was difficult for people to enjoy themselves bearing in mind what had gone on, but we wanted to show terrorists that they’re not going to win and we’re going to do everything we can to let people attend these events without fear. Before the crowd came into Ariana Grande’s One Love benefit concert, we wandered around getting to know where the entrances were, where the exits were, so that if, God forbid, anything did happen, we knew where to go. The concert started and I’d been standing at the back for a few hours when my back started aching a bit. I do like Coldplay, I even like Take That, though I’m a 50-year-old guy. Then Justin Bieber came on and I noticed these two little girls, Tegan and Maya, and they were about five yards away just staring at me. Then Natasha, Maya’s mum, asked if they could have a photograph taken. So, of course, I did and a few minutes later we were dancing. It turned out to be just what I needed for my back, to get the old joints going. There were about 10 of us doing a little Ring a Ring o’ Roses, so I thought nothing of it, never did I imagine it would go viral. At the end of the concert, there were a lot of tearful teenage girls – many of them had been to the original concert. They were saying they were apprehensive about making their way back outside. So I went to the exit with them and saw them out. People were really appreciative and thankful, shaking our hands. It’s not that often we get compliments from the public. It’s something I’ll never forget. 14 June: Grenfell Tower blazes – a firefighter with North Kensington fire service relives the tragic night It was mid-morning by the time everyone from my watch had been rounded up. The 10 of us had been spread all over the area – in the building, pumping, working on the ground. In the end we just sat together in a dazed silence on the pavement in the shadow of the tower, waiting to drive back to the station. Most of us have worked alongside each other for years – we’ve seen and been through a lot together. But nothing compared to what we witnessed that night. The desperate screams and the debris falling from above us, the flashing lights and the smoke-filled stairwells. The all-consuming sound of the inferno. It was silent as we drove back to the station. We sat glued to our phone screens, it was dawning on us that our families would be watching the horrors unfold on TV. I made sure my loved ones knew I was OK. Back at the station firefighters from other watches were waiting. They helped us with our gear and made breakfast. We were asked to write down everything we had seen, every action taken. It’s hard to forget, but sometimes the little details fade. Nothing was said about the number of lives lost that night, but there was no need to. We all knew there were so many people we couldn’t get to. We could see them in the windows waving and calling out for help, unreachable. It was devastating knowing that in that moment there was nothing more anyone could do. We knew we couldn’t save them. As soon as I could I got away from the station. I reached a crossroads and looked up to see Grenfell Tower smoking. Flashbacks of the night ran through my mind. When I made it home and walked in the front door my wife was waiting. She held me as we both burst into tears. It didn’t feel real. That sense of disbelief remains. The tears haven’t stopped either, although a lot of that has now turned to anger and frustration at how the community has been treated in the aftermath. The survivors of Grenfell are being failed by the government and the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The tragedy for them is far from over. 24 June: Glastonbury falls for the Labour leader – Jeremy Corbyn recalls the moment he took to the stage I will never forget the electric atmosphere that met me on stage at Glastonbury. It was a wonderful event and so full of hope. I remember being taken to Glastonbury as a boy by my mum and dad to see the Tor, long before the festival started. It has always been a special place, and now the festival is an extraordinary occasion, bringing together people, art, music, environment – and joy. I wanted to reflect the magnitude of the occasion and was planning to incorporate appropriate poetry into my speech. I originally wanted to quote from Ode to the West Wind, as Shelley is a poet who has inspired generation after generation. The poem contains many pertinent lines, but there was nothing I could quote briefly, so I reverted to the famous rallying cry from The Masque of Anarchy: “Ye are many – they are few.” I was going to stick to my script, but gazing out at all the banners I changed my mind about what to say. One sign read: “Build Bridges Not Walls”, so I began with a reference to Donald Trump and his ridiculous border plan. My speech, I hope, was a statement about the creativity that is in us all and that politics, like poetry and music, is about all of us: our hopes, our dreams and our aspirations for the world. I returned to Glastonbury a few weeks ago for the opening of a social xhousing development and we went back to the festival site, with the Pyramid stage laid bare, a mere skeleton. Four of us stood in a field where there had been thousands in the summer. It was so quiet. You could only hear the rustle of the leaves and sheep faintly grazing. In the distance behind the stage, we could see the Tor. It was another magical moment, which reminded me of Shelley’s verse: “O Wind, / If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?” 9 July: The liberation of Mosul – by the BBC’s Quentin Sommerville The battle for Mosul was a vicious street fight, played out in the homes of the people who lived there. In suburban neighbourhoods, the leaves of eucalyptus and orange trees would shake and fall as so-called Islamic State sent wave after wave of car bombs towards Iraqi forces. The city airport was bombed flat and, as mortars landed nearby, I met a man who could take no more. He was leaving, with only a small bag of belongings and a blanket. “For God’s sake,” he said, “we need you to help us, we need a shovel to get the dead bodies out of the building.” Six of his family were killed that day. Iraqi special forces entered Mosul on 1 November 2016; on 9 July 2017 Iraq’s prime minister declared victory. Life had already returned and, in the east, much of the city was intact. But in the west, inside the historic old city, there was near total ruin. In the city’s east, at the Mosque of Believers, I met Mullah Fares Fadel Ibrahim. He said Isis were welcomed as men of faith, until their true nature was realised. They murdered the senior imam at his mosque. Iraq has declared victory over Isis. A remarkable feat when, three years before, its forces ran away from the jihadists, abandoning tanks, howitzers and even their uniforms as they fled. But some of the divisions which Isis exploited in Iraq remain. The group’s predecessor was al-Qaida, it was almost defeated in Iraq, but rose again. The caliphate, an unrealised empire that promised to threaten the gates of Rome, has been bombed out of existence. But Isis fighters and sympathisers still lie in wait, and will not be so easily obliterated. 12 August: Violence flares in Charlottesville – protestor Ross Mittiga recalls standing up to the neo-nazis It was the night before the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville when it dawned on me that our streets were going to see violence. After a service led by Cornel West on the evening of 11 August our congregation was told to remain inside the church, as Nazis attacked students outside. The next morning I marched with a group of 50 or so anti-racists to Emancipation Park, where the Nazis were gathering. Down the street was smoke and the sound of yelling. It quickly became obvious we couldn’t get close without risking serious harm. We changed direction and found ourselves face to face with the parade: Nazis dressed like Trump; Nazis dressed like Italian fascists; Nazis with wooden shields. There were no masks, nobody even attempting to hide their identities. Eventually it quietened down. It looked as if we’d succeeded in chasing the racists from our town. My wife pointed out we’d taken no pictures of each other, so she turned her camera towards me. In that split-second a car smashed into the crowd just 20ft away. At first everyone froze. Bodies and placards were flying in the air. All I could hear was screaming. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed and 19 others were injured when a white supremacist ploughed into us. Fear and anxiety remains, and I don’t know if or when that will go away. But today hope and pride also flow through Charlottesville, we are a town that showed strength. We resisted the neo-fascists and embraced each other through grief. 1 September: L’Oréal’s race row – by model and social activist Munroe Bergdorf I got an email saying L’Oréal wanted me to be the face of a campaign. The importance of it only dawned on me as I was coming back from the shoot in Paris: I was to be the first transgender woman to do so. The reception was great for two weeks, then L’Oréal’s PR department told me that the Daily Mail had a screen grab from a Facebook post I’d written, and the paper was running a story saying I think all white people are racist. Rather than allow me to explain my position, I was dropped. The fallout was awful. People said they wanted to rape, kill and dismember me. The response just proved my point: if these people didn’t already dislike black people why would they react with such violence? L’Oréal’s decision to hire me would have been a big deal if it hadn’t been just an exercise in tokenism. They wanted a black girl and a trans girl to sell their product, but they didn’t want my history, my thoughts or my voice. 6 September: The desperate plight of the Rohingya refugees – Minzayar Oo photographs the human crisis More than 600,000 Rohingya refugees, over 340,000 of them children, have fled to Bangladesh since Myanmar’s military launched what it described as “clearance operations” in August. This photograph shows Rohingya families getting on to a boat on the Naf river to continue their journey as they entered Bangladesh. I took it on my first afternoon in the country; the next day, the authorities were waiting for us at the hotel. I was arrested on suspicion of espionage and faced with seven years in prison. My assignment was for the German magazine Geo. They wanted to do a state-of-the-union report about Myanmar and, when you talk about my country, you cannot avoid the Rohingya issue. There is almost no access on the Myanmar side, only a few selected media get official permission to go to the Rakhine border and these are very much arranged trips. So we decided it was better to report from Bangladesh, hearing the stories of the people arriving. The Rohingya people I met in Bangladesh looked exhausted and lost. I spoke to one man who was carrying his father on his shoulders. Their village and their house had been burned to the ground, so they had to leave. In the hospital, there was a four-month-old baby with a serious injury and a woman who said she had been shot. Many of them had lived where they had left for decades. It was heartbreaking: I kept thinking: “What if it was me or my family?” When I was arrested, I felt quite confident. I was just telling the truth whenever I was questioned. But it did get complicated, and I ended up spending 10 days in prison. The Rohingya story is a very tough one to work on in Myanmar, but also it’s an important one. And if there’s a chance for me to keep reporting on it then, yes, I will do it. 6 September: Hurricane Irma causes devastation – resident Laura Strickling braves the storm on St Thomas I had never been through a hurricane before. The last big one to hit St Thomas was 20 years ago. People told me it was going to be fine and not to worry. The Friday before, I went out shopping and everyone said I’d gone overboard, but by Monday everyone was doing the same. By Tuesday they were saying Irma was going to be the biggest storm on record. One of the blessings of modernity is that we have iPhones, and we’d downloaded hurricane-tracking apps which said the storm would arrive at 7am. The crazy thing is that the entire day of the storm I had a perfect signal. At 6am we went down to the basement. We all knew it was coming and we shut the door and put sandbags in front of it. We were going to be in there all day. It was so hot because it was summer. There were no fans because the power went out – it hasn’t come back on since. For about three hours from noon to 3pm on hurricane day the whole building was shaking. You could barely hear because it was so loud and the pressure was so intense. We watched the storm on our phones and saw when the eye had passed, when we could breathe a little easier. You can’t just open a door to see what’s going on outside, that would be suicide. We thought the house was going to fall apart; it just felt neverending. I’m a brave person – we lived in Afghanistan for three years – but I’ve never been as scared as I was that day. When we closed the door before the storm everything was green, like a feast for the eyes, and when we finally opened the door everything was gone. The roofs of our neighbours’ houses were gone. We stayed on our property for four days. The electric lines were down all over the roads so we weren’t even sure how far we’d be able to get if we got in our car to explore. Finally, on the fifth day, we got out and my family flew to Chicago. A lot of people have decided not to go back at all, and those are my friends, so that’s really hard to imagine because we had this beautiful, perfect life in St Thomas. 27 September: Saudi Arabia lifts the ban on women driving – by activist Loujain Al-Hathloul My phone rang half an hour before the government made the official announcement that women were soon to be given the right to drive in our country. I had no idea the news was coming, but on the other end of the line was an official from the Presidency of State Security, the secret service. At first I was thrilled by what he had to say, I am one of many who have campaigned tirelessly for women’s rights in Saudi and beyond. Quickly it became obvious to me that this wasn’t a congratulatory phone call. I was told to say nothing publicly about the upcoming announcement and that if I did I’d be held accountable for my words. I was being threatened. This didn’t get in the way of my initial excitement: I phoned my husband, I couldn’t stop smiling, I cried. When I was arrested and imprisoned back in 2014 simply for driving a car, I wasn’t sure whether a change like this was possible. If I hadn’t been given a royal pardon I’d still be behind bars today. But that threatening phone call marred the occasion. This was the first time that I saw eye to eye with the government, but instead of embracing our work and our common goals I, and the many other women who received similar phone calls, were silenced. I’m not sure if the government were pushing us aside in an attempt to erase our activism, as if the King wanted take all the credit himself. But ours was and is a grassroots movement, so shutting down a few voices won’t make us disappear. People won’t forget what we’ve done. 5 October: The Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal breaks – Professor Tomi-Ann Roberts tells her story In the summer of 1984, I met Harvey and Bob Weinstein when I was waiting tables in New York, and Miramax was hardly a known entity. I was a 20-year-old student with aspirations of becoming an actor. Harvey offered me a part in their first feature film, but when I showed the script to my mother she said: “That’s a bit smutty.” I was invited to Harvey’s apartment one evening for a read-through. No one else was there. Harvey was naked in the bathtub. He asked me to “at least” remove my top, saying I may need to for the role. I declined, apologetically. I left the apartment thinking: “I’m not cut out for this.” I felt I wasn’t cool enough, but there was a feminist whisper that went beyond that, telling me to get out. I ended up going to the actual read-through and brought a beefy man friend along with me. It was clear Harvey wasn’t going to be there. A female casting agent said: “You know you’re not getting this part, right?” The sense that I’d been had was mortifying. Demoralising. It made me take a sharp left-turn away from pursuing that kind of career. It’s absurd that one should feel terrified by a person pacified in a bathtub, but the sexual objectification of women occurs along a continuum and I was mistreated; a tool for this man’s gratification. It took me years to come to terms with it not being about me. The security of men in this kind of situation is incredible. He knew it was not going to work every time, but why not give it a try? What struck me most about the #MeToo campaign is women’s resilience. We should not have to endure this treatment. Shame is a very lonely experience, but now you are in a room packed with women. You can turn the shame into anger, which is productive. Anger moves outwards. We change things with it. I was supposed to be grading exams when I read Jodi Kantor’s piece on Weinstein in the New York Times. I thought I’d email her on the off-chance. Aside from telling people about my experience at parties, here was a chance to tell someone who wanted to hear it. When she replied, I thought: “This is a story? You care?” It was astonishing to me."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/it-was-an-incredibly-enriching-day-the-families-taking-control-of-death","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T06:30:05Z","webTitle":"‘It was an incredibly enriching day’: the families taking control of death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/it-was-an-incredibly-enriching-day-the-families-taking-control-of-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/it-was-an-incredibly-enriching-day-the-families-taking-control-of-death","fields":{"headline":"‘It was an incredibly enriching day’: the families taking control of death","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Six years ago, my cousin died. As we waited on the kerb, my aunt, her mother, reached out, as if to touch her daughter’s coffin through the glass of the hearse window. “I hate to think of her in that box,” she said. And a chink of brutal reality hit me; this was not like any funeral I had seen at a roadside before. This was her child, in a box in a car. The tragedy was only accentuated by how alien it all felt. I had, not long before, given birth to my second child at home, with my eldest upstairs asleep, and the promise of blueberry pancakes (and a martini) after. I started to think about how much preparation we put into birth: making birth plans, reading books, talking about it, everything to make it as perfect – personal – as possible. Death is more certain than giving birth, but we rarely talk about it or want to plan for it. Yet when death comes, funerals are, as my partner says, “the ultimate distress purchase”. All through the ceremony I chewed on this. Both ends of life, one so well catered for, so planned; the other so little talked about or planned for. And yet here we were, marking a death in a way that seemed so dark and sad and not particularly recognisable as being my cousin’s. I’ve always thought you know you’re at a good funeral if the deceased were to wake up and feel right at home. And while personalised services are familiar enough these days, the conventions of hearse, traditional coffin and brisk service linger. For me, the most terrifying part of a funeral is when the coffin comes in. That and hearses, which have always evoked a visceral reaction, as if simply by looking at them you might die. They hint at one thing: epic pain and loss. I had written about wicker coffins for a column once. Did wicker coffins make funerals nicer? Could anything? It was investigating how to make funerals more family friendly that led me to Gloucestershire to meet Jane Harris and Jimmy Edmonds, whose son, Josh, had died, aged 22, two years earlier as a result of a road accident while travelling in Vietnam. As they had sat around the kitchen table taking in the terrible news, they decided to take control of Josh’s funeral in their own way. “Why would we want to hand that special ritual to someone else?” Jane explains. It was Jimmy’s idea to build Josh’s coffin, helped by a cabinet-maker friend. “We spent £30 on materials,” Jane says. “The whole community helped organise the funeral and for the men, building the coffin – doing something – was useful because some found it difficult to talk. There was a traditional division of labour, the men doing one thing, the women another. It was like a ritual.” Josh’s coffin was made of one-inch plywood and his funeral took place not in a rushed half-hour, but over seven hours. It was held at a local venue that had nothing funereal about it: one wall was lit by fairy lights. The day was about honouring, remembering and celebrating. Josh’s coffin arrived in an estate car, and was carried in by his friends and father. (“It’s useful,” Jimmy tells me, “to check practicalities. That the coffin will fit through any door you want it to, and that it will fit with people on either side carrying it.”) Friends remembered Josh, sang songs and read poetry. A humanist celebrant conducted the ceremony. “People weren’t afraid of the coffin,” Josh’s parents say: “They touched it.” The second half of the funeral involved the coffin being carried to a more private room where people said their goodbyes and wrote messages for Josh on pieces of paper or ribbons, which were then threaded through the coffin poles and subsequently kept – indeed, they were the first thing I saw when I walked into Jimmy and Jane’s house, hanging in the sitting room. “This was the death of a young person in the wrong order of things,” says Jane. “We didn’t want it to be dark. We wanted to create a safe place [at the ceremony] for his family and his younger sister. [Josh also has an older brother]. It was an incredibly enriching day, the most important day of my life, but also the saddest.” Why do the funeral yourself? “You can create something that’s about you and your family and the ritual of it saved me, in so many ways,” says Jane. “We weren’t trying to save money, we were trying to save ourselves.” The final stage of the funeral happened the next day when Josh was cremated. Even here, the family did their own thing, booking a double slot at the crematorium, “so we wouldn’t be rushed”. (You usually get 15 to 20 minutes and that can seem a savagely short time to say that final goodbye.) Josh’s ashes are now all over the world, some by the tree they planted for him, some his mother carries in a bracelet, friends have some and some are in the house in a silver-lidded dish, which Jimmy pulled out and opened. He proffered it to me and this is where I faltered. I realised it was a huge honour to be allowed to touch his son’s ashes, but I had never touched human ashes before. Three years later, this act was to stay with me – save me, actually – as I handled my own father’s ashes; and it made the whole process so much less terrifying. In Cambridge, I met David Spiegelhalter and Kate Bull, whose son Danny died aged five, of cancer, in 1997. Danny’s death had been expected so they were able to plan. “Even now,” Kate says, “people don’t mind bringing up the subject of Danny, because of their involvement in his funeral.” Danny had been a very popular young boy, so the day after his death, he was laid out in his Thunderbirds outfit and more than 100 people came to see him, including other parents and many of his classmates. David had got the Natural Death Handbook and found it “an absolute revelation”. Although Danny’s family, like Josh’s, involved a funeral director to a degree, they did much themselves. “Twenty-four hours after he died, the funeral director took him away and we went and made the coffin,” says David. “It was enormously therapeutic for me to make it; I did it with my men’s group. We had measured Danny up, and then I went to the builder’s merchants to buy the MDF. The weather was fine and we worked outside to make it. It was serviceable and robust, with a well-fitting lid and rope handles.” Indoors, a “second committee”, largely of women and children, continued the work: Danny’s mum, his two sisters and children he had known. They painted the coffin, drew on it, attached stickers. “Then, about an hour before the funeral started, the funeral directors brought Dan back, put him in the coffin and David and I screwed the lid on,” explains Kate, “which was very hard.” Danny’s coffin was lined in cloth and a cushion, with bread and presents inside it and his favourite model car. His coffin was carried down the street to a local hall, with his uncle, playing Danny Boy on the violin, walking ahead of the procession. “We had a master of ceremonies to conduct it,” says Kate, “and balloons on the coffin. Danny’s teacher spoke and held up works of his, and his nurse spoke. There were lots of children at the funeral, and they touched the coffin and were looking at it.” Danny was taken in a hearse from the centre to the small local cemetery, with just family and close friends in attendance. The grave had been dug, but they lowered the coffin in themselves and filled in the grave using spades. The school later organised the children to make flags and pictures to put on the grave. When I visited it in 2013, there were still little toys, visible, in the grass. Not long after my cousin’s death, other people I knew started dying. An uncle, three friends, two aunts – including the one whose comment had started all this. We became adept at organising family funerals. Each time, we used the same undertakers who we had got to know so they were no longer anonymous people in dark suits. The funeral director, Linda, became like one of the family. She knew my dad and my dad knew her. Then, last year, my father died. This time, I knew we had options. I knew we could keep him at home for a while, that we could make his coffin, that we didn’t need a hearse to transport him. I knew we could bury him in my garden if we wanted to. But none of this was right for us. Moreover, because of my research, I was no longer scared to talk about death and so had talked to my dad about what he wanted: to be cremated and brought home, to Italy. We kept my father at home for 11 hours after he died. It was, incredibly, a magical time. Then, we said our final goodbyes. We had already called Linda. My father’s funeral could not have been more beautiful. We used a hearse, but that didn’t scare me. When his coffin came into the church, there was no jolt of fear. I actually smiled at him. My children had picked flowers from our garden, and had written their “nonno” letters, which I had sent to Linda and she had put in with him. He had three eulogies, the priest knew him, and we took our time. We drove to the crematorium – the bit I had been dreading – where, because Linda had talked us through our options, there was no conveyor belt to take him away, no curtains drawn. We played Italian songs and when everyone else had gone, his close family gathered round the coffin – as Jane had said they’d done with Josh – and we said goodbye. • Jane Harris and Jimmy Edmonds co-founded a charity last year: thegoodgriefproject.co.uk The rules: what you need to know to create a personalised farewell The three rules to adhere to: 1. You must register the death. 2. You must dispose of the body in an approved manner. 3. You must not expose a dead body on the public highway. Direct funerals – such as David Bowie’s – are on the increase. Here, there is no ceremony, the body is collected, then disposed of – cremated or buried. You can have a separate ceremony at a later date. Direct funerals suit some (it’s cheaper) but for many, a funeral ceremony, with the coffin present – is an important part of grieving and saying goodbye. You do not need to use a funeral director unless you want to. Or you can use them just for parts of the funeral. If you can’t find a funeral director who will do this, look elsewhere. If you are told you “can’t” do something you would like to do, check. It is very easy to be bullied when you are vulnerable and grieving. You do not need to use a hearse – any suitable and safe vehicle can be used. You do not need to use a coffin – although most crematoriums will insist on a “rigid container”. Bodies can usually be buried in a shroud as long as they can safely be lowered into the grave. If a person has died of an infectious disease they would have been placed in a body bag by the hospital/undertaker and a shroud could then be wrapped around that. See hse.gov.uk/pubns/web01.pdf for more information You do not need to embalm a body unless it is being repatriated abroad. Most crematoria will deal with the family direct. You can keep a body at home, with sensible precautions. You can bury a body on private land as long as certain guidelines are followed (naturaldeath.org.uk/index.php?page=home-burial; gov.uk/guidance/cemeteries-and-burials-prevent-groundwater-pollution). Last, the Natural Death Centre website (naturaldeath.org.uk) is a fantastic resource for learning more about the choices you have, including a template for a death plan. (Why not? We have birth plans.)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/03/stories-of-loneliness-overwhelm-labour-and-conservative-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T15:00:11Z","webTitle":"Stories of loneliness: two MPs tell of 'social epidemic' in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/03/stories-of-loneliness-overwhelm-labour-and-conservative-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/03/stories-of-loneliness-overwhelm-labour-and-conservative-mps","fields":{"headline":"Stories of loneliness: two MPs tell of 'social epidemic' in UK","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A Labour and a Conservative MP have described how they were overwhelmed by heartbreaking stories of disabled people, half of whom say they feel lonely every day. Rachel Reeves and Seema Kennedy teamed up to carry on the work of their murdered Westminster colleague, Jo Cox, who wanted to lead a commission into the issue of social isolation, which she warned was seriously damaging people’s health, income levels and happiness. After the year-long project, the pair have overseen a study that shows that the effect of loneliness is equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day and can significantly increase the risk of premature death. Meanwhile, more than three-quarters of GPs see between one and five lonely people a day, with one in 10 seeing six to 10. The MPs quote Helen Stokes Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, who warned that if “nothing is done, loneliness will inevitably take its toll on the entire healthcare system”. In an interview to mark the work of the Jo Cox Loneliness Commission, Reeves says she is convinced this is a “social epidemic” that would be counted as one of social reformer William Beveridge’s giant evils if he were alive today. Kennedy, the parliamentary private secretary to the prime minister, Theresa May, calls it “a moral, health and economic issue” that inflicts an enormous cost to the exchequer. But after assessing loneliness in several different groups in society, it is the personal stories the MPs say have struck them the hardest. “It is quite overwhelming,” says Kennedy. “What was shocking were the statistics of people with disabilities – 50% of disabled people feel lonely every day. And more shocking, the vast majority of able bodied people feel they don’t have anything in common with disabled people – don’t know how to speak to them.” Reeves was surprised by the scale of loneliness among refugees and asylum seekers. “I went to an event in Leeds organised by one of the refugee charities. One guy was put in a hostel for refugees and asylum seekers and he was a black African French speaker, and everyone else spoke different languages and he couldn’t understand a word.” She says that boosting the teaching of English is among their recommendations. Carers have also been highlighted, with Reeves recounting a woman’s poem about dancing in the living room with her mother, who suffered from dementia, but still feeling incredibly lonely. Even MPs approached the pair with their stories. Reeves mentions female politicians feeling isolated after becoming mothers, and a male colleague saying how isolated he felt after a divorce. Kennedy stresses the health concerns that the report highlighted. “Research that shows links to hypertension, falls, early onset of dementia, earlier admission to residential care, the leading indicator of early mortality. And in younger people that link between loneliness and a lack of social connectedness and mental health problems.” The pair were thrown together to focus on the issue after Cox’s death. The Labour MP, who was killed by a far-right extremist in 2016, had sought out Kennedy during her time in parliament to collaborate on the issue after hearing her raise the topic of loneliness in a parliamentary debate. “Jo was always really keen to do things cross-party because she wanted to show – as she said in her maiden speech – that we have more in common than that which divides us,” she says. “That wasn’t just a good line in a speech, that was how Jo lived her life, trying to bridge gaps and work across the political spectrum.” Reeves says Cox has managed, after her death, not just to raise the issue of loneliness that she was passionate about but to shift the outlook of MPs by encouraging them to team up across party lines. After their collaboration, it is apparent that she and Kennedy have become friends. Asked what she would say to those colleagues who have suggested they could never be mates with a Tory, Reeves bursts out laughing. “I think - give it a try. It may be better than you thought. I’ve learned a lot working with Seema. We don’t always vote in the same division lobby at the end of the evening. But that doesn’t mean we don’t have a huge amount in common.” She argues that working cross-party increases the chances of lasting change. Not that all Labour activists feel the same way about their political opponents. Last year, North West Durham MP, Laura Pidcock, said it would be disingenuous to suggest she could “happily sit there and have a light-hearted chat” with people she felt were ambivalent about the suffering of her constituents. Mike Amesbury, who represents Weaver Vale, argued that he was happy to work pragmatically with political opponents but he “just won’t be drinking buddies” with them. When Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, attended a Shed Seven gig alongside Tory MP, Thérèse Coffey, the leftwing blog Skwawkbox raised questions about who she had chosen to socialise with. Does this attitude annoy Kennedy? “I think it shows a slight naivety about the way that parliament works and maybe when people say that – in a year or so time– they may realise we are not as bad as they think,” she adds, with a giggle. On loneliness, Kennedy says she thinks people are prepared to “break the taboo”. “It is not just being dismissed,” she adds, saying the government has welcomed the work of the commission and there will be a full response in new year. “That is pretty encouraging.” For Cox, the key was to make sure that the report led to practical solutions. Kennedy thinks it is key to measure loneliness across the course of people’s of lives – and to understand the effectiveness of interventions. As for Reeves: “I’ve called it a social epidemic but the great thing is it is entirely solvable. We said at the beginning of the year to start a conversation if you are a lonely person or if you know someone in your street, your family, your friendship group who is lonely. “One of the things that Jo was great at was putting people first. If we all lived our life as Jo Cox lived hers, the world would be a less lonely place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/20/building-regulations-experts-who-werent-heard-before-the-grenfell-tower-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T19:27:18Z","webTitle":"Building regulations experts who weren’t heard before the Grenfell Tower fire | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/building-regulations-experts-who-werent-heard-before-the-grenfell-tower-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/building-regulations-experts-who-werent-heard-before-the-grenfell-tower-fire","fields":{"headline":"Building regulations experts who weren’t heard before the Grenfell Tower fire","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The report by Judith Hackitt (Building regulations open to abuse – Grenfell review, 19 December) highlights the “mindset of doing things as cheaply as possible and passing on responsibility for problems and shortcomings”. One longstanding and illogical result of this is the Thatcher government’s decision to introduce competition into building control. This was, and remains, the only regulatory function of local government to be subjected to competition. It was originally done as part of a deal by Michael Heseltine with Tory councillors who objected to his suggestions for the private sector to take control of planning decisions. Since then, despite frequent pleas from the Local Government Association (I was its spokesperson on building control) there has been no level playing field. The private sector recruits people who have been trained at public expense, and cherrypicks the most lucrative schemes, while leaving the rest to councils – who of course pick up the tab for enforcement. Few MPs even realise this has been going on, and many are appalled when they find out. A fair deal is well overdue. Peter Kent Crewe • Dame Judith Hackitt’s interim review of regulations lays out in detail what many of us learned from the fire at Lakanal House in 2009. Her report reinforces the need for the public inquiry to ask why the lessons from the Lakanal inquest didn’t lead to significant changes in the guidance prior to the Grenfell Tower fire. There was clearly time, and many of the experts giving evidence to Hackitt also spoke up prior to Grenfell. Did an ideological aversion to “red tape” get in the way of ministers listening to those voices, and will the inquiry dare to put the government in the dock for any failures?

Craig Mackey, deputy commissioner of the Met since 2011, receives a knighthood in the honours list, published on 29 December 2017. Before joining the Met, Mackey was chief constable of Cumbria Police, which he led during Derrick Bird’s shooting rampage in 2010, in which 12 people died. Alan Wood, who retired in 2015 as director of children’s services in the London borough of Hackney, also receives a knighthood. Wood joined Hackney in 2001 and the borough’s schools are now ranked among the best state schools in the UK. In recent years, Wood has led high-profile reviews into services in Doncaster, Birmingham and Tower Hamlets. In 2014/15, he was president of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services. There is recognition in the honours list for several of those involved in running Hull’s year as city of culture. Martin Green, chief executive and director of Hull City of Culture 2017, who was head of ceremonies at the 2012 London Olympics, receives a CBE, while Stephen Brady, leader of Hull city council, and Jon Pywell, city culture and place manager at the council, each receive an OBE. Fran Hegyi, executive director at Hull City of Culture 2017, and journalist and broadcaster Rosemary Millard, the organisation’s chair, each also receive an OBE. Ray James, the former national president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and longstanding executive director of health, housing and adult social care at the London borough of Enfield, receives a CBE for services to adult social care. In October, James was appointed as the first national learning disability director at NHS England. Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of adult social care at the Care Quality Commission, also receives a CBE, as does Amanda Skelton, chief executive of Redcar and Cleveland council. Annie Hampson, chief planning officer and development director for the City of London Corporation, receives an OBE, as do Judith Hay, assistant director for children and families for North Yorkshire county council, and Geraldine Doherty, former registrar of the Scottish Social Services Council and a member of the Northern Ireland historical institutional abuse inquiry. Elma Murray, chief executive of North Ayrshire council, who is also chair of the Young Scot charity, receives an OBE, as does Joyce White, chief executive of West Dunbartonshire council, and Martin Kelly, head of resources for children and young people’s services at North Yorkshire county council. Local politicians recognised in the honours list include Norma Redfearn, the elected mayor of North Tyneside, who receives a CBE. Other politicians to receive an OBE include councillor Ranjit Dheer, deputy leader of Ealing council; Graham Garvie, former Tweedale East councillor and convenor of Scottish Borders council, who stood down from local politics in May; Dennis Harvey, leader of Nuneaton and Bedworth borough council; Ralph Hoult, a former deputy mayor in Ramsgate; and John Hudson, a councillor in Oldham, who has held his seat in Saddleworth South ward since 1977. In Falmouth, Cornwall, Geoffrey Evans receives an MBE for his wide-ranging contribution to the community, including more than 40 years’ service as a local councillor. Police Nuzhat Saleh, assistant director in the directorate of legal services in the Met, receives a CBE. Joe Holness, a former inspector in Kent Police, who already holds a Queens Police Medal, now receives an OBE, for services to policing and the National Police Memorial Day (for which his wife, Sharon Holness, received an MBE in December 2016). Norman Pascal, former chief inspector at Avon and Somerset Constabulary, who retired earlier this year, receives an OBE, as do Inspector Bill Priestley, of Northern Ireland’s Criminal Justice Inspection, Gary Ridley, assistant chief officer of Durham Constabulary, and David Simm, acting detective inspector in the Met Police. Diane Winder, neighbourhood watch coordinator at West Yorkshire Police, also receives an OBE. Eighteen police officers, of all ranks, receive the Queen’s Police Medal for distinguished service. They include six constables, as well as the chief constables of three forces: Jerry Graham, chief constable of Cumbria police, Charlie Hall, chief constable of Hertfordshire police, and Andy Marsh, chief constable of Avon and Somerset. Fire Andrew Fry, former chief fire officer and chief executive of the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service, receives an OBE, as does Lynn Swift, director of people and organisational development at Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service. Five staff in England and Wales receive the Queen’s Fire Service Medal: James Courtney, chief fire officer, South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service; Karen Soady, watch manager, Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service; Paul Walker, chief fire officer, Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service; Philip Loach, chief fire officer, West Midlands Fire Service; and Russell Pearson, chief fire officer, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service. Ambulance Four ambulance service staff in England and Wales receive the Queen’s Ambulance Service Medal: Kuldip Singh Bhamrah, technician, East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust; Kath Charters, clinical data specialist, Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust; David John, advanced paramedic practitioner, Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust; and Diane Scott, deputy chief executive, West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust.

He was talking about [boxing] Conor McGregor. Was that real? Have you heard Floyd talk about many things that aren’t real? He usually tips his hand when he’s in the media and then that shit ends up happening. “We’re interested in doing something with Floyd. Everything is a realistic possibility. Mayweather versus McGregor fucking happened. Anything is possible.” Mayweather, a five-division boxing champion, emerged from a 23-month retirement in August for a one-off match against Ireland’s McGregor under boxing rules, defeating the UFC superstar by ninth-round TKO to improve his record to 50-0. The 40-year-old American has previously made brash statements about crossing over to the octagon, first during the build-up to the McGregor fight and most recently during a live-streamed Q&amp;A with fans last week. “If I want, I can go, I can come right back to the UFC, I can go fight in the octagon,” Mayweather said. “I can do a three- or four-fight deal in the octagon and make a billion dollars.” But what was initially dismissed as boilerplate Mayweather bluster was given weight on Tuesday when veteran UFC commentator Joe Rogan, who is close associates with White, confirmed the boxer and MMA’s leading promotion had opened discussions on a potential move. “Floyd talked about it. This is one thing I can tell you,” Rogan said in a podcast released on Tuesday. “Dana told me that Floyd wants to make a deal in the UFC. Like legitimately. I texted him, I go ‘Is Floyd really talking about fighting MMA?’ He goes ‘Yeah, he’s fucking crazy. I told him he’d get killed. But he’s still talking about doing it.” Mayweather’s publicist was unable to confirm the fighter had been in talks with the UFC when reached by the Guardian on Wednesday. Showtime, which broadcast the money-spinning Mayweather-McGregor circus in the United States, confirmed last week that it sold 4.3m pay-per-view buys in North America, the second-highest total ever after Mayweather’s long-anticipated welterweight showdown with Manny Pacquiao in 2015. The network also claimed the total global revenue from the event including ticket sales, sponsorship and international distribution exceeded $600m, among the largest windfalls for a single-day sporting event along with Mayweather-Pacquiao. US bookmaker Bovada was offering odds Wednesday on whether Mayweather would take part in a UFC fight in 2018. McGregor, the UFC lightweight champion, has not fought inside the octagon since a TKO win over Eddie Alvarez in November 2016, with a rumored return at UFC 219 on 30 December having been scuttled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/30/a-to-z-of-2018-in-tv-music-and-film","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"The A-Z of 2018: from A-listers on the small screen to Zayn Malik’s solo career","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/30/a-to-z-of-2018-in-tv-music-and-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/30/a-to-z-of-2018-in-tv-music-and-film","fields":{"headline":"The A-Z of 2018: from A-listers on the small screen to Zayn Malik’s solo career","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"* * * A-listers on TV It was around the start of the decade that TV began luring Hollywood A-Listers, but the multi-Emmy garnering Big Little Lies represents the dawn of a new era. For the first time, TV is where stars deliver their star-worthy performances, while movie roles mostly involve unflattering superhero spandex or kung fu fights with CGI aliens. If you’re Catherine Zeta Jones, say, it makes perfect sense to follow up a glamorous supporting role in Ryan Murphy’s Feud series with the starring role in TV movie Cocaine Godmother. Or maybe you’re the formerly rubber-faced funnyman Jim Carrey, hoping to emphasise your spiritual side? What better way than by re-teaming with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind director Michel Gondry for a new Showtime series, Kidding? Details of its release are yet to be confirmed, but George Clooney has signed up for a serialised adaptation of Catch-22, nearly two decades after leaving medical drama ER. Even Jennifer Aniston, once queen of the TV stars who’d made it, is returning to her roots for the first time since Friends, by joining forces with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV drama. The screen may be small, but the opportunities are big. EEJ * * * Brexit “We’ve got Brexit, so let’s exit,” declared John Lydon earlier this year, as part of a novel campaign to smear his own reputation using the medium of rhyme. But if the thought of the punk firebrand getting on board with Nigel Farage’s vision of Britain was depressing enough, there were more strident Brexiteers than Lydon lurking among pop culture’s old guard. Ringo Starr, who lives in the US, didn’t bother sending a postal vote but if he had: “I would have voted to get out … but don’t tell Bob Geldof!” Michael Caine explained his own leave vote by saying he’d “rather be a poor master than a rich servant. It wasn’t about the racism, immigrants or anything, it was about freedom.” Elsewhere, Roger Daltrey was positive that “when the dust settles I think that it’ll be seen that it’s the right thing for this country to have done.” But if recent years have taught us anything, it’s that next year will be the same, only much worse. And so 2018 could well be when we get our very own Moe-Tucker-joining-the-Tea-Party moment. So who will provide the shock? Could Laura Marling promote her next album by rabidly extolling the flavoursome joys of chlorinated chicken in every interview? Will Idris Elba take to deliberately smashing an energy-saving kettle against a wall in every scene he’s in? Will the next Ukip leader be a straight-up choice between a presenter for CBeebies and Claire Foy? Or maybe it will just be more old white guys with precious little skin in the game crawling out of the woodwork for another long slow grumble stretched tediously over 12 arduous months? Thinking about it, it’ll probably be more of that. TJ * * * Cardi B effect Until this year, Cardi B’s story had a typical rags-to-social-media-influencer feel. She dropped out of college and started stripping while posting inspirational Instagrams about sex, money and empowerment. Her online profile grew until she had half a million followers and could make money just from being an “influencer”. Soon enough reality TV came calling and she booked a place on season six of Love and Hip-Hop New York on VH1. Normally that’s where the story would have ended: a quick cash injection, a few club appearances, and then back to obscurity. But Cardi B refused to let it be that way. Reality TV has always been able to launch its most eccentric stars into semi-real celebrities. But whether it’s Rylan, Jedward, Amy Childs or Spencer Matthews, their fame has always been tainted by their reality past. That initial deal with the devil means they’re always available for a Littlewoods Christmas advert or an Ant and Dec charity telethon; every booker’s back-up, never quite tasting the actual enigma of true fame. Even a global star like Kim Kardashian is still ostensibly lame. Cardi B is different. She’s been on the cover of tastemaking music magazine the Fader and won the BET hip-hop award for best newcomer. Rarer still, she has coupled that credibility with unparalleled success: the first female rapper in 19 years to reach No 1 on the Billboard chart with her smash Bodak Yellow, which stayed at the top for three weeks after dethroning Taylor Swift’s Look What You Made Me Do. The impact of her rise may well change the way we think about new talent. Not only has she shown a cynical industry that female MCs can be just as successful as men, potentially opening doors for British artists such as Stefflon Don, she could finally erase the critical stigma around reality TV. While traditional labels become less able to support new artists, reality TV could become a more legitimate place to scout new talent. It could be starting already: the Hills producer is launching a new scripted-reality show Studio City, about the Nashville music scene. SW * * * Doctor Who Which Doctor are you … Doctor Who, Doctor Foster or Doctors? 1) What was your life like a decade ago? a) Pretty much the same as it is now. b) I was 23 years younger than I currently am. c) Much happier, but with well-telegraphed allusions to my current discontent. 2) You witness a minor traffic accident. Do you… a) Immediately hurry over and offer medical assistance. b) Explain what has happened very quickly, over a score loud enough to render you inaudible. c) Have angry loud sex with your ex-husband. 3) An old lady comes to visit you.

SH ANSWERS - Mostly As: You’re a doctor from Doctors! Mostly Bs: You’re The Doctor! Mostly Cs: You’re Doctor Foster! * * * Early, John Having spent years crafting his wince-inducingly well-observed YouTube sketches with his comedy partner Kate Berlant, the actor, standup comic, hip-hop dancer and peerless impressionist of Britney Spears finally has his own show. Hulu has ordered a pilot by the duo called This Is Heaven, directed by New Girl’s Lorene Scafaria and described as “a take on a classic half-hour comedy about two best friends Roger and Eva”. If you can’t wait until that emerges then catch him on kooky crime thriller Search Party, as flamboyant megalomaniac Elliott Goss, Netflix’s Wet Hot American Summer as bratty, deluded thespian Logan, or miniseries 555, Kate and John’s neon-lit comedy dreamscape on Vimeo. HG * * * First Man Given the trajectory of Damian Chazelle’s directorial career so far – Whiplash then La La Land – it’s no surprise he is shooting for the moon next. With Hollywood’s hunger for content, it is surprising the story of Neil Armstrong and the moon landings hasn’t been told before (apart from Kubrick faking them in the first place, that is). Considering Armstrong’s notorious publicity shyness and refusal to cash in on his achievement, James Hansen’s authorised Armstrong biography – also titled First Man – became the best indication of what the man was actually like. Clint Eastwood bought the rights to it in 2003 but couldn’t get it off the ground. (Armstrong, who died in 2012, apparently didn’t like the violence in Eastwood’s movies.) Now it has passed on to Chazelle, whose choice of lead actor for the role will surprise no one: Ryan Gosling. Judging by the first on-set image – of Gosling in a plaid shirt lassoing a rocking horse – it’s not just going to be another Gravity-like space procedural. Other stars on board include Claire Foy as Armstrong’s wife and Corey Stoll as Buzz Aldrin. SR * * * Gugu Mbatha-Raw Oxford-born actor Gugu Mbatha-Raw has been floating elegantly through the backwaters of culture for some time now. She played companion Martha Jones’s little sister Tish in David Tennant-era Doctor Who, a mixed-race 18th-century aristocrat in Amma Asante’s ground-breaking 2013 film Belle, and it was her vivacious energy that helped propel the Black Mirror episode San Junipero to its Emmy awards glory. Now it’s time the world went gaga for Gugu. In February, she’ll star in God Particle, the highly anticipated, mystery-shrouded third feature film to be set in JJ Abrams’s Cloverfield universe. Later in the year, she’ll share a screen with Game of Thrones hottie Michiel Huisman in romantic drama Irreplaceable You. Then, perhaps most intriguingly, she is signed up for the lead role in the Gina Prince-Bythewood-directed adaptation of An Untamed State, the debut novel from lauded feminist academic Roxane Gay. Commercially adept, critically approved and culturally relevant: our Gugu’s got all the bases covered. EEJ * * * Horoscopes By Psychic Stu, AKA Stuart Heritage Aries A natural leader like you should be an influencer. You should be telling me what to enjoy next year. What’s that? I should look out for Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again? Hey, you’re just Meryl Streep with a fake moustache. Get out of here! Taurus Your work ethic is exceptional, and you will enjoy all culture in 2018. Except for Eggplant Emoji, because that’s a film about a boy who cuts his penis off, and you’re only human. Gemini As the most socially minded sign of the zodiac, it doesn’t matter what music you like, you’re just going to spend your entire time at quiet, intimate gigs using your iPhone, aren’t you? I bet you’ll even keep the keytones on when you message, won’t you? Idiot. Cancer You enjoy security and adventure in equal measure, which is why you’ll be first in the queue to watch Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, because what an almighty bummer that looks like. Leo The undisputed king of the zodiac, you will only accept the very best. This is why – as with all other years – your 2018 will be marked by bitter disappointment. You were looking forward to that Arctic Monkeys album, weren’t you? Sorry, pal. Virgo Oh Virgo, nobody cares about you. Literally nobody. Go and watch Girlboss repeats on Netflix. Seriously, that’s all you deserve. Libra The easiest to please sign of the Zodiac, you will literally lap up any old crap. Unfortunately, Hollywood knows this, which is why the makers of Gnomeo &amp; Juliet came up with Sherlock Gnomes specifically for you. Enjoy it, numbnuts. Scorpio Your born intensity will only become stronger in 2018, thanks to horror films such as Cadaver, Truth or Dare and The Nun. It’s important to mention, however, that intensity can sometimes mean you walk out of films that look and sound exceptionally stupid. Sagittarius Nothing can dim your sunny outlook on life; not climate change, Brexit or the spectre of nuclear death. However, there’s another season of Arrested Development coming out in 2018, so kiss goodbye to your run of optimism. Capricorn As an inherently ambitious person, your biggest goal for 2018 will be to complete and enjoy both the Maze Runner and 50 Shades of Grey trilogies. The enjoyment half is automatically doomed to failure, but God loves a trier. Aquarius Aquarians don’t care what people think about them. This is why, if you’re an Aquarian, you’re most excited about that terrible-looking James Corden Peter Rabbit film. You are the worst. Pisces As the most sensitive sign of the zodiac, you’re going to get steamrollered by 2018. Just bludgeoned to pulp. Don’t bother getting excited about anything, because you’re going to be too busy cowering under a duvet to see it, anyway. * * * I don’t wanna talk about it It has been an odd time for pop star interviews. Rather than face a grilling from an actual human, Frank Ocean (pictured, above) opted this year to pen an “essay” for style mag i-D. Taylor Swift contributed what could generously be described as a “poem” to Vogue in return for not having to answer any hard questions (sample: “The only thing cut and dry/ In this hedge-maze life/ Is the fact that their words will cut but your tears will dry”). Beyoncé went one better and did nothing. All managed to spin this not as a sign that they were shitting their pants at one of their dumb answers going viral, but a signifier that they have reached a higher plane of fame and are above such behaviour. Social media has made it easier for artists to get their ideas across directly to their fans. But the press are to blame for indulging this nonsense, too. It makes you really look forward to 2018 and a world where pop stars are no longer answerable to anyone but their own egos. Still, we might at least get an exclusive sudoku from Jessie J. TJ * * * Justin Timberlake To some, Justin Timberlake is one of the last remaining pop megastars: he can sing, dance and wear a hat without looking like a wally. To others, he’s breezed through a career based on appropriating black culture, got away with throwing Janet Jackson under a bus (not literally) at the Super Bowl in 2004, and yes he can wear a hat but that’s because he’s got shit hair. To be fair, a mix of all the above is true, but only a fool could deny the imperial phase in the mid to late 00s that saw him knock out Cry Me a River, Rock Your Body and SexyBack like he was solely responsible for all the high points at any given wedding disco. After some ill-advised film work, an obsession with golf and a brief dalliance with interior design, Timberlake then tried to undo some of that goodwill in 2013 with the apparently never-ending The 20/20 Experience. In fact, the only thing more boring than The 20/20 Experience (Mirrors aside) was The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2, which followed six months later. While 2016’s single Can’t Stop the Feeling was an Oscar-nominated success, it was essentially an even more grating Happy. So what can we expect from Timberlake in 2018? Film-wise, word is that he’s “embarrassingly out of his depth” in Woody Allen’s Wonder Wheel, but seems to be on surer ground vis-a-vis his pop career. He’s doing the Super Bowl half-time show again in February (featuring, you would hope, a cameo from Jackson), so it would make sense for a new single at the very least to appear around that time. There are vague rumours that the album is called Man of the Woods, and we know – because he’s Instagrammed some intense pictures of him looking at some buttons – that he’s been working with past collaborators Pharrell, Timbaland and Max Martin; so all the clues are pointing towards a Timberlake-heavy 12 months, whether you like it or not. MC * * * Kenya Barris Kenya Barris, the mastermind behind Blackish and Girls Trip, is writing the script for a Coming to America follow up. Yes, we’re talking about a sequel here. The very word may fill you with dread, and rightly so. Zoolander 2 was a lacklustre imitation of its predecessor, while the less said about Alien: Covenant, the better. But, enough with the negativity: there’s a real chance the next Coming to America instalment might not belong in the bin. The beloved 1988 comedy about an African prince (Eddie Murphy) who moves to America to circumvent an arranged marriage and find love by going undercover as a poor New Yorker, was an instant classic in a golden period of African American cinema. Three decades later, the next film seems to be in good hands. Original cast member Eddie Murphy is attached (although not necessarily starring), with Jonathan Levine directing. With Barris’s game changing comedy having captured the screen zeitgeist this year, if anyone can handle the sequel to a cult 80s classic it might just be him. SM * * * Luca Guadagnino If you want to do a good remake, the golden rule is: pick a movie that wasn’t so great first time around. Clearly Luca Guadagnino didn’t get that memo, but what is he doing remaking Suspiria at all? Dario Argento’s original 1977 movie is the definitive giallo, an operatic, colour-saturated fairytale of gore and witchcraft set in a secluded academy for vulnerable ballerinas. Guadagnino, on the other hand, just directed the gorgeous gay romance Call Me By Your Name, although his previous film, A Bigger Splash, did have a few notes of horror (and not just Ralph Fiennes’s dancing). Guadagnino insists he is not simply remaking Suspiria, and would never want to “erase” the original. His is a more personal take, he says, “inspired by the same story, but it goes in different directions”. He’s lined up an enticing cast, including Dakota Johnson, Chloë Grace Moretz, Mia Goth and Tilda Swinton. And Thom Yorke will hande the score, itself a daunting challenge: the original by Italian prog rockers Goblin is a classic in its own right. SR * * * Minogue, Kylie As 2017 hangs up its hotpants, we’re further from Spinning Around than that song was from I Should Be So Lucky, so it is safe to say Kylie’s turn-of-the-millennium comeback has been something of a success. Kylie will be aiming for her 16th Top 10 album in 2018, with songs that showcase a new focus on lyrical storytelling via themes of “freedom, self-discovery, life and love”. “The album,” Kylie tells the Guide in a short but perfectly formed email that represents the absolute textual embodiment of that’ll-do-nicely, “is a collision of some elements of country and dance, made at the altar of Dolly Parton standing on a dancefloor.” It will be Kylie’s first album for new label BMG, where she has been reunited with the A&amp;R bigwig who oversaw her 21st-century relaunch, with collaborators including DJ Fresh and long-term associates Biff Stannard and Karen Poole. Recorded throughout 2017, it shifted gear following a trip to Nashville, where the album “found its heart”. “There’s a little bit of heartbreak, I would say,” Kylie noted in October. “But we bounce back. Most of it is super-positive and inspiring, as a note to self as much as anything else. I’m feeling great right now.” PR Yee-haw! Other dance-country hybrids: • Rednex Cotton Eye Joe • Shania Twain Man, I Feel Like a Woman • Avicii Wake Me Up • Steps 5, 6, 7, 8 • Madonna Don’t Tell Me * * * Nico, 1988 The title already makes it clear, this is not the Nico of Andy Warhol’s Factory, the Velvet Underground, Jim Morrison and all that. But this should still be one of the most intriguing biopics in the 2018 pile, partly thanks to its focus on the last years of Nico’s dramatic life, and partly thanks to the casting of magnificent Danish actor Trine Dyrholm. She doesn’t play “Nico”, she plays Christa (her real name): the rude, ravaged, resigned, black-haired fortysomething junkie who’s bored with being asked about the good old days and only puts on her stage persona when the occasion demands. “I wasn’t happy when I was beautiful,” she says at one point. She’s not that happy now, either, trudging aimlessly through her European tour with a substandard band. Sadly, there are no original Nico tunes here, though Dyrholm nails the German singer’s doleful, only-just-in-tune intonation, and Italian director Susanna Nicchiarelli uses Jonas Mekas’s original Factory movies for flashbacks. A late attempt to detox and reconnect with her teenage son offers the prospect of a vaguely happy coda, although – spoiler alert – 1988 was the year Nico died. SR * * * OscarsSoGay Hollywood has been in a staring competition with its navel for so long now, you would imagine there was nothing left to re-examine after #OscarSoWhite and the post-Weinstein reckoning. But still there are blind spots. Openly LGBTQ performers are still experiencing discrimination off-screen and seeing their parts taken by straight actors on-screen, and it’s long been the rule that gay-themed movies will only win awards if they dilute the “gayness” down to trace levels, hence Crash beating Brokeback Mountain a few years back. Last year’s Moonlight was celebrated as a triumph for the #OscarSoWhite campaign, but it was also the first gay-themed film to win best picture. Did it break down any barriers for gay movies? With a straight director and cast, perhaps it never could, but this is a good year to find out. Although, again, many of the prime awards contenders are actually straight: the leads in Call Me By Your Name, and Emma Stone as Billie Jean King in Battle of the Sexes. On the other hand, Chilean drama A Fantastic Woman’s Daniela Varga could become the first trans person to receive a nomination. SR * * * Poppins, Mary If you have been waiting for a Mary Poppins film sequel, then you’ve been waiting a long time – 53 years, to be exact. The early signs suggest it’s been worth it. Although it will be Christmas 2018 before we can be sure that Mary Poppins Returns truly is as supercalifragilisticexpialidocious as it would appear. Short of conjuring up Julie Andrews in her prime, Emily Blunt seems the perfect choice for the lead. She comes across as exactly the sort of woman who’d keep all manner of useful things in her handbag and cheerily admonish small children. Screenwriter David Magee has also wisely opted to move the story on from Edwardian London to the mid-1930s, where the Banks children, Jane (Emily Mortimer) and Michael (Ben Whishaw) are now all grown up, but still in need of some guidance from their old nanny. Word also has it that 92-year-old Dick Van Dyke has been coaxed out of retirement for a cameo. Will he be reprising that iconically awful cockney accent? We can only hope. EEJ Dick Van Dyke-itis - other dodgy accents: • Anne Hathaway in One Day • Joss Stone singing Sensimilla • Tom Hardy in everything * * * Queen What a story Freddie Mercury’s life would make, with all the highs, lows, hits, outfits and intersex dwarves with platters of cocaine strapped to their heads. But 2018’s forthcoming biopic seems to have been cursed. Sacha Baron Cohen appeared to be the perfect choice for the lead, but by 2013 he wanted to break free. Reportedly, he felt the film should focus on the nitty-gritty of Mercury’s sexual exploits while the surviving band members preferred to focus on Queen “going from strength to strength” after Mercury’s death. Baron Cohen’s replacement, Rami “Mr Robot” Malek, very much looks the part, though whether this will be Mercury’s real life or just fantasy remains to be seen. In early December, the curse struck again: director Bryan Singer, lately in the frame owing to allegations of sexual misconduct, was fired in the wake of reports of “tensions on the set”. British director Dexter Fletcher has been drafted in, with two weeks’ shooting to go. Will it be a case of The Show Must Go On, or Another One Bites the Dust? SR * * * Rina Sawayama Japan-born, London-based independent superstar-in-waiting Rina Sawayama’s brand of springy, in-your-face pop music – showcased on her recent mini-album, Rina – is inspired by the classics. We’re talking Oops!... I Did It Again-era Britney on Take Me As I Am; early 90s Teddy Riley on Ordinary Superstar, and the digitised drama of a lost Kevin “She’kspere” Briggs-produced Destiny’s Child classic on Cyber Stockholm Syndrome. It’s the latter that really solidifies Cambridge graduate, part-time model and full-time video game obsessive Sawayama’s MO of marrying millennial-focused lyrics – in that song’s case a generation’s mobile phone-related anxiety – to hugely melodic (she’s mad for seminal hitmaker Max Martin), emotionally engaging pop with a capital P. MC * * * Sitcoms A mere 21 years after its “final” season, Roseanne Barr’s game-changing sitcom has some work to do as it returns. The 1997 swansong’s infuriating twist ending – the whole show had been a novel written by Barr’s screen alter ego, Roseanne Conner – left fans aghast at a narrative in disarray. The casting for 2018 implies we will need to pretend season nine never happened: John Goodman is in it, so husband Dan is presumably not in fact dead, while news that Darlene and David’s children will appear indicates that the reshuffling of the show’s relationships – that finale suddenly gave Roseanne’s daughters each other’s partners – will be reversed. The necessary contractual wrangling has been done to keep Johnny Galecki, now a superstar on a rival network in The Big Bang Theory, as David – and both Lecy Goranson and Sarah Chalke, who used to chaotically share the role of Becky, are present. Chalke, however, will play a new character. Still with us? Logistics aside, Roseanne’s political relevance is why we’ll scrutinise the eight new episodes. The show was valuable for its depiction of a blue-collar couple for whom economic strife compounded the hardships of marriage and parenting: just the sort of people whose disenfranchisement helped Trump to power, and who still demand more attention from US storytellers. The rub is that Barr has spoken out in support of Trump, with her recent tweets sliding into a Breitbart/InfoWars sinkhole. She says the new show won’t be about the Potus, but political neutrality looks beyond her, and a pro-Trump sitcom would be no laughing matter. Britain’s big comedy comeback also nods towards political meltdown: Alan Partridge returns to the BBC, reputedly as “the voice of Brexit”. Having presciently given us the perfect Brexit metaphor 15 years ago, when Alan tried to present an awards ceremony despite having speared his foot on a spike, Steve Coogan should be able to place his creation back into the national conversation with ease. JS Roseanne’s best zingers 1 Darlene: “You guys think we don’t understand your corny sex jokes.” Roseanne: “You are our corny sex jokes.” 2 Becky: “Our school is having a food drive for poor people.” Roseanne: “Get them to drive some of that food over here.” 3 DJ: “Darlene called me a ‘prevert’.” Roseanne: “No you’re not a ‘prevert’ honey. You’re a pervert.” * * * Tina: The Musical Until recently, the idea of 2018 being the year of Tina Turner looked about as likely as an X Factor contestant managing not to sing Proud Mary in the auditions round. The 78-year-old pop superstar has been, ahem, a private dancer since she retired with one last round of 50th-anniversary arena shows in 2009 and has lived quietly in Switzerland since the early 90s. But theatre great Phyllida Lloyd, who, with Mamma Mia!, gave Abba a permanent home in the West End and got Meryl Streep into denim dungarees, is about to bring the story of Turner’s extraordinary life – already told on screen in the harrowing biopic What’s Love Got to Do With It in 1993 – to the stage with the much-hyped “bio-musical” Tina. “This took me out of retirement,” Turner told the crowd at its launch, where she duetted with Broadway actor Adrienne Warren, who will play her in the show. It comes to London’s Aldwych Theatre, WC2, in March; expect a roaring trade in blond rock mullet wigs outside. RN * * * Utopia Bad news. Psychic Craig Hamilton-Parker – the guy who predicted Brexit and President Trump – has seen the future and to be honest, it’s not looking great. “2018 will be a year of political turmoil and environmental crisis caused by dramatic and unprecedented weather,” he wrote in a blog post. What next year lacks in global tranquility, it makes up for in cultural majesty, however. There’s Disney’s luminous adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time, the story of a girl’s fantastic quest across the universe to save her father, which features celebrity comfort blanket Oprah. Or Pixar’s musical adventure Coco, set in the Land of the Dead but warm as the cosier corners of Hell, while queen of celestial escapism Björk takes her album Utopia on tour, one date of which is at Cornwall’s appropriately leafy Eden Project. “It’s really important now to be intentional,” she told the Observer earlier this year. “If you feel this world is not heading the right way, you have to be DIY and make a little fortress, over here to the left.” Let’s hope whoever’s last into the giant greenhouse locks the door and swallows the key. HG * * * Victoria Beckham Not a year goes by without rumours emerging of a Spice Girls reunion celebrating some sort of anniversary. Last year, frustrated with Victoria and Mel C dragging their heels over a potentially lucrative trip down Girl Power lane (not a real place, sadly), Geri Horner, née Halliwell, announced “supergroup” GEM, as in Geri, Emma Bunton and Mel B, via a video seemingly knocked up in five minutes on iMovie (they’ve since disbanded). Perhaps Easy V, AKA Victoria Beckham, saw it because following more rumours of a proper reunion this year – apparently now including Mel “Melanie” C – she’s basically put a stop to the whole thing. “It is not happening,” the hugely successful fashion designer told former Big Brother contestant Alison Hammond on This Morning. “At some point, you’ve gotta know when it’s time to say: ‘That was great.’ Girl power will always be out there and is something that we all still believe. What I do now is still all about girl power, but it’s empowering women through power. I don’t think I’ll be slipping into a PVC catsuit any time soon.” So there you have it. Sort of. “I still love the girls,” Geri said in a separate interview, “and there are other bits and bobs in the pipeline.” Fingers crossed, it’s not a GEM-related party hat. MC * * * Widows It’ll be coming up to five years since 12 Years a Slave – what has taken director Steve McQueen so long? You can understand a decompression period, but his prolonged absence has become a matter of concern. But, after a few false starts (a scrapped HBO project here, a proposed BBC series there), McQueen is finally (hopefully) back in November, with a thriller based on Lynda La Plante’s 1980s TV series Widows. In the original, three women take matters into their own hands after their criminal husbands are killed in a failed bank heist. But of course, it gets messy. Working with writer Gillian “Gone Girl” Flynn, McQueen transposes the action from London to Chicago “in a time of turmoil”, presumably the present day. The cast includes Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Cynthia Erivo, Elizabeth Debicki and Carrie Coon. Plus a few token males such as Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell and Daniel Kaluuya. Given McQueen’s political convictions, Widows is unlikely to be a straightforward thriller, but while his earlier films were more critical than commercial successes, this one could be a real banker. SR * * * X-Files Gillian Anderson has hinted that this year’s run of The X-Files will be her last. That might be wise, following the travails of seasons eight and nine, which soldiered on with Anderson’s acting soulmate David Duchovny mostly absent, and 2016’s season 10, a box-ticking clutch of uneven episodes that fumbled their big comeback after 14 years away. As the alien-arrival cliffhanger from last time is resolved, and Mulder and Scully battle to save humanity from a nasty virus, all the pieces are on the board: crucial old characters and recently added ones are present. So are the writers from the glory years, all of whom are men, which has led to showrunner Chris Carter getting flak for his creative team’s gender bias. You’d think a show so strongly associated with the 90s would avoid giving us more reasons to think of it as dated. Still, nothing in the past two decades has replaced The X-Files’ shamelessly outre sci-fi hooey; if it finds a reason to exist in 2018, its audience is still out there. JS * * * Yeah Yeah Yeahs One of the best books of 2017 was Lizzy Goodman’s Meet Me in the Bathroom, which told the story of the early 00s indie rock explosion that centred around New York City. While much of the book focuses on the Strokes, Interpol and LCD Soundsystem, it found a true hero in Karen O from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who seemed to embody all of the highs, lows and madness of the time. Of course, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs never really went away, steadily releasing albums for the last 14 years, but in many ways it felt like the right time for a triumphant victory lap and a reminder of what they had set in motion (not least providing Beyoncé with a sample for Lemonade’s Hold Up). So they reissued their debut album Fever to Tell, celebrated that with a handful of live shows (their first in four years), and released a documentary of their 2003 tour called There Is No Modern Romance. Blunt fringes at the ready: more live dates are promised next year. RN * * * Zayn Officially, 2017 should have been Zayn’s year. Having got his difficult post-One Direction debut out of the way – 2016’s sex-obsessed Mind of Mine, a US and UK chart-topper – and fully established himself as a sleepy-eyed style magazine cover mainstay, there were early murmurings he was already working on its sequel. Instead he followed up I Don’t Wanna Live Forever, his duet with Taylor Swift, with March’s Still Got Time, a PartyNextDoor collaboration that was relegated to a “buzz track” after it peaked at No 24. September saw him work with Sia on the billowy Dusk Till Dawn, which spent 11 weeks in the UK Top 10 but, once again, didn’t usher in an album. There is one, though: that same month he told Fader it was “pretty much there”, while in November, Billboard managed to hear bits of songs produced by the likes of Timbaland and Malay, suggesting it would be out “in the first quarter of 2018”. The Fader interview also promised live solo shows, an aspect of the pop star contract Zayn is yet to fulfil due to anxiety issues and the more prosaic “not having enough songs”. Let’s state it now, so it’s written: 2018 will be Zayn’s year. MC * * * More predictions Having predicted what 2018 will bring, here are three things that definitely will happen in 2019 ... Florence Welch releases an Elizabethan-themed cookbook, co-authored with Orlando Weeks. Anthea Turner and Lowri Turner join forces for a 10-part investigation into alcopops called Turners &amp; Hooch.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: £90 The last dish to land on my table in 2017 is a ray of sunshine as drawn for a children’s book: a triangle of wobbling lemon tart the colour of daffodils or beaches or buttercups. The filling has been infused with basil, and punched up with lime, then sprinkled with sugar and given a glancing burst from a blowtorch. The pastry is crisp top and bottom. Alongside, is a scoop of ricotta and sour cherry ice cream. It is a bunch of simple things done exceedingly well, which describes the whole of my lunch at Treves and Hyde in the City. It is a fitting end to a year which boasted more reasons to be cheerful at the table than not. Fewer than a fifth of my reviews in 2017 were unrelentingly negative, though it is a mark of just how horrible you all are that one of those managed to get almost as many page views – more than 2m – as half the others put together. I didn’t go to Le Cinq in Paris to be controversial. I went for dinner, and to spend a slab of my own money and to write a column about the stupid glories that wealth can buy. It didn’t work out like that. In what must have been a slow news week, the somewhat negative review – I think of it as therapy – made global headlines. The end result: the entire French nation thinks I am a head-banging, Brexit-loving, rich-bashing commie with the palate of a washing machine. The rest of the planet, meanwhile, seemed rather encouraged by it all. The other negatives are not worth dwelling on: a Test Kitchen that made me feel too much like a lab rat, a steak house from Jamie Oliver that left me moaning about the sommelier, and a Scottish country house hotel whose idea of hospitality extended to slagging me off in the comment section under the review. I didn’t enjoy their company when I was there, let alone two weeks later. Instead, in the words of the great Johnny Mercer, let’s accentuate the positive. Skosh in York proved that first-rate food does not require the selling of a kidney or an atmosphere akin to the cremation of a disliked aunt. Chef Neil Bentinck’s egg, full of frothy whites and shards of toasted Dale End cheddar with, at the bottom, a mushroom duxelles cooked down in sherry, remains a dish of the year. The contents of that egg changes but it still costs just £3.30. At the other end of the price continuum, chef Claude Bosi took over Bibendum and made it all shiny and new. His explosive cuttlefish and tripe stew made me moist and hormonal. Meanwhile, the Game Bird opened at the Stafford Hotel and felt like it had been there for ever. There were repeated outbreaks of splendid suet puddings – well, two – both at the Game Bird and at the Cartford Inn, Lancashire. I celebrated by coining the phrase Gravy Moderne to describe robust British cooking built on French classical technique. The Cartford Inn’s chef, Chris Bury, is threatening to get a Gravy Moderne tattoo. Courtesy of both Wilson’s and Box-E – and others reviewed by my former Guardian colleague Marina O’Loughlin – Bristol continued to prove that it is the most interesting place for small independent bistros outside London. I bored almost everybody, including myself, by whingeing about lists exclusively made up of so-called natural wines, at Westerns Laundry, the Other Naughty Piglet and Louie Louie. All three served terrific food at a good price, and then sabotaged the bill via wine pricing. Still, Louie Louie’s braised ox cheek on hummus and the Other Naughty Piglet’s XO linguine were other dishes of the year. Small plates proliferated, they would come out in the order that suited the kitchen – honourable mention for Skosh, which didn’t do this – and waiters continued taking my order without a notebook. Weirdly, I became almost inured to all of this. Indian street food paired with craft beers made a successful bid for non-kerbside greatness at the Cat’s Pyjamas in Leeds and, even more impressively, at the cavernous Bundobust in Manchester. A howl of outrage at a planning application that would have wiped the tiny Da Maria trattoria in Notting Hill off the map, resulted in the council turning it down. Treves and Hyde, with which I am finishing this year, occupies a new building that probably breezed through the planning process. It’s a hard-edged lump of modern London. Still, if you go at lunch, you might get a good view of the demolition across the road. Pay attention instead to chef George Tannock’s deceptively simple food: to warm, airy cheese puffs, covered with grated chestnut as if it were a savoury Mont Blanc. They melt away to nothing on the tongue. Pay attention to a piece of smoked and glazed pork belly with subtle striations of fat, and soft, pliable meat that tastes like the very best bacon; and to slices of seared salmon with sesame, avocado purée and a balanced hit of acidity. His food is all about the killer detail. Duck confit is soft and crisp-skinned. A duvet of mash is pure comfort. And here, across the top, are fried breadcrumbs to give crunch. Slices of bavette, that grown-up steak for people with all their own teeth, come with suety bacon “pudding” and curls of pumpkin purée. But it’s made by their own sweet-sour barbecue sauce. We coo over buttered carrots with goat’s curd; over a Little Gem salad with spirals of fennel. A chocolate delice, with segments of orange and an impeccable pistachio ice cream, plays support to that glorious lemon tart. Pricing is keen for cooking of this quality. Apparently it’s the start of a group across the country which makes a slightly depressing kind of sense. Nothing depressing about this kind of food being mirrored elsewhere. It’s just that the economics of 2017 make the stand-alone restaurant less viable than ever before. To survive you apparently have to go big. You have to build in economies of scale. And 2018? Where to start? The deformed, twisted aggression of Brexit has put ingredient costs up by 20% and discouraged vital European staff from staying, let alone coming. Property prices are dysfunctional, and business rates have been violently re-assessed. And, going from the comment section on my reviews, too many people in this country still resent paying a fair whack because they think they could make it at home for a fiver. I’ll keep my fingers crossed that, despite all this, Britain’s brilliant restaurants manage to endure in 2018. Because, if you can afford it, a good meal cooked by someone else just makes life better. Happy New Year. Jay’s news bites The restaurant from 2017 to which I’m giving an extra fist bump is Noble in Holywood, just outside Belfast. None of the menu writing will make you swoon. It’s just a whole bunch of nice things done exceptionally well, be it grilled langoustine, a classic risotto, or a pear and frangipane tart. Both chef Pearson Morris and general manager Saul McConnell run a brilliant operation (nobleholywood.com). Figures for the last full month of 2017 show that eating (and drinking) out really has become an ingrained habit. Visa UK’s most recent Consumer Spending Index showed that household expenditure was down in November by 0.9%. But spending in restaurants, hotels and bars was up 4.2%. You’ve had all your presents, but what can you look forward to food-book wise in 2018? There are new recipes from Michel Roux Jr and a memoir from Prue Leith, but most thrilling of all is a reissue (with new commentary) of Graham Kerr’s Galloping Gourmet Cookbook.

After a remarkable five years during which our fizz consumption has grown by 76%, that’s no longer the case; a lot of people drink it all year round now. Still, tonight remains a – if not the – big night for bubbles, and with the British drinking a third of all the prosecco produced in the past year, the frothy Italian is likely to be top of many shopping lists today. Of the supermarket bottles, my house standby has long been the soft freshness of Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Prosecco Congeliano DOCG 2016 (£10). But it has competition this year from the fuller-flavoured appley brightness of Aldi’s newcomer. Tesco finest* Grand Cru Vintage Champagne, France 2009 (£25) Prosecco’s runaway success has led retailers to experiment with other Italian fizz, with the crisper, more incisive style of Lombardy’s Francicorta among the styles to benefit. Closer to champagne than prosecco in production methods, grape varieties, style and price, the best are really polished, stylish wines. Tesco’s bright and citrussy own-label version, finest* Franciacorta Brut DOCG NV (£15), is very good for the money; Corteaura Pas Dosé Franciacorta Brut DOCG NV (£22.95, Lea &amp; Sandeman) is dry, racy with interwoven flavours of fresh fruit and buttered toast. Is it as good as champagne? I think we can settle on different. But if you must have something from the French region this evening, you could do much worse than Tesco’s crystalline all-chardonnay creation. Leckford Estate Brut, Hampshire, England NV (£19.99, Waitrose) English sparkling wine continues to impress, with the list of quality producers growing by the year. Recent favourites include the delightful red apples and cherries of Digby Leander Pink, East Sussex NV (from £28, Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose, Harvey Nichols); the tongue-tingling mix of nerviness and creaminess of Gusbourne Estate Berry Bros &amp; Rudd English Sparkling Wine Brut 2013 (£25.95); and the toasty, zingy champagne-alike made by Waitrose on the firm’s own farm, Leckford Estate, in Hampshire. Given the latter is currently 20% down on its usual price of £24.99, you could put the nominal saved fiver towards another successful English version of a French speciality, White Heron British Cassis (£19, Waitrose), for pouring over vanilla ice cream or mixing with the Leckford for an all-British kir royale.

Phyllis Omido has been threatened by thugs, arrested by police and forced into hiding for organising opposition to a lead-smelting factory in Mombasa, which allegedly poisoned residents in the neighbouring shantytown of Owino Uhuru. But the NGO she founded, the Centre for Justice, Governance, and Environmental Action, has already forced the closure of the plant and is now pushing the courts to secure compensation for the victims and a clean-up of the community. They have gathered thousands of local residents in a class action against the government and two companies – Metal Refinery EPZ Ltd and Penguin Paper and Book Company (no connection with the global publishing company) for 1.6bn Kenyan shillings (£11.5m) compensation and a clean-up of contaminated land. Two years after the suit was launched, the plaintiffs will be called as witness for the first time on 19 March in the environment and land court. “This is the biggest step since we started,” Omido told the Guardian. “The victims will finally get to tell their story in court. That’s crucial in making people realise what happened. We hope our case will be something that every environmental defender in the world can refer to when they raise issues of accountability.” Progress has been perilous. Following assaults and intimidation, the United Nations has called on the Kenyan government to protect Omido and her fellow activists. A special rapporteur, John Knox, said in a statement last year that two homes had been burned, death sentences had been issued and a 12-year-old son of one activist was kidnapped for three days. The plant has been closed. Former director Hezron Awiti Bollo declined to respond to the allegations. “I cannot comment. This is a matter that is in the courts,” he told the Guardian by phone. Sometimes referred to as the “east African Erin Brockovich”, Omido was a co-winner of the Goldman environmental prize in 2015 along with Berta Cáceres, the Honduran activist who was murdered a year later. Omido also lives under constant threat. She has had to go into hiding several times and carries a panic button that can alert international supporters and trace her whereabouts if she is abducted. “I face threats to my life because of this case,” she told the Guardian. Before its closure, the EPZ refinery recycled car batteries, using chemicals to extract the lead. Former workers said they were given only a flimsy face mask as protection. Neighbours said noxious smoke billowed out from the factory chimney, blackening and corroding the tin roofs of the shanty town; toxic waste leaked into a stream that ran through the village. “People used it for cooking and washing,” said the local pastor, Anastasia Nambo. “We sometimes drank it even though it smelt rotten because we don’t have any alternative. We had no idea it was dangerous. “Nobody told us for several years. We want compensation for those we know are affected and tests for those who do not yet know their status.” Omido – who worked in the company office – was the first to make a connection between the factory and health problems. She started to grow concerned in 2010 when her baby son fell ill. Blood tests showed the amount of lead in his blood was 35 times above the the World Health Organisation’s level of concern, she said. Assuming this had been passed on when she nursed him, she then arranged for three more children to be tested, all of whom proved to have been contaminated. Locals also complained of unusually high numbers of miscarriages and respiratory disease. After the factory refused to relocate and the environment ministry ignored her warnings, Omido organised demonstrations by thousands of residents, who blocked the main road between Mombasa and Nairobi with burning tyres. Many were arrested by police or beaten by factory security guards. Since then the group’s tactics have grown increasingly sophisticated as they built networks of support across the continent and the globe. The East Africa Society provided pro bono legal advice. Foreign NGOs including Frontline Defenders and Human Rights Watch provided advice and media support. When the Kenyan authorities refused to close the plant, Omido went over their heads by appealing to the East Africa Community. This regional body banned lead from Kenya, forcing the closure of more than a dozen smelters, including the one at Owino Uhuru. In 2013, the Kenyan authorities approved tests for 50 residents. All came back positive, with the highest reading 420 micrograms per deciliter of blood - more than 80 times the point considered a health concern. The community is still dealing with the aftermath. One mother, Janeth Jardine says she used the stream that runs through the village to wash her children and clean food. Now she blames it for the flaking rash that covers the hands and legs of her two-year-old daughter, Josephine. “They never heal. I’ve taken her to hospital six times. They give cream, but it makes no difference,” she says. “This is common in this village.” Many of those who developed rashes later died or suffered repeated bouts of illness. One man blames the death of two of his children on the contaminated soil they used to play in. Others remember Linet Baraza, who died with lead levels of 238 micrograms per deciliter of blood. They are also warned that their children may suffer lower IQs unless they can get the expensive treatment needed to purge the lead from their blood. The UN Commission on Human Rights is helping to fund the legal claim for compensation. And UN Environment has raised their appeal for treatment, remediation and justice at international forums. “Phyllis has shown what can be achieved when victims of pollution get access to even basic information,” said Erik Solheim, the executive director of UN Environment. “Now it is up to the courts to show that the law is on the side of environmental defenders.” Omido hopes it will just be the start. “There are 17 other communities fighting for compensation for lead poisoning. We want to set a precedent for them,” she says. ‘We want to show environmental defenders can use litigation as a tool and we want the UN to build up the capacity to enforce environmental law in courts around the world. Defenders are often treated as criminals or people who are hostile to development. That is not the case.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to the world’s biggest problems.

Even in the cold sogginess of winter our minds are focused on the future as we plan for sunnier days ahead. The new year is a chance to take stock in the garden and experiment with fresh ideas, so here are three new edible introductions to liven up your fruit and veg patch. If you believe trend forecasters, ultra violet is the colour of 2018. Now it’s probably complete coincidence, but three of the most exciting fruit and veg varieties in the seed catalogues right now also happen to come in this dazzling shade. Having trialled all three this summer, I can confirm that they taste as good as they look. The best bit? Their eye-catching shade is provided by a group of naturally occurring botanical pigments called anthocyanins, which share a range of intriguing health benefits. So it’s a win-win all round. I have written before about my love of the purple raspberry ‘Glen Coe’, a British-bred hybrid of a jet-black bramble from the wilds of North America with the more familiar red cousin. It’s one of my all-time favourites for knockout berry flavour, with stunning colour come July. Recreating the original cross, British growers have now produced the brand new ‘Malling Passion’. This much larger-fruited purple raspberry has the same great flavour, but fruits later, from mid-August to September. Grow both varieties and you greatly extend the purple raspberry season. Admittedly the one downside to ‘Malling Passion’ is its thorniness, but being a later fruiter, pruning couldn’t be more straight forward. Just whack the whole lot down to ground level every February and you avoid the worst of the prickles. If it’s veg you’re looking for, the new purple Asian radish ‘Bluemoon’, that is dyed bright lilac to its core, takes some beating. Crisp and fresh, they have been bred for a milder flavour, too, so even haters of the veg’s traditional pepperiness could be converted. Being an Asian-type radish (aka mooli) they are not only much larger, but much more versatile in the kitchen, too, with a denser, less watery flesh that means they are tasty both raw and cooked. They are generally very easy to grow, but are total martyrs to cabbage root fly. So you must keep the plants covered in garden fleece for the whole growing season – and I mean must. If you have a sheltered garden or greenhouse, it is well worth giving the sweet, faintly rose-flavoured flesh of purple sweet potato ‘Molokai’ a go. Despite its Hawaiian heritage, they give a pretty decent yield in the UK, easily comparable to other cool-tolerant varieties, like the classic ‘Beauregard’. So full of anthocyanins their flesh is almost black, they make an incredible purple-hued sweet potato pie, not to mention beautiful mash, soups and purées.

The Resolution Foundation said the loss of pay across all sectors took the average loss for each of the UK’s 800,000 agency workers to £500 a year, up from £430 last year. The charity said it was shocked to find that around 85% of temporary staff suffered a pay deficit while working in the same job for more than three months. It said agency workers that stayed with one employer for more than three months were expected to have the same pay as full-time employees. Lindsay Judge, a policy analyst at the foundation, said many employers were using loopholes in the law that allow agency workers to sign away their right to equal pay. “Agency workers deserve to be paid the same as employees if they’re doing the same job, so the government should look to close the loophole that allows agency workers to sign away their right to equal pay. “With the government-commissioned Taylor Review noting this abuse, we’re hopeful that 2018 will be the year of action on fair pay for agency workers.” Last year, labour market economist John Philpott found that more than one in five workers, around 7.1 million people, were in precarious employment, up from 5.3 million in 2006. A report by the GMB union this summer warned that the number of workers who could be dismissed at short notice was nearer 10 million. The foundation said some agency workers earned a bonus to compensate in part for the loss of pension contributions, with interim managers and senior social care staff topping the list of those workers who command high wages. Workers in the category for caring, leisure and other service occupations earn £218 more on average than equivalent full-time members of staff, while temporary managers and directors enjoy a £2,477 pay boost compared to full-timers. But administrators lost £990 a year compared to full-time employees and the average sales or customer service worker lost £800 a year. The report said: “These pay penalties exist despite the Agency Worker Regulations 2010 which gives those with 12 weeks-plus of continuous service in the workplace pay parity with comparable employees.” It said the regulations allow agency staff to forgo their right to equal pay with directly employed staff in return for a contract that offers pay between assignments, known as a “Swedish derogation” contract. It said these were “widely abused, as noted by the government commissioned Taylor Review of Modern Working Practises”. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “Two people working next to each other, doing the same job, should get the same pay rates. But too often agency workers are treated like second-class citizens. “It’s time to end this undercutters’ charter and for the government to scrap this loophole. It’s recent review into modern employment practices called for precisely that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/20/elderly-canadian-couple-separated-christmas-care-home","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T18:11:59Z","webTitle":"Canadian couple forced to spend first Christmas apart after 69 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/20/elderly-canadian-couple-separated-christmas-care-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/20/elderly-canadian-couple-separated-christmas-care-home","fields":{"headline":"Canadian couple forced to spend first Christmas apart after 69 years","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For decades, Herbert and Audrey Goodine have celebrated Christmas together, setting out decorations and preparing gifts. This year the elderly Canadian couple will be forced to spend part of the season apart for the first time in 69 years, after provincial authorities determined that they required different levels of home care. Earlier this month, a health assessment found that 91-year-old Herbert Goodine’s health was deteriorating and said he would have to be moved out of the special care facility where he had lived with his wife Audrey, 89, for more than three years. The couple’s daughter, Dianne Goodine Phillips, said she was informed about the impending move on Friday in an email. “I read this message over several times in disbelief of how can anyone be so cold and cruel to do this a week prior to Christmas,” she wrote on social media. The New Brunswick department of social development gave her a few options; she could send both of her parents to another care home three hours away – far from their friends and family – or have her father sent alone to a home a 30-minute drive from where he was currently living, Phillips told Global News. She instead asked that her father be allowed to stay where he was until the end of the week. A provincial representative then forced her parents to decide, said Phillips. The decision weighed heavily on them. “When talking to my parents yesterday I listened to my mother weep and I could hear my father in the background,” said Phillips. “My mother said ‘Christmas is over for us now and this is the worst Christmas that we will ever have. Why could they not have waited till after the holidays.’” On Monday, Herbert and Audrey kissed and bade a tearful goodbye as they prepared to sleep in separate beds for the first time in decades. Audrey stood by the window, watching as her husband was driven to his new home. The issue, said Phillips, was not the decision but the timing. While still in early stages, her father’s dementia had progressed and he had broken some of the rules at the facility, including turning off a door alarm so that he could step outside to retrieve his wife’s ornamental plant. “I don’t have a problem with higher level of care. I had a problem with how it was rolled out … Why could this not have waited until after Christmas?” Phillips asked. “It’s mentally and emotionally hard on them. To me, it’s senior abuse.” Phillips said she was eventually hoping to find a home that can accommodate both of her parents. Until then, her father has been forced to adjust to his new place. “He said to me before I left, he said, ‘Look where they’ve put me … I’ll miss holding your mother’s hand in bed when I go to sleep,’” she told CTV News. The association that represents special care homes in the province said the decision was based on safety concerns, pointing to the fact that special care homes are not equipped with locking systems. “With dementia, if we get into a situation here where somebody is wandering out the front door and we don’t have a coded system, then really their safety is at risk,” said Jan Seely. “Nobody wants to read in the paper that a senior has gone missing.” New Brunswick’s department of social development said it was aware of the situation but would not comment on the details of the case. “If it’s determined that a senior needs additional care or that their safety is potentially in jeopardy, the department works with the resident and family members to facilitate a move to an appropriate home,” said a spokesperson for the department. “Individuals who require a higher level of care than what can be provided in special care homes are moved to where their needs can be more appropriately met, such as in a nursing home or a memory care home.” The Goodines will still be able to spend part of the season together; the couple is planning to spend Christmas Day at their daughter’s home. Hours after leaving his wife, Herbert said he was eager to see her again. “You don’t know how close we are,” he told the CBC. “And always was.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/dec/27/online-sti-kits-double-testing-uptake-in-young-people-study-suggests","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-27T19:00:25Z","webTitle":"Online STI kits double testing uptake in young people, study suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/27/online-sti-kits-double-testing-uptake-in-young-people-study-suggests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/dec/27/online-sti-kits-double-testing-uptake-in-young-people-study-suggests","fields":{"headline":"Online STI kits double testing uptake in young people, study suggests","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Offering young people testing kits for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) over the internet almost doubles testing uptake compared with inviting them to a clinic, research suggests. In 2016 alone there were more than 417,000 diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections in England, including gonorrhoea and chlamydia, with rates of STI diagnoses generally higher among young people. While the use of condoms can help to prevent the spread of STIs, a recent survey found that nearly half of under-25s questioned did not use one when having sex with a new partner. With time of the essence when it comes to diagnosis, new services have been developed to boost testing, including so-called “e-STI testing”, whereby testing kits for gonorrhoea, HIV, syphilis and chlamydia can be requested by individuals over the internet, with sexual health information also made available. The kits are then posted out, with samples returned by post and results given by phone or text message. The latest study suggests the approach could indeed increase testing uptake. “It is a really good news story, we are really delighted,” said Dr Caroline Free, co-author of the study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It is good news that it increases testing and it is really good news that it does that in high risk groups as well as lower risk groups.” E-STI testing schemes have attracted criticism from some, whose arguments include the accusation that the services are being rolled out as a sticking plaster for funding cuts to clinics and don’t offer the chance to pick up other issues or give counselling. However, others have argued that it is a convenient approach that could encourage testing. Writing in the journal Plos Medicine, a team of researchers based at a number of London institutions describe how they carried out a trial involving more than 2,000 participants aged between 16 and 30 from the boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark to probe whether e-STI services improved testing rates compared to conventional face-to-face services. The team randomly split participants – recruited via posters in universities, bars, and on social media – into two groups and sent a text message inviting them to have an STI test, either at a walk-in sexual health clinic or by ordering an STI-testing kit online. The latter group were also asked to complete a short form – those who reported symptoms, or appeared to have complications such as drug problems, were directed to a clinic but could continue with the postal test if they wished. After analysing patients’ records and taking into account missing data, the team reveal that just under 27% of those invited to a clinic had completed a test by six weeks, compared to 50% of those invited for e-STI testing – the large majority of whom did indeed use the postal kit. The results also hint that more STI diagnoses were made for the group invited for an e-STI test, but the researchers note that a greater number of participants would be needed to confirm this, and not all relied on the postal test; some instead went to a clinic. “[E-STI testing] is more convenient; and for some people they would rather do a test like this in the privacy of their home than attend a clinic,” said Free, adding that the study suggests e-STI testing should be commissioned alongside existing sexual health services. Dr Mark Lawton of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV and a sexual health consultant in Liverpool, welcomed the study. “Anything that increases testing rates has got to be seen as a good thing,” he said. “For the right people the postal testing might be an acceptable way.” But, he added, it was not clear why rates were lower for those invited to a clinic, while there are concerns that a move to e-STI testing is linked to budget cuts for clinics. “This should be in addition to, not instead of, traditional sexual health services which are best suited for people who have symptoms and also identifying vulnerable groups and supporting those,” he said. The National Aids Trust’s director of strategy, Yusef Azad, agreed. “Sexual health clinics need to be better funded so we can have both e-STI testing and end the long waiting times that are now building up for face-to-face appointments,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/22/sebastian-prodl-watford-kitchens-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T12:07:00Z","webTitle":"Watford’s Sebastian Prödl: ‘I’m interested in furniture, interiors and especially kitchens’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/22/sebastian-prodl-watford-kitchens-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/22/sebastian-prodl-watford-kitchens-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Watford’s Sebastian Prödl: ‘I’m interested in furniture, interiors and especially kitchens’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Prödls have two family businesses. The first, started in Styria two generations ago by Josef Prödl, has become a successful producer of high-end kitchens. The second is football. Sebastian Prödl is Watford’s player of the season; his brother, Matthias, played in Austria’s lower leagues but retired last year; a cousin, Viktoria Schnaderbeck, plays for Bayern Munich and captains Austria’s women’s team; another cousin, Jason Kicker, is a 20-year-old goalkeeper trying to make his way into the professional game; and a third was on the books of a top-flight team in Austria as a youth before injury ended his career. “I really don’t know how it happened,” Sebastian Prödl says. “We always think about it and talk about it. Maybe when we were young we played together and it started like this?” Unlike many players, retirement is not a word that fills Prödl with fear and uncertainty. Like his brother a year ago, when he finishes in one family business he can step neatly into the other. “I would already be involved if I hadn’t become a professional and of course I’m thinking about that when I finish my career,” he says. “I grew up with it and my whole family is involved in the company. As I’m interested in furniture, in interiors, and especially kitchens, I’m thinking about joining the company. I don’t know which kind of way, in what kind of job, but I feel like I want to be part of it as well.” It is fair to say few footballers list furniture as a particular area of interest. “When I buy a flat or an apartment, I want to be a part of it,” he says. “I don’t want to give it to an interior designer and say: ‘Just do it.’ I want to learn, I want to get taught these things and get a feeling for it. So I go to Design Week to see new furniture, but I’m also interested in classic designs and classic designers. I want to collect. It’s something I’m interested in and want to spend time on when I finish my career. At the moment I collect art but not furniture. It’s easier to get: paintings, photographs, pop art.” Born in the Styrian countryside 30 years ago, Prödl broke through at Sturm Graz and spent seven years at Werder Bremen before moving to Watford on a free in 2015, settling in Hampstead near his friend and former Werder team-mate Per Mertesacker. “I’d never lived in a big city and that’s what I put on my bucket list: if there was a chance in my life to live in a big city and to live the big city life, I’ll do that,” he says. “And I took the chance. People often say the city makes them tired but I take a lot of energy out of the city as well. We go to a lot of museums, exhibitions. If there’s a good concert in town we like to go there. It’s a big deal for me. “This city is so global, so open-minded. You get a different point of view about life. That’s what I sometimes miss when I go back to Austria. I miss that open mind, that international view, the will to work together, to interact, the will to communicate in a different way, to approach in a different way foreigners, cultures, religions. That’s what I really enjoy about living here.” It is clear Prödl sees the world around him as something not just to be experienced but to be examined and he does so with a focus and intelligence not always found in hulking 6ft 4in centre-backs. If he seems to have embraced all aspects of his off-pitch life, however, there are issues in English football about which he is less enthusiastic. “I don’t think it’s going to be soon but maybe there will be a problem here one day,” he says. “They’re selling everything, not only the football but everything around it. The players are becoming a brand and even I don’t read all the news any more because there’s too much. Too much news, too many rumours, too many things that aren’t even related to football. There’s a chance people will get annoyed by that. I hope not because I like football and I’m part of it, but maybe. “Sometimes you sit in the stands and you don’t feel the guy sitting next to you knows the game. People travel to England and watch a game, not because they love football but just to show they’ve been to a game. So sometimes, in a big stadium of a big club, the atmosphere is not what we expect. And the transfer market – there was the transfer of Neymar last summer; it was the only transfer where you could understand the value. So many transfers were not that good value. The market went crazy. It’s difficult for a small team and will become more difficult for small teams. I don’t know where this goes.” The call of England’s capital was one of the reasons why he chose to move to Watford instead of Leicester, who had also been courting him. “I always choose clubs with my gut,” he says. “Watford seemed to be the better choice for me.” He then had to watch the side he spurned sprint to the Premier League title, though that the player they signed instead of him, Yohan Benalouane, made four substitute appearances that season helped to calm any pangs of jealousy. Meanwhile in Hertfordshire, Prödl has excelled in central defence, where he is a composed and physically imposing presence, under an annually changing parade of managers. The latest, Marco Silva, has a burgeoning reputation that has already prompted a larger club to try to tempt him away. “He’s very different to the last coaches we had,” Prödl says. “He’s very clear in his opinion how to play. He’s very demanding: he demands a lot of discipline, not only on the pitch but also off the pitch. Which means the rules outside of the pitch, be on time, these kinds of things. On the pitch he’s got his opinion and he’s very focused. Every second on the pitch, in training sessions, he’s preparing us well for the games and you can tell he loves his job because of that focus.” The focus did not appear to drop when the press was full of stories about Everton courting him. “We followed everything that was written but there was no impact on the team or on him, as far as we could see,” Prödl says. “We never discussed it. We don’t know what was behind the scenes. For us the story was only in the papers.” Prödl spent much of Watford’s excellent early season on the sidelines with a hamstring injury and results since his return have been less encouraging. Watford have been beaten four times in five games, including a 4-1 capitulation at home to Huddersfield last Saturday that was, Prödl says, “a very desperate afternoon for us”. There is a familiar pattern repeating here, of early-season success followed by a winter wobble: in 2015 they were seventh on Christmas Day; in 2016, as this year, they went into December in eighth. But under Quique Sánchez Flores and Walter Mazzarri they had the 18th best record in the division from Boxing Day onwards, and under Silva they are again suffering from what Prödl calls “goblins”. “There’s still confidence,” he says. “We just need to not make the same mistakes we did in the first two seasons, when we were totally capable of competing in the first part of the season and dropped our level in the second part. We have to progress, to make sure we stay confident and compete in every game. There have only been two games this season when we didn’t compete, against Manchester City and Huddersfield. “We competed in 16 games. If we can continue like this, there’s no worry about maintaining that level of play. If we drop a little bit, there’s a danger of the same kind of situation we had in the last two seasons. I hope we don’t do that and I don’t see it coming. We try to continue the way we did and not face the same goblins of the last two seasons.” Prödl signed a four-year contract in September but though what follows it may be mapped out he remains ambitious for the remainder of his career. “I always dreamed about playing in the Premier League,” he says. “When I joined I fulfilled my dream on the one hand but on the other hand I also saw I could compete at this level. Who knows if I’m at the top of my ladder or if I’m still able to climb.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/20/republicans-plan-celebration-with-trump-after-house-passes-tax-bill-again","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T21:29:04Z","webTitle":"Republicans celebrate with Trump after House passes tax bill – again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/republicans-plan-celebration-with-trump-after-house-passes-tax-bill-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/20/republicans-plan-celebration-with-trump-after-house-passes-tax-bill-again","fields":{"headline":"Republicans celebrate with Trump after House passes tax bill – again","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jubilant Republican lawmakers joined Donald Trump at the White House for a victory celebration on Wednesday as Congress approved the party’s biggest priority, the most thorough reshaping of the American tax system since the 1980s. They celebrated their legislative victory and heaped praise on the president in the outdoor ceremony. After Trump inaccurately called the bill “the largest tax cut in the history of the country”, and hailed it for allowing for the “formation of new, young, beautiful, strong companies”, Republican leaders took turns praising him. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said this had been “a year of extraordinary accomplishment for the Trump administration” and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, praised Trump’s “exquisite presidential leadership”. Others went even further. Vice-President Mike Pence thanked Trump for his “boundless faith in the American people” while Utah senator Orrin Hatch called Trump “one heck of a leader”. Perhaps the most fervent praise came from Tennessee congresswoman Diane Black who proclaimed: “Thank you, President Trump, for allowing us to have you as our president.” The House passed the bill by 224 to 201– repeating the previous day’s vote after making a mistake in its passage on Tuesday. Twelve Republicans voted against the plan and no Democrats supported it. The bill represents a $1.5tn tax cut which permanently slashes corporate tax rates and also lowers taxes for individuals. Trump hailed the bill in a statement. “I promised the American people a big, beautiful tax cut for Christmas. With final passage of this legislation, that is exactly what they are getting … By cutting taxes and reforming the broken system, we are now pouring rocket fuel into the engine of our economy. America is back to winning again, and we’re growing like never before.” In a cabinet meeting shortly before the House vote, Trump praised the legislation and hailed it as “essentially repealing Obamacare” in addition to what he claimed would be the economic benefits of the tax cut. “It’s about jobs,” insisted Trump. He also heralded a measure which would open up the Alaskan Arctic wilderness for oil and gas drilling by energy companies. Pence also spoke, praising Trump for delivering “historic tax cuts … [and] that middle-class miracle”. The housing secretary, Ben Carson, also offered a prayer. “Workers benefit. Wages go up. More jobs occur,” Ryan said Wednesday on NBC’s Today, describing what Republicans say will flow from a $1.5tn measure that affects everyone’s taxes but is dominated by breaks for business and higher earners. Democrats call the legislation a boon to the rich that leaves middle-class and working Americans behind. “If they think this bill is a good political argument for them, let them think that,” the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, told reporters. The Senate used a post-midnight vote to approve the measure on a party-line 51-48 tally. Protesters interrupted with chants of, “Kill the bill, don’t kill us” and Pence, chairing the session, repeatedly called for order. Upon passage, Republicans cheered, with the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, among them. McConnell insisted Americans would respond positively to the tax bill. “If we can’t sell this to the American people, we ought to go into another line of work,” he said. Trump planned a ceremony with GOP lawmakers on Wednesday at the White House after final congressional approval. The bill will not be signed there, however. Instead, it is likely to be signed by Trump while he spends Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The tax bill which was pushed through Congress at a breakneck pace required an extra day before it could reach Trump’s desk because of a procedural hiccup with Senate rules. This meant the House had to vote a second time on the bill once two minor offending provisions had been stripped out. Ryan, who has worked years toward the goal of revamping the tax code, gleefully pounded the gavel on Tuesday’s House vote. GOP House members roared and applauded as they passed a package that will touch every American taxpayer and every corner of the US economy, providing steep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy, and more modest help for middle- and low-income families. Despite Republican talk of spending discipline, the bill is projected to push the huge national debt ever higher. Ryan said on Wednesday the GOP was willing to risk running up deficits with the aim of getting a higher annual economic growth rate. Trump is aching for a big political victory after 11 months of legislative failures and nonstarters. The president tweeted his congratulations to GOP leaders and to “all great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!” Congressional Republicans, who faltered badly in trying to dismantle Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, see passage of the tax bill as crucial to proving to Americans they can govern – and imperative for holding on to House and Senate majorities in next year’s midterm elections. “The proof will be in the paychecks,” Senator Rob Portman said during the Senate’s nighttime debate. “This is real tax relief, and it’s needed.” Not so, said the top Senate Democrat as the long, late hours led to testy moments Tuesday night. “We believe you are messing up America,” the New York senator Chuck Schumer told Republicans, chiding them for not listening to his remarks. The GOP has repeatedly argued the bill will spur economic growth as corporations, flush with cash, increase wages and hire more workers. But many voters in surveys see the legislation as a boost to the wealthy, such as Trump and his family, and a minor gain at best for the middle class. Democrats mocked the Republicans’ contention that the bill will make taxes so simple that millions can file their returns “on a postcard” – an idea repeated often by the president. “What happened to the postcard? We’re going to have to carry around a billboard for tax simplification,” declared Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the ways and means committee. Tax cuts for corporations would be permanent while the cuts for individuals would expire in 2026 to comply with Senate budget rules. The tax cuts would take effect in January, and workers would start to see changes in the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks in February. The bill would slash the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The top tax rate for well-off individuals would be lowered from 39.6% to 37%. The legislation repeals an important part of the 2010 healthcare law – the requirement that all Americans carry health insurance or face a penalty – as the GOP looks to unravel the law it failed to repeal and replace this past summer. It also allows oil drilling in the Arctic national wildlife refuge. The $1,000-per-child tax credit doubles to $2,000, with up to $1,400 available in IRS refunds for families that owe little or no taxes. Disgruntled Republican lawmakers from high-tax New York, New Jersey and California receded into the background as the tax train rolled.

Whereas in previous years I’ve skipped through the issue of post-Christmas waste in an upbeat “how to” guide, this year’s advice might be summed up as “Brace, brace”. Let me explain. Back in July the Chinese government announced a clampdown on so-called “foreign garbage”. To get slightly more technical, that means bringing in very tight contamination limits on 24 categories of scrap, especially waste paper and plastic. This concerns us, because since 2012 the UK has shipped more than 2.7 million tonnes of plastic scrap to mainland China and Hong Kong. Put simply there is no other market to replace it right now. This leaves us scrambling for solutions. My advice is to get in early with recycling and do your homework. Resources include Recycle Now for dealing with Christmas decoration and packaging, and WRAP has produced a series of Christmas waste videos, too. If your recycling is not “clean”, it’s game over. Already one fifth of the material collected for recycling from households cannot be recycled. When you chuck plasticised paper in with your normal paper (recyclable) it contaminates the whole lot in the eyes of recyclers. This seems like a giant mess, but could there be an upside? If we can’t dump our rubbish on China, could we be forced to confront the reality of our own waste habits finally? The famous Blue Planet II episode featuring a whale death has triggered a guilt response in many of us. Can we now convert that into taking a zero tolerance stance on the plastic packaging problem that likely caused the whale to die in the first place? 2018 needs to be the year that things change.

But this is no ordinary shopping experience, rather an immersive introduction to the future of fashion. Visitors get a multi-sensory journey using scent and sound to tell the story of the brand. It’s quite an evolution: over the past decade Bottletop has developed its signature bags made from waste ring pulls into the go-to luxury sustainable accessories brand. Bottletop’s sustainable design ethos is literally built in here at the new shop. The interior has been 3D printed from 60,000 recycled plastic bottles and 5,000 cans. This is thought to be the world’s first store 3D printed from upcycled plastic, and the printers were operated by robots (Bottletop, 84 Regent Street, London W1B 5RS).

Call Me By Your Name is the Guardian’s film of 2017. Thank you. It makes me feel so happy. I am honoured. Are you surprised by how the film has resonated with people? We did the movie in Cremona, in northern Italy, in 2016 as a little family affair. And we brought it to the world feeling proud of it but not knowing what to expect. This is a movie about a family, compassion, transmission of knowledge, of being better people because someone’s otherness changes you. That this kind of discourse could be embraced by an audience and critics is very warming. Those themes of sharing knowledge and emotions seem relevant at a time when people are talking past each other. We have mindlessly been falling into a hole of individualism, a world in which we somehow lazily prefer to be confrontational, enraged, unconnected with our emotions. Because it fits better the sort of technology in which we are now soaked. Call Me By Your Name encompasses what I’ve found striking about life: that you can be a better person, and you can build a bridge to go and meet new people instead of confining yourself within your own boundaries. The film was made in your home town, and it is set in a similar time period to your own childhood. What sort of feelings does it stir from your own youth? I was two years younger than Elio is in the book [the film is based on]. But I remember my childhood and adolescence distinctively, and how I was already starting to be a director, because I was sitting at the far end of a room studying people dancing at parties. I was reading books and imagining stories in my own mind and I was starting to become a young man aware of his own sexuality, although, unlike Elio, I did dare to speak [up about it]. The casting of Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet is something that people have latched on to. How did you know you would be able to bring out the chemistry between them? I had been a great fan of Armie since seeing him in The Social Network. I met him 10 years ago and I kind of fell in love with him. I followed his career and once I had something to propose to him, I did. And I was lucky that he said: “OK, I’m gonna do it.” With Timothée, I met this young, feverish boy in New York four years ago. He was 17 and already had the lean, nervous appearance of Elio. Timothée is such an ambitious young man; he really knows what he’s doing. But he is also naive, so the mixture was intoxicating and perfect for the role. I was surprised to hear you have already discussed possible sequels – the story feels so self-contained. What are your plans? These characters are so fantastic, and I want to know what happens to them. The last 40 pages of the book tell you about 20 years in the life of Oliver and Elio. So I started to think about Michael Apted’s Up, and the cycle of films Truffaut devoted to the character of Antoine Doinel. And I thought, maybe it’s not a question of sequel, it’s a question of chronicling everyone in this film. I think seeing these characters growing in the bodies of these actors will be quite fantastic. There’s a lot of Oscar buzz about your film, though there have been some suggestions that Moonlight winning last year might hamper your film’s chances. Does the comparison between the two films frustrate you? Not at all. I love Barry Jenkins’s film and I am excited by the comparison. His work has a formal style that comes from a certain kind of cinema that I love: in particular, Hou Hsiao-hsien. So I feel a sense of brotherhood with what Barry Jenkins did. Your next film is a remake of Dario Argento’s Suspiria. Can you tell us a little bit about it and your relationship with the original? Every movie I make is a step inside my teenage dreams, and Suspiria is the most remarkably precise teenage megalomaniac dream I could have had. I saw the poster when I was 11 and then I saw the film when I was 14, and it hit me hard. I immediately started to dream about making my own version of it. So in a way it makes me smile when I hear people say, “How dare you remake Suspiria. Typical commerce-driven mentality.” I was just a boy who had seen a movie that made him what he became. So that’s how I am approaching it: a homage to the incredible, powerful emotion I felt when I saw it. It’s weird that remaking a film is a negative thing, but in theatre or opera, say, a new staging can find things the original missed. Do you stop watching Tristan und Isolde’s mise-en-scène because Patrice Chéreau’s was so incredible? No, there will be a new one that will be fantastic. How many Hamlets have we experienced in our lifetimes that were fantastic? Human art is not about inventing originality, it’s about finding a new point of view. Capitalism wants to tell us something new is always coming; it’s not true. The iPhone X is the same as 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. It’s the great marketing qualities of Apple that make us want to buy this stuff. But it’s the same! Do you need a 10 after you got the 8? You don’t. Well, I need an iPhone X because my 7 is starting to feel a bit creaky. Yes, because they are engineered like that. But I can tell you that Suspiria, by Luca Guadagnino, will stay strong and not get creaky like the iPhone!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/20/david-lammy-sent-email-warning-he-could-face-same-fate-as-jo-cox","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T17:27:33Z","webTitle":"David Lammy reports email warning he could face 'same fate as Jo Cox'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/20/david-lammy-sent-email-warning-he-could-face-same-fate-as-jo-cox","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/20/david-lammy-sent-email-warning-he-could-face-same-fate-as-jo-cox","fields":{"headline":"David Lammy reports email warning he could face 'same fate as Jo Cox'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"David Lammy has insisted he will not be intimidated after he received an email accusing him of striving for black supremacy in the UK and warning him he could suffer the same fate as murdered MP Jo Cox. A spokesman for Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, who shared an image of the email in a tweet, said the matter had been reported to police. The message, sent to Lammy on Tuesday morning, offered what its sender described as a “friendly warning”. It went on: “As you attack the White population of Britain in your aims to gain Black Supremacy in this country, remember what happened to Jo Cox. I AM NOT ONE OF THEM but there are those out there who would like to see you suffer the same fate. Be careful!!” Cox was shot and stabbed to death by Thomas Mair as she made her way to a surgery in her Batley and Spen constituency in June 2016, days before the Brexit referendum. While attacking Cox, Mair was heard shouting: “This is for Britain”, “keep Britain independent”, and “Britain first”, his trial heard. Police later found a library of far-right literature in his home. Lammy has been outspoken on institutionalised racism. A recent report compiled by the MP concluded that black and ethnic minority suspects still face bias and discrimination in the justice system. On Tuesday, the Ministry of Justice announced that it had agreed to carry forward many of his recommendations, including a radical pilot scheme that could lead to the dropping or deferral of prosecutions in London in an effort to reduce disproportionality in outcomes. Responding to the email in his Twitter post on Tuesday morning, Lammy said: “Thank you … for your friendly warning and reference to Jo Cox, my friend &amp; colleague who was murdered. However if this is meant to be a subtle way of intimidating me, scaring me or stopping me raising important issues as an elected representative it isn’t going to work.” On Wednesday, Lammy updated followers. “Thanks for supportive tweets, emails messages and letters I am very grateful indeed,” he tweeted. “This was reported to the police yesterday, and will not put me off fighting for what I believe in.” A spokesman for David Lammy said: “This email has been reported to the police. Unfortunately, David regularly receives racist abuse, hate mail and threatening communications. This was a particularly disturbing email to receive and the specific reference to Jo Cox is clearly concerning for his wife and children.” A few hours later on Wednesday, Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, shared an image of a racist Christmas card he said was sent to party leader Jeremy Corbyn. “Stop Labour stealing our white Christmas,” the card declares, over a doctored image of Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, dressed as Santa Claus and hauling away a Christmas tree. Lewis says in the tweet: “I’m not keen on sharing racist propaganda but I think it’s important folk see the kind of hate Diane is subjected to for doing nothing more than standing up for her beliefs #solidarity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/20/police-watchdog-investigates-death-of-student-in-custody","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T18:01:01Z","webTitle":"Police watchdog investigates death after use of restraint","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/police-watchdog-investigates-death-of-student-in-custody","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/police-watchdog-investigates-death-of-student-in-custody","fields":{"headline":"Police watchdog investigates death after use of restraint","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The police watchdog has launched an investigation into the death of a 25-year-old student in Oxford who was arrested by Thames Valley police shortly before he died. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the death of Nuno Cardoso, a law student from Kentish Town, north London, who died in November. According to evidence given to the IPCC, Cardoso was restrained during arrest and subsequently collapsed. Cardoso is the fifth black man to die after the use of restraints by police in 2017. Four Thames Valley police officers have been warned that their decision to transport Cardoso to police custody rather than seek medical assistance is under investigation. Thames Valley police informed the IPCC of the incident and investigators were sent to the scene after the arrest on 24 November. According to information given to the IPCC, Cardoso was being transferred to a police station in the back of a police van when officers reported that he had become unwell. Officers stopped the van in order to administer CPR, with additional officers arriving with a defibrillator to provide further medical assistance. Cardoso was taken by ambulance to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford where he died later that day. Body-worn video footage of his arrest and his subsequent medical assistance has been downloaded for analysis. Cardoso’s mother, Doroteia dos Santos, said she wanted justice for her son. “The number of deaths in police custody, particularly of young black men, makes me worried that something is wrong,” she said. “I have so many questions about how this could have happened to my son.” A major review into serious incidents and deaths in custody was published in October, calling for far-reaching reforms to the police, justice system and health service. The review by Dame Elish Angiolini – which was ordered by Theresa May in 2015, when she was home secretary – found evidence of racial disproportionality in police restraint deaths. It also warned that police vehicles and cells should not be used to transport or hold those detained under mental health powers, unless in exceptional cases. Guido Liguori, an IPCC associate commissioner, said: “My thoughts are with the family and friends of Mr Cardoso and all those affected by his death. The investigation, which is in its very early stages, will look at the full circumstances surrounding this incident.” Ruth Mellor from Saunders Law, the firm representing the family, said: “It is vital that there is a thorough investigation. Any concerns that might come to light around the actions or omissions of the police officers or paramedics involved in these events should be robustly examined to ensure proper accountability and justice.” Campaigners have warned about the number of deaths of black men in police custody. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, a charity providing expertise on state-related deaths, said there was a “systemic problem”. “It is despairing that we end the year with yet another restraint related death of a black man, who died less than a month after the publication of the Angiolini review,” said Coles. “Enough is enough. That young black men are dying with such regularity shows that this is a systemic problem that needs urgent attention.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/20/struggling-swansea-sack-paul-clement-after-nearly-year-at-club","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T08:12:48Z","webTitle":"Swansea sack Paul Clement but hope to appoint successor in next 24 hours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/20/struggling-swansea-sack-paul-clement-after-nearly-year-at-club","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/20/struggling-swansea-sack-paul-clement-after-nearly-year-at-club","fields":{"headline":"Swansea sack Paul Clement but hope to appoint successor in next 24 hours","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Swansea City are looking for their third manager in less than 12 months after Paul Clement was sacked. The club’s American owners decided to part company with Clement after losing faith in his ability to engineer a turnaround following a dismal run of 10 defeats in 13 Premier League matches that left Swansea anchored to the bottom of the table and four points adrift of safety. It is understood that Swansea have a replacement for Clement lined up and hope to have him in place before the critical home match against Crystal Palace on Saturday, with an announcement anticipated within the next 24 hours. Clement’s successor is expected to have Premier League experience, although there is no suggestion at this stage that Tony Pulis is in the frame. The timing of the decision to part company with Clement comes as something of a surprise, not least because all the indications were that he would remain in charge for the Palace match and that Swansea’s majority shareholders, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, wanted to try to give the 45-year-old the January transfer window to strengthen a woefully ill-equipped squad. Swansea’s owners are acutely aware that the club’s recruitment was poor in the summer, yet they also came to the conclusion that Clement was not capable of leading the team out of trouble and, with a busy festive programme coming up and the vital game against Palace on the horizon, were not prepared to wait any longer before acting. Although Swansea have struggled badly this season and Clement has not helped himself at times with his overly cautious tactics, the decision to dismiss him feels harsh in some respects. Appointed in January, Clement managed to keep Swansea up against the odds last season, collecting 29 points across 19 games to lift the club away from the bottom of the table, and ended up being nominated for the Premier League manager of the season award. Clement’s biggest gripe, however, is likely to be in relation to summer transfer activity. Swansea sold their best two players, Fernando Llorente and Gylfi Sigurdsson, and never came close to replacing them as they finished the window with the lowest net spend in the Premier League. In many ways the seeds were sown then for the abject season that has followed. “To change the manager, especially at only the halfway point of the season, is the last thing we wanted to do as a club,” Huw Jenkins, the Swansea chairman, said. “We had three different managers last season and as a result we all wanted to give Paul as much time as possible to turn things around. But we felt we couldn’t leave it any longer and needed to make a change to give us the best chance of an uplift and a turnaround in fortunes with the club bottom of the Premier League. “Paul has been at the club for 12 months and what he achieved in the second half of last season to keep us in the top flight was a tremendous feat. For that, and his effort and commitment this season, it goes without saying that the club thanks him for his work, together with Nigel [Gibbs] and Karl [Halabi]. “I have had an excellent working relationship with Paul and we are all, including the owners, surprised and disappointed it hasn’t worked out this season.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2017/dec/21/sajid-javid-promises-to-liberate-leaseholders-from-feudal-practices","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T00:01:46Z","webTitle":"Sajid Javid promises to liberate leaseholders from 'feudal practices'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/21/sajid-javid-promises-to-liberate-leaseholders-from-feudal-practices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/dec/21/sajid-javid-promises-to-liberate-leaseholders-from-feudal-practices","fields":{"headline":"Sajid Javid promises to liberate leaseholders from 'feudal practices'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Leaseholders are to be freed from “feudal practices” in the property market, according to the government minister responsible for housing, with new rules to make extending a lease or purchasing a freehold “much easier, faster and cheaper”. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, also said the government would go ahead with a ban on leaseholds on new-build houses first announced in July, and will force developers to cut controversial ground rents to zero for all new apartments and houses. The government will also write to all developers that have sold homes with “onerous ground rent terms” to ask them to provide “necessary redress”. Taylor Woodrow has set aside £130m to assist leasehold buyers but other developers have steadfastly refused to pay any form of compensation. Javid said: “It’s unacceptable for homebuyers to be exploited through unnecessary leaseholds, unjustifiable charges and onerous ground rent terms. It’s clear from the overwhelming response from the public that real action is needed to end these feudal practices.” The Department for Communities and Local Government said it will be “working with the Law Commission to make the process of purchasing a freehold or extending a lease much easier, faster and cheaper”. Property experts immediately predicted that some leaseholders could save nearly 50% on the punitive sums many are forced to pay once a flat’s lease drops below 60 years. In one example, a £200,000 flat with 50 years left on the lease would be charged around £36,000 to extend under the current system but only £20,000 under a new approach the DCLG is understood to be considering. There are 4.2m residential leasehold homes in England in the private sector – one in five of all properties – and of these 1.4m are leasehold houses. Numbers have jumped sharply in recent years because of the explosion of apartment building in cities, and developers who have profited from selling houses as leasehold. Scotland has largely abolished the leasehold system. It is understood that Gavin Barwell, a former housing minister but now chief of staff to Theresa May, has been the driving force behind the reforms, enabling Javid to push through laws that will hit many wealthy freeholders. Campaigners welcomed the reforms but remain concerned about when they will come into force. Sebastian O’Kelly of Leasehold Knowledge Partnership called it “a huge vindication of our efforts”. However, O’Kelly warned: “There is plenty of wriggle room here as the issue is referred to the Law Commission, where doubtless the sector and its grisly trade bodies will have their baleful influence.” But government officials promised that the new rules, including a new formula for calculating leasehold buyouts, will be in place by the end of 2018. James Wyatt of Parthenia Valuations, whose model for valuing leases is among those being studied by the DCLG, said reform will end the £500m a year “gravy train” of excess fees and charges earned by freeholders, solicitors and surveyors. Leaseholders should be given easy ready-reckoners for buying out freeholds, said Sir Peter Bottomley, Conservative MP for Worthing, sweeping away the jargon of leasehold enfranchisement, such as “hedonic regression”, “relativity” and “marriage value”. “The calculations should be simple and cost-free and neither side ought to have disputes.” Bottomley is a leading member of an all-party parliamentary group that has brought Labour and Conservative MPs together to fight leasehold abuses, such as the ground rent scandal that has engulfed homeowners, particularly in the north-west of England. Many homebuyers found that after buying new-build homes on 999 year leases sold as “almost the same as freehold” they were trapped in spiralling ground rents, doubling every 10 years, with the freehold sold on to specialist companies demanding huge sums if the homeowner wanted to buy their way out. In extreme cases, homeowners have been left with homes made virtually worthless as banks will no longer lend against them. Justin Madders, the Labour MP whose constituency of Ellesmere Port and Neston is a hotbed of leasehold issues, said: “There is still a risk that the government could kick this into the long grass leaving thousands of people still trapped in unsellable homes. “Urgent action is needed now for those with doubling ground rents and unfair fees and charges in their existing leases and I will be seeking a meeting with the housing minister to set out in detail the straightforward process for purchasing the freehold that I have proposed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/23/you-may-confer-test-your-knowledge-of-literature-music-and-art-christmas-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T08:00:16Z","webTitle":"You may confer: test your knowledge of literature, music and art – Christmas quiz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/23/you-may-confer-test-your-knowledge-of-literature-music-and-art-christmas-quiz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/23/you-may-confer-test-your-knowledge-of-literature-music-and-art-christmas-quiz","fields":{"headline":"You may confer: test your knowledge of literature, music and art – Christmas quiz","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"To save up to 20% on books featured in this quiz, visit bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2017/dec/24/sanctuary-review-comedy-hidden-depths-irish","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-24T07:50:45Z","webTitle":"Sanctuary review – low-key charm and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/24/sanctuary-review-comedy-hidden-depths-irish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/dec/24/sanctuary-review-comedy-hidden-depths-irish","fields":{"headline":"Sanctuary review – low-key charm and more","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"My first impression of Sanctuary, an Irish film about two people with intellectual disabilities (lovely performances by Kieran Coppinger and Charlene Kelly) who want to be together, was that it was a gentle, low-key comedy with charm but not much in the way of impact.

Berkeley Homes, which builds 4,000 homes a year, is planning to create a facility in Kent next year where builders will work to produce up to 1,000 houses and apartments annually which will then be craned on to sites. Another company, nHouse, is setting up a factory in Peterborough with the capacity to build 400 homes a year, complete with light fittings, bathrooms, bookshelves and kitchens. Production is expected to start in January. It claims it can build a house in 20 days in the factory which can then be erected on site in half a day. Several other developers, including Legal and General and Urban Splash, have also launched prefab home divisions. Fears of a shortage of skilled construction workers caused by an ageing workforce and an exodus due to Brexit are part of the reason for the revival of prefabrication, which last provided a significant number of homes after the second world war. The government has set a target of building 300,000 homes a year by the middle of the next decade. Despite recent increases in activity, the last annual figure was 190,000. A Berkeley spokesman said: “We have acquired a 10-acre brownfield site from the Homes and Communities Agency to build a factory for modular homes in Ebbsfleet, Kent. This will have the potential to deliver up to 1,000 homes a year. “Construction of the factory could begin next year. While the speed of production and the impact on skills and labour are important factors, our real driver is the quality we can achieve with modular housing.” The nHouse has been designed by the architect Richard Hywel Evans and is made in four modules from engineered pine panels which are transported on the backs of lorries and are then clipped together on site and connected to pre-existing services. Its built-in features include solar panels, a robot vacuum cleaner and even a drone landing pad – looking forward to a time of aerial deliveries. A three-bed house is on sale to developers or individual householders from £170,000 to £185,000, which is about the same price as a standard house built using wet trades. Nick Fulford, the director of nHouse, argues that with 100 workers operating on an indoor production line rather than on muddy building sites in the elements, the homes will suffer from fewer snagging problems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/a-z-winter-houseplants-jane-perrone-gardens","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T11:00:11Z","webTitle":"Gardens: the A-to-Z of winter houseplants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/a-z-winter-houseplants-jane-perrone-gardens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/06/a-z-winter-houseplants-jane-perrone-gardens","fields":{"headline":"Gardens: the A-to-Z of winter houseplants","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A is for avocado Want more houseplants?

Many will root even if you just stick a stem in a glass of water for a few weeks. And you can make more of certain succulents (including echeverias, haworthias and crassulas) by carefully removing a leaf from the stem, leaving it to callus over for a week or two, then pressing into gritty compost. Soon, a rooted baby plant will grow from the end, while the leaf gradually shrivels away. D is for dormancy Many houseplants, cacti and succulents included, like a breather over winter, so reduce watering and stop feeding until spring. E is for epiphtye Tillandsias (air plants) are epiphytes, meaning they grow on trees in the wild and have few, if any, roots. So, if you fear the mess of compost, air plants may well be the answer: they don’t need a pot and need only a weekly half-hour soak in water to keep them happy. F is for fiddle leaf fig Still a painfully fashionable specimen plant, but not the easiest to keep happy. If you don’t have the touch, go for a Swiss cheese plant (Monstera deliciosa) instead. G is for gynura (and other furry houseplants) I love houseplants that not only look good, but feel good, too: the purple passion plant (Gynura aurantiaca) has scalloped, velvety leaves that look like offcuts of an Austen Powers suit, while the rusty leaves of my feltbush (Kalanchoe beharensis) are the perfect tactile stress reliever. H is for hippeastrum (aka amaryllis) If you raised one of these outsize bulbs as a Christmas curiosity and fancy a repeat performance, start cutting back on watering next September and let the plants die back. Cut away the leaves, then leave somewhere cool and dark – a shed or garage will do – for about six weeks. Bring back indoors, start watering and feeding again, and it’ll soon be popping out another phallic flower bud. I is for ivy Surprisingly, the English ivy (Hedera helix) that runs rampant in gardens does pretty badly in most homes. Grow lookalikes that won’t shrivel and die: namely, grape ivy (Cissus rhombifolia) or devil’s ivy (Epipremnum aureum). J is for jewel orchid If you’re bored with supermarket moth orchids, you just need to spread your net wider. If you value foliage over flowers, you’ll love the jewel orchid (Ludisia discolor) with its smart, dark green and silver-striped foliage. K is for kit Yes, that copper watering can may look stunning, but I’ve found that a drinks bottle with a sports top is actually a better way of watering without splashing. L is for light In winter, low light levels can cause cacti and succulents to become leggy and stretched. Invest in an LED grow light to keep them happy. M is for mealy bugs If your succulents are covered with fluffy white lumps, it’s probably mealy bugs, a sap-sucking scale insect. Put a drop of methylated spirits on the end of a cotton bud and dab on to the insects. Repeat until they’ve all gone (although, in serious infestations, you may need to ditch the plant altogether). N is for Norfolk Island pine tree It’s not a true pine, but Araucaria heterophylla will fill the gap very nicely if you are missing your Christmas tree already. O is for Oxalis triangularis Purple shamrock is my prediction to become the must-have houseplant of 2018. Its heart-shaped leaves fit perfectly with the Pantone colour of the year, ultra violet. P is for pebble trays Cacti and succulents revel in dry air, but that can be problematic for other indoor plants. Misting is often recommended as a solution, but sticking pots in a tray of gravel or pebbles half-covered with water is more effective. Q is for quarantine If you want to avoid importing pest problems such as mealy bug (see M, above), keep any new plants in a different room from the rest of your collection for a few weeks, so you can check the arrivals for any unwanted visitors. R is for rosary vine (Ceropegia woodii) This trailing plant with heart-shaped, silvery leaves has a clever trick up its sleeve: the bead-like aerial tubers that grow along the stems can be snipped off to make new plants. S is for succulent Got a succulent for Christmas? Don’t kill it with kindness. Right now, it’s sleeping (see D is for dormant), so put it somewhere cool but sunny, and water sparingly until spring arrives. T is for terrariums If you have tried and failed with succulents, don’t label yourself as someone who “can’t do houseplants”; you’re probably just growing the wrong plants for your space. Shady spots are perfect for closed terrariums planted with ferns and moss. Be inspired by Tovah Martin’s book The New Terrarium. U is for umbrella grass (Cyperus involucratus) If you are the overwatering type, this bog-dwelling plant is the one for you. V is for variegation Leaves with swirls, stripes and splashes of colour look great on Instagram, which may explain their current popularity: try nerve plant (fittonia), calatheas and prayer plants (marantas). W is for watering The biggest killer of houseplants is overwatering. If in doubt, step away from the watering can. Use a wooden skewer stuck deep into the compost as a moisture indicator. Pull it out before watering, and go ahead only if the wood is dry. X is for ex-plant Tempting as it may be to try to nurse a leafless stick that was once a plant back to life, don’t. Limited space means you need to be brutal, so consign it to the green waste bin and start again. Y is for yellow When your plant’s leaves turn yellow, it’s usually because you’re not watering right: too much or too little. See W. Z is for Zamioculcas zamiifolia If you can’t keep anything green alive, this architectural foliage plant is the most forgiving of all. • Listen to Jane Perrone’s houseplant podcast at janeperrone.com."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/20/new-year-rail-strikes-to-pile-on-misery-days-after-fares-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-20T16:00:27Z","webTitle":"New year rail strikes to pile on misery days after fares rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/new-year-rail-strikes-to-pile-on-misery-days-after-fares-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/20/new-year-rail-strikes-to-pile-on-misery-days-after-fares-rise","fields":{"headline":"New year rail strikes to pile on misery days after fares rise","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Railway workers are to hold a series of 24-hour rail strikes that threaten to cause widespread disruption in the new year, in an escalation of their long-running dispute about guards. Workers at six train operating companies – Southern, South Western Railway, Greater Anglia, Merseyrail, Arriva Rail North and the Isle of Wight’s Island Line – will walk out 8 January. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union at at the same companies, except Southern, will stage two further walkouts on 10 and 12 January. The union said it had tried to resolve the dispute, but said it continues to have safety concerns over plans to impose driver-only trains without guards. The strikes will be a fresh blow to passengers just days after the imposition of the 3.6% increase in fares – the biggest annual rise in five years. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “Every single effort that RMT has made to reach negotiated settlements in these separate disputes with the different train operating companies over safe operation and safe staffing has been kicked back in our faces. We are left with no option but to confirm a further phase of industrial action in the new year.” Cash said the disputes were about putting the safety of the travelling public “before the profits of the private train companies”. “It is frankly ludicrous that we have been able to negotiate long-term arrangements in Scotland and Wales that protect the guards and passenger safety but we are being denied the same opportunities with rail companies in England,” he said. “This suspension of normal industrial relations by the employers has to end if we are to make progress towards a solution that guarantees safe rail travel for all. “RMT is in no doubt that it is the dead hand of the minority Tory government that is interfering in these disputes and their influence is a factor in preventing the union from reaching negotiated settlements.” Cash added that with fares increasingon 2 January it was “outrageous” that the prime minister and the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, were “happy to stand aside and cheer on overseas rail companies that rip-off the British passenger with eye-watering fare increases to subsidise their domestic transport operations while throwing the guards off our trains”. He said the government should lift its “blockade” on talks in the separate disputes to allow the union to negotiate “freely” with the companies. RMT members on Virgin West Coast, CrossCountry, South Western Railway, Greater Anglia and London’s Docklands Light Railway are taking strike action in the coming weeks in a series of disputes over staffing, pay and working conditions. Richard Allan, Arriva North’s deputy managing director, said: “Northern is committed to investing in new and updated trains, better stations and faster journeys for our customers. “Northern is still prepared to guarantee jobs and pay for conductors for the rest of our franchise to 2025 if we can reach agreement on how our colleagues deliver better customer service using those fantastic new facilities. “Additionally, last week the government wrote to RMT, guaranteeing employment for conductors beyond 2025 if RMT ends its dispute. “We will be working hard to keep customers on the move during these next RMT strike days.” Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, said: “No one wins from RMT strike action. The partnership railway understands the need to change and is working together with a long-term plan to do more for customers, communities, businesses and our people. “These improvements are what the RMT strikes are about. Working together, we’ve got to find a way through this dispute so that we can get on with the business of delivering our long-term plan for the railway, playing our part to support Britain’s economy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/dec/23/broadcasters-box-sets-slump-festive-viewing-figures","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Broadcasters release box sets to tackle slump in festive viewing figures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/23/broadcasters-box-sets-slump-festive-viewing-figures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/dec/23/broadcasters-box-sets-slump-festive-viewing-figures","fields":{"headline":"Broadcasters release box sets to tackle slump in festive viewing figures","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"British broadcasters that have seen festive audiences slump in recent years as viewers have turned in droves to the US streaming giants Netflix and Amazon are planning to fight back this Christmas with the help of their own archives. Families have been increasingly giving up on the traditional custom of crowding round the TV on Christmas Day and during the festive break, owing to the rise of on-demand, catch-up and an explosion of choice. As recently as 2008, Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death drew more than 16 million viewers, but viewing of BBC1 shows on Christmas Day has fallen by almost a quarter since 2012, according to research from the media agency Blue 449. But this year the gloves are off as broadcasters take a leaf out of Netflix’s playbook and release bumper box sets and reruns of their most popular TV shows to combat the drastic fall in festive viewing figures. The BBC is making its biggest-ever push to beef up its festive content by stacking the iPlayer service with more than 40 box sets – from Peaky Blinders and the teen drama Thirteen to Gavin &amp; Stacey. It also features classics such as the 1986 EastEnders Christmas special when Den handed Angie divorce papers –an episode watched by a record 30.6 million on Christmas Day and for its repeat a few days later. The BBC, which has historically ruled the Christmas Day TV ratings, has been seeking to bounce back from hitting a primetime viewing low last year when it recorded the smallest Christmas audience since the current form of TV ratings began in 1981. The most-watched show of the day was a Call the Midwife episode set in South Africa. Dame Pippa Harris, the co-founder of the show’s maker Neal Street Productions, said: “Over the last five years overnight ratings figures [at Christmas] have dropped off. We’ve seen this ourselves with Call the Midwife which regularly gets 5-6 million viewers on Christmas Day but would normally get 8-9 million on a ‘regular’ night. “I do think Christmas is slightly different, though. People now have so many other pulls on their time. More than ever it is about saving up your Christmas TV treats.” Harris pointed out, though, that the 2016 festive special of Call the Midwife ended up attracting the show’s highest-ever audience – 10.4 million – when all viewing over the festive period was aggregated. “It is so easy to record and time-shift shows to watch right across the festive period,” she said. “In a way, Netflix and other streaming services are responsible for the festive viewing patterns that have emerged. Netflix has in a sense instilled the idea you can watch what you want, when you want. You can choose your own schedule and timings – the box set mentality.” Netflix added 222 new programmes and films to its catalogue in November and a further 125 in December, according Blue 449, whose chief executive, Simon Davis, said: “Netflix is once again gearing up for a festive season of binge watching. We see on-demand viewing spike in December, driven by people ‘snacking’ on content over the Christmas period. The public aren’t turning off their TVs; they just have more choice.” However, the deep-pocketed US streaming firm is facing a renewed challenge from traditional broadcasters this year. Channel 4 will air two Great British Bake Off festive specials, while Miranda Hart will front a Christmas show, marking the broadcaster’s first major effort at taking a major slice of festive TV viewers. Richard Davidson-Houston, head of Channel 4’s digital TV service All4, says that with three such “festive bullseyes” in the schedule, he has been focusing on a Netflix-style large-scale loading of box sets for viewers. All4 now has 120 box sets including The Inbetweeners, Catastrophe, the Isis drama The State, the school drama Ackley Bridge and foreign-language fare under the Walter Presents banner. “The popularity of services like Netflix is you realise you are sitting on a treasure trove,” he said. “All of these shows did well when they first launched on TV but there is a huge [on-demand] audience that hasn’t yet found those titles. It is about changing viewer behaviour, and we are making much more of a virtue of it.” Davidson-Houston said that while catch-up TV was still growing fast – for example, Bake Off audiences rose by up to 50% over the week after each episode aired – Channel 4 had found that archive, older shows now accounted for more than half of on-demand viewing on All4. “On-demand is effectively replacing that DVD moment at Christmas now,” he said. The growing power of the new wave of TV services, led by Netflix and Amazon’s Prime Video, is underlined by a growth milestone they are forecast to hit next year. By the end of 2018, subscription video-on-demand services will have signed up almost 17m customers, the same number as have pay-TV packages with Sky, BT, Virgin and TalkTalk in the UK, according to Ampere Analysis. For now, nearly all viewers add a service such as Netflix to their existing TV habits, and traditional broadcasters are not ready to let the US service become the Grinch who stole Christmas TV just yet. Kate Harwood of Euston Films, which is releasing the drama Hard Sun in one hit on the BBC and iPlayer in the new year, said that viewing habits had changed but Christmas remained a focal point of the TV calendar. “There is still a cultural rush towards Christmas. Netflix hasn’t killed it,” she said. “But there is a lot more spread betting now where it is no longer the case everyone has to gather round the TV and watch the same thing. There is always event TV on Christmas Day – the first female Doctor Who, a Call the Midwife special – what is fun is delivering a bit of a treat. Christmas has certainly not been cancelled.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/15/church-of-england-to-apologise-over-george-bell-abuse-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T00:21:49Z","webTitle":"Church of England to apologise over George Bell abuse allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/church-of-england-to-apologise-over-george-bell-abuse-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/15/church-of-england-to-apologise-over-george-bell-abuse-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Church of England to apologise over George Bell abuse allegations","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Church of England is to apologise for its handling of allegations of sexual abuse against one of its most revered figures of the 20th century, which critics said had destroyed the reputation of a respected man. The church is due to make public on Friday the conclusions of an independent inquiry into the way it dealt with claims of abuse made against George Bell, the former bishop of Chichester and one of the most admired church leaders of recent times. In a statement released on the eve of publication, Peter Hancock, the bishop of Bath and Wells and the C of E’s lead bishop on safeguarding, said it was clear from the report that “our processes were deficient”. “For that we apologise. Lessons can and have been learnt about how we could have managed the process better,” he said. The inquiry, led by Lord Carlile, was commissioned last year after a vigorous campaign by Bell’s supporters who said the church had “condemned as a paedophile” someone who could not refute the claims against him and on the basis of one person’s testimony. Bell died in 1958. The George Bell Group, established to defend the late bishop’s reputation, accused the church of failing to properly investigate the claims. “The valuable reputation of a great man, a rare example of self-sacrificing human goodness, has been carelessly destroyed on the basis of slender evidence, sloppily investigated,” it said. Bell’s supporters pointed to his record of championing the oppressed and denouncing as inhumane Britain’s carpet-bombing of German cities in the second world war. Lord Carlile is believed to have delivered his report to the C of E more than two months ago. The church said its delay in publication was due to the “intensive process” of liaising with those involved, in particular the complainant known as “Carol”. However, a report in Friday’s Daily Telegraph – which appeared to be based on a briefing rather than actual sight of the report – prompted the church to release statements from Hancock and the current bishop of Chichester, Martin Warner, who issued the formal apology to Carol in 2015. Hancock said: “At the heart of this case was a judgment, on the balance of probabilities, as to whether, in the event that her claim for compensation reached trial, a court would have concluded that Carol was abused by Bishop Bell. The church decided to compensate Carol, to apologise and to be open about the case.” Carlile’s report had concluded that in cases where settlement was made without the admission of liability, a confidentiality provision should be included, Hancock said. But he added: “Respectfully, we differ from that judgment. The church is committed to transparency. We would look at each case on its merits but generally would seek to avoid confidentiality clauses. “It is clear from the report, however, that our processes were deficient in a number of respects, in particular the process for seeking to establish what may have happened. For that we apologise. Lessons can and have been learnt about how we could have managed the process better.” He also said: “The church has always affirmed and treasured Bishop Bell’s principled stand in the second world war and his contribution to peace remains extraordinary. At same time, we have a duty and commitment to listen to those reporting abuse, to guard their confidentiality, and to protect their interests. “We recognise that Carol has suffered pain, as have surviving relatives of Bishop Bell. We are sorry that the church has added to that pain through its handling of this case.” Warner said: “We welcome Lord Carlile’s assessment of our processes, and apologise for failures in the work of the core group of national and diocesan officers and its inadequate attention to the rights of those who are dead. We also accept the report’s recognition that we acted in good faith, and improvements to core group protocols are already in place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/15/royal-commission-final-report-australia-child-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T01:11:15Z","webTitle":"Catholic church dismisses key recommendations from landmark inquiry into child abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/15/royal-commission-final-report-australia-child-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/15/royal-commission-final-report-australia-child-abuse","fields":{"headline":"Catholic church dismisses key recommendations from landmark inquiry into child abuse","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Leaders of the Catholic church in Australia have quickly dismissed calls from a landmark inquiry into child sexual abuse that the Vatican should make celibacy for priests voluntary and end the secrecy of confession. After five years of work, Australia’s royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse delivered its 21-volume report to government containing 400 recommendations – 189 of them new – to governments and organisations about how to prevent children being harmed on such a scale again. It found the inadequacy of canon law contributed to the failure of the Catholic church to protect children and report or punish perpetrators within church institutions. The commission urged the Australian Catholic bishops conference to ask the Vatican to reform canon law by removing provisions that “prevent, hinder or discourage compliance with mandatory reporting laws by bishops or religious superiors”. “We recommend that canon law be amended so that the ‘pontifical secret’ does not apply to any aspect of allegations or canonical disciplinary processes relating to child sexual abuse,” the report said. It also said the conference should urge the Vatican to rethink its celibacy rules. The commission found that while celibacy for clergy was not a direct cause of abuse, it elevated the risk when compulsorily celibate male clergy or religious figures had privileged access to children. But the archbishop of the archdiocese of Melbourne, Denis Hart, responded by saying the seal of the confessional was “inviolable” and “can’t be broken”. He said if someone confessed to abusing children, he would encourage them to admit to their crimes outside the confessional so that it could be reported to police. “I would feel terribly conflicted, and I would try even harder to get that person outside confessional, but I cannot break the seal,” he said. “The penalty for any priest breaking the seal is excommunication.” Hart said the commission “hasn’t damaged the credibility of the church”. In August, Hart upset many abuse survivors and advocates when he said he would risk going to jail rather than report allegations of child sexual abuse raised during confession. He was responding to a recommendation the commission published earlier this year that called for failure to report child sex abuse in institutions to be made a criminal offence. Hart reiterated those views on Friday and said that he did not expect canon law to change. He said there was “real value” in celibacy, and did not want laws to be changed. “I think it’s taken time for bishops to realise the seriousness of the matter” of child sexual abuse, he said. The Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, said the report would take him time to digest. “It will not sit on any shelf,” he said. “I will study the findings and recommendations carefully, and then provide a detailed response as we discern, with the rest of the community, the best way forward. However, like Hart, he dismissed calls to change confession. Changing mandatory reporting of abuse that comes to light through confession was “a distraction,” he said. “While we are yet to study what the commission has had to say about that, I think everyone understands that this Catholic and orthodox practice of confession is always confidential,” he said. “Any proposal to stop the practice of confession in Australia would be a real hurt to all Catholics and Orthodox Christians.” On celibacy rules, he said: “We know very well that institutions who have celibate clergy and institutions that don’t have celibate clergy both face these problems. We know very well that this happens in families that are certainly not observing celibacy.” The commission is the largest inquiry of its kind conducted since the first reports of what became a global child abuse scandal emerged in the US. The report found an overwhelming amount of the abuse reported to the commission occurred in faith-based institutions. Almost 2,500 survivors told the commission about sexual abuse in an institution managed by the Catholic church, representing 61.8% of all survivors who reported sexual abuse in a religious institution. “In many religious institutions, the power afforded to people in religious ministry and the misplaced trust of parents combined with aspects of the institutional culture, practices and attitudes to create risks for children,” the report said. “Alleged perpetrators often continued to have access to children even when religious leaders knew they posed a danger. “We heard that alleged perpetrators were often transferred to other locations but they were rarely reported to police. The failure to understand that the sexual abuse of a child was a crime with profound impacts for the victim, and not a mere moral failure capable of correction by contrition and penance (a view expressed in the past by a number of religious leaders) is almost incomprehensible.” The report said the Australian Catholic bishops conference should conduct a national review of the governance and management structures of dioceses and parishes, including in relation to issues of transparency, accountability, consultation and the participation of lay men and women. The commission also called for the selection criteria for employing bishops to be published, including their credentials relating to the promotion of child safety. The commission called on churches to “establish a transparent process for appointing bishops which includes the direct participation of lay people”. It found that Catholic schools in the archdiocese of Melbourne had a “dysfunctional” employment structure, where the parish priest is the employer of the school principal and school staff for parish schools. “There is a risk that having the priest as employer could act as a barrier to people reporting concerns about child sexual abuse,” the report found. “We recommend that parish priests should not be the employers of principals and teachers in Catholic schools.” The commissioners found numerous cases where alleged perpetrators were priests associated with Catholic schools. “We concluded that the relevant bishop or archbishop knew about allegations of child sexual abuse but failed to take appropriate action to protect children from the risk of abuse, sometimes for years. Their inaction left these priests in positions where they had ongoing access to children in Catholic schools. It was left to principals and teachers to attempt to manage the risk these individuals posed to children.” Among the other recommendations were that federal, state and territory governments should fund dedicated community support services for victims and survivors in each jurisdiction; that the federal government should conduct and publish a national study to establish the extent of child maltreatment in institutional and non-institutional settings; that each state and territory make the failure to report suspicions of abuse a crime, and also remove any remaining limitation periods, or any remaining immunities, that apply to child sexual abuse offences, including historical child sexual abuse offences. The commission, led by Justice Peter McClellan, heard stories of abuse that occurred in more than 4,000 institutions ranging from religious organisations and sporting clubs to schools and orphanages. More than 15,000 people contacted the commission with evidence. More than 8,000 people spoke to a commissioner during a private sessions, while hundreds more told their stories through public hearings that lasted 444 days. The commission referred many allegations of abuse to police, which to date has resulted in 230 prosecutions. Two versions of the report were delivered to the government on Friday, one of which has been redacted for publication until a number of criminal proceedings have been completed. Inquiries into the sexual abuse of children have been conducted worldwide, with Ireland’s Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse finding abuse in church-run institutions including schools was endemic. But that commission has been criticised for its limited scope, and did not examine the external impact of the abuse or name perpetrators to the extent that Australia’s royal commission already has. A British inquiry into child sexual abuse, still under way, has been marred by controversy. Its head, Dame Lowell Goddard, was forced to step down in 2016 after it was revealed she had spent extensive time on holiday. Australia’s commission has been consistently praised by survivors, their advocates and experts for its uncompromising investigation of institutional abuse. It conducted 57 case studies, resulting in 45 reports to government, culminating in Friday’s final report. It has employed almost 700 staff since its inception in 2013, who examined more than 1.2m documents. McClellan chaired the commission throughout. The royal commission reviewed more than 300 reports published in the past 28 years, using many of these to inform its work. The royal commission was first announced on 12 November 2012 by the then prime minister, Julia Gillard, who said allegations that had come to light about child sexual abuse were heartbreaking. “These are insidious, evil acts to which no child should be subject,” she said at the time. “The individuals concerned deserve the most thorough of investigations into the wrongs that have been committed against them. They deserve to have their voices heard and their claims investigated.” On Friday she thanked the six commissioners for their work. “Our nation is indebted to you and to the survivors who fought so hard for justice and a safer future for our children,” she said. The current prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told reporters the commission’s work had uncovered a “national tragedy”. “Above all, I want to thank and honour the courage of the survivors and their families who’ve told, often for the first time, the dreadful stories of abuse that they received from people who actually owed them love and protection,” he said. Turnbull has come under pressure for already ignoring recommendations made by the royal commission around a national redress scheme for survivors. The federal government’s redress legislation has attracted criticism for excluding abuse survivors who have been convicted of serious crimes, and for capping redress at $150,000. The royal commission recommended a cap of $200,000. The legislation has been referred to a Senate inquiry by the shadow social services minister, Jenny Macklin. State and territory governments have also been slow to commit to the legislation. The commission found: “We heard from some survivors about their negative experiences with diocese-based redress schemes, including delays, inconvenient processes, and perceptions that the maximum payments available through these schemes were inadequate.” Experts have already expressed concerns that the commission’s recommendations will only be as effective as the state, territory and federal governments and institutions tasked with implementing them. The commissioners’ report found 64.3% of survivors were men. More than half were aged between 10 and 14 years when they were first sexually abused, though female survivors generally reported being younger. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people comprised 14.3% of survivors, and 93.8% of survivors told the commission they were abused by a male. The commission found 83.8% of survivors were abused by an adult, and the average duration of child sexual abuse experienced in institutions was 2.2 years. Of survivors, 36.3% said they were abused by multiple perpetrators. “A national memorial should be commissioned by the Australian government for victims and survivors of child sexual abuse in institutional contexts,” the report recommended. “Victims and survivors should be consulted on the memorial design and it should be located in Canberra.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/15/bennelong-byelection-result-judgment-on-my-leadership-turnbull","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T00:33:09Z","webTitle":"Bennelong byelection result 'judgment' on my leadership: Turnbull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/15/bennelong-byelection-result-judgment-on-my-leadership-turnbull","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/15/bennelong-byelection-result-judgment-on-my-leadership-turnbull","fields":{"headline":"Bennelong byelection result 'judgment' on my leadership: Turnbull","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has conceded a loss for the Liberals in Saturday’s Bennelong byelection would be a reflection on the performance of his government, but said confidence in his leadership was “a matter for the Liberal party room and, of course, on the floor of the House”. Turnbull used a radio interview on Friday to warn the government’s lower house majority was at stake, saying if Labor’s candidate, Kristina Keneally, won, “we would no longer have an absolute majority in the House of Representatives”. Asked whether he accepted the result would be a reflection on his leadership, Turnbull replied: “Of course. You know, in any byelection, there is a contest between two candidates and there is also a contest between the two parties which they represent. No question about that.” “People will be casting a judgment on the government which I lead, of course.” Asked whether a Labor win would make his leadership shaky, Turnbull said it would bring Labor one step closer to government. “It would reduce the government down to 75 seats out of 150 in the House of Representatives.”Turnbull chided his host, the Melbourne broadcaster Neil Mitchell, for focusing on personalities rather than the government’s policies. “You always want to talk about me and I want to focus on the 25 million Australians I represent.” The campaign in Bennelong has been brutal, given the importance of the result for the government’s political fortunes. After internal rebellions by MPs and open discussion about the prime minister’s leadership in the run-up to the New England byelection in early December, Turnbull has used the win there by Barnaby Joyce and the subsequent passage of marriage equality legislation to shore up his position. A defeat in Bennelong would trigger a fresh round of internal instability. The Liberal incumbent, John Alexander, is expected to prevail, but activists on the ground point to substantial levels of voter frustration and disaffection, and fatigue with the bombardment of campaign materials. Opinion polls published over the past week point to a line-ball contest on Saturday, or an Alexander win. Either because the contest is close, or as a strategy to maximise primary votes, both sides were declaring the result line ball on Friday. Given Bennelong has a substantial Chinese community, the contest has been complicated by the controversy surrounding Dastyari’s dealings with Chinese donors and the Turnbull government’s measures dealing with foreign interference – which have been met with a firm rebuke from Beijing. On Friday Alexander had to fend off reports that he failed to declare rental income on his recently purchased luxury mansion in the NSW southern highlands. He told Sky News he had complied fully with his obligations under the register of pecuniary interests, and completed his declaration “100% correctly” with advice from the clerk of the House. Alexander also defended a decision by the Liberal party to focus heavily on Keneally’s record in New South Wales politics, but he said he personally had been more concerned with “untruths” during the byelection campaign. The Liberal, who held the seat at the last federal election with a margin of just under 10%, said he was “fighting for every vote” until polls closed. Keneally told reporters on Friday the weekend contest was “an opportunity for the people of Bennelong to stand up and have their choice heard”. “This is an opportunity for the people of Bennelong to put aside all the negativity the prime minister has been spreading around, and to take note of the fact he hasn’t come here and said much that’s positive,” Keneally said. “He has no positive plan for the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/16/trump-hater-gift-guide","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-16T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"The ultimate gift guide for the Trump-hater in your life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/trump-hater-gift-guide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/trump-hater-gift-guide","fields":{"headline":"The ultimate gift guide for the Trump-hater in your life","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’ve survived almost a full year of the Trump presidency and things are bleak, y’all. Shrinking national monuments, Muslim bans, sexual harassers being endorsed for public office, the slow erosion of the Environmental Protection Agency from the inside out, and of course, the continuous undermining of resources to support women’s rights and reproductive health. It may seem like there isn’t much to celebrate, but we’ve put together the ultimate gift guide for the Trump-hater in your life nonetheless. These gifts are guaranteed to help bolster their resistance for at least another 12 months. 1. National park pass Cost $80 for a one-year pass With Trump’s recent decision to shrink the Bears Ears national monument by over 80% and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument by 45%, national parks need our support now more than ever. Plus, just look at that picture: activism never looked so good! Buying an adventurous loved one a park pass can inspire their outdoorsy spirit, and giving an experience rather than a thing is also a fantastic way to lessen the environmental load of the holidays. 2. Furious Vulva chocolate Cost $20 for 12 vulvas Give the gift of pussy-power with a box of sweet vulvas that Trump won’t ever be able to get his tiny hands on. The chocolatier Lagustas Luscious creates these delectable chocolates in the softly sculpted likeness of lady parts, cast in dark chocolate and filled with delicate pink peppercorns and Hawaiian alaea sea salt. Is your mouth watering, too? 3. A monthly donation to Planned Parenthood in Trump’s name Cost varies Ever since the election, Planned Parenthood’s funding has been under attack by the Trump administration. Offering a regular monthly donation is a great way to support this worthwhile organization - doing it in Trump’s name is even better. Check the box about three-quarters of the way down the donation page which says: “Yes, my gift is in honor or in memory of someone special.” You’ll be able to specify that your donation is being made in Donald Trump’s name and also request that a card be mailed to him to let him know (Need the address? Here: The White House, Office of the President, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington DC 20500.) Merry Christmas, Donny boy! 4. Anything from Patagonia Cost varies I mean literally anything. Why? Well, not only is Patagonia one of the most socially and environmentally responsible companies in existence today, it is also currently suing Donald Trump over the aforementioned National Park reductions. Yes indeed, a corporation is suing the current US administration. If that doesn’t make your entire Christmas, I don’t know what will. So! Socks? A sweater? Even a canoe! It doesn’t really matter what it is, it just matters that your giftee needs it and that it comes from this ballsy corporation that’s made the decision to do business better. 5. I am Malala Cost $11.30 It’s not a new book, but since Trump seems intent on continually demonizing Islamic communities, this memoir of a young Muslim woman is needed more than ever. Malala Yousafzai (you may recognize her name because oh, she won a Nobel peace prize at the age of 17) writes in detail about her childhood growing up in the Swat Valley of Pakistan, her life under the Taliban regime, how she spoke up for women’s rights, and immigrating to the United States after an assassination attempt. Yousafzai puts a face on the immigrant experience and shows just how vital it is that the United States remain a beacon of hope and equality. Buy it from your local bookstore if you can! (For kids, Malala’s Magic Pencil is a simplified yet still touching story of Yousafzai’s journey paired with beautiful illustrations.) 6. Eco kit – reusable straws and utensil set Cost $12.95 for a set Trump’s entire presidency seems like a giant middle finger to the environment, so give someone you love the gift of personal responsibility. This reusable bamboo cutlery set includes a fork, knife, spoon and chopsticks, perfect for putting a dent in the 40bn plastic utensils used (and probably discarded five minutes later) each year in the US alone. It’s become painfully clear that we can’t rely on this government to protect the environment for us – time to do it ourselves. Add on a reusable straw for bonus environmental points and do your part to reduce the amount of plastic sitting in landfills and clogging our oceans. 7. F*ck Trump Lipstick Cost $19.95 It’s a bit on the nose but since we’re all thinking it, why shouldn’t “F*ck Trump” be plastered all over a lipstick tube? This matte pink lipstick is made by the delightfully named LipSlut cosmetics company, and each purchase supports a great cause. The LipSlut website states: “50% of all earnings from F*ck Trump go towards helping a civil rights organization targeted by the Trump administration. This organization is to be chosen by the people, as with every lipstick purchased comes an opportunity to vote. 50% towards charity, 100% against tyranny.” Yes, please! 8. ACLU T-Shirt Cost $27.99 The ACLU consistently mounts some of the most vocal and effective oppositions to Trump’s arcane policies. Support them by giving the civil rights fan in your life a chance to send a message about what real patriotism looks like. Despite Trump’s assertion that dissent is unpatriotic, we (and the tee) feel differently. 9. Impeachment Scented Candle Cost $25.31 The last impeachment vote failed miserably, with 58 votes against an overwhelming 364 – but nevertheless, we can dream, can’t we? And while we’re at it, why not order a lovely impeachment scented candle for your favourite activist? What does impeachment smell like, you ask? Well, while the manufacturer, JD and Kate Industries, admits that real impeachment probably smells like “printer toner and sweaty congressional interns”, this candle is a sweet blend of peach and mint. Best of all, the candle lid has a social justice spinner on top, offering a handful of effective ways to get involved in impeachment efforts. 10. What Happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton Cost $13.49 Now, we know that anti-Trump does not necessarily mean pro-Hillary. But for those who “yass, queen”-ed their way through the entire election and cringed every time Trump talked over Clinton or cut her off mid-sentence, it’s time to let Hillary speak. Though it may be painful to relive the election through Clinton’s personal account, it also offers a valuable perspective from the first female presidential nominee of a major political party. 11. Cards Against Humanity Cost $25 If you’ve ever played Cards Against Humanity, you know that it really does live up to its slogan: “a party game for horrible people”. And though its boundary-pushing (and sometimes unbelievably offensive) humour may not be to everyone’s taste, its latest forays into political activism will please any Trump-hater in your life. As part of its “Cards Against Humanity Saves America” project, the company bought land on the US-Mexico border and pledged to make it as difficult as possible for Trump to build his proposed border wall. Next, it redistributed the wealth of the 150,000 people who bought into the project, using the results of a survey to take money from the richest subscribers and give it to the poorest. Supporting this company is the perfect way to surprise the sometimes-over-the-line person on your list. This article contains affiliate links to products.

But rather than perceiving it as my enemy, I came to embrace its enticing, futurist charms. The term Latinx arises from a perceived inadequacies of the labels “Hispanic” and “Latino”, which emerged in the civil rights era, around the same time that the term “Negro” gave way to “black”, and then “African American”. Although Hispano was used earlier, particularly in New York in the early to mid-20th century by migrants from Latin American as a vehicle for advocacy and political organizing, Hispanic was adopted in the 1970s by government bureaucracies, the business community and advertisers and marketers as a way to promote American assimilation while retaining ethnic pride. Yet many academics and activists, as well as cultural figures, particularly west coast Mexican-Americans, grew to prefer “Latino”. The term Hispanic, they felt, was an attempt to use identification with Spain to create another “whitened” European-American ethnic label. The term Latino, these activists believed, subtly reflected the mixed-race origins of Latin Americans. More recently, attempts to address the male-centric nature of the masculine “o” suffix created variations like Latino/a, Latina/o, and finally the awkward Latin@, which seized on internet age typography and tried to create a shared male/female space. The arrival of Latinx coincides with a strong push for eliminating identifiers of gender in language, such as the now ubiquitous (at least among millennials) posting of pronouns to be used when referring to an individual, such as she/her, him/her, and the liberating they/them. This trend is emblematic of how acknowledging “border spaces” through the sort of women-of-color feminism pioneered by 1970s and 80s Chicanx writers like Gloria Anzaldúa and Cherrie Moraga can transform male-dominated ideas about Latinx identity into broader intersectional sectors of marginalized people. In this way “Latinx” represents a queering of Latino. Yet of course Latinx has its detractors. An early attack appeared in a student newspaper of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. It resonates with some grievances I’ve heard when speaking to some of my students at Columbia. Latinx is seen as an attack on the Spanish language in its dismantling of tradition, and this particular post criticizes it as an imposition of US values on Latin American culture, which is based in the Spanish language. It also mocks the messiness of continually using “x”s in written and oral communication, which is understandable until you realize that saying Latinx is as easy as saying Kleenex. There’s also a growing debate about whether those of Latin American descent should even identify as a monolithic group at all. Both Hispanic and Latino are terms used by media giants like Univision and major advertisers who have for decades tried to concoct a flattened, deracialized identity to create a loyal pool of voters and consumers. In 2015, Mark Hugo López of the Pew Hispanic Center argued that research showed: “Hispanics prefer to identify themselves with terms of nationality (Mexican or Cuban or Dominican) rather than pan-ethnic monikers (Hispanic or Latino or even American).” Similar research shows that even the use of or identification with the Spanish language decreases in most Hispanic groups by the second or third generation, and intermarriage with non-Latinx groups is at around 25%, second only to Asian Americans. While this second factor may be a threat to the diminishing of Latinx identification, the first one does not erase the fact that Latinx identification is primarily about non-binary racial and gender identification. That doesn’t mean that we don’t see ourselves in terms of our race and sexuality, which although fluid, powerfully symbolizes difference from the American norm. I embrace Latinx because of its futurist implications. Like superheroes of color and the possibilities inherent in girls and everyone else who code, Latinx represents an openness that is increasingly under threat in a political climate that is most intent on drawing borders, keeping outsiders out, and using violence to keep it that way. Yet because I am aware of how the strategic essentialism of Latinx is not the be all and end all of who we are, I think it’s important that we nurture and continue to redefine who we are as Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Central Americans, and beyond to the furthest reaches of the Southern Cone. It’s not easy to hold on to such seemingly opposite intentions, but although it’s not usually part of our national conversation, it points to a future America that might be.

Bruce Springsteen’s hit Broadway show, Springsteen on Broadway, which was originally slated to last until 26 November, and then February, has now been extended again to June 2018. The new tranche of tickets goes on sale on Tuesday. The extension of the rocker’s Broadway run confirms Springsteen has established a new paradigm for performers: tapping a seemingly insatiable demand by audiences for what amounts to a nightly reading from his hit autobiography, set to music, interspersed with songs performed solo and with his wife, Patti Scialfa. But the new ticket allocation will be distributed to the same original list of fans organisers received before the show began the run on 12 October. The list – run by Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan process – is closed, and is likely to remain so. Anyone else who wants to see the performance must venture on to the secondary market where, three months into the run, tickets are still commanding anywhere between $1,200 and $5,000 a pair, or turn up at the theatre and line up hoping for returns. There is also a lottery for another lucky few. Last week, fans who already had tickets queued in the bitter cold outside the Walter Kerr theatre on 48th St in midtown Manhattan to see their idol. “It’s a dream come true. I’ve been waiting all my life,” said Susan Hopkins from Atlanta, whose commitment extended to car vanity plates that read “BRUUUCE”. “I think he’s the great American poet of our time,” she said. Her companion, Trish Hollandsworth, confessed she’d fallen in love with Bruce in 1980. “He’s the best storyteller ever. He relates. He’s our everyman. He’s in our blood, and we feel he writes every song for us specially,” she said. Some had come from further. “He became my brother when I was fifteen, and he’s never betrayed me,” said Enrico Orlandi from Italy, who’d flown especially to see the show. This intensity of Springsteen infatuation is not new, but his Broadway run may have served to intensify it further. Alex Bidorini, 45, from Costa Rica, was coming for a second night. “You feel like you’re in his living room. He’s happy in his habitat. Sometimes he sings off the mic so you hear his real voice. So it’s amazing.” At the end of a contentious year in the city of Donald Trump, New York magazine put Springsteen and his wife on the cover as first among things to love about the Big Apple. “Because after 26 years of marriage, Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa still sing love songs to each other on Broadway – and their run was extended for four more months,” the editors explained. In one sense, Springsteen’s Broadway run is nothing new. Journalist Richard Williams noted in 1981 that Springsteen had a “strong feeling that even the playing of rock’n’roll entails hard work and obligations”. “It’s not about thew money,” said Hopkins. “He loves his fans. His fans are his therapy. If he didn’t do this he would not exist. He wants to do it till he dies. He gives everything, and gives it every night.” Nevertheless, Springsteen has found a way to connect with thousands of committed fans, make a handsome paycheck, and to sleep in his own bed at night. Those familiar with the economics of the touring business say that despite the union costs of playing on Broadway, Springsteen could be taking home 60-65% of the weekly gross. While the price of secondary market tickets has soared, their face value averages at $500 a piece. The Walter Kerr theatre has 948 seats and Springsteen is doing five nights a week. That’s around $1.6m a week to Springsteen, after costs. Over its current eight-month run, Springsteen could make around the same – $42m – as he made schlepping round the world with the E Street band playing stadium shows to nearly two and a half million people last year. New York music business veterans struggle to come up with comparisons, butone might be Billy Joel, who has played a show a month at the 10,000-capacity Madison Square Garden going on four years. Over his career, Joel is approaching 100 shows at the Garden. Springsteen has done more than 50 at the Walter Kerr so far and will complete around 180 by the end of June. New York promoter Ron Delsener, who booked David Bowie’s debut concert at Carnegie Hall on the Ziggy Stardust tour in 1972, and Bob Dylan when he went electric at Forest Hills stadium in Queens, said Springsteen’s long residency would be hard or impossible for another performer to match. “Bruce? He’s going through the roof with this thing. It’s unheard of. He’s breaking new ground.” Delsener has booked other artists on Broadway. “We had Jackson Browne played for a week. Elvis Costello. Way back when, Queen opened for Mott the Hoople. Bette Midler, Liza Minelli, Shirley Bassey and people like that. But but no one has played this long. Bruce could go on for years if he wanted to.” Springsteen is so confident of his market in New York and in his home state of New Jersey, he has not needed a promoter for 20 years. But Springsteen on Broadway is not really a rock show with opportunities to change up or deviate from the set list. It’s a theatrical Broadway performance, rooted in stories from Springsteen’s hit autobiography, Born to Run, and interspersed with songs. “This is a performance, not a concert,” points out former Smashing Pumpkins manager Andy Gershon. “It’s hard work doing the same thing night after night. At least with the live shows he can mix and veer off course depending on how he’s feeling and reacting to the audience. Broadway is very disciplined. You’re doing the same thing, the same show, the same exact tone, day and day out.” There are rumours that Springsteen plans to take the show to London when he finishes the New York run in June. That will leave an opening for someone to follow his lead on Broadway. But who? “Would Bowie [have done] that? Would Prince? Maybe Bowie because he lived here,” says Delsener. “I would say of all of the people, Bowie could have done it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/designer-trees-and-board-game-butlers-christmas-in-londons-poshest-hotels","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T13:04:04Z","webTitle":"Designer trees and board-game butlers: Christmas in London's poshest hotels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/designer-trees-and-board-game-butlers-christmas-in-londons-poshest-hotels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/designer-trees-and-board-game-butlers-christmas-in-londons-poshest-hotels","fields":{"headline":"Designer trees and board-game butlers: Christmas in London's poshest hotels","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s a popular family ritual across the world – settling the children down and reading them ’Twas the Night Before Christmas as the excitement builds for the big day. But if you’re super wealthy you can choose to have a professional read it for you as part of a minimum £3,000 festive break at a five-star hotel in Mayfair. Families checking in to Claridge’s on Christmas Eve are promised “Christmas just as it should be: elegant, indulgent – and totally effortless”. After drinking the complimentary champagne, parents can let their children explore the hotel suite, complete with its own private Christmas tree, before settling them down at 6pm for some storytelling, including the classic 19th century poem. Claridge’s dedicated service this Christmas is the latest foray in a battle between London’s poshest hotels competing for high-spending Brits and overseas visitors coming to the capital for the festivities. The grade II listed Ritz on Piccadilly has installed a 7.6m (25ft) Christmas tree in its Louis XVI lobby, and promises a “board-game butler” to “recreate the magic of a family games night”. The Ritz’s Prince of Wales suite – the only suite still available – can be yours for £7,475 a night. The Connaught, near Berkeley Square, promises “the most perfect Christmas imaginable”, including “a special letter from Father Christmas to say he’ll see you at the Connaught”. The minimum price is £2,310 for two nights. On Christmas morn there will be no need to get up before dawn to put the turkey in the oven, as the Michelin-starred chefs at Claridge’s have got it covered and will serve a six-course feast in the former Gordon Ramsay restaurant. After lunch the hotel – which has played host to Barbara Cartland, Winston Churchill and countless visiting royals – guarantees guests a visit from Father Christmas as well as a magician, caricaturists, cartoon entertainers Sharky and George for the children, and a set from acoustic trio Wandering Hands for the parents. You might have a relaxing day planned, but the Wandering Hands won’t – they are also performing at the Ritz. All the hotels have spent vast sums on decorations. The Ritz’s dedicated florist Paul Thomas called in a team of 25 to help him install the 7.6m tree. Thomas “travelled to the [Scottish] Highlands to handpick our tree from a choice of three which are all especially grown for us”, according to the hotel. Decorating it with cherubs, luxurious wrapped presents, model deer and Ritz teapots took seven hours. In total there are over 10,000 decorations and more than 6,500 lights. The Connaught has installed a 9.1m (30ft) Norway spruce decorated in “Connaught purple” lights. The lights spell out a poem written especially for the hotel by Tracey Emin. The fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld had the decorating honours at Claridge’s, and decided to install a 4.9m (16ft) inverted Christmas tree with silver gilded roots in the art deco lobby. “Reminiscent of a silver stalactite,” the hotel said. “It is hung with traditional silver lametta decorations, silver butter-leather feathers and snowflakes handmade by craftsmen in Germany, with tree candles giving a warm, inviting glow.” Beneath the tree are hand-sewn white Icelandic sheepskin rugs to “reflect a recent snowfall”. In previous years, Apple’s Sir Jonathan Ive, Burberry’s Christopher Bailey and Dolce &amp; Gabbana have decorated the Claridge’s tree. Hotel staff have thought of everything, they boast, from installing Christmas trees in every suite to providing stockings for children and adults to hang from the fireplaces. Martin Ballard, the head concierge who has been with Claridge’s for 30 years, even ensures there are sufficient mince pies and carrots for children to place on the mantelpiece for Father Christmas and his reindeer. Claridge’s, which heavily promotes its Christmas offering to rich overseas guests, declined to speak to the Guardian, with a spokeswoman citing the need to “maintain the level of discretion for our guests”. Andrew Love, the deputy chair of the Ritz, provided a tour of the 111-year-old, billionaire Barclay brothers-owned hotel, decorated with nearly 100 Christmas trees. “It’s all about families at the Ritz,” said Love, who has been with the hotel for nearly 20 years and knows many of the guests by sight. “We have Christmas carols every day.” Love was reluctant to speak about guests who stay at the hotel over Christmas. But he said most were British families who have been spending the festive period at the hotel for generations, some of whom “take over full suites of rooms”. “The truth is you have got families whose great grandfather has been coming to the hotel since 1906, and the great-great grandchildren still stay here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/14/golden-opportunity-lost-as-syrian-peace-talks-collapse","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T20:28:10Z","webTitle":"'Golden opportunity' lost as Syrian peace talks collapse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/golden-opportunity-lost-as-syrian-peace-talks-collapse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/14/golden-opportunity-lost-as-syrian-peace-talks-collapse","fields":{"headline":"'Golden opportunity' lost as Syrian peace talks collapse","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"UN-sponsored talks in Geneva designed to end the Syrian civil war have collapsed, with a deflated special envoy Staffan de Mistura admitting “a golden big opportunity” had been missed. He largely blamed the Syria government delegation for setting preconditions on holding direct talks with the opposition, saying it would be difficult for any future talks sponsor to make progress “if the government is not willing to meet anyone who has a different opinion”. He said the Syrian government delegation had refused to discuss two of the major potential agenda items – a constitutional process and presidential elections – insisting instead it would only discuss terrorism. The end of talks on Thursday leaves the Geneva process – now in its eighth round of talks – perilously shorn of credibility. De Mistura said he would report the outcome of the talks to the UN Security Council next week and would not stop trying. He said without pressure from President Bashar al-Assad’s sponsors Russia, or an implausible change on the battlefield, Assad felt no need to negotiate with a divided, and under-resourced opposition. As the Syrian government delegation resolutely refused to engage in Geneva, de Mistura had pleaded with the Russians to put more pressure on the government negotiators to start talks, but the Syrian government lead negotiator Bashar Ja’afari said it was not possible to talk to the opposition. He said a statement issued by a revamped opposition delegation team in Riyadh ahead of the talks demanded a political transition in which Assad did not participate. He said he would not negotiate under blackmail. De Mistura countered that apart from one mistaken statement by the opposition at Geneva, it had not set preconditions, and its call for Assad to stand aside ahead of UN supervised presidential elections was merely an expression of an opinion, and not a precondition. At one point Ja’afari accused de Mistura of misleading him by by putting the Syrian government delegation in a room adjacent to the opposition. The collapse of the talks leaves the political initiative to secure a political settlement now resting largely with President Vladimir Putin who has said he will convene a Syrian Congress of National Dialogue in the Black Sea resort of Sochi probably in February. The Syrian government will attend any Putin-sponsored talks especially if the still unknown composition of the congress dilutes the opposition attending the talks. In a bid to make itself a viable negotiating partner for the Syrian government, the opposition ahead of the talks had broadened its composition and diluted its platform. The Trump administration has taken little interest in a long term political settlement in Syria, with different members of the government giving different views on whether Assad can remain in office, or for how long. The UK remains committed to Assad’s removal on the basis that no sustainable political settlement or return of refugees is possible so long as he remains in power. The Sochi conference also faces difficulties since one of the co-sponsors, Turkey, has insisted it will not allow Syrian Kurds to attend the dialogue on the basis that they have links with Turkish Kurdish group, the PKK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/dec/14/teachers-must-never-dismiss-sexual-harassment-as-banter-government-says","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T20:56:05Z","webTitle":"Teachers warned not to dismiss sexual harassment as ‘banter’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/dec/14/teachers-must-never-dismiss-sexual-harassment-as-banter-government-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/dec/14/teachers-must-never-dismiss-sexual-harassment-as-banter-government-says","fields":{"headline":"Teachers warned not to dismiss sexual harassment as ‘banter’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Combating sexual harassment and violence among pupils requires teachers to be vigilant on and offline, according to the government’s long-awaited guidelines for schools and colleges. The advice covers responses to sexual misconduct between students, including those of the same sex, and warns school leaders they must be aware that sexual harassment is likely to be amplified by social media. The report says schools should make clear that “sexual violence and sexual harassment is not acceptable, will never be tolerated and is not an inevitable part of growing up”. It warns that schools risk normalising sexual harassment such as groping if it is tolerated or dismissed as “banter”, “part of growing up” or “boys being boys”. The guidelines recommend that leaders should keep victims and alleged perpetrators apart if they attend the same school, recognising long-standing complaints at the lack of an official policy. “Whilst the school or college establishes the facts of the case and starts the process of liaising with children’s social care and the police, the alleged perpetrator should be removed from any classes they share with the victim,” the document states. “The school or college should also consider how best to keep the victim and alleged perpetrator a reasonable distance apart on school or college premises and on transport to and from the school or college.” Teachers and politicians welcomed the guidelines, billed by the Department for Education as advice on “how to prevent and respond to reports of sexual violence and harassment between children”. Maria Miller, the chair of parliament’s women and equalities committee, said: “We are very pleased to see this advice for schools and colleges but the department needs to promote this widely so that it doesn’t just sit on their website. “It is well over a year since the committee called for the government and schools to make girls’ safety an immediate priority and this is a belated, but critical, step in the right direction.” A recent report found that more than one in three girls in mixed secondary schools said they have been sexually harassed while at school, and 24% have been subjected to unwanted physical touching of a sexual nature. The use of sexist or misogynistic language was also found to be widespread, with 66% of sixth-form students complaining they had heard sexist language in schools. “We have continued to hear distressing stories of girls being abused and harassed in schools around the country. We hope this advice will be a significant step on the road to schools being better equipped to respond,” Miller said, calling for data to be collected on incidents. The DfE’s advice says schools should recognise that sexual violence and harassment that continues online can spread across multiple social media platforms, and for the impact to extend far beyond a school’s immediate community. “Social media is very likely to play a central role in the fallout from any incident or alleged incident. There is the potential for contact between victim and alleged perpetrator and a very high likelihood that friends from either side could well harass the victim or alleged perpetrator online,” the report states. Teaching unions welcomed the report. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said schools needed to be allowed time to train teachers and engage students on issues related to sexual harassment and violence. “Teachers need to be empowered to identify the right strategies,” Courtney said. “Sexism is learned behaviour and school is a brilliant place to unlearn it, given the right conditions.” The new advice was published alongside a consultation on updated guidance for safeguarding in schools to include sexual harassment and violence. Robert Goodwill, the minister for children and families, said: “Schools and colleges should be safe places, and where there are incidents of abuse or harm it is vital that the young people involved are supported.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/19/mogadishu-market-bomb-somalia-militants-terror-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-19T18:00:00Z","webTitle":"Survivors of the Mogadishu market bomb: 'Our life is destroyed.

There is no more to say'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mogadishu is a famously resilient city. Once known across Africa and beyond as tranquil, relatively prosperous, cultured and cosmopolitan, successive waves of violence over decades have repeatedly reduced much of the city to rubble. It has been rebuilt, destroyed again and rebuilt. Six years ago, the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab withdrew from the city after fierce fighting. The rebuilding started once more. Now, at weekends, the beaches and restaurants of the Lido are packed with men and women, young and old. Returnees from the diaspora bring capital and skills. The stalls where women serve strong, spiced tea to garrulous elderly men in brightly checked traditional sarongs are busy. The famous Bakara bazaar is boisterous and lively. So, too, are local markets, full of local vegetables, fruit, cheap Chinese clothes and DVDs. One of these markets had grown up around K5, or Zoobe, Junction. On 14 October a massive truck bomb detonated among its shoppers, stalls, tailors, mechanics, computer stores, clothes shops and restaurants. Powerful enough to rip the front off buildings hundreds of metres away, the explosion killed more than 500 people and injured many more. It was the worst such attack in Somali history and one of the most lethal single terrorist acts since 9/11. The scars are still very raw; the consequences still to be fully understood. Idil Abdulle Yussuf, 32, lost her husband in the attack. A street vendor selling drinks just a few metres from where the bomb went off, his death is like “death to all the family”. “Our life is destroyed. There is no more to say. Hassan was everything to us. In the evening, when he returned home, he brought food, drinks and sweets for the children. We could pay the rent of the house. My kids went to school. Now there is nothing,” she says. The family, evicted from their home, now live in a rudimentary camp for the destitute and displaced, on the outskirts of the city: “I do not know what to do. I do not know what the future of my children will be without their father. Those who killed my husband also killed us. They have sentenced us to death.” Others, even if they survived the blast, lost their livelihoods. Mohamed Abshir Omey, a 35-year-old taxi driver, had his right leg amputated. “I was only discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and now I cannot drive. Even my name has changed because people call me Jeeri [Lame]”, he says. “I was planning to marry, so I used to keep some savings. All that money is gone now. My car was burnt. Nothing remains for me. October 14 is the day of the disaster which ruined my future.” Then there are the psychological effects on a city that, though it has long suffered violence, had never seen anything like the carnage of October. “People are more scared, compared with previous attacks,” says Abdirahman Hassan Omar, a lawyer and social activist who now tries to limit the time he spends moving around the city. “You never know when or where a bombing will happen. It is better to stay to home unless you have a very important job to do outside.” Mogadishu is not an easy place to make safe. Three million people live in its sprawling, scruffy neighbourhoods. Hundreds of thousands have arrived this year alone from rural areas. Most are very poor, fleeing drought and famine. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world, and senior officials admit that al-Shabaab has a strong presence. Few now have much trust in security forces. There are frequent shootings. One major attack came just two weeks after the October bombing. Al-Shaabab gunmen killed 23 people at a city hotel, after destroying the entrance with a truck bomb. Fadumo Omar Barrow, 23, survived the bombing but lost her sister Jija and four cousins. All were mothers, and returning from the fish market when the truck bomb hit their minibus. “The other four cousins were found dead but my sister’s body was never found. We only received body parts, which we thought were her remains and we buried them,” she says. Fadumo has abandoned plans to go to university and decided to leave the country “because it is not safe … My sister was my mentor. She helped me during my whole life. After her death, I do not want to stay in Somalia. I am planning to leave to immigrate abroad. A safer place. “I fear a lot ... I also try to escape the sad memory I have from the day of tragedy. My sister left three children behind; the eldest one, a three-year-old boy, continues to ask me: ‘Where is my mum?’ I still don’t know how to explain.” At the blast scene, construction workers labour to rebuild shattered buildings. A new road surface has been laid. A tea stall stands where the 48-room Safari hotel once stood. “This is part of the resilience we Somalis have,” says construction contractor Ahmed Ashur. “There is a blast in Mogadishu destroying whole buildings and you see the next day people start renovating. Life goes on. Those who died have died. We have to think about those who live now. They need life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/14/us-gives-evidence-iran-supplied-missiles-that-yemen-rebels-fired-at-saudi-arabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T20:00:33Z","webTitle":"US gives evidence Iran supplied missiles that Yemen rebels fired at Saudi Arabia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/us-gives-evidence-iran-supplied-missiles-that-yemen-rebels-fired-at-saudi-arabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/14/us-gives-evidence-iran-supplied-missiles-that-yemen-rebels-fired-at-saudi-arabia","fields":{"headline":"US gives evidence Iran supplied missiles that Yemen rebels fired at Saudi Arabia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The US has presented evidence that officials said proved that Iran had supplied short-range ballistic missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen which were then fired at Saudi Arabia. The US envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, made the presentation at Bolling Air Force base in Washington, which is the headquarters to the Defence Intelligence Agency. She said that the evidence would be used to convince Congress and UN member states of the threat to peace represented by Iranian missile proliferation in the Middle East. Haley said the supply of missiles to the Houthis was a violation of a UN resolution, but stressed that the US was not seeking to use the evidence as a reason to walk out of the 2015 multilateral agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme. “The nuclear deal is not something we are focused on now,” she told journalists. “Everything doesn’t have to be tied to the nuclear deal, but it does have to be tied to the security council resolution. Everybody has tiptoed around Iran in fear of them getting out of the nuclear deal and they are allowing missiles like this to be fired over to innocent civilians and hurt and that is what has to stop.” “So we will continue to build the international community’s support to say this is not about the nuclear deal. This is about all other actions and the president will work with Congress on how we go forward in dealing with Iran in this way.” Standing in front of segments of two missiles, which US officials say were fired recently by Houthi forces at Saudi Arabia, Haley said: “As you know we do not often declassify this time of military equipment recovered from these attacks but today we are taking an extraordinary step of presenting it here in an opening setting.” “In this warehouse is concrete evidence of illegal Iranian weapons proliferation gathered by direct military attacks on our partners in the regime,” she added, saying that representatives from other countries had been invited to inspect the evidence at Bolling. “The fight against Iranian aggression is the world’s fight. The US is acting today in the spirit of transparency and international cooperation that is necessary to defeat this threat.” The Iranian spokesman at the UN, Alireza Miryousefi, said the evidence was fake. He said: “We categorically reject it as unfounded and, at the same time, irresponsible, provocative and destructive. This purported evidence, put on public display today, is as much fabricated as the one presented on some other occasions earlier.” The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, used a tweet to compare Haley’s appearance to former secretary of state Colin Powell’s presentation of allegations of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction in 2003, that later proved groundless. “When I was based at the UN, I saw this show and what it begat,” Zarif said in a tweet, accompanied by side-side photos of Haley and Zarif. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, submitted a report to the security council saying that there was evidence that Iran was supplying ballistic missiles to Houthi rebels in defiance of UN resolution 2231, and that the UN was investigating. However, in the report, Guterrres stressed that the nuclear deal remained the “best way” to ensure the exlusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. He said Donald Trump’s decision in October not to certify the nuclear agreement under US law created “considerable uncertainty” about its future. But he added: “I am reassured that the United States has expressed its commitment to stay in [the deal].” Saudi Arabia welcomed the UN report and Haley’s comments, calling on the international community to “hold the Iranian regime accountable for its hostile actions,” according to state news agency SPA. “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia welcomes the UN report that asserted that the hostile Iranian intervention and its support for the terrorist Houthi militia with advanced and dangerous missile capabilities threatens the security and stability of the kingdom and the region,” SPA said. The US says that the two missiles on display were recovered from Saudi Arabia. One was aimed at Riyadh airport and the other fell in the west of the country. Haley said that they were Qiam missiles that had been directly supplied by Iran. She pointed to the absence of fins and an arrangement of nine valves on the missiles, which she said were characteristic of the Qiam. US officials also said that the missile body was made of aluminum alloy and not steel, a fact that weapons experts said pointed to the missiles being Qiams rather than the more rudimentary Scud C of the sort North Korea is known to have delivered to Yemen in 2002. “When they made the Qiam, the Iranians replaced the steel with aluminum, so the material of construction is interesting,” Michael Elleman, a missile expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said. “If it is aluminum, then it’s almost certainly the Qiam. That suggests the entire missile was transferred rather than just some parts.” Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said that North Korea had also used aluminum in its version of Scud C, but is very unlikely to have supplied that updated version to the Houthis. “I’m reasonably persuaded that these are Iranian,” Lewis said. “But this is still a short-range ballistic missile, under 1,000 km. It’s comparable to the kind of things we give to our proxies.” The Saudi-led coalition leading the fight against the Houthis in Yemen, which has been supplied with weaponry by the US, the UK and other allies, has been accused of the indiscriminate killing of civilians through its aerial bombing campaign and by its blockade of rebel-controlled areas of the country. The World Food Programme (WFP) says 17 million Yemenis (60% of the population) are food insecure, of whom 7 million are severely so. The WFP chief, David Beasley, told CNN: “Give us the access we need so innocent people can feed their families and stay alive. We need all the help we can get.” The UK foreign office accepts the intelligence in the UN-provided report does imply Iran supplied missiles to Houthis, confirming this in the Commons last week. But British officials are deeply concerned that the US push to impose wider sanctions on Iran for breaches of UN resolutions relating to Yemen could endanger the 2015 nuclear deal, potentially by goading Tehran to walk out of the agreement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/dec/14/nasa-find-first-alien-solar-system-with-as-many-worlds-as-our-own-kepler-google","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T08:37:41Z","webTitle":"Nasa find first alien solar system with as many planets as our own","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/14/nasa-find-first-alien-solar-system-with-as-many-worlds-as-our-own-kepler-google","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/dec/14/nasa-find-first-alien-solar-system-with-as-many-worlds-as-our-own-kepler-google","fields":{"headline":"Nasa find first alien solar system with as many planets as our own","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Scientists on Nasa’s Kepler mission have spotted an eighth planet around a distant star, making it the first alien solar system known to host as many planets as our own. The newfound world orbits a star named Kepler 90 which is larger and hotter than the sun and lies 2,500 light years from Earth in the constellation of Draco. Known as Kepler 90i, the freshly-discovered world is smallest of the eight now known to circle the star, and while it is probably rocky, it is a third larger than Earth and searingly hot at more than 420C. “This ties Kepler 90 with our own solar system for having the most known planets,” said Paul Hertz, director of astrophysics at Nasa’s headquarters in Washington DC. Researchers on the Kepler planet-hunting telescope discovered Kepler 90i when they teamed up with artificial intelligence specialists at Google to analyse data collected by the space-based observatory. The Kepler telescope hunts for alien worlds by detecting the shadows planets cast as they orbit their parent stars. When a planet passes in front of its star, the telescope detects a minuscule dimming in light, which for an Earth-sized planet circling a sun-like star, can mean a fall in luminosity of a mere 0.01%. Kepler has observed 150,000 stars to date and already discovered more than 4,000 candidate planets, of which about 2,300 have been confirmed. Astronomers now suspect at least one planet orbits every star in the sky. For all their success with Kepler, Nasa scientists knew that more planets lay hidden in the telescope’s observations, but the signals were so weak they were difficult to spot. This is where Google’s AI researchers came in. By training a neural network to learn what bona fide signals of distant planets looked like, Christopher Shallue, a Google researcher, helped Nasa to scour Kepler’s observations of 670 stars for planets that had previously been missed. The search turned up two new planets around different stars, Kepler 90i, and another world named Kepler 80g, the sixth planet now known to orbit its star. The scientists now plan to search Kepler’s data on all 150,000 stars for other missed planets. A research paper on the findings will be published by the Astronomical Journal. Suzanne Aigrain, an astrophysicist at Oxford University who was not involved with the research, said: “What is perhaps most exciting is that they are able to find planets that were previously missed, suggesting there are more yet to be found using this approach.” Earlier this year, Kepler scientists announced the discovery of 219 more candidate planets, of which 10 appeared to be about the same size and temperature as Earth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/dec/22/the-bull-hotel-fairford-the-cotswolds-gloucestershire-review","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-22T10:00:50Z","webTitle":"The Bull Hotel, Fairford, the Cotswolds: review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/22/the-bull-hotel-fairford-the-cotswolds-gloucestershire-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/dec/22/the-bull-hotel-fairford-the-cotswolds-gloucestershire-review","fields":{"headline":"The Bull Hotel, Fairford, the Cotswolds: review","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There’s something inherently festive about the Cotswolds: all chocolate-box villages, ancient churches, and pretty pubs with open fires for warming up after a frosty countryside stomp. Kate Moss and her posse have been known to enjoy a spot of Christmas Eve cheer at the Five Alls in Filkins – a pub with rooms run by chef/proprietor Sebastian Snow and his wife Lana, which sparkles at this time of year. The couple’s latest venture – The Bull Hotel at Fairford – adds another string to their bow (they also run The Plough at Kelmscott). Owned by Arkell’s brewery, the handsome stone building on the market square was originally two coaching inns, dating to the 15th century. It reopened in March after a major refurbishment, with the Snows at the helm, breathing new life into a historic hotel. We arrive on a dark, rainy winter’s afternoon and although the Bull is a big place, the ambiance is instantly cosy. There’s a theatricality to the decor – a dramatic palette of green-black, burnt orange and teal with antique furniture, gilt mirrors and a copper-topped bar – so I’m not surprised to discover that the public spaces were created by Lana’s set designer friend Corina Burrough (whose credits include The King’s Speech and Downton Abbey). A huge, horned bull’s head hangs over one of several fireplaces and a sense of history pervades, with exposed beams, winding stairs and old framed photos and memorabilia. The 21 bedrooms (by the brewery’s in-house designer) have a calmer white and grey scheme, lovely fabrics and quality bed linens. Each is different: two have freestanding baths, number 12 has a tiny doorway you have to duck through, and there are two spacious family suites. For dining there’s a choice of spaces: the pub, the main Stables Restaurant with banquets and pizza oven, or a smaller, romantic area beyond the striking lounge, which we opt for. The menu covers all bases, with stonebaked pizzas, pub classics and finer British-Mediterranean food (Sebastian’s mother is Italian). Carpaccio of tuna with avocado, lime and ginger dressing is melt-in-the-mouth delicious; the twice-baked double Gloucester cheese soufflé is creamy and fluffy (both £7.95). A roulade of hake with mussels, spinach and new potatoes is fresh and light, and mallard “two ways” comes with chestnuts and rosti potatoes (both £17). For pre- or post-dinner drinks, the bar serves cask ales by Arkell’s including 3B Moonlight and Wiltshire Gold and there’s a decent cocktail list, too. We emerge next morning to join the Sunday paper readers enjoying breakfast, while the staff ready the Bull Room, a private dining area with its own bar, for a big rugby match on TV. A generous continental buffet is included in the price, but if you want anything cooked it will cost you – £10 for the full English, £9 for eggs Benedict. Fairford has a military base, from where Concorde took its maiden flight, but it’s main claim to fame is its church, St Mary’s, which has the finest complete set of medieval stained glass windows in England. The congregation is just leaving as we pop in to check out the nave before we stroll down to the Coln river which skirts the village. The Bull has fishing rights to a mile-long stretch of it, great for trout and grayling year-round. It’s a bit nippy for hanging about by the water today though, so we scurry inside to defrost by the fire, plotting a summer return, before heading home. A pub like this, after all, is not just for Christmas... • Accommodation was provided by The Bull Hotel, 01285 712535, thebullhotelfairford.co.uk.

As gay and bisexual men and women were making limited strides in the struggle for equality not so long ago, a furious backlash followed. Today’s media-driven moral panic over trans people and their rights seems like history repeating itself. Over the past few weeks, there have been almost daily articles in the press targeting trans rights and trans people. The tropes are the same. Back then, gay people were sexual predators; a “gay lobby” was brainwashing children; being gay was a mental illness, or just a phase; and gay rights was political correctness gone mad. Replace “gay” with “trans”, and that’s the state of the British press in 2017. A Daily Telegraph front page this week was headlined “‘Trans’ survey for 10-year-olds”. The article took issue with the NHS for asking whether children were “comfortable in their gender”. And so we’re back to the 1980s arguments behind Section 28, which barred the “promotion” of homosexuality in schools. As Margaret Thatcher put it: “Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay.” In 1986 the press united in outrage at a picture book called Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin, about a five-year-old girl who lived with her father and his partner. It was falsely claimed that the book was being distributed to children – a single copy had been purchased for the use of teachers – but the point of the exercise was clear: children were being corrupted by the gay agenda, and could even be turned gay simply by discussing homosexuality. And so history repeats itself. Consider these recent headlines. “The transgender zealots are destroying truth itself”, screeched the Mail on Sunday. “The skirt on the drag queen goes swish swish swish”, wailed the Sun, adding “Trans classes for kids age 2” for good measure. “Church: let little boys wear tiaras”, howled the Daily Mail, describing “New advice on transgender bullying for C of E schoolteachers”. It’s worth considering the impact of this. Media anti-gay onslaughts helped legitimise and reinforce a hostile environment for gay and bisexual people. This had two consequences: it made a minority already disproportionately affected by mental distress feel even more misery, knowing that they were widely detested, feared and ridiculed; and it emboldened homophobic bigots who felt their hatred had official sanction. In today’s Britain, eight in 10 trans young people report self-harm and nearly half have tried to kill themselves. How is a minority so afflicted with transphobia-induced mental distress supposed to feel with this relentless media campaign? Note that 64% of trans school pupils have been bullied for their gender identity; and 38% of trans people have suffered physical intimidation. Are their persecutors likely to feel more, or less, empowered by this media offensive? “Children sacrificed to appease trans lobby” was the headline on an opinion piece in the Times, conjuring up both the image of child sacrifice, and implying that trans people – one of the most marginalised minorities in Britain – wield sinister, disproportionate power. The pejorative use of “the gay lobby” is now widely accepted to be a statement of bigotry – how then is “the trans lobby” any different? The object of the article’s ire was the rise in referrals of teenagers to gender clinics; it claimed that “butch” lesbians were being pressured to transition to men. But as Ruth Hunt – chief executive of Stonewall, a champion of trans rights and a self-identifying butch lesbian – puts it, “very few people who access support go on to transition”. The increase was down to more young people discussing gender identity, as attitudes become more accepting. Undoubtedly, though, more are coming out as trans: the same happened with gay and bisexual young people. This month the Australian MP Bob Katter preposterously claimed that gay people had only existed for 60 years: the reality is that, as homophobia began to be rolled back, more men and women felt able to come out. A 19-year-old trans woman, Lily Madigan, was hounded after being elected women’s officer at her local Labour party. Online trolls were spurred on by the media coverage: “I’ve had people hoping I commit suicide and calling me horrid things like dickhead and freak.” This should shame the media; it probably won’t. In the US, opposition to trans rights has been spearheaded by the Republican right, who in many states have introduced “bathroom bills” to ban trans people from using toilets that match their gender identity. At the same time, though a new wave of feminism stresses its trans inclusivity, there are self-described progressives who claim that support for trans rights is driven by misogyny. Women feel threatened by trans women using female toilets, goes the argument. Yet, according to the British Social Attitudes survey, 58% of women say prejudice against trans people is “always wrong”, 12 points higher than for men; and 72% of women say they are “very” or “quite” comfortable with a trans woman using a female toilet – compared with 64% of men who feel similarly about trans men in male toilets. Transphobia is, disproportionately, a male problem. The main driver for the current backlash is the government’s proposals – backed by Labour – to reform the Gender Recognition Act, which currently imposes a degrading, bureaucratic, medicalised two-year process on trans people before a panel can grant a gender recognition certificate. The plan is to move in line with countries, such as Ireland, that have a process of self-identification. But, goes the argument, this will mean men falsely declaring themselves as women to invade women’s spaces and harass women – even though in countries that have adopted this system, such as Argentina (where it has been in place for years), such cases have simply not materialised. Opponents of trans rights are losing, and they know it, hence the viciousness. There are brilliant trans voices emerging – like Shon Faye, Paris Lees and Munroe Bergdorf – but the media surely have a responsibility to provide a greater platform. And just as gay rights was once seen as the preserve of the “loony left”, trans people are desperately lacking in influential media allies. History is a savage judge of those who resisted the onward march of gay rights. I doubt it will be less damning of those who bitterly fight trans rights. • Owen Jones is a Guardian writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/23/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-invisible-immigration","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T13:58:00Z","webTitle":"The invisible wall: how Trump is slowing immigration without laying a brick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/23/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-invisible-immigration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/23/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-invisible-immigration","fields":{"headline":"The invisible wall: how Trump is slowing immigration without laying a brick","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump has failed to add another inch to the country’s border wall between the US and Mexico, but his administration this year has quietly erected a steep, invisible wall that limits migration to the US, according to interviews with lawyers and refugee groups. Some of these roadblocks received considerable attention, like the three versions of a travel ban on people from Muslim-majority countries and the cancellation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) – an Obama-era program that protected undocumented youth raised in the US. But the Trump administration also appears to have orchestrated a more subtle attack on immigration that touches the most vulnerable populations, like refugees, as well as powerful business people who work in the US. “I think that they’re basically hoping that five years from now we see a significant decrease in the number of people who even want to come,” Sandra Feist, an immigration lawyer in Minnesota, told the Guardian. “I think if we keep this up, that’s what we’ll see.” Feist, who has worked in immigration law for 16 years and is a part of the American Immigration Lawyers Association media and advocacy committee, said a slew of small administrative changes have drastically slowed the visa process. This includes things such as increased scrutiny of the H-1B visa for people in specialty occupations and a new requirement that people seeking employer-sponsored green cards be interviewed. For all visas, immigration lawyers have also seen an increase in challenges, or requests for evidence, from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversees immigration. When Trump was elected, Feist anticipated Congress would move to change immigration law, but she said she did not expect interference with the administrative process. “I don’t think I expected them to attack my high-skilled immigration process so aggressively,” Feist said. “I also was not prepared for the ways in which they used the administrative processes so skillfully to create very real hurdles and barriers in ways that didn’t require any changes in the law.” A concern for immigration lawyers is the direction of the USCIS under its new ombudsman, Julie Kirchner, who for 10 years was director of Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that has advocated extreme restrictions on immigration. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) called for her removal in May. “We do not believe that a person who has spent over a decade attacking immigrant communities will now work effectively and thoughtfully to advance the rights of immigrants and fulfill the important duties that are required of this role,” the CHC said. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees USCIS, said it does not comment on congressional correspondence to secretaries. The changes at USCIS have hit the key pillars of immigration in the US: employer and family-based, where citizens or a green card holder sponsor a family member’s green card application. Trump has said he wants to replace family-based immigration, which he calls chain migration, with a merit-based system. Trump has also called for Congress to terminate the diversity lottery program, which awards 50,000 visas to people vetted by the same process as other visas. “The lottery system and chain migration – we are going to end them fast. Congress must get involved immediately, and they are involved immediately, and I can tell you we have tremendous support, they will be ended,” Trump said last week. In the meantime, programs to help people fleeing natural disasters, violence and persecution have either been cancelled or slowed by bureaucratic hurdles under Trump. In July, advocates filed a lawsuit that accused DHS and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of putting asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border in grave danger by threatening, misleading or rejecting them. The agencies do not comment publicly on litigation. Trump appointees have also dramatically shifted how the federal government speaks about asylum, going as far as to suggest in public communications the unproven claim that asylum is a routinely abused legal loophole. “We also have dirty immigration lawyers who are encouraging their otherwise unlawfully present clients to make false claims of asylum providing them with the magic words needed to trigger the credible fear process,” the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said in October. USCIS said it does not have data that shows widespread abuse of the asylum system. The Department of Justice, which Session heads, directed the Guardian to five press releases and one news story about immigration fraud. None of these cases demonstrated abuse of the asylum system – though a Bosnian was found to have lied about his involvement in the country’s civil war in order to obtain refugee status. Three of the fraud schemes were orchestrated fully, or in part, by Americans. This year, the administration has also gone after a program that grants temporary status to people affected by events like natural disasters or conflict: Temporary Protected Status (TPS). In November, TPS was terminated for more than 50,000 Haitians and 5,300 Nicaraguans who must leave by 2019 or face deportation. The largest group of (TPS) recipients, Salvadorans who fled their home country after it was struck by earthquakes in 2001, are waiting to hear whether their protection will be extended before it expires in January. And the White House made refugees one if its primary targets a week after Trump took office, when he issued an executive order blocking refugees from entry in the first travel ban. In September, the White House restricted refugee admissions in 2018 to 45,000 people – the lowest ceiling since the president began capping refugee admissions in 1980. Unlike the smaller administrative changes to immigration processing being made in federal agencies, the travel ban was easily challenged in courts and deemed unconstitutional. The supreme court, however, allowed the third version of the travel ban to be enforced this month while it faces multiple legal challenges. This version does not block refugees, but does bar most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, Venezuela and North Korea from entering the US. Hans Van de Weerd, vice-president of US programs at the International Rescue Committee (IRC), said US efforts to restrict refugee admissions signals to other countries that it is OK to kick out refugees. “It makes the global challenge of offering protection to refugees so much bigger,” Van de Weerd told the Guardian. The Trump administration has also suspended refugee programs such as the Central American Minors program, which allowed parents lawfully in the US to bring their minor children to the country – IRC estimated the program protected nearly 2,700 people last year. And administrative hurdles like expanded security checks and paperwork requirements have put a further burden on an already slow system where cases can take up to 200 days to clear. “The country’s reputation as a beacon of safety and the values of this nation are really about offering protection to those who are in danger,” said Van de Weerd. “The US is losing that reputation.” Despite the piling of bricks in the virtual wall, Van de Weerd said IRC remained hopeful because the administration’s efforts inspired support for groups that help immigrants and refugees. “We’ve seen a massive interest from the private sector in resettlement and an increase in private donors,” said Van der Weerd. “We see businesses standing up and saying we want to employ people. We’ve had a hard time managing the huge inflows of volunteers.” He wasn’t sure if the energy would turn the tide, but it gave him hope as IRC prepares to push for more resettlements and improve the attitude towards refugees next year. Van der Weed said: “This whole situation has forced people to make clear where they stand.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/15/mother-superior-its-been-a-great-year-for-onscreen-mums","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Mother superior: it’s been a great year for on-screen mums","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/15/mother-superior-its-been-a-great-year-for-onscreen-mums","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/15/mother-superior-its-been-a-great-year-for-onscreen-mums","fields":{"headline":"Mother superior: it’s been a great year for on-screen mums","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"At a screening I went to recently, one of the biggest laughs came when the lead character, a 58-year-old grieving mother, drilled a small hole into the hand of a dentist. No, not nice. But honestly, he was being inexcusably patronising. The film was the Oscar-buzzy Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and the grieving mother was Mildred Hayes, played by Frances McDormand at her finest since Fargo. Mildred’s daughter was raped and murdered seven months earlier. Furious at the police’s failure to arrest the killer, she rents three billboards the size of double-decker buses outside her small town, Ebbing, Missouri, to shame the local sheriff (Woody Harrelson) into action. Her signs read: “Raped while dying.” “Still no arrests.” “How come, Chief Willoughby?” Mildred is a mother on a mission. Everyone has a mum. Films are full of them. The problem is a lack of variety. Movie mothers tend to be monsters (Mommie Dearest, Carrie, Precious, Animal Kingdom), angels (Bambi, The Grapes of Wrath) or just a bit nothing-y (pretty much everything else). That, however, could be changing. While 2017 has been an awful year for women in film in most respects, it has thrown up a riot – or whatever the collective noun for mums ought to be – of complex on-screen mothers. Top of the pile is Mildred. When In Bruges director Martin McDonagh started writing his firecracker script eight years ago, he couldn’t have predicted the relevance of his storyline about a woman attempting (tragically after the fact) to protect her daughter from a sexual predator. But after a year of women being angry because of men, here comes Mildred striding on to the horizon like an avenging angel lobbing molotov cocktails. Like a lot of gritty heroines, she is far from perfect. Her moral compass is skewed, and Chief Willoughby is not one of the bad guys. When he says he would do anything to catch her daughter’s killer, you believe him. McDonagh recently told the New York Times that he wanted the character to be flawed. “We didn’t want to do anything to make her more likable or lovable. For once, we don’t have to show the female side or the light side or the nurturing, mothering side.” Showing the “nurturing, mothering side” in all its complexity is what actor-turned-director Greta Gerwig does in her solo directorial debut Lady Bird (in UK cinemas 23 February), a movie in which a mother lobs molotov cocktails of the emotional variety. The film’s working title was Mothers and Daughters, and it’s loosely based on Gerwig’s teenage years in suburban California, the film stars Saoirse Ronan as 17-year-old Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson, with Laurie Metcalf as her tough-love mum Marion. Unlike most coming-of-age stories, which focus on boys, Lady Bird’s central love story is mother-daughter. Hollywood has always been lacking in epic mother-and-daughter stories. But with “mum” no longer a pejorative term (“mom jeans” = Vogue-approved denim choice), planet film is catching on to the excellent-ness of mothers. Lady Bird opens with Lady Bird throwing herself out of the passenger seat of a moving car being driven by her mum. Two seconds earlier, the pair are bonding over an audiobook of The Grapes of Wrath, silently crying at exactly the same line. But that somehow turns into a blazing row. “You’re infuriating!” Gerwig doesn’t pull any punches. The relationship is a battlefield. Marion wants the best for Lady Bird, but her anxiety mostly manifests in criticism and irritation. She witheringly tells Lady Bird that she doesn’t have a hope in hell of getting into a prestigious arts university. For Lady Bird, these are the “I hate you” years. With strops and slammed doors, she rejects her mum, while at the same time searching for her approval. My favourite bit of dialogue in a film brimming with brilliant dialogue, goes: Lady Bird: “Why don’t you like me?” Marion: “I love you.” Lady Bird: “But do you like me?” Silence. Gerwig has talked about Marion and Lady Bird being two sides of the same coin. In an interview with Pop Sugar, she described the fraught relationship between teenage girls and their mums: “It’s almost like something chemical happens where you just fight in this way. You’re so similar, and you’re being pulled apart, and I think that makes it more complicated. Because they know that they’re losing you. So there’s this intensity to it that’s unlike anything else.” By the end of the movie, Lady Bird and Marion know each other more deeply than before, taking their first steps into an adult relationship. It’s like 90 minutes of therapy. How about monstrous moms? This year has certainly been awash with dysfunctional ones. Mother!, Darren Aronofsky’s bizarre film, stars Jennifer Lawrence as, well who, exactly? Mother Nature giving birth to the messiah? It would take five margaritas and a smoke of something behind the bike shed to work out where Mother! sits in cinema’s mothers canon. The most monstrous mother is yet to come. I, Tonya (in UK cinemas in February) turns the fall of disgraced US Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding into a black comedy. Harding was implicated in 1994 in the knee-capping of her arch skating rival Nancy Kerrigan. Allison Janney is already being talked about for an Oscar for her performance as LaVona Golden, Harding’s pushy stage mom. Golden has been called the nastiest movie mum since Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest. She’s a hard-drinking, chain-smoking, throwing-a-knife-at-her-daughter villain. But Janney is on LaVona’s side, as she explained to Vice: “She worked very hard to get herself out of the life she was in. Then she had this daughter with this talent, so every penny she made working as a waitress went to Tonya’s skating. She was going to make sure she rose to the top, despite all the odds, because the skating world did not embrace her.” One of the most depressing things about reading the allegations of sexual harassment in Hollywood has been the realisation: so this is how (some of) the men in the industry I write about think about women. Films are meant to allow us to enter into the life of someone else, to help us empathise. But to these men, female lives are meaningless. For them, women are objects. (“Take your clothes off.” “Put this in your mouth.” “I’m going to do this to you.”) Seeing the mothers and daughters in these films feels so important now. But the cinema matriarch I truly lost my heart to this year was Halley, the 21-year-old single mum played by newcomer Bria Vinaite in Sean Baker’s The Florida Project. If I saw Halley and her six-year-daughter Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) on the bus, I would probably scowl with disapproval. Halley gives Moonee fast food for lunch, giggles when she swears and lets her run rampage. I would judge her. Maybe not after seeing The Florida Project, which tells a story behind the statistic that in the US, 35% of single-mother families live below the poverty line. Halley and Moonee are among the hidden homeless, renting $30-a-night motels in Florida within a mouse’s whisker of Disney World – “the happiest place on earth”. If you do the maths, Halley was 15 or 16 when she had Moonee. Now, at 21, she is parenting with no money and no safety net, and yet she loves Moonee with an unwavering, self-sacrificing love. Like angry Mildred in Three Billboards, she is a mother we needed to see in 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/18/if-men-respected-certain-boundaries-we-would-see-less-violence-against-women","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T21:29:31Z","webTitle":"'If men respected certain boundaries, we would see less violence against women' | Amal Ben Hadda and Johanna Higgs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/if-men-respected-certain-boundaries-we-would-see-less-violence-against-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/18/if-men-respected-certain-boundaries-we-would-see-less-violence-against-women","fields":{"headline":"'If men respected certain boundaries, we would see less violence against women'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Johanna: Amal and I met on a trip to Morocco when I was visiting the city of Casablanca. I come from Australia, a western country, and Amal grew up in Morocco, which is a traditional Muslim country. Even with incredibly different cultural backgrounds, we share many beliefs, especially when it comes to bringing to an end harmful acts of violence against women, like sexual harassment. We decided that we wanted to write together and share our thoughts on the shared difficulties that we have faced as women and where we both want to see change. While I argued sexual freedom is essential for improving women’s rights, Amal had a different perspective and thought that more sexual freedom would only lead to more male irresponsibility. My question to Amal is, why is sex outside of marriage considered such a terrible thing? Amal: In Morocco, we are not supposed to have sexual freedom yet men have more sexual freedom then women. Sex outside marriage is considered a terrible thing only for women. Some men justify their right to sexual freedom based on the fact that they are born male. For them, women are supposed to keep their chastity and should hold higher ethical standards than men. If a woman has sex outside of marriage this often results in women, very unfairly, being rejected by their family members while men are not made to take any responsibility for their actions. Some traditional families consider having sex outside of marriage by their female relatives a dishonour for the family. This gives men more freedom to have sex outside of marriage but also to insult and stigmatise women who do the same. Johanna: A couple of years ago when I was doing a project in Argentina on human trafficking, I met a lawyer who was working on sex trafficking issues . He said, “Violence against women will not stop until women have the same sexual rights as men.” I completely agree with this. Most forms of violence and discrimination against women are centred around controlling women’s sexual behaviour, as in the case of honour killings where they justify killing women on the basis that she has engaged in sexual activity. Or when men justify violence by saying that a woman “deserves” to be harassed because she is too sexual. If women had sexual freedom, then men wouldn’t be able to justify so much violence against women. Amal: I believe that sexual relationships should happen through marriage. If men don’t make this commitment, then they have the freedom to run away and leave the mothers alone with their children. For example, in Morocco sex outside marriage is illegal and socially unacceptable but it happens. As a result, there are many babies who are abandoned just because society rejects single mothers and their children. Mothers and children are entitled to inheritance. If the man dies and there is no agreement between the families like marriage, then how can a child born out of wedlock be recognised in the status of a son or a daughter and the inheritance can be fairly shared? I think that women and children rights won’t be improved by allowing freedom in sexual relationships. When women ask for sexual freedom in relationships, then they are just helping men to get rid of their obligations. Johanna: Some of the things that you’ve mentioned [with sexual rights] have a lot to do with culture. If I use Australia as an example, there is sexual freedom, so everyone can chose their sexual partners and they can change them if they want to. Women are free to have as many boyfriends as they want, to choose their husband, to divorce their husband, and through all of this, if a man and a woman have a child together then the man is absolutely expected to care for his child. It’s socially unacceptable for a man to abandon his children and if he did, then I think most people would look at him badly. Also, if the parents are not together, then legally he is required to pay money to the mother to take care of the child. So I think it’s rare that men completely abandon their children, though it could happen. So you can definitely have sexual freedom for both men and women and still have men required to be responsible for their children. If there is a strong culture in place, along with a strong legal framework that insists that men take responsibility for their children, then it works. I know the problem of fatherless children is a problem in many countries. Latin America for example, there is a big problem of men abandoning their children. I noticed that this seems to be due to a lack of cultural pressure on men to care of their children as well as poverty and a general lack of respect for women. So in order to make men responsible for their children, then you have to make it culturally and legally required for them to be so. Amal: It’s important to consider the surrounding culture before asking for the same sexual rights as the ones existing in countries like Australia. In Morocco 2017, there are still men who deny that their children are theirs, even with DNA tests. Single mothers are in a vulnerable situation because the law clearly states that biological fathers are not required to take care of their children if they are born outside of marriage. Moreover, when single pregnant women go to the hospital to give birth, then they can be put in jail for having sex outside marriage. The justice system is discriminatory towards single mothers and this lowers the social status of women. In this context, giving men sexual freedom allows them the freedom to sexually harass women while making women responsible for what these men are doing. So we need to put boundaries around men’s sexual behaviour socially and legally. If these boundaries are respected by men, then I don’t think that we will have issues with women’s rights. Johanna: I agree that if men respected certain boundaries, then we would see less violence against women. However I think it’s only when we get rid of sexual constraints on women that we are going to see an improvement in women’s rights. Some of the most uncomfortable countries I have travelled in are the ones where there is no sexual freedom. The sexual harassment is horrible. When a woman’s sexuality is tightly controlled, then it’s assumed that she can be harassed, disrespected or raped should she in any way, shape or form be “too” sexual – whether this be because of her clothing, where she is walking or if she goes out at night. In countries where there is more sexual freedom for women, then the situation of women’s rights is usually much, much better – mostly because men behave better. Men can’t use a woman’s behaviour as an excuse to sexually harass or justify violence against her. We also have to change what is “normal”. We have to make it normal that women are respected regardless of their sexual behaviour and we have to make it normal that men are expected to be responsible towards their children. So do you agree that women should have the same rights to sexual freedom as men? Amal: I believe in equality. There should be no sexual double standards between men and women. If there are rules about no sex outside of marriage, then this should be applicable to both men and women. If a particular society believes in sexual freedom, then obviously both men and women should enjoy it. I believe that there should be restrictions on sexual freedom for the reason that I mentioned, so children can have full access to their rights from both parents. So for me, sexual relationships should only take place if there is an official agreement like civil or religious marriage. • Amal Ben Hadda is an IT engineer.

Polls suggest the Liberal John Alexander is the favourite, but the seat is very much still in play. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, acknowledged it was a “very, very close contest” when he and Alexander met voters at Gladesville Public School on Saturday morning. “Australia’s security and prosperity depends on John Alexander being back part of our government, delivering more than 1000 jobs a day,” Turnbull said. Keneally declared she was feeling “energised” by the campaign before handing out how-to-vote cards at Ryde East Public School. “There has never been a more important vote in Bennelong,” she told reporters. “Indeed the people of Australia are looking around at Bennelong, looking at this seat and wishing they were having their chance to have a say on this government.” Bennelong has historically favoured the Liberals. Labor famously won the seat from John Howard in 2007, but it has otherwise elected Liberals at every election since its creation in 1949. During Howard’s time, the seat shifted west, away from the north shore, and the area became much more diverse. The seat became more marginal, but it still definitely leans to the Liberals. The 2001 census recorded that 10% of the seat’s population was born in China, Hong Kong or South Korea – that number had grown to 20.8% in the 2016 census. Bennelong is ranked 13th out of 150 electorates in terms of the proportion of the population who don’t speak English at home. Alexander won a third term in 2016 with a 9.7% margin. National polls suggest a national swing to Labor of up to 5%, but byelections often see larger swings. A 10% swing is definitely achievable. There have been four polls in Bennelong – two gave Alexander a lead of 3%, while the other two had the race tied. Seat polling is not a perfect science, but these polls suggest a sizeable swing to Labor. Trying to make a more precise prediction risks leaving egg on your face. Twelve candidates are running – a large field but not that unusual for a prominent federal byelection. In addition to Keneally and Alexander, there should be a significant vote for the Greens, and possibly for Cory Bernardi’s new Australian Conservatives party, who are competing with the Christian Democratic Party on the right. Greens preferences should favour Labor, while you would expect the Conservatives and the CDP to favour the Liberal. The electorate is centred on the Ryde council area and Epping, north of the Parramatta river. The Liberal vote is highest in areas such as Putney, Eastwood and Epping. The western end of the electorate, including Eastwood and Epping, tends to be more multicultural, while the suburbs closer to the north shore are less so. There has been a great deal of speculation about whether these multicultural communities, particularly those of Chinese and Korean backgrounds, may abandon the Liberals. The government may have lost support with its citizenship legislation, and more recently its loud attacks on Labor and Sam Dastyari for his links to Chinese donors. But it would be foolish to assume these communities are monolithic and will all vote the same way. Larger swings in the multicultural western end of the seat could indicate that parts of the Chinese and Korean communities have moved away from the Liberals. This byelection will play a big role in either solidifying or destabilising the Turnbull government – a win restores its majority, while a loss will leave it relying on the crossbench for support. This will be a factor for the voters – they are not simply choosing a local representative, but also determining the fate of a government. Will it govern with a majority, or limp along until the next election? There is no particular reason to think people are more likely to vote Labor due to Alexander’s citizenship troubles. Past byelections triggered by section 44 eligibility problems have generally resulted in the ousted member being returned, usually with an increased vote. But voters clearly have other reasons to consider switching to Labor – national polling has put Labor in a clear lead in almost every poll since the last election, and electing a Labor MP in this traditional Liberal seat would send a very clear signal that this government is probably nearing its end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/29/can-the-british-man-who-saved-torontos-subway-help-new-york-city","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-29T12:00:31Z","webTitle":"Can the British man who saved Toronto's subway help New York City?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/29/can-the-british-man-who-saved-torontos-subway-help-new-york-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/29/can-the-british-man-who-saved-torontos-subway-help-new-york-city","fields":{"headline":"Can the British man who saved Toronto's subway help New York City?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Sixteen years ago, former New York transport boss Bob Kiley was recruited from across the pond to rescue the London Underground “New York Tough Guy to Run Tube,” announced the Evening Standard. Now the reverse is happening. Andy Byford – who grew up in Plymouth and is a veteran of Transport for London, Sydney’s RailCorp and the Toronto Transit Commission – arrives to take on New York’s rammed and creaking transport system, which this year suffered a “summer of hell”. Long-deferred repairs wrought havoc on the already overburdened system, leaving passengers stranded on sweltering platforms and captive in immobilized subway cars. During his time in Toronto, Byford rode the rails and buses every day alongside customers, wearing a conspicuous name tag and fielding questions and complaints about the service. He seems likely to get plenty of both in New York, whose passengers are not shy about giving their views on the state of the subway. “That’s the job, and I expect to be held to account,” Byford told the Guardian, confirming he would keep up his pattern of traveling on the system he runs. “I’ll use it every day; that’s how I get about. I’ve never owned a car in my life and I don’t intend to buy a car in New York.” Byford seemed undaunted by becoming head of the New York City Transit Authority. “I didn’t take this on for the prestige. I took it on because I like a challenge,” he said. He has already floated potentially unpopular ideas, like an end to 24-hour service on some lines, and closing others for repairs. “It’s a harsh message but there will be no gain without a bit of pain,” Byford said. He added: “A lesson that I’ve applied here at the TTC [in Toronto] came from the London Underground, where once upon a time we tried to upgrade things overnight and on weekends, but came to the conclusion that sometimes [if repairs are done all at once] it’s more efficient and you get the get the job done more quickly.” His résumé certainly appears to fit the bill. Byford started his career as a station foreman at Regent’s Park station in London in 1989 before becoming manager of King’s Cross St Pancras, and then holding leadership positions in the London, Sydney and Toronto transit systems. He met his wife, Alison, on the London Underground, proposed to her on a high-speed train and hired a double-decker bus to take guests to their wedding in Ottawa. Byford sees London’s underground system as a model for New York. “Every time I go back to the Tube I’m amazed. I go to the stations and they’re bright and renovated. The station staff are incredibly proactive, they look great, they’re very helpful,” Byford told the Evening Standard. In Toronto, Byford took over the top job in 2013, and set in motion an ambitious five-year modernization plan. Under him, on-time arrivals went up, and trains got faster. The subway, which Byford had previously described as “squalid”, got cleaner. “He basically was looking for, in the short term, quick wins,” said Steve Munro, a veteran Toronto transit activist and blogger. “That’s the basic thing any new manager does: they come in and want to be seen as doing something. So he went after the stuff that was relatively easy and cheap to implement.” The wins bought him time and cachet. Byford turned around and converted that political capital into bigger, deeper changes to infrastructure and agency culture. “He’s a good forceful spokesman but he’s not overbearing,” Munro said. “He made a good political case and fortunately for him, the political era was such that fixing the problem was more important than fighting about, ‘Oh God, how did we get here?’” The effort culminated in Toronto being named “outstanding public transit system of the year” by the American Public Transportation Association. The award was greeted skeptically by Torontonians – straphangers worldwide aren’t typically the most optimistic bunch – but the system fared much better than the one New Yorkers currently contend with every day. According to a November New York Times investigation, on-time arrivals are down about 26% since 2007, and a majority of the city’s 20-odd service lines have on-time arrival rates below 65%. It’s not all in the numbers either. One particularly “hellworthy” summer image was that of desperate travelers, trapped in a subway car without air conditioning for more than an hour. Byford was in New York for a transit function the same June day that New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, declared a state of emergency – a designation usually reserved for natural disasters – for the city’s subways. New York has managed some transit wins. The city opened its first stations on the centuries-delayed Second Avenue line earlier this year, and delivered a 7 line expansion on the west side in 2015, even if both projects were beset by cost overruns and delays. The city also made good on a promise to get every underground station equipped with wifi, and in 2017 got digital arrival bulletins into all of its 425 stations – no easy feat.But the political situation Byford walks into is complex. Cuomo and city mayor, Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, are locked in a seemingly perpetual feud, and city transit, over which they share authority, has been a common site for their skirmishes. Byford has pledged to stay out of it: “I’m not going to even attempt to get into the middle of that relationship. My job is to give advice and for politicians to decide, and my job is to advocate for my customers.” The task is herculean, though, and Byford is the first to admit that the system faces major limitations based on its current age, state of repair and massive ridership. “There’s a reason why that equipment is under strain. It’s old and it’s trying to carry more people than it was ever designed for,” Byford said.Byford faces the impending shutdown of the L line, the city’s busiest train route. In 2019, the tubes that connect that line underneath the East river will be taken out of operation for a total overhaul and the 225,000 daily riders will need to be accommodated. Cuomo and De Blasio have already tangled over whose mess that is to solve, and it’s not likely to smooth over any time soon. Byford admits that he’s never quite tackled a problem of that magnitude, but he’s certainly game to try. “Any transit professional who’s worth their salt wants to do this job,” Byford said. “This is New York, for God’s sake.

Hopefully, it’ll get a reaction. We don’t want to leave it too late.” After collecting only one point from the last possible 24, something needs to change for Benítez’s side, who visit Arsenal on Saturday. While Newcastle’s manager waits to hear if Mike Ashley, the club’s owner, has accepted Amanda Staveley’s £300m offer to buy him out – the latest indications are that the takeover should happen at some point early in 2018 but there is quite a bit of negotiating still to do – he is ruing Ashley’s summertime failure to allow him to properly strengthen the squad who won promotion from the Championship last spring. Benítez has taken to quoting an old Spanish saying about “a short blanket” leaving either your feet or your top half cold. In football parlance it translates to the uncomfortable reality that no formation currently looks capable of camouflaging Newcastle’s collective flaws. In the last three games alone, their manager has tried three systems and deployed 18 different players to no avail and Lascelles acknowledges that confidence has been dented. “When you keep getting bad results it’s going to knock you a little bit as a human beings,” the centre-half said. “But now is the time for characters and big personalities to come out of their shells. With the manager and players we have here we can definitely sort things out. I’m not going to say we’re in a relegation battle. There’s still loads of games to play.” And much to put right. “For the last couple of weeks I’ve felt our organisation hasn’t been great, there wasn’t much talking on the pitch,” Lascelles said. “I feel we had that back against Everton but we just lacked that bit of quality. In the last three or four weeks we’ve been making mistakes and it’s cost us. We definitely have to sort that out; it’s unacceptable. “Now that I’m back from injury I’m definitely going to be on to people. It’s not as if the boys aren’t working hard, it’s not like a few years back when I had a go at people [for not pulling their weight]. It’s just about sticking together as a team.” Although Lascelles says the players are not distracted by takeover talk, Benítez’s hopes of squad strengthening apparently rest on Ashley agreeing to spend in next month’s transfer market before being refunded by Staveley once the deal is done. On Thursday Benítez attended a transfer summit with Lee Charnley, Newcastle’s managing director, to discuss potential signings and the need to reinforce the team to prevent the club’s value depreciating. In an ideal world he would like to secure, among other signings, loans for the Liverpool striker Danny Ings and the Manchester United left-back Luke Shaw."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/greater-manchester-needs-15bn-to-boost-cycling-says-olympian-chris-boardman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T00:01:02Z","webTitle":"Greater Manchester needs £1.5bn to boost cycling – Chris Boardman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/greater-manchester-needs-15bn-to-boost-cycling-says-olympian-chris-boardman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/greater-manchester-needs-15bn-to-boost-cycling-says-olympian-chris-boardman","fields":{"headline":"Greater Manchester needs £1.5bn to boost cycling – Chris Boardman","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Greater Manchester should spend £1.5bn to make the region one of the best places in the world to cycle or walk, Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman has said. Boardman, the first cycling and walking commissioner for Greater Manchester, has made the ambitious demand in his first report to Andy Burnham, the region’s mayor. He wants to spend the money over the next 10 years to produce more than 700 miles of safe cycle lanes and claims that the investment will result in a return of at least £8.3bn in public benefits. Currently 50% of adults in Greater Manchester are physically inactive, costing the NHS more than £500,000 per week, he says. Boardman, who won gold at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 and wore the yellow jersey in the Tour de France, told the Guardian earlier this year that he now avoided cycling on UK roads because he feels they are too unsafe. His goal is to drastically increase the number of people in Greater Manchester who walk or cycle, and says the only way to do this is to radically redesign the region’s streets. “The fact is that people will only travel this way if it is easy and pleasant. Riding a bicycle or crossing a street should not require bravery,” he argues in the report, which he will present to the leaders of Greater Manchester’s 10 boroughs on Friday. “We need protected space; uninterrupted, all the way from where I am to where I want to be. Only with safe and attractive space will people that don’t walk or cycle now venture out on to the road in significant numbers.” He has based his vision around the idea that a 12-year-old would choose to use it. “That ‘12-year- old’ represents a pensioner, a mother, someone with mobility issues, all the people we want to travel by bike instead of car but currently don’t,” he said. “There are strong precedents and clear evidence. Other European countries like the Netherlands started to prioritise walking and cycling in the 1970s. There, they’ve seen child fatalities on the road fall from over 400 to just 141 in 2010, while at the same time increasing the proportion of children who cycle to school to over 50%. Here in the UK, just 3% of children cycle to school.” Burnham welcomed Boardman’s recommendations but stopped short of saying he would be able to provide such a vast sum of money. In a statement he said: “Chris has identified the need for substantial investment in our cycling infrastructure and in response, we are aiming to create a challenge fund of around £50m a year from 2019 to 2021, which will be able to be accessed by our 10 districts if they are building to the required standard and meeting part of the costs. This will go a considerable way towards meeting the required funding challenge and we will provide initial funding next year to get things going.” But Boardman insists his demand is not excessive: “Over the next decade, this works out at £150m per year and will deliver an initial network spanning the main conurbations of Greater Manchester. It will give a return of at least £8.3bn in public benefits. It sounds like a lot, but with over 700 miles of main corridors across Greater Manchester, this is the scale of network we need to aim for.” Paul Tuohy, chief executive of Cycling UK, said: “Chris Boardman’s report shows an exciting level of ambition which the government and other cities now need to copy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/944","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-18T00:00:44Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 944","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/944","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/944","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 944","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/17/weaponised-social-media-isnt-brexit-smoking-gun","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-17T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Why ‘weaponised’ social media isn’t Brexit’s smoking gun | John Naughton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/weaponised-social-media-isnt-brexit-smoking-gun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/17/weaponised-social-media-isnt-brexit-smoking-gun","fields":{"headline":"Why ‘weaponised’ social media isn’t Brexit’s smoking gun","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Last May the UK information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, launched a formal investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes. This involved an initial exploration of what went on in the Brexit referendum campaign but potentially also in others. And given the global nature of digital data, the investigation also involved an investigation into how “companies operating internationally” were using the personal data of UK citizens for political purposes. The overall goal of this inquiry was to understand how personal information was used in political campaigns. The commissioner was concerned about the “invisible processing” of citizens’ private data by algorithms that carry out data-matching and profiling – which of course is what Google and Facebook do for a living. Their automated engines were originally built to facilitate the targeting of commercial messages at their users. But what became clear in 2016 is that those same engines had been “weaponised” by political actors to deliver targeted political and ideological messages, and that’s a very different game. “When the purpose for using these techniques is related to the democratic process,” wrote Denham, “the case for a high standard of transparency is very strong.” Quite so. What the commissioner may not have appreciated when she embarked upon her inquiry, though, is that transparency is about as popular with these companies – not to mention the political actors who exploit their automated systems – as garlic is with Count Dracula. Her investigation has covered more than 30 organisations – including political parties and campaigns, data companies and social media platforms, together with a mysterious Canadian outfit, AggregateIQ, whose name continually crops up in connection with this stuff. Denham’s progress report – published last week on her office’s website – suggests it hasn’t exactly been plain sailing. “A number of organisations,” she reports, “have freely cooperated with us, answered our questions and engaged with the investigation. But others are making it difficult. In some instances we have been unable to obtain the specific details of work that contributed to the referendum campaign and I will be using every available legal tool and working with authorities overseas to seek answers on behalf of UK citizens.” And some outfits have been obstructive – or “failed to be as comprehensive as I believe they need to be in answering our questions”, as the commissioner politely puts it – forcing her to invoke statutory powers to demand information from data processors. Her office has to date served four formal information notices as part of the investigation, including one to – guess who! – Ukip, which has now appealed against the commissioner’s demands to the Information Rights Tribunal. Cue battalions of m’learned friends and a long war of legal attrition. Political campaigning has always been a dirty and corrupt business, polluted by dark money and the unscrupulous use of whatever communications media happens to be dominant at any particular time. The main lesson of the 2016 Brexit and Trump campaigns is that social media and data analytics are now the tools of choice for manipulating public opinion and influencing elections. At the moment, they have several advantages over old-fashioned broadcast TV. First, a lot of the money spent on them in political campaigning can be hidden from regulators, partly because it involves exploiting troves of personal data accumulated over decades by social media companies (and is therefore outside any particular campaign window). Second, unlike older media, different (and possibly contradictory) messages can be delivered to individuals, and no one will ever know. And third, they are fantastically cost-effective. Investigations in the US, for example, suggest that messages crafted by Russian agencies, which spent about $30,000 on Facebook, may have reached up to 126 million users. That’s an awful lot of bangs per buck and perhaps explains why the Leave campaign spent 98% of its communications budget on data analytics. It seems obvious now that the weaponisation of social media played some role in both the Brexit referendum and the US election. What’s much less clear, however, is whether it was critical in determining the outcome. Personally, I’m sceptical. Our current obsession with digital technology as the trigger for these political earthquakes may actually be a kind of displacement activity. What we’re overlooking is that none of this would have happened if our ruling elites had noticed what four decades of globalisation and neoliberal economics had done to the life chances of many of our fellow citizens. Nearly four million people in the UK voted for Ukip in 2015, for example, and got just one MP for their trouble. So when David Cameron presented them with a chance to give the neoliberal order a good kicking, they hardly needed their Facebook feeds to tell them what to do. I hope the information commissioner does succeed in unearthing the role of data analytics in Brexit. But even if she does, she’ll only have retrieved one piece of the jigsaw."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/14/the-breakdown-northampton-jim-mallinder-stuart-lancaster","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T18:32:03Z","webTitle":"Could Stuart Lancaster be the man to get Northampton on the up again? | The Breakdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/14/the-breakdown-northampton-jim-mallinder-stuart-lancaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/14/the-breakdown-northampton-jim-mallinder-stuart-lancaster","fields":{"headline":"Could Stuart Lancaster be the man to get Northampton on the up again?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Flying high in September, Jim Mallinder was shot down in December. Northampton led the Premiership after their bonus point victory over Harlequins in the fifth round, but five successive league defeats since then saw them drop to 10th. That run, together with three Champions Cup defeats out of three with 124 points, and 18 tries, conceded despite two of the matches being at Franklin’s Gardens, prompted the Saints’ board to call time on the Premiership’s longest serving director of rugby. Saturday’s 43-32 home defeat by Ospreys, the Pro 14 strugglers who had not won away from home all season and were far from full strength, in a ground that was little more than half full marked an ignominious end for Mallinder, who after taking over in 2007 when the club had been relegated to the Premiership guided them to a European Cup final and the Premiership title in 2014, a year after they had been beaten by Leicester at Twickenham. Under him, Northampton were wedded to success rather than style. Their high point coincided with the point in the game when territory rather than possession was the mantra. Strong in the set-pieces and blessed with hard-running forwards and centres, supplemented by controlling halfbacks and an accurate goal-kicker, the Saints were difficult to beat once they had established a lead, if less comfortable when they had to play catch-up. Since winning the Premiership in 2014, their tale has been one of decline, slow at first, as rugby changed. It was less that they were unable to replace Samu Manoa, who was offered a lucrative contract by Toulon, as a ball-carrier, and more that they did not look comfortable in possession, a contrast in the last two seasons to Exeter. They lost 12 Premiership matches last season and were beaten by a total of 97-23 by Leinster in the double-header weekend of the Champions Cup. Northampton got rid of their attack coach, Alex King, but that was like getting rid of the person who produced the paper for the architect to draw his plans on. Mallinder’s success, and the club’s gratitude, remembering where they had been in the middle of the previous decade, earned him the board’s loyalty. “This has not been a decision that was taken lightly,” said the Northampton chairman John White in a statement on Tuesday announcing Mallinder’s departure. “The board and major shareholders felt the time was right for some change.” A decision they refrained from last season could no longer be put off. Being beaten at home heavily by Leinster is one thing, but by Ospreys another. Northampton had six England players in their line-up, five of whom had played under Eddie Jones, but the collective spirit that had been a signal feature just a few years before was lacking. Northampton said they would be seeking a “world-class” director of rugby to succeed Mallinder. Pat Lam, the club’s captain when they won the European Cup in 2000, would be a popular choice judging by supporters’ message boards, but the Saints are a year too late, unless they are prepared to buy him out of his contract at Bristol, who are on course to return to the Premiership next season. Northampton want to appoint someone on the up rather than on the rebound. Football’s managerial carousel sees managers sacked by one struggling club and hired by another, as this season again shows. The names immediately linked with Mallinder’s job were familiar: Mike Ford, fired by Bath at the end of the 2015-16 season; Jake White, dismissed by Montpellier last May; Andy Robinson, removed by Bristol little more than a year ago; and Richard Cockerill, who has spent most of his rugby career at Leicester before having his contract at Welford Road terminated almost a year ago. While Northampton are in decline, they look in need of a stimulus rather than a blood transfusion. The board’s trust in Mallinder was commendable at a time when knee-jerk reactions are more the norm, but perhaps he should have been encouraged to freshen up his back-up team: he has been more Arsène Wenger than Alex Ferguson in the use of lieutenants, and at a time of flux in the game that can lead to stasis: players who have been at the club a long time stop responding to the message while new recruits struggle to make sense of it. Northampton have used five outside-halves in their last 10 matches. Injuries have been partly responsible for the changes, but is a position that has come to define their fall: the days when Stephen Myler could operate behind the gainline and either kick for position or launch big runners have passed. The need now is for variety and an inside-centre who, like a 10, can act decisively. Which brings in Stuart Lancaster as a contender to succeed Mallinder. His four-year stint with England may have ended in the disappointment of the 2015 World Cup, the pressure of the occasion proving too much for management and players, but before that the team was on a steady upward line. The foundation Lancaster laid allowed his successor Eddie Jones to start at a sprint. Lancaster spent time in the southern hemisphere analysing coaching methods after losing his job with England before taking charge of Leinster’s attack. He signed a new contract with the province earlier this year: its length was unspecified other than it was for at least this season. It is unlikely Leinster would stand in Lancaster’s way should Northampton come calling. Leinster use the ball as Northampton have been trying to do and in his time in Dublin, Lancaster has helped advance the careers of backs like Garry Ringrose and Joey Carbery. It raises the prospect of Lancaster linking up again with a player he dropped from the World Cup squad, the current England captain Dylan Hartley, but that would hardly be a problem. Lancaster should be in a top job again and Northampton need someone like him, upward looking. • This is an extract taken from the Guardian’s weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

We may criticise the law of the land, and particular laws, and criticise the national curriculum or particular exams. In doing so we help to realise and hope to establish what is valuable. Even if the influential Ms Pepinster believes there is no difference between her two examples of teaching ethics, this is not an argument against faith schools. It does though suggest the schools find friends in the media who think more clearly about these important matters. Janet Dubé Peebles, Tweeddale • Catherine Pepinster appeals to “freedom to choose”, yet she ignores precisely that value in asserting the “wrongness of abortion” halfway through the same article. That’s what people really object to about faith schools: the hypocrisy, the bias, the meddlesome mixing of religious doctrine (not faith, which is universal) with what should be open-ended education for its own sake. (Fr) Alec Mitchell Manchester • Catherine Pepinster has failed to do her homework. Ofsted is very clear about British values. The school inspection handbook guidance on inspecting the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils is explicit, paragraphs 143-146, especially 145-146. Among other things, it defines “the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs”. This is a public document, available – to those sufficiently curious – on the Ofsted website. John Morey Penzance, Cornwall • “British values” is simply an expression used to reinforce a sense of us (versus them), and implied specialness. There are no values which non-Britons would recognise as applying typically and only to British people.

Representative Blake Farenthold, a Republican from Texas, will not seek re-election in 2018, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, announced on Thursday. Speaking at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Ryan told reporters Farenthold was “making the right decision to retire”. Farenthold’s office has yet to issue a statement. The decision came one day after a former staffer alleged “verbally abusive and sexually demeaning” behavior in an interview with CNN. Michael Rekola, who served as Farenthold’s communications director in 2015, accused Farenthold of making sexually graphic jokes and regularly referring to his aides as “fucktards”. Rekola also said Farenthold would angrily berate his aides and that the congressman’s bullying led him to seek psychological counseling and medical treatment. “There are news stories that are very disconcerting,” Ryan said. “Unacceptable behavior has been alleged in those stories, and I think he’s made the right decision that he’s going to be leaving Congress.” Farenthold was already under investigation by the House ethics committee after it was revealed earlier this month that he used taxpayers’ money in 2014 to settle a sexual harassment claim brought by his former spokeswoman. Lauren Greene, then Farenthold’s communications director, had filed a lawsuit against Farenthold in the US district court in the District of Columbia over allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination. Greene alleged she was fired after complaining about Farenthold’s behavior. She dropped the case after reaching a private settlement with the congressman. Ryan would not say if he believed Farenthold should immediately resign. According to a source familiar with the discussion, Ryan spoke with Farenthold on Wednesday and urged him not to run for another term. Farenthold is the latest member of Congress whose political career has been cut short amid a watershed dialogue regarding sexual misconduct. Last week, the Arizona representative Trent Franks resigned after it was alleged he discussed surrogacy issues with female staffers. Franks, a Republican, reportedly offered an aide $5m to bear his child. Two Democrats, the Minnesota senator Al Franken and the Michigan representative John Conyers, also resigned this month following sexual harassment allegations. Several women accused Franken of grabbing their rear ends while posing for photographs, while two other women said he tried to forcibly kiss them. Franken denied the claims but resigned after a growing number of Democrats called on him to step down. Conyers also resigned at the urging of his Democratic colleagues after it was revealed he reached a $27,000 settlement with a female staffer who said she was fired because she resisted the congressman’s sexual advances. This week, a group of Democratic lawmakers called for a congressional investigation into sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump. The president was accused of sexual misconduct by as many as 17 women prior to his election last November. Republican leaders have said they do not plan to launch in inquiry into Trump, who has denied the allegations. Trump, however, boasted of groping and kissing women without their consent in a 2005 Access Hollywood tape leaked less than two months before the presidential election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
