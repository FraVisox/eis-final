All are world renowned for their differing but successful coaching styles and have excelled in their profession. Each is contrasting in terms of personality, image and footballing philosophy but there is a common denominator, which is they were exposed to top-tier management while in their 30s. They achieved it differently but compared with managers in England they were coaching top-level clubs relatively young and able to apply their ideas and engage with players closely, partly owing to the benefit of their youth. After succeeding elsewhere they have arrived in England and have undoubtedly inspired and challenged young aspiring English coaches like me to learn and improve. Think about those guys in relation to the appointment of David Moyes (54) at West Ham United and the interest Everton reportedly hold in appointing Sam Allardyce (63) to their vacant post. Both managers are the logical step in terms of an experienced, safe pair of hands who would be expected to guide these teams to safety from the financial perils of relegation. The go-to argument is that they know the league but looking at the incumbents of the top five only Pochettino had previous Premier League experience, with Southampton, before being appointed at Spurs, while Mourinho first went to Chelsea from Porto. Pochettino’s arrival at St Mary’s in 2013 had experts and pundits ridiculing the club’s board for taking the decision to bring him from Espanyol and placing faith in the fundamental footballing principles that are the basis of his style of play. Pochettino was neither safe nor experienced and if we look further back Espanyol were also questioned when they, as a solid La Liga club, appointed a man with no first-team experience to take charge. However, both clubs saw something special, something different, and we all know now that faith was repaid in abundance. Strange as it may sound, if Barcelona were an English club – without the strong footballing philosophy and identity they possess within their culture – Guardiola, 38 at the time, would never have been appointed, though we all know the fantastic, evolved football thinking he has brought to the game in his relatively short career. For years, we have asked where top English coaches with new ideas are coming from and then, without looking for the right person, clubs have instead opted to continue the seemingly endless obsession with the managerial merry-go-round. Thus we see the same faces linked to every available job regardless of what they did at their previous clubs and due almost entirely to their experience of football in this country. The reason for this is twofold and bound to the natural emotion in everyone that governs the ability to make decisions regardless of our circumstances: fear. Fear of losing the vast sums of money now at stake in the Premier League that would be lost through relegation. Fear of ridicule and pressure from the media that, in certain areas, has an ever-increasing influence on the decision-making processes in Premier League boardrooms. Marco Silva is someone who has challenged the status quo and has rightly gained admirers for his work at Hull City and Watford. But, again, look closer at his career and he was appointed aged 34 at Estoril with no previous experience; how many home‑grown managers are afforded that opportunity up and down the leagues in this country? Moyes enjoyed a similar opportunity when he was appointed at a young age at Preston. After gaining experience and credibility there he moved on to Everton where he did an outstanding job in building a club over the years with his energy, ethos and philosophy running through it. The irony of this is that Moyes’s most successful part of his career was the earlier part and came when he was still a relatively young manager. If we look at the numerous top young players being produced in the Bundesliga and the young coaches standing on the touchlines developing these players, I fear in England we are already being left behind and a whole generation of forward-thinking, innovative and progressive coaches will be lost to the game. Football is too great a sport to be paralysed by fear and the longer it strangles our game and promotes safety-first appointments, and the accompanying arcane philosophy of football, we will end up with 14 or 15 Premier League clubs rejecting the opportunity to develop better futures in favour of focusing on survival.

Harlow Carr in Harrogate, north Yorkshire, provides just the right lure; its winter walk runs alongside 400 metres of path that snakes through the centre of the garden, planted with all kinds of delights to see and sniff. The walk was created to add a new dimension to this RHS-owned garden, bringing six months of interest, from the fiery foliage of November through to the spring bulbs of April. It is designed to run on an east-west axis: aspect is important in winter, because the low angle of the sun’s rays lends plants a different perspective, lighting up bare stems and trunks that are obscured during summer. This produces two very different views depending on which way you are walking, explains horticulturist Russell Watkins, who heads the team managing the winter walk. “If you go one way, you benefit from the light shining through things, so we have lots of plants such as honesty [Lunaria annua] that we allow to seed through,” he says. “The seedheads pick up the light and glow like little lanterns. Walk the other way, and it’s fiery and vibrant.” One key species providing vibrancy is dogwood: a pedestrian plant when in leaf, but at autumn’s end, the foliage falls away to reveal a tangle of brightly coloured stems. Bold blocks of red and orange Cornus sanguinea ‘Midwinter Fire’, yellow-green C. sericea ‘Bud’s Yellow’ and scarlet-stemmed C. alba all catch the light. Along the walk are deciduous trees chosen for their textured bark and strong outlines, such as paperbark maple (Acer griseum), Persian ironwood (Parrotia persica) and silver birch, or bright berries such as mountain ash ‘Copper Kettle’. That’s all very well on a sunny day, but what’s to recommend a visit in fog and drizzle? The dogwoods glow even in the gloomiest moments, Watkins says, but he also rates the cryptomerias, or Japanese cedar trees. “The best one, for me, is C. japonica ‘Elegans’. Its foliage holds on to water droplets so it shimmers as if it’s covered in diamonds.” Any winter walk worth its salt will offer plenty of scent. At Harlow Carr there is lots; the citrus shades of the witch hazels (hamamelis), spidery white winter box (sarcococca), yellow sprays of mahonia, and the pink and white daphnes all make their presence known via wafting perfumes, their strategy for attracting the few pollinating insects venturing out on milder days. It’s possible to achieve a winter display in more confined spaces. Pots that can be moved in and out of the spotlight depending on the season offer a great solution for smaller gardens. “Even if you’ve only got a container, all you need is a dogwood or two, some heather and some spring bulbs and you’ve got a long-lasting combination,” Watkins says. Heathers haven’t yet seen the same kind of revival that other once-reviled plants such as dahlias have undergone, but Watkins argues that the winter-flowering types, such as the pink-flowered, bronze-leaved Erica carnea ‘Ann Sparkes’, have earned a place in the winter garden, both for their long-lasting colour and for their role as a magnet for early-emerging pollinators. “They can look a bit dull on their own – try them in among other plants, at the front of paths,” Watkins says. And grasses? Despite their current popularity in horticulture, there are just two that have proved suitable for the winter walk, chosen for their ability to stand up to a hard frost and snowfall. “In some awkward spaces under trees where it’s shady and dry, I’ve got evergreen Carex morrowii [Japanese sedge], which is brilliant for difficult situations as a background plant. I also use Miscanthus ‘Little Kitten’, which doesn’t do that thing a lot of miscanthus do – dropping leaves and making a mess; it flowers well but only gets to 1m tall.” Watkins knows when visitors are enjoying the winter walk, because their brisk steps slow to a crawl. “You see people power-walking in the summer, but in the winter people slow as the scent catches them.” Harlow Carr is open daily except Christmas Day"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2017/nov/10/its-not-fair-to-judge-lecturers-on-national-student-survey-scores","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T07:30:12Z","webTitle":"It's not fair to judge lecturers on National Student Survey scores","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/nov/10/its-not-fair-to-judge-lecturers-on-national-student-survey-scores","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/nov/10/its-not-fair-to-judge-lecturers-on-national-student-survey-scores","fields":{"headline":"It's not fair to judge lecturers on National Student Survey scores","bodyText":"It’s only weeks into the academic year, but already the big bosses are trying to scare us with the three initials we academics have been taught to dread: NSS. The National Student Survey may only contact students between January and February, but its impact is felt long before it actually opens. I have received pleas from senior management to do the best we can, as well as threats about what will happen if our results dip. In theory, the NSS is a good idea. It asks a select group of third-year students questions ranging from whether marking is fair and feedback timely to how easy it is to contact staff when needed. But the problem is its use as a tool to evaluate academics’ performance. Some things are not within our control. I take full responsibility over whether my students believe that I am “good at explaining things”, “make the subject interesting” and whether the “criteria used in marking have been made clear in advance”. But how can I be responsible for whether they can “access course specific resources (eg equipment, facilities, software, collections)”? Academic staff don’t deal with resources and budgets. And how can any chalkface academic be held responsible for the overall organisation and management of the course? “We are turning all the students into little customers. It’s like we are trying to be the best supermarket,” a colleague told me. “It’s exhausting.” Another colleague agreed: “We are jumping through hoops that are actually unachievable. Why don’t we just have a TripAdvisor for universities? It’s just meaningless nonsense. The more it’s measured the more meaningless it becomes.” This year has, by and large, gone well. But it’s already halfway to Christmas and some students have just got their timetables. Computers crash all the time. Campus food is a constant nightmare – inedible and huge queues. Will these be reflected in the NSS scores used to evaluate my performance as a lecturer? It was good news, then, when it was announced in September that the NSS weighting in the teaching excellence framework will be halved. It’s unclear what that half will be replaced with, although there’s speculation that contact hours will be weighted. Critics have said that halving the weighting will silence the student voice. But what if the NSS is not a valid vehicle for the student voice to be heard in the first place? Let’s start by stating the obvious. If a course is relatively easy and every bum on a seat gets an A, it stands to reason that NSS scores might be higher than in a challenging course where students have to work hard for their marks – and still graduate with a 2.2. But some nuances are more opaque. One year, I caught four students cheating in a third-year module. The chances they will entertain warm, fuzzy thoughts about the lecturer who, in effect, caught them with their pants down are infinitesimally small. The chances they’ll feel positive toward the university that lowered their degree classification, despite paying rising tuition fees year after year, is even smaller. An academic colleague in the US told me how he failed a student he caught cheating. She retaliated by writing falsehoods about him on ratemyprofessors.com, and he was called in by his line manager for a disciplinary meeting. The student ended up re-enrolling, and actually had the nerve to ask him for a letter of recommendation. He declined. It’s common knowledge that the NSS is flawed methodologically as well. Last year, my department didn’t even make it into the survey. Why? Because not enough third-year students on my course answered it. Ipsos MORI, which administers the survey, chooses students to participate from a first-year register. At every university, a percentage of the students surveyed have already dropped out years earlier. Earlier this term, a manager produced a chart outlining how we can improve our NSS scores. This was helpful: not only did he point out ways to improve feedback and communication, but he also highlighted what needed to be done that was outside our control. But this conflicts with other managers telling us to bend over backwards for students with unreasonable demands, just because the NSS is looming.

Each news story following the blaze seems to pile further indignity on the survivors and relatives of those who died, with the response and rehoming revealing the shambolic working of both local and national government. This week, the Grenfell Recovery Taskforce issued its first report into the response of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea after nine weeks of research. The findings are damning, as anyone following the story would expect, and focus on particular cultural failings in the council that worsened the response. The report speaks of “a leadership vacuum”, with a “distant council” and a lack of emotional intelligence in dealing with survivors and the community. It says empathy and emotional intelligence need to be put at the heart of its recovery plans. “We have seen many good intentions, which have gone unrecognised by residents,” says the report. “Often what has been lacking is the appropriate ‘style’ of delivery, where an approach that had empathy at its core would have had greater positive impact. Systems, policies and practice need to be designed with people’s current needs at the heart as opposed to what is good or convenient administrative practice.” This comment speaks to one of the main failings of the council: to understand what the community needed, not just in terms of temporary accommodation, rehousing and the release of funds, but with regards to people centred response services. Many complained that the council seemed robotic in its responses, focusing on defending its approach rather than accepting and understanding that people viewed its actions as inadequate and working out precisely why. It was a council that had become insular, disconnected and in particular distant from communities similar to those on the Lancaster West estate. Despite the tragedy being unprecedented, the council appears to have become fixated on behaving as though the recovery could be dealt with within traditional local government frameworks, notes the report, which says the council needs to be bolder. The taskforce urges the government to encourage a “highly innovative” response responding to residents’ needs, rather than being “bound by tried and tested bureaucratic response systems that are not appropriate in these circumstances”. Many of those affected spoke of feeling deliberately sidelined and ignored by the council in the run-up to the blaze, with their concerns dismissed. The same was true after the fire, when damage limitation and reputation management seemed to be of greater concern than immediate aid. Criticisms that council officials were nowhere to be seen were met with either dismissal, claiming employees were simply not identifying themselves on the ground, or the assertion, insulting to survivors, that it was not safe for council officials to meet residents face to face. That in itself is a startling example of a failure of emotional intelligence: many survivors were desperate to speak to people responsible for managing the tower, to ask how on earth it could happen and what would be done to help survivors. Instead, the council retreated; in a meeting of the full council in June, survivors were initially not allowed into the main chamber, then, after some were escorted in, others were shut out on the other side of a locked fire door, particularly concerning given the circumstances. In the chamber, the aunt of one teenage girl who had died spoke directly to the new leader of the council, asking why an email she had sent detailing the problems her surviving family were facing had gone unanswered. Kensington and Chelsea is an extreme example of the stripped-back local government we now see across Britain. This is due not just to austerity hollowing out council accounts and making it impossible to deliver services, but also to a philosophical shift in the way councils operate. Too many have shifted from providing hands-on, local services with a high level of resident involvement, to an aloof, threadbare service that consists of both councillors and staff who eschew frontline work and meetings for a rigid managerialism and dismissal of residents as obstacles and annoyances. More emotional intelligence within Kensington and Chelsea would have drastically altered its response and tempered much of the trauma felt by residents. If only the council had been more flexible, hands-on and listened more when responding to survivors in the chaos and horror that followed the fire five months ago. Many councils will be reading the taskforce report and considering how closely it describes their own organisation. Local politics is far closer to everyday lives than national politics; by its very nature, empathy and emotional intelligence are absolutely imperative to a functioning council. It’s tragic that the Grenfell tower fire and external criticisms were necessary for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea to understand that.

There have been calls for Jones to resign over the issue but during an emotional press conference in Cardiff on Thursday he did not apologise and defended his actions, claiming everything had been done “by the book”. He said: “I had no alternative but to take the action that I did and I hope that people will understand that.” Jones paid tribute to Sargeant, who was cabinet secretary for communities and children, and apparently took his own life on Tuesday amid allegations of harassment. Jones described the 49-year-old as a great minister and chief whip, and said he could not imagine what his wife, Bernie, and his family were going through. He said: “Carl was my friend. In all the years that I knew him I never had a cross word with him. For 14 years we worked together. He ... served his country with distinction. Carl was a true force of nature, he drove through more legislation than any other minister. Not just through force of argument but through sheer force of personality and persuasion. “Wales has lost a person of great warmth, ability and charisma. These are the darkest days any of us can remember in this institution, but they are darkest of all for the family.” Declining to answer questions, Jones said: “Everybody is grieving and it is not appropriate for me to get into precise detail. These are matters for the future. He said his team would cooperate with the inquest due to open next week. “The family deserve to have their questions answered and if that isn’t possible through an inquest, then I will endeavour to make sure that happen through other means. There is a legal process to go through and I am obviously acting within that, but I welcome the scrutiny of my actions in the future and it is appropriate for that to be done independently.” Ahead of the statement, Sargeant’s family expressed concern that Jones was meeting Labour members of the assembly to discuss the matter before speaking to them or in public. He spoke to assembly members for an hour and a half before making his statement. Putting forward the view of Sargeant’s family, a friend, Daran Hill, said: “There is a feeling that political survival is being given greater weight than the human tragedy.” Hill, a lobbyist and political commentator, also tweeted: “Here in Connah’s Quay [Sargeant’s home town] there’s disbelief that the first minister is explaining his side of events to AMs without offering any explanation to the public or the devastated family.” Following the statement Hill said: “There are still many questions to answer and legal processes to examine.” There was anger in Sargeant’s home town in north Wales that Jones had not resigned. Bernie Attridge, deputy leader of Flintshire county council and a childhood friend of Sargeant, said: “I’m am absolutely appalled that the first minister has not done the decent thing and resigned. How can the first minister call Carl his friend?” Chris Risley, chair of Connah’s Quay town council, said: “[Jones] should be suspended, as Carl should have been until an independent investigation has been completed.” The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, called for an independent investigation. He said: “The statement from the first minister has left many unanswered questions and fails to provide the answers Carl’s family deserve.” Davies also highlighted claims from the former Welsh Labour minister Leighton Andrews that Sargeant had been subject to “deliberate personal undermining ... from within the Welsh Labour government over several years”. The Labour government has declined to comment on the allegations. Leanne Wood, leader of Plaid Cymru, also called for an independent inquiry to be conducted in “a mature, dignified and respectful manner”. She said: “Many questions remain unanswered by the first minister – a factor that will prolong the distress for all those involved.” Ukip said it would table a motion of no confidence in Jones when assembly business resumed next week. A key focus of any inquiry would be why Jones spoke of the allegations against Sargeant in television interviews on Monday, three days after the investigation was passed on to the national party to deal with. He would also be asked to say whether he had previously heard allegations against Sargeant and, if so, what he had done about them. On Wednesday, Sargeant’s family released correspondence showing that the allegations concerned “unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping” – which he had denied. It is understood that three women made allegations about Sargeant that were examined by a member of Jones’s staff before being passed to the Welsh Labour party for investigation.

But it is already clear that in monetary terms alone it will go down as one of the most costly cabinet departures ever – at just short of £8,000, in the Guardian’s carefully constructed estimate. The abortive round trip to Nairobi would have cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds in wasted air fares which could have been avoided if Patel had been prepared to face up to her critics. Patel was scheduled to go on an pre-arranged visit to Africa on Tuesday. The flight was due to leave at 5.25pm that day with many pressing questions unanswered about her undeclared meetings with Israeli officials. It was no surprise that the Speaker granted Kate Osamor, Patel’s opposite number, an urgent Commons question on Tuesday lunchtime. Patel had time to appear in the Commons in person to face the wrath of MPs and still catch the 5.25pm flight. But rather than stay, or even cancel her trip, she opted to get an earlier flight to Nairobi at 10.10am. Patel was therefore conveniently in the air while Alistair Burt, her deputy, was fielding tricky questions about her meetings on that holiday to Israel. Changing flight plans on Kenya Airways comes at a penalty of £240 on some business class tickets, but only if a day’s notice is given. If the Telegraph is correct in suggesting that Patel brought forward the flight at the last minute, new tickets would have had to be purchased. Patel’s former department has yet to give full details of the cost of the trip which she is understood to have made with her private secretary. But two last-minute business class returns to Nairobi on Kenya Airways would cost up to £5,878, according to the airline’s website. On Wednesday morning, Patel was due to fly to Entebbe in Uganda with Liam Fox, the trade secretary, and the rest of the entourage. But before boarding, she was summoned back to London by the prime minister on another last-minute flight for two. Two business returns from Nairobi to Entebbe would have added another £1,823 to the cost of the trip. The costs of the flights have not been disclosed but the Department for International Development insists that Patel’s Tuesday flight to Nairobi was brought forward the previous Thursday and there was no extra charge. It said Patel and her secretary stayed at the home of the high commissioner in Nairobi and so avoided accommodation costs. Osamor added that it was unacceptable for Patel not to answer questions in the Commons about her meetings with Israelis. She said: “It was simply unacceptable that Priti Patel failed to show up to the urgent question in parliament. She should not have been allowed to get on that plane. We deserve to know how much this fiasco has ended up costing the British taxpayer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/nov/16/i-never-used-to-eat-salads-how-to-look-like-kate-moss-according-to-kate-moss","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-16T06:00:20Z","webTitle":"'I never used to eat salads': how to look like Kate Moss (according to Kate Moss)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/16/i-never-used-to-eat-salads-how-to-look-like-kate-moss-according-to-kate-moss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/nov/16/i-never-used-to-eat-salads-how-to-look-like-kate-moss-according-to-kate-moss","fields":{"headline":"'I never used to eat salads': how to look like Kate Moss (according to Kate Moss)","bodyText":"Kate Moss doesn’t do interviews. “Never complain, never explain” has been the publicity-shy model’s mantra throughout her 25 years at the top of fashion modelling. But, as her career branches out into styling for Vogue, running her own model agency and working with Japanese skincare brand Decorté, she granted me a rare chance to talk beauty over afternoon tea. I wasn’t expecting the legendary party girl with a devil-may-care attitude to politely refuse a glass of champagne and extol the benefits of daily workouts and occasional juicing, but here we were. As she sat, her glowy face all smiles and giggles, dressed in a leopard sweater and chic black flares, Croydon’s most famous export revealed just how she maintains her iconic looks. On eating healthily... “Food is really important. I try to eat healthily. And I do cook, but not as much as I’d like to because I’m busy, but I cook a good roast. I do good breakfasts – eggs are my forte. I really enjoy food, proper food, but I do try to eat more healthily than I used to. I think as you get older you have to. When I was young I was so low maintenance I didn’t have to worry. Not what I ate, not about anything really. My skin looks better when I eat well, too. Obviously if you eat all that grease, skin just doesn’t look as healthy. I’ve really noticed an improvement since I’ve been more ‘on it’ with food – like eating salads and all that stuff – I never used to really eat salads. And now I’m like, juicing!” On sleeping in her makeup “My skincare routine is really simple. I couldn’t be bothered with loads of products and I’d get them all mixed up and not know what I was doing. I haven’t got the time or the inclination to sit there for ages, putting creams on my face. I need it to be effective and quick. I’ve been to bed in my makeup on occasions but I wouldn’t make a habit of it, not now. You can always tell the next day. It’s not a good look.” On wearing sheet masks while watching telly … “Regardless of whether or not I’m working, I just do the same thing all the time. I’ll do a cleanser and a serum and a moisturiser and that’s it. That’s all I need. I’ll sometimes do those gorgeous sheet masks while watching telly. I had one on last night for today. Like a good girl, in bed, with my face mask on for work.” On embarking on a gym routine … “I’ve never been a gym bunny or anything like that. I was always, like, ‘UGH’, it made me feel ill, but now I’ve actually started working out, I’m really quite into it. I’m at very early stages, but I’ve joined a gym and all that, and it’s made me feel really good. I worked out for an hour every consecutive day for a couple of weeks and it was enough that I really started to see the benefits, which I’d never really done before. I always thought ‘this is agony, I’m not coming back. This is torture’. But this time I just kind of pushed through. I honestly lost an inch off my waist in about 10 days. Now I really enjoy it.” On taking a low-key approach to hair styling … “My hair takes a battering at work. I’ve got a great colourist (Nicola Clarke at John Frieda) and she is key – she’s saved it really. I don’t really do any moisturisation or hair treatments or anything. I’m very low maintenance with hair. I’m not really there yet. Makeup, I love. Even more when I’m not working. I like doing my own makeup and playing. I love a dark eye, love makeup generally. I just like dressing up. It’s a passion of mine.” On being a social media refusenik … “Social media is just not me. I’ve never really liked it – that whole thing of ‘look at me!’. For me, the more privacy the better, not telling people where I am and what I’m doing. All that is the opposite of what I want to do. I suppose that makes people more interested, I don’t know, but I certainly don’t do it for that reason. It’s not a game plan. I just have to live by my own rules.” Kate Moss is the face of Decorté Beauty, now exclusive to Selfridges This article contains affiliate links to products.

The mood was helped by positive US earnings and housing data, which pushed Wall Street to new highs. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 21.88 points or 0.3% at 7411.34 Germany’s Dax rose 0.83% to 13,167.54 France’s Cac closed 0.48% higher at 5366.15 Italy’s FTSE MIB climbed 0.62% to 22,326.44 But Spain’s Ibex bucked the trend, down 0.32% at 9993.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.61% to 721.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 175 points or 0.74%. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US markets are hitting new highs, helped by positive earnings reports and better than expected housing figures. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global stocks are on the rise today, with US indices proving the big outperformer on the day amid further improvements to the corporate earnings picture. With gold and the yen rising in the afternoon, there is an interesting risk-off shift coming in play despite the record highs being set across US indices. This afternoon saw the US economic picture improve once more, with existing home sales beating market expectations in October. The 2% rise in US existing home sales comes as the US gets back on its feet in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. US markets have been punching higher in early trade, as they continue to benefit from an earnings season that appears to be the gift that keeps on giving, as home-improvement firm Lowe’s seeing a 6.5% year-on-year jump in sales in the wake of recent hurricane destruction. As for the UK, he said: The recent lack of direction in sterling has been a reflection of the largely sideways trade for the FTSE. However, with a growing feeling that the Tory Brexiteers are increasingly open to improving the divorce settlement offer, the likeliness of a December trade talk kick-off seems to be rising. With the UK budget due out tomorrow, the focus on the UK is likely to remain in place, with a heavily housing based speech from Phillip Hammond expected. Meanwhile some positive developments relating to Greece. Helena Smith writes: The European Commission has given the Greek government the green light today to distribute €1.4bn worth of social welfare benefits to citizens worst affected by the gruelling austerity measures Athens has been forced to take in return for bailout assistance. Addressing the European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said as Greece had overperformed fiscally, achieving a primary surplus of 1.75 %, its leftist-led government could honour its pledge to hand out a “social dividend” to those hardest hit by the country’s long economic crisis. The endorsement by Dombrovskis, a one time harsh critic of Greece’s inability to meet fiscal targets, is a 180 degree volte face from the reaction prime minister Alexis Tsipras received when he announced pre-Christmas ‘gift’ handouts last December. In a televised address that took many by surprise last week, Tsipras said the government had decided to more than double the amount it would distribute in the form of a one-off “social dividend” this year. Among those entitled to the handout are low-income pensioners and unemployed. With auditors representing international creditors poised to return to Athens, Dombrovskis sounded an upbeat note adding : “The economy is rebounding.” It was more than feasible, he said, to conclude an ongoing compliance review - the third since the country received a third bailout from eurozone partners and the IMF - by the end of the year or early 2018. In more optimistic news, the Bank of Greece announced that more than 23.5 million tourists visited Greece between January and September this year - up from 21.4% over the same period last year. Revenues came in at around €13bn - a godsend for Greeks. Back with the UK, and here’s our report on Airbus warning MPs about the possible effects of Brexit: Airbus has told MPs that Britain risks losing the “crown jewels” of its aviation industry to China as a result of Brexit, putting up to 7,000 wing-manufacturing jobs in Wales at risk. The head of the company’s UK operations warned the business select committee that the threat of new customs bureaucracy and reduced employee mobility could deter long-term investment and accelerate a shift to Asia. Though there are no current plans to move, Katherine Bennett said, adding that she was “fighting to ensure that wing design – the crown jewels of aerospace – remains in this country”. “I need to let you know, committee, that other countries would dearly love to design and build wings,” she told MPs. “Some of them already do; we do build wings in China now, and believe you me they are knocking at the door as a result of the situation we are in in this country. The full story is here: And more positive US economic news. Existing home sales rose by more than expected in October, up 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48m units, helped by a recovery from the disruption caused by recent hurricanes. September’s figure was revised down from 5.39m to 5.37m. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 5.42 for October. The National Association of Realtors, which compiles the figures, said supply shortages were pushing prices higher and making it difficult for first time buyers. The association’s chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Job growth in most of the country continues to carry on at a robust level and is starting to slowly push up wages, which is in turn giving households added assurance that now is a good time to buy a home. While the housing market gained a little more momentum last month, sales are still below year ago levels because low inventory is limiting choices for prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated. The residual effects on sales from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are still seen in parts of Texas and Florida. However, sales should completely bounce back to their pre-storm levels by the end of the year, as demand for buying in these areas was very strong before the storms. US markets have made a bright start, with technology stocks moving higher and pushing the Nasdaq Composite to new highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 140 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.33% higher and the Nasdaq up 0.46%. Higher oil prices and some relatively positive reports from retailers Urban Outfitters and Dollar Tree. But trading volumes were thin ahead of the forthcoming Thanksgiving break. Here’s a quick summary of the Bank of England hearing at the Treasury Select Committee, from Oxford Economics: Over in the US, and another positive pointer for the country’s economy. The Chicago Fed National Activity index - an average of several indicators of economic activity - rose from 0.36 in September to 0.65 in October, better than the 0.2 figure expected by analysts. The September number was also revised upwards from the initial reading of 0.17. Markets seem unshaken by the various disappointments around. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the unresolved political situation in Germany, a brewing Tory backlash over the Cabinet’s movement on the EU divorce bill, and an unexpected widening of the deficit ahead of tomorrow’s Autumn Budget, things were pretty damn quiet this Tuesday. Investors seemed wary of getting too involved with the forex markets. The pound is flat against the dollar and up 0.1% against the euro, while the euro itself effectively unchanged against the greenback, sporadically dipping 0.1%. This forex flatness has allowed the European indices room to breathe. The DAX is up half a percent, ignoring the issues with the German government (or lack thereof) to hit a fresh 8 day high; the CAC, meanwhile, has risen 0.4%, with the IBEX also climbing 0.2%. Somewhat predictably the FTSE couldn’t muster the same level of energy as its peers, struggling to break 7400 with a meagre 0.1% rise. Looking to the afternoon and the Dow Jones seems set to claw back more of its recent losses, with a 0.2% increase leaving it 20 points away from 23500. There’s not much worthwhile data to contend with – the existing home sales are expected to rise from 5.39 million to 5.42 million – meaning the focus will likely remain on any pre-Thanksgiving movement in the Republicans’ tax plans. Here’s our story on the UK budget deficit: Britain’s deficit unexpectedly widened in October, handing Philip Hammond disappointing news on the eve of the budget. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, grew by £500m to £8bn compared with October a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). City economists expected the deficit, which is the gap between government spending and tax receipts, to improve by £500m to stand at £7bn. The figures are likely to frustrate the chancellor as he puts the final touches to his budget speech – due to be delivered at about 12.30pm on Wednesday – as they point to a weaker picture than thought for the public finances. Hammond is coming under increasing pressure, including from senior Conservative figures, to increase spending amid widespread dissatisfaction with austerity. The full report is here: Time for a quick recap: Budget Eve has got off to a bad start for Philip Hammond, with new figures showing that Britain’s deficit rose last month. The UK borrowed £8bn in October, up from £7.5bn a year ago and almost a billion pounds more than the City expected. The higher borrowing was triggered by a rise in the cost of repaying the UK’s existing debts; the rise in inflation has pushed up the yield on index-linked government bonds. City experts say the figures highlights the dilemma facing Hammond. Tomorrow’s budget may show a rise in borrowing in future years, due to weak productivity. However, borrowing this financial year is still down almost 10%, rather better than forecast in March. Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, reckons the bad news will come in the budget forecasts: We’ve also seen that the weaker pound is helping British factories. New orders have accelerated at the fastest rate since 1988, with manufacturers seeing a rise in exports. Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, said: “UK manufacturers are once more performing strongly as global growth and the lower level of sterling continue to support demand. Output growth has picked up again, and export order books match the highest in more than 20 years. “Nonetheless, uncertainty continues to hold back investment and cost pressures remain strong. Manufacturers will be hoping the Budget brings some relief from the business rates burden in particular.” Airbus, the aeroplane manufacturer, has warned that Brexit could force its wing design business overseas. Other countries are ‘knocking on the door’, its UK boss says. The news that Britain’s deficit rose to £8bn last month has disappointed some City traders. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, says the chancellor would have hoped for a drop in borrowing (as economists had indeed expected). This isn’t the news Hammond will have been hoping for the day before the budget, as the deficit has increased to £8.0bn from £7.5bn a year earlier. Despite rises in income and VAT receipts and expectations the deficit would narrow closer to £7.bn, inflation and the effect it has had on debt costs has caused the deficit to widen and suggests Carney was right to start focusing on keeping inflation under control with his historical interest rate rise. William Anderson Jones, head of UK corporate dealing at RationalFX, says sterling hasn’t been hit, though: Higher borrowing costs due to inflation drove the deficit up, although the effect on the pound has been limited. The deficit figures come as analysts await Chancellor Phillip Hammond’s budget tomorrow. Today’s data highlights the challenge Hammond faces, as many analysts expect a call for more spending as the UK’s economic growth weakens. Investors will be watching the pound closely to see how it reacts tomorrow to the budget.” John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says Hammond will be pleased that borrowing has dropped during this financial year. But.... The more critical issue for the Budget is how public borrowing will evolve in future years. Lower than expected productivity growth is likely to weigh more heavily in the OBR’s new forecasts tomorrow than the borrowing undershoot this year. “We do expect the Chancellor to retain a reasonable amount of headroom in meeting his medium-term fiscal target, but he is likely to want to retain most of this as a contingency to deal with any future adverse Brexit-related shocks. While we do expect some giveaways in the Budget on housing, health and some areas of public sector pay, we also expect these to be largely offset by clawbacks in other tax and spending areas.” Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, agrees that the next few years will be tough. Hammond is still on target to beat a target of £58.3 billion for the 2017/18 financial year. Not bad considering the circumstances. This means that this year Hammond actually still has some room for manoeuvre, however looking ahead to the coming years, his challenge looks set to intensify. The ONS is expected to forecast lower levels of growth for the UK in the coming years. For the Chancellor, this means lower tax receipts and therefore less money coming in. Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation also reckons the chancellor’s headroom is shrinking... Over at parliament, the head of Airbus UK has warned MPs that other countries are keen to lure some of its British manufacturing business. Katherine Bennett told the Business, energy and industrial strategy committee that Airbus’s wing design business - its “crown jewels” – has won covetous looks from overseas. She also warned that Airbus staff who are EU citizens are very concerned about the future, and whether they’ll be able to work in the UK after Brexit. Airbus employs some 6,000 people at its North Wales plant at Broughton, Flintshire. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you’d expect, there’s an at-a-glance agenda of the day’s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Despite the recent surge in orders, UK factory bosses expect growth to slow over the next quarter. A failure to invest in new equipment may be to blame..... Newsflash: UK factories have just reported the biggest jump in new orders since 1988, as the weak pound boosts exports. That’s according to the CBI’s monthly survey of British manufacturing. It found that output rose in the last quarter, with more orders coming in from abroad. Some 28% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 11% said they were below normal. That gave a net balance of +17% -- the highest figure since August 1988. The CBI says that orders for food &amp; drink and chemicals rose particularly sharply. Export order books strengthened “notably” for chemicals, electronics and transport goods. Here’s John McDonnell MP, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, on today’s public finances: “These figures are a reminder of the continued failure of both Philip Hammond and Theresa May over these past seven years. The deficit has still not been eliminated as they promised it would be by 2015, and the national debt continues to grow. The rise in the Government’s deficit over October shows once again that seven years of Tory spending cuts have caused pain and misery for millions with little to show for it. “It further highlights why it is so vital that we see a change of course in the Budget tomorrow, halting the growing emergency in our public services and ending their failed austerity policies. “The next Labour government will set out a serious plan for the public finances with strategic investment underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule, to help build a high-wage, high-skill economy for the many not the few.” October’s borrowing figures are another sign that the Brexit vote is hurting the UK economy, says Labour MP Chris Leslie. He’s alarmed that rising inflation drove up the cost of servicing the national debt (as explained here). Leslie says it might prompt a rethink about Britain’s exit from the EU: “Rather than delivering a huge windfall for public services and our economy, it is clear that Brexit is in fact damaging the public finances. “Soaring inflation resulting from the fall in the value of the pound is resulting in rising debt costs. Our NHS and public services are being starved of vital funding. And the Brexit ‘war chest’ set aside by the Chancellor in March has now been virtually wiped out. “The Chancellor is running out of headroom. Nobody voted to be worse off, or for a weaker economy, and as these new facts emerge people are entitled to keep an open mind about whether this is the right course for our country.” Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY Item Club, says the “weakened” October public finances have denied Philip Hammond a boost ahead of Wednesday’s budget. But...he also expects borrowing for the full financial year to be below forecasts. Digging into the public finances, we can see that income tax receipts rose by 6.9% year-on-year in October, and VAT receipts rose by 2.3%. But corporation tax dropped by almost 1% compared with October 2016, and revenue from fuel duty dropped by 2.1%. You can see the dataset here. The full public finances report is online here. Bloomberg describe Britain’s October’s public finances as “disappointing”, ahead of Wednesday’s budget. However, they still expect borrowing for 2017-18 as a whole to be lower than forecast. The ONS reports that UK government income, and spending, are both higher than a year ago. In the current financial year-to-date, central government received £394.3bn in income, including £292.7bn in taxes. This was around 4% more than in the same period in the previous financial year. Over the same period, central government spent £420.4bn; around 3% more than in the same period in the previous financial year. Of this amount, just below two-thirds was spent by central government departments (such as health, education and defence), around one-third on social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, Child Benefit and Maternity Pay), with the remaining being spent on capital investment and interest on government’s outstanding debt. Ross Campbell, public sector director at accountancy group ICAEW, says Philip Hammond doesn’t have much wriggle room for tomorrow’s budget. Looking at the annual trend, we are still running a large deficit which means our national debt continues to grow. Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics reckons Britain will borrow less than forecast this financial year, despite the unexpected rise in October’s deficit. As this chart showed, the UK has been expected to borrow £58.3bn this financial year, up from £51.7 in 2016-17. However, the UK has only borrowed £38.5bn since April, some £4bn less than a year ago. Britain’s deficit jumped last month because the cost of repaying existing government debt jumped in October. That’s because some government bonds are linked to inflation, to protect bond-holders from a surge in the cost of living. The retail prices index has hit 4% in October -- as the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote has driven import costs higher. And this is now hitting the public finances, meaning the government has to borrow more (and thus repay more in the future....) As the ONS puts it: In October 2017, the debt interest paid by central government was £6.0 billion, while this represents the highest October interest payment on record it remains less than the highest recorded monthly payment of £7.2 billion in April 2017. This increase in debt interest payment is largely due to the movements in the level of the Retail Prices Index (RPI). Channel 4’s Helia Ebrahimi has tweeted the details: The big picture from today’s public finances is that the UK national debt continues to grow. The Office for National Statistics says: Public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) was £1,790.4 billion at the end of October 2017, equivalent to 87.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), an increase of £147.8 billion (or 4.5 percentage points as a ratio of GDP) on October 2016. This is the first time since June that Britain’s monthly deficit has risen year-on-year. This chart shows borrowing this financial year (dark blue) compared to 2016-17 (light blue). So, October’s £8bn deficit has eroded the improvement in the public finances since the spring. The jump in Britain’s deficit to £8bn last month highlights the ‘headache’ facing chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of Wednesday’s budget, say Reuters. Here’s their first take: Britain’s budget gap unexpectedly widened last month, underscoring finance minister Philip Hammond’s challenge as he juggles calls for more spending in his budget on Wednesday with the prospect of weaker economic growth ahead. The deficit, excluding state-run banks, stood at £8.0bn, up 6.9% compared with October 2016, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. Rising debt costs, linked to Britain’s higher inflation since the Brexit vote, were a driver of the shortfall. The budget shortfall was bigger than a median forecast of £7.0bn in a Reuters poll of economists. Breaking! Britain’s deficit was bigger than expected last month. The UK borrowed just over £8bn to balance the books in October, up from £7.56bn in October 2016 (that excludes the impact of Britain’s state-owned banks) That’s more than the £7bn which City economists had expected. But despite this rise in borrowing, Britain’s has borrowed less this financial year than a year ago. Public sector net borrowing since the start of this year has now reached £38.5bn, down 9.6% year-on-year. More to follow! In the City, shares in budget airline easyJet have soared to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after it reported a surge in bookings. EasyJet may be profiting from the collapse of rival Monarch, and Ryanair’s recent pilot shortage. But...catering giant Compass has slumped by up to 5% despite posting an 18% rise in operating profits. The City may be disappointed by an drop in revenue at its offshore business, which cleans and caters at remote oil and gas extraction and mining sites. Global investors seem to have shaken off the German election crisis. Asian stocks hit a 10-year high overnight, with traders citing optimism over the strength of the global economy. European markets have opened calmly this morning too, with the UK, French and German indices broadly flat. The word in the City this morning is that Germany’s economy is strong enough to shrug off the uncertainty of a second election (if it comes to that). But are things too quiet? Nick Leeson, the man who brought Barings Bank down in the 1990s, suspects there may be trouble ahead.... Even if October’s public finances do beat expectations this morning, Britain’s long-term borrowing needs are still worryingly high. Economists at JP Morgan say Philip Hammond will be batting on a ‘sticky wicket’ tomorrow, as the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (Britain’s fiscal watchdog) may revise down its growth forecasts. That will have a nasty impact on how much tax revenue the government might take in over the coming years. They write: Next week’s budget will be significant for both economic and political reasons. The OBR is set to downgrade its view of potential growth significantly, forcing the Chancellor to pencil in either more borrowing or more austerity—a particular challenge given the domestic political backdrop. The government lacks an overall majority and is under pressure to increase its financial offer ahead of the mid-December EU summit. The Chancellor is also under pressure to use fiscal policy to offer support to key parts of the electorate amid an ongoing real income squeeze, addressing these concerns while ensuring his budget has enough support in Parliament to pass. JP Morgan thus expect Hammond to absorb any growth downgrades by planning to borrow more over the next few years. This chart shows how the UK monthly deficit has fluctuated over the last two years: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain’s public finances will be in the spotlight today as we learn how much the UK borrowed to balance the books last month. Economists predict that the monthly deficit will hit £7bn, down from around £7.6bn in October 2016. A month ago, September’s deficit came in at just £5.9bn, the lowest in a decade, thanks to a bumper crop of tax takings. Any drop in the October deficit would be welcome news for chancellor Philip Hammond as he puts the finishing touches to tomorrow’s budget. Hammond faces a tricky task, given Britain’s productivity problems, and the looming impact of Britain’s exit from the EU. But so far this financial year, the UK has actually borrowed around £6bn less than expected. Finn McLaughlin of Capital Economics expects another decent month’s borrowing figures: We expect the public sector net borrowing requirement measure of borrowing to continue to undershoot the OBR’s forecast, providing some good news ahead of the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget on Wednesday. Indeed, we have pencilled in borrowing of £7.0bn in October, just below last year’s outturn of £7.5bn, leaving cumulative borrowing 7% lower than last year. However, this will probably be overshadowed by downward revisions to the OBR’s forecasts for economic growth and therefore the medium-term outlook for the public finances. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank thinks Hammond should use any windfall this wisely... Although Brexit uncertainty hangs over the UK’s long-term outlook, the economy continues to hold up well. Healthy tax receipts so far this year will likely lower projected borrowing modestly in the near term. The Chancellor ought to use this boost to finances to make a stronger commitment to budgetary discipline. Unfortunately, the political barriers between Hammond and this sensible route forward are probably too large. Also coming up today.... MPs on the Treasury committee will grill four Bank of England policymakers over the latest inflation report, and their decision to raise interest rates. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe (who opposed the rate hike) will be accompanied by three external members - Ian McCafferty, Gertjan Vlieghe and Michael Saunders. European investors will be watching German politics closely, after coalition talks floundered on Sunday night. Angela Merkel has hinted that she’d rather go through another general election than lead a minority government. After yesterday’s wobbles, the markets look calm this morning as traders await developments from Berlin. In the City, DIY chain Kingfisher, engineering firm Babcock, food producer Compass and budget airline easyJet are reporting results. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK public finances for October 10am GMT: Bank of England policymakers Sir Jon Cunliffe, Ian McCafferty, Gertjan Vlieghe and Michael Saunders appear before the Treasury Committee to discuss the Bank’s inflation report 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends report for October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/22/nasa-to-be-hit-by-csiro-engineers-stop-work-action-over-pay","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T17:00:25Z","webTitle":"Nasa to be hit by CSIRO engineers' stop-work action over pay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/nasa-to-be-hit-by-csiro-engineers-stop-work-action-over-pay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/22/nasa-to-be-hit-by-csiro-engineers-stop-work-action-over-pay","fields":{"headline":"Nasa to be hit by CSIRO engineers' stop-work action over pay","bodyText":"A group of Australian engineers whose work supports the Nasa deep space network are targeting the space agency with industrial action at a communication centre in Canberra. The employees of the Canberra deep space communication complex in Tidbinbilla are employed by Australia’s science agency the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), which is limiting their pay rises despite the fact they are paid out of Nasa’s budget. Unions have blamed the Australian government’s bargaining policy – which limits pay rises to 2% a year or less – for an impasse in the nine-month bargaining dispute. At 2.20pm on Wednesday more than 70 operational, engineering and administrative staff, will delay the handover of communications responsibilities from the Goldstone deep space complex in California with a one-hour stoppage in a bid to bring the dispute to Nasa management’s attention. The industrial action involves members of the Electrical Trades Union, Professionals Australia, and the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union. ETU Canberra organiser Mick Koppie told Guardian Australia the complex in Tidbinbilla was one of three tracking stations spread 120 degrees apart, each one a third of the way around the world, to provide Nasa with global deep space tracking and communication capabilities. He said staff in California would have to work overtime to cover the stoppage, otherwise screens tracking dozens of interplanetary spacecraft missions in the Nasa deep space network would “go black”. The industrial action was “not taken lightly” but was designed to make Nasa leadership aware of what Koppie called the “mismanagement” of the vital facility. Koppie said the unions had asked for existing pay rises of about 2.8% a year to be rolled over into a new three-year agreement and for planned roster changes cutting workers’ shifts and reducing take-home pay to be phased in over time. Koppie said it was an “extraordinary situation” because workers had been told the restrictive wages policy would apply to their wages “despite the fact that not one cent of funding for the Tidbinbilla deep space complex comes from the commonwealth government”. He queried why the CSIRO, which concluded an agreement with its other workers in August, did not apply to the government for an exemption from the policy. “Instead, they told Nasa the workers will only get 1-2% pay rises as if it were set in concrete; that’s not good faith bargaining.” Koppie said industrial action was likely to escalate further if CSIRO management refused to budge, potentially causing disruption to Nasa’s deep space tracking and communication capabilities. A CSIRO spokesman told Guardian Australia the agency was “continuing to discuss” the new workplace deal with staff and “is committed to negotiate a mutually agreed outcome”. “The action taken by the staff will not compromise the day-to-day operation of the station,” he said. In a separate dispute, the Community and Public Sector Union has challenged the bargaining policy by asking the industrial umpire, the Fair Work Commission, to grant pay rises to its immigration department staff above the policy’s limits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/21/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-jiang-tianyong-jailed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T03:41:43Z","webTitle":"'Travesty' trial ends in China with lawyer Jiang Tianyong jailed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-jiang-tianyong-jailed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/21/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-jiang-tianyong-jailed","fields":{"headline":"'Travesty' trial ends in China with lawyer Jiang Tianyong jailed","bodyText":"China has sentenced a prominent civil rights lawyer to two years in prison in a trial that was denounced as political theatre by critics. Jiang Tianyong, whose past clients include a wide range of activists such as the exiled dissident lawyer Chen Guangcheng, was sentenced on charges of “inciting subversion of state power” in the central city of Changsha on Tuesday morning, after languishing in detention for the past year. Jiang said he would not appeal against the conviction, according to the court’s official social media account. He was also deprived of political rights for three years. His case was part of a wider campaign focused on jailing and intimidating lawyers who took on politically sensitive cases that challenged the government. President Xi Jinping has overseen a sweeping crackdown on dissent since coming to power five years ago, and activists and diplomats have described it as the worst in three decades. “I don’t accept this sentence: the entire trial completely ignored China’s own laws and due process,” said Jin Bianling, Jiang’s wife, who has received asylum in the US. The government rejected lawyers she hired to defend her husband, and the state-appointed attorney refused to speak to her, Jin said. “I spoke to Jiang Tianyong briefly today. He told me he misses me and our daughter. He worries about us a lot.” During his trial in August, Jiang said he attended training sessions abroad where he was encouraged to reject China’s political system and ruling Communist party, saying he was “ashamed”, according to state media reports. The court also said he was guilty of applying for funds from overseas “anti-China” organisations, although it did not provide details. Jiang’s interviews with “foreign media” were also used as evidence of his efforts to “discredit organs of state power”. Human rights advocates said any admission of guilt was likely to have been coerced and rejected the charges against Jiang. “Today’s guilty verdict is the final act in this carefully managed play. Chinese authorities subjected Jiang to a litany of due process violations, including being forcibly disappeared and denied access to a lawyer and he was likely tortured to confess,” said Frances Eve, a researcher at the NGO Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders. The court also cited Jiang’s role in helping publish information on the plight of another human rights lawyer, Xie Yang, who detailed his account of torture in detention. Jiang disappeared while boarding a train in November 2016 and it was several weeks before the authorities confirmed he was in custody. “This case has been an absolute travesty from the beginning, sustained by nothing other than pure political persecution, not facts or broken laws,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/21/australia-will-have-its-own-weinstein-reckoning-its-just-a-matter-of-time","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T04:16:39Z","webTitle":"Australia will have its own Weinstein reckoning.

It's just a matter of time","bodyText":"Did you hear about the stand-up comedian? High-profile, well-known – and banned from several local venues because he touches up the female comedians. No one’s gonna talk about it – “not until he dies in an alcohol-fuelled car accident”, a friend from the scene has said. But the women don’t like him. They don’t feel safe when he’s around. What about the young male theatre maker? Before he started getting main stage gigs he was still doing shows on the fringe, and became obsessed with a woman also working with one of the theatres. He got her number, would not stop calling her, told her that he was in love with her, and one night, when she was at work, he cornered her. She just started bellowing until someone heard and intervened. She told the artistic director what happened; the man agreed to stop calling her, and to stay away from her when his show was on. But that was it. Then there’s that actor who hit his girlfriend at the party. Nobody saw exactly what happened but people intervened: someone bundled him into a car, while others looked after her. She didn’t want to press charges. She just wanted the abuse to stop. In the wake of the Weinstein allegations and the cascade of similar claims it’s provoked in the United States and Britain, Australia’s performing arts community has been obliged to examine its shadowy corners – because everyone knows stories like the ones that I mention, including the industry’s most powerful. Cast, the organisation which represents Australia’s high-profile, main-stage companies, has issued a statement condemning harassment and abuse, vowing to take action where it occurs. The actors’ union, MEAA, and the Screen Producers Association have launched a demand for sexual harassment policies to be included in a revamped Screen Safety Code, and Screen Australia has recirculated its own fact sheet on sexual harassment. The AFI/Aacta awards put out a slightly weird statement: they had never presented an award to Harvey Weinstein, they insisted – but, if they had, would be retracting it anyway. But as name after name has come forward to denounce Weinstein and others overseas, in Australia the new era of what I’ve called “collective de-shaming” is yet to fell any considerable mass of offenders in the open. It’s easy to imagine that it’s because Australia lacks a harassment culture; it’s also fanciful. The reaction of many male and female victims in Australia’s industry mirrors that of actor Sascha Horler. The ABC reported that when the Weinstein allegations broke, Horler first thought “that the Australian industry had left her relatively unscathed,” she told the ABC. “Then I went, ‘Oh hang on, I’ve normalised so much of this.” But now Tracey Spicer is discussing a list of 65 “media and entertainment” alleged offenders, which she has been collecting since her investigation launched last month. The ABC ran a feature detailing anonymous allegations in the theatre industry, and the Sydney Morning Herald did the same. On her new site Witness Performance, theatre critic Alison Croggon detailed “deeply distressing” stories she was sent in confidence, after a call-out, which implicated “well known names and unknown names, and every level of theatre”; and on Tuesday Fairfax revealed allegations of historic child sex offences against David Edward Lewis from Opera Australia. With local rumours circulating regarding the likely “outings” of alleged harassers and abusers, it’s been interesting to consider just what has fostered normalisation of harassment in Australia – and what may have so far prevented disclosures on a more public scale. Personally, it’s been confronting to realise that the few anonymous accusations that have been reported are easily identifiable. But while hearsay is plenty, direct witnesses – of course – are always few, and behind the scenes the women and young men abused are adamant that they don’t want to name names. Exploring the reasons for their enduring silence is the first step to redress. In Australia, the industry is small, the walls between the worlds of comedy, screen, TV and the stage are very thin, and a tiny pool of shared talent shares stories about creeps and perpetrators with some rapidity. But the industry’s small size perhaps also provides additional structural discouragement to expose harmful behaviour. Long-term women-in-film activist and now director of the For Film’s Sake festival, Sophie Mathisen, believes the unwillingness of women subjected to harassment and abuse to speak out more openly comes down to “a very real and palpable sense of reprisal.” She’s been critical of Screen Australia’s response for failing to address the existing gendered barriers to entering the film industry which foreground unequal power dynamics and isolate women from the onset. The same could be said for women in comedy, theatre and television. “Given the limited opportunities for women in the Australian creative arts sector,” says Mathisen, “it’s too risky for anyone to stick their neck out.” It’s a sense of risk that extends beyond the individual, to their collaborators, teams and communities. With intersections of influence concentrated amongst consistently small numbers of gatekeepers and practitioners, the disruption brought to systems by complaints and their ramifications is far more powerful – and personal – than in bigger, broader spheres. In this country, arts and entertainment budgets are tight, jobs are few, opportunities precarious. The removal of key production and artistic personnel can collapse an entire project, if not a company, risking other people’s money; precious, always-threatened infrastructure; and the income streams of other colleagues. I’ve worked with female actors who’ve only disclosed harassment incidents at the end of a tour, explicit in their desire to protect the investment of others in the show. Combine these material anxieties with the influences of broader societal sexism and the phenomenon of internalised shame – the window to abuse is wide and the disincentive to expose abusers even wider. Without proactive, pre-emptive intervention, abusive behaviour becomes a problem for the abused themselves to manage. I’m horrified at the fatalistic advice my own experience obliged me to share with my university students in a lecture 10 years ago: “Never meet a powerful person alone. Always meet them in a public place. If they put the hard word on you, pretend it’s a joke, pay them a compliment, leave immediately. If they want to hire you, they’ll call your agent. It’s only when they want to fuck you that they ask to meet you privately.” It says much that an underground resistance movement of rumours, whispers and warnings is one of the few resources that the abused and their allies retain. Again, perhaps it’s the small size of the Australian industry that allows word, repeated often enough, to traduce the trajectories to power of many predators. That actor who’d assault women at parties is no longer working; the gross theatremaker did not become famous; and in the new post-Weinstein climate, one wonders that the comedian’s anonymity may not yet endure. But to think the intimate nature of the industry has weeded out all predators would be naive. The lack of public disclosures in Australia to date does not mean the behaviour of individuals with power and stature is not being discussed. People are talking on sets, backstage, at pubs after work. Names and stories are being shared, phone calls are being made, and more abusers will be outed. And the old culture of normalisation may not yet be enough to weather the potential storm to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2017/nov/21/burst-your-bubble-australia-sour-grapes-on-the-right-after-yes-majority","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T04:27:01Z","webTitle":"Burst your bubble Australia: sour grapes on the right after yes majority | Jason Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/nov/21/burst-your-bubble-australia-sour-grapes-on-the-right-after-yes-majority","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/nov/21/burst-your-bubble-australia-sour-grapes-on-the-right-after-yes-majority","fields":{"headline":"Burst your bubble Australia: sour grapes on the right after yes majority","bodyText":"After shouting about threats to religious freedom for months, in the last few days conservative pundits and bloggers have trained their sights on a particular religion: Islam. Had the survey result in favour of same-sex marriage been any closer, we might be hearing more about how an ambivalent nation was not really ready for change. Instead, almost to a person, the Australian right has seized on the strong no vote in parts of western Sydney as evidence that Australian Muslims are out of step with mainstream values. It almost goes without saying, but all of this is based on a simplistic reading of the result. The Guardian’s data blog showed how religious belief in general, rather than the Muslim faith specifically, correlated most strongly with a no vote. Among other things that the right habitually forgets to mention is how many migrants, including from the Middle East, are devout Christians; along with native-born Christians, they disproportionately rejected same-sex marriage. In between the attempts to retrieve something from the same-sex marriage vote, there are a few pieces expressing sour grapes at what can only be seen as a significant defeat for social conservatives. No one on the right is willing to consider the possibility that it is those who proposed this antagonistic process, like former PM Tony Abbott, who are most out of touch with public opinion. No, this isn’t Bernardi’s revenge Publication: The Spectator Australia Author: Corinne Barraclough used to edit celebrity magazines. Her unique contribution has been to fuse the declarative sentences and non-sequiturs of that milieu with reactionary opinions, in the Australian Spectator and elsewhere. Why you should read it: Barraclough argues that politicians like Cory Bernardi should not be criticized for continuing the fight against evils like “radical theories about gender” following after the vote. In doing so, she summarises the basic thrust of the conservative response to last week’s defeat: carry on as if nothing has happened. Extract: “If the SSM discussion raised one issue above all else, it is indeed that many people are concerned about ‘radical theories about gender and sexuality’. Why should that conversation end now? Predictably left-wing reporting on Bernardi’s actions came with a rainbow spin. Are we all supposed to be still too busy dancing down Oxford Street to turn our attention to other issues that urgently need addressing?” Yes vote means a new minority needs protection Publication: The Daily Telegraph Author: It’s impossible to say which News Corp columnist has been the sorest loser, but Miranda Devine has done the most to seek out people who are even angrier about the result than she is. Why you should read it: Devine is determined to persist with the idea that socially conservative no voters are the victims of serious and ongoing oppression. So much so that she offers sympathetic coverage to a man who vandalized a mural, and a small businesswoman who received a likely fake inquiry about body waxing. The worst thing that anyone in the story seems to have endured is “ridicule”. Somehow, this does not qualify as “free speech”, which at other times has seemed to be Devine’s highest priority. Extract: “But Turnbull assured us during the campaign that he believed in religious freedom ‘even more strongly’ than in same-sex marriage. And now social conservatives find themselves disenfranchised and unprotected. Last week they were being ridiculed for trying to protect basic freedom of expression, association, thought, conscience or religion, and for upholding the right of parents to ensure the education of their children is in accordance with their beliefs.” Hypocrisy on Tap Publication: Quadrant Author: Peter O’Brien’s Quadrant bio describes him as a “retired Army officer with academic credentials in science and data processing”. His twin obsessions appear to be climate change denial and same sex marriage. Why you should read it: Tony Abbott devised the plebiscitary process as a way of stalling same-sex marriage when he was prime minister. As a backbencher, he led the no side to defeat. In any other milieu, this might constitute a challenge to his authority. On the hard right, it’s all the more reason to defend him against the media and the left. Extract: “So is there anyone in this whole process untainted by the charge of hypocrisy? Well, how about Tony Abbott? Clearly no homophobe, he steadfastly maintained his opposition to same-sex marriage while simultaneously putting in place the democratic mechanism by which it has been achieved. Even as an opponent he now graciously accepts that result. All he wants is to ensure that adequate protections for freedom of speech and religion, demanded by the 40% of No voters, are put in place. Abbott haters such as Niki Savva and Peter Van Onselen will portray this as just another example of his ‘wrecking’ both SSM and Turnbull. They will, of course, ignore the fact that respected former PM John Howard demands the same thing. Howard’s concerns will be presented as misguided but sincere, while those of Abbott will be depicted as the ‘opportunistic’ mouthings of a wrecker.” Why Muslims’ No vote in same-sex marriage survey is no mystery Publication: The Herald Sun Author: Andrew Bolt, multimedia purveyor of reactionary opinion. Why you should read it: Andrew Bolt is Australia’s leading conservative voice for a reason. He is capable of seamlessly pivoting from months of decrying the alleged intolerance and violence of the yes campaign to pointing the finger at Muslims in the wake of its victory. He prepared the way over the weekend by belatedly celebrating the yes victory, and claiming that it was almost sabotaged by those who fought against the survey, and by blaming Liberal divisions sown by their hard right on Malcolm Turnbull. Many others are trying to transform a conservative defeat into a victory by changing its meaning; few are as smooth, or as shameless as Bolt. Extract: “But I suspect the Left is also hiding from a tough question often raised by conservatives. Will our colonies of Muslim immigrants from the Middle East really assimilate with our values, or will a significant minority insist on their jarring own? What then of the Left’s cult of multiculturalism? Is it smart to have a government policy to ‘celebrate our diversity’ by encouraging migrants to preserve their own culture rather than merge with Australia’s?” Conservatives should prepare for a new SSM plebiscite no later than 2027 Publication: Catallaxy Files AUTHOR: John Adams is a frequent guest author on Catallaxy, which self-nominates as “Australia’s leading libertarian and centre-right blog”. Why you should read it: The day before the results came in, John Adams got in early with a conspiratorial take on the prospective result. The difficulty that social conservatives have is explaining how it is that the broader community’s attitudes on homosexuality have shifted so far from their own, in a way that absolves their position. For Adams, the idea that this might be of a piece with rising levels of tolerance over a long period is unacceptable. His fellow citizens must have been brainwashed. Extract: “There can be no question that an internationally integrated multi-dimensional and coordinated campaign has been pursued throughout the western world featuring Hollywood created or inspired cultural products (i.e. TV shows, Movies and Music) comprising of regularly featured gay characters as well as gay intimacy and sexual activity, educational messaging throughout primary and secondary schools, academically driven advocacy from University Arts Faculties as well as political and main stream media advocacy. These elements have been the catalyst for the ‘normalisation’ of attitudes relating to homosexuality and same sex relationships.” Jason Wilson is a Guardian reporter and columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/nov/21/australia-v-england-australia-v-england-womens-ashes-third-t20-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T11:49:21Z","webTitle":"Women's Ashes: England beat Australia to win third T20 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/nov/21/australia-v-england-australia-v-england-womens-ashes-third-t20-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/nov/21/australia-v-england-australia-v-england-womens-ashes-third-t20-live","fields":{"headline":"Women's Ashes: England beat Australia to win third T20 – as it happened","bodyText":"What. A. Game. Not just from Mooney, but Wyatt as well. Duelling banjoes, duelling hundreds, and a pulsating finish to this series. Imagine England had won on Friday, and this game was for the whole bag of prizes? Ah, perchance to dream. What a wonderful series it has been. The ODI contests with both teams battling towards a close finish in the first, Rachael Haynes exploding in the second, England hitting back in the third. The Test match with Perry’s double hundred and England’s last-day determination. The Australian celebrations after the first T20, then England’s fightback in Canberra. It has been a fine, fine time to follow the strangest game on earth. We’ve loved bringing it to you on the OBO, and we hope you’ll go back, read through the old editions, and keep your loved ones in future years informed about what happened in that greatest of Women’s Ashes years, 2017-18. We’ll be back with you when the blokes run around starting this Thursday. From Geoff Lemon, Adam Collins, and Vithushan Ehantharajah, farewell. Yes, it’s the Crazy 88 for Australia and England. The home side retains the Ashes, but it will have the slightly hollow feeling of a retention by the letter of the law rather than the spirit. This isn’t a win, and for England it might feel a bit more like one after coming back to win these last two games. They should never have been in it tonight. Not remotely close, after an utter masterclass from Beth Mooney. England needed the highest ever T20I run chase in the women’s game... and they produced it. Australia, of course, was key to letting that happen, with four - count them - supremely easy dropped chances. Healy had two with the gloves, Strano a sitter, and Schutt a simple one. Villani also may have got a hand on one running back, though that was a tougher chance. Australia took none of them. They dropped five catches on Friday and still got away with a comfortable win, but you can’t have the same happen on a consistent basis. 19 overs: England 181-6 (Wilson 5, Gunn 1) Let me recap - England started that 19th over needing 8 to win. The first ball, Wyatt went down, stumps everywhere. The second was a wide down leg, reducing the target to 7. The third was back to the bowler. The fourth was Wilson edging behind point, with a fielder running back but unable to get there. Then Brunt’s hearty drive took enough of the bat to fly away for four, before she was out from the fifth ball. England had seven balls left, but Wilson only needed one of them. As she does so well, she provides a ramp shot that runs fine to the boundary for four runs. Would you believe it? You wouldn’t, you really wouldn’t! One ball left in the Kimmince over, and Fran Wilson steps across her stumps and plays a ramp shot over her own head for four! The double strike from Kimmince, as Brunt tries to go over cover and Perry runs around to take the catch! But crucially between those wickets, Brunt edges a four through backward point. Another one goes down! I was so engrossed in the game that I forgot to write it down. Wyatt charges, tries to drive over cover again, and loses her middle stump! Full enough and straight enough. Another twist. 18th over: England 171-4 (Wyatt 100, Brunt 1) I’ll say it again - five days ago she had never passed 50 for her country. Tonight she has produced a fifty and a century to her name. 100 not out from 56 balls, and she’s the first England player ever to score one in a T20 International. England need 8 from 13. Perry the bowler, and Brunt the new bat can’t get the last ball of the over past her. Or is there another twist in the tail of the tale? Knight flicks two runs to raise her fifty from 35 balls, then sets off for a single and is sent back. It was never there. Healy just had to pick the bouncing ball up, run in and flick the stump. Oh my. 17th over: England 167-3 (Wyatt 99, Knight 49) Jonassen. The last over available from the dot-merchant. She’s been unhittable so far tonight. She’s hittable now. Times have changed, Jessica! Knight back away to crash four over cover, then goes inside out again and cover drives a six! 15 from the over, 12 needed from 18 balls now, as Wyatt follows Knight’s lead and adds another cover boundary. 16th over: England 152-3 (Wyatt 95, Knight 38) If anyone can take down Wyatt, it’s a Schutter. But Australia needs a straight Schutter. This is a wide Schutter. Outside off, and Knight cover drives perfectly into the gap for four more. She drives a single, Wyatt flicks one, and then... oh no. Megan Schutt bowls five wides. Looking to curl one into the pads, it keeps going and going, and there’s no way Healy can stop that, even if she hadn’t coated her gloves with spray-on canola oil at the start of the night. Four more, as Wyatt carves through point, then four again as she opens the face. Everything she has tried has worked. She’s within sight of a century. 20 from the over. Beth Whoney? 15th over: England 132-3 (Wyatt 86, Knight 32) Wyatt is the gunslinger. Sharpshooter. Lines up Kimmince’s medium pace, and plays an outrageous shot. Inside-out square drive. Through the gap at point. Cover and backward are there, but no one square. Four runs. Has a big swing at the next, and edges four more! Genuine nicks are good T20 shots, kids. 12 from the over, Wyatt threatening a second century in the match, and 47 from 30 needed. 14th over: England 120-3 (Wyatt 76, Knight 30) Four more! Strano back on with the ball, and Wyatt produces some delicate touch, steering through third man! The ball is almost stopped by Jonassen, but her touch can’t stop it reaching the rope. And again! Over cover this time! Gave herself space, lofted that deliberately, inside out and it flies away! Single, then Knight gets two with a reverse shot. They need 59 from 36. This is on. 13th over: England 106-3 (Wyatt 65, Knight 27) Dropped again! Would you believe this? Heather Knight has been dropped more than Shaun Marsh. Another simple chance for Healy, top edge from Delissa Kimmince this time, and again the ball drops from a height and slips out of the Aussie keeper’s gloves. Again they take a single, and again Wyatt celebrates with a big hit, this time through cover for four. The hundred is up. Is this on? Could this possible be on? 12th over: England 97-3 (Wyatt 60, Knight 24) Dropped again! Australia shelling them like mussels here today. Knight’s slog-sweep off Gardner goes straight to Schutt on the boundary, who reaches for it like an AFL novice going hard hands for a mark. Can only palm it down. After the single, Wyatt pumps six more over midwicket!. 11th over: England 88-3 (Wyatt 53, Knight 22) Knight v Wellington is a fair battle. The skipper lofts two runs out to deep cover, then pulls out the reverse to get three more to fine third man. Wyatt goes big, mis-hitting down toward long-on, but Villani running back can’t quite get hands to the ball. Maybe a fingertip. So Wyatt says good, my luck is in, and goes hard over cover. Gardner is on the rope, shuffles back, shuffles back, heels on the fibre, and can’t reach the ball with the leap. Five days ago, Danni Wyatt didn’t have a single international fifty. Now she has two. This one off 37 balls, the other off 35. 10th over: England 73-3 (Wyatt 44, Knight 16) Megan Schutt back in to bowl, who has been so good during this series. 18 wickets to date. Nearly has Knight stumped second ball, with Healy up to the stumps, but the captain just got the foot down. Heather Knight’s foot, incidentally, has a stress fracture that will keep her out of the WBBL this season. She’s just pushing through to finish this series. Schutt nearly bowls a great over, but slips the last ball too wide and Wyatt pumps it over cover. 9th over: England 65-3 (Wyatt 38, Knight 14) “Be thankful for what you have, work hard for what you don’t have.” That’s what the tattoo on Amanda Wellington’s inner left arm says, and that’s the kind of detail and colour I can bring you from following the game around the world. Can’t see it with the long sleeves on. Wellington works hard for an outside edge, but it goes safely past Healy for two runs. She has more hard work to do when Knight smashes four runs over cover, lovely inside out shot to the rope. Wellington does that work to beat England’s captain in flight, but has little reason to be thankful when Strano runs around from short fine and drops the simple catch. 8th over: England 55-3 (Wyatt 36, Knight 6) Shot! Ash Gardner comes on, and Wyatt greets her first off-break with a whip over midwicket for four. Timing there. Knight plays a reverse for a couple of runs, sweeps a single, then Wyatt doubles down. They’ve moved long-on squarer after her last shot, but she still splits the two fielders in the deep. 7th over: England 43-3 (Wyatt 27, Knight 3) Ellyse Perry on for her first over. Wyatt welcomes the pace, walloping four runs over mid-off. She mostly has one shot, that slap down the ground, and she used it to fine effect in the first game in Sydney. She tries a cut next ball, but Strano dives and fields atheltically at pint to keep the shot to one. Boundary bound, before that. Think it’s more backs through the wall time. Leaving a crisp, cartoon, England-cricket-team shape in the bricks. 6th over: England 36-3 (Wyatt 21, Knight 2) Strano bowling. Singles, and a big edge from Wyatt for two. They just can’t connect. 5th over: England 30-3 (Wyatt 17) “It’s been on the cards,” says Charlotte Edwards. It has been on the cards. The Christmas cards, saying ‘See you next year.’ Sciver’s Ashes tour is done. Jonassen did the job again, just three singles from the over, so Sciver went for a sharp run from the last ball. Elyse Villani set well back at mid-off produced a ripper throw, and broke the stumps well in advance of the sliding bat. 4th over: England 27-2 (Wyatt 15, Sciver 6) “We’ll do it singles,” Wilfred Rhodes probably didn’t say, and the approach isn’t going to work for England now either. They do work a few runs, then Wyatt tries an almighty and hideous slog to the leg side. Big top edge towards cover. It hangs around longer than an unwelcome housemate. Healy gets around to pitch a tent under it. Then when it finally drops, it bounces through the heels of her hands into her sternum, and onto the ground. Painful, and painful. Sciver slogs next ball and top edges over cover, and Haynes running back does a full 360 trying to find the ball in the air. Nearly falls over her own feet in the Tassie Devil routine, and the ball drops safe. 3rd over: England 20-2 (Wyatt 10, Sciver 2) England getting ragged and desperate as Sciver comes to the crease. She sprints for a single driven straight to cover, and would have been well out had the throw hit. There’s another dicey single to the on-side, then Sciver drives straight, beats mid-off, takes two, and is nearly run out again trying for a third. Sent back and dives back in. Chillllll, Winston. And back goes the pendulum the other way! The left-arm spinner again, Taylor leans back as she drives, and Haynes takes a fine diving catch coming forward. 2nd over: England 16-1 (Wyatt 10, Taylor 5) England with the advantage in this over. Taylor produces a perfect on-drive for four. Wyatt clouts another straight down the ground. They run hard, hustle, and get 13 from the over. That’s the right stuff. My colleague is... niche. 1st over: England 3-1 (Wyatt 2, Taylor 0) Jonassen often opens the bowling, and that’s why. Dots and singles, then the wicket from the fifth ball. And that doesn’t help. The required rate starts at more than 9 per over, so the pressure is on England to launch immediately. That’s not exactly what Australia did, but it’s harder to take your time in the second innings. Beaumont steps out, tries to clear mid-off, and the left-arm spinner for Australia is very hard to hit. Right, the job is all ahead of England. This will take the highest ever run chase. The current crowd is 3274, but a final number will come out later. Can’t tell you how happy I am that Lorde has been played on the PA at every game this Women’s Ashes. What a record. What a songstress. What a tune. Here’s the Picasso version. Excuse me a minute while I catch my breath. It feels like I just ran up three flights of stairs. Which we’ve been doing a lot in Canberra. The last hour or so, though, I’ve just been sitting holding the same bit of arancini halfway to my mouth, unable to put it down or finish it off. Beth Mooney, gearing up for the WBBL in the finest possible style. 20th over: Australia 178-2 (Mooney 117, Perry 22) Shrubsole has the job for the last over of the innings. Singles down the ground for each to begin. England will take that. They have a huuuuge job ahead of them. Mooney! Of course she does, through point just as she began the night with square drive to the point boundary. Oh goodness me, this is GENIUS cricket - gets down low to lap the England champion with the most ridiculous timing. More a scoop than a lap. Another four. And another! Three on the trot! This time it is catching height, Wilson diving to her right at full stretch but can’t quite get there. Third highest T20 score for Mooney now. MAKE THAT SECOND! FOUR IN A ROW! Drives the last ball through cover to do it one last time. Blimey, what an ending. 19 fours and one six, 70 balls. You don’t see many better innings than that. A joy to OBO those 20 overs. What a player, Beth Mooney. Over to Geoff. 19th over: Australia 160-2 (Mooney 100, Perry 21) Perry holds up her end of the bargain, a single first ball to get Mooney back on strike. Knight takes her time with the field, Hazell with the ball in her hand. Two away. Lovely timing out to point, weight transfer spot on. But only one there, Wyatt racing around from deep cover to ensure she’ll need to play another strike for a hundred. Perry plays another deft little late cut - does anyone play it better? Stopped on the rope from some committed fielding, only two there. Then one down the ground. So we go again, Mooney on 99. Two balls to go. The fielders outside the rope are straight. She drops it into cover and does it! What a century that is! The fifth in World T20s played by women, the first ever in Australia. 65 balls to get there, 15 boundaries and one six. Magical hand. Perry gets in on the party with the last ball, sweeping four to fine leg. 18th over: Australia 150-2 (Mooney 98, Perry 13) Gunn is back on and Mooney is sweeping the first ball for four more behind square! Has a go at getting there in one hit too, but doesn’t get enough of it. Lands just short of Brunt at deep cover. Perry’s turn. Oh, and she’s played the most immaculate late cut. Deep in the crease as we saw so often through her Test Match double ton. Last ball of the over, Mooney is on 96 and back on strike. Will she have a pop? Fielders outside the ring at deep midwicket, deep cover, long-off and long-on... an no. She’s happy enough clearing the ring. Races back for two! Determined running puts her within two of the a rare Women’s T20 international century. 150 up as well. 17th over: Australia 138-2 (Mooney 91, Perry 8) Ecclestone returns from the Pool End. Lovely old pool it is, too. Quick single taken first ball, Perry to the danger end and just back. Another single gets Mooney her second chance in the over. She slices past backward point for two, just into the gap. Excellent comeback from Ecclestone, darting one through the gate after Mooney drives. Is that a missed stumping from Taylor? I think it might be! Rare! Mooney responds the only way she knows how, having a massive swing over midwicket, Brunt unable to hold onto the catch on the rope, parrying it over for Mooney’s first six! She’s into the 90s with three overs to go! 16th over: Australia 127-2 (Mooney 81, Perry 7) Up and over the cover field for four more! Inside-out, perfect from Mooney to begin Gunn’s new over. That makes 120, the run-a-ball mark, with plenty of balls to go. Mooney keeps going, pulling this time through midwicket. Boundaries in consecutive balls. To 80. This is perfect T20 batting from the Queenslander. A ton well within her grasp. 14 boundaries in her stay so far. Keeps the strike with a single out to extra cover again. Another double-digit over, 12 off this. 15th over: Australia 115-2 (Mooney 71, Perry 5) Brunt back for her fourth and final. Perry goes first up, but only enough bat to get a single to third man. Very handy use of her change of pace later in the over, keeping Perry put for three consecutive dots. Field goes out on the legside before the final delivery and she has misdirected that way, a wide signalled. Perry takes a single down the ground to finish it off. Six from it. Five overs to go. 14th over: Australia 109-2 (Mooney 68, Perry 3) Captain Knight has another go. But it doesn’t work, Mooney nailing a lofted drive down to long on for four more! And again, with a shot far more subtle, paddling to short fine. She’s been outstanding tonight. 12 from the over. Australian rocking and rolling again. 13th over: Australia 97-2 (Mooney 57, Perry 2) Nicely done by Hazell, racing through the over with the new pair yet to settle. A wide in there, but three runs only. Mini-fightback, maybe, after a couple good overs on the trot. 12th over: Australia 94-2 (Mooney 56, Perry 1) Before the wicket fell, Mooney was ever so clever playing a delecate dab after charging and readjusting. All-but yorked herself, but had the timing to get it fine enough for another four. She’s still got ample time for three figures, I reckon. There’s the second for England. Villani comes down to a quicker Ecclestone delivery, missing a late-cut and that’s the end of that. 11th over: Australia 86-1 (Mooney 50, Villani 15) Well, they have a plan for Villani. All four fielders outside the circle are on different parts of the legside rope, Hazell coming around the wicket and targeting the pads. But she gets off strike with a single. Villani gets another chance later in the over and tries on a premeditated reverse - down in position before the ball is bowled - making only partial contact. Mooney gets one to cover to the penultimate ball of the set, moving her to another half-century. Nine fours in 38 balls. Doing the job. Villani last ball finds a way through that legside field, whacking it out to long-on for four. Australia on for 160-180 here. 10th over: Australia 78-1 (Mooney 48, Villani 9) Brunt to continue, her third in the spell. Mooney off the front foot is clever, accessing her favoured backward square leg area with a standing little pull-flick off the front foot. Brunt hates it, understandably. Just when England were about to complete a good over, Brunt is lifted over midwicket into the game by Mooney who gets a ninth boundary to finish off the first half of the innings! Fantastic batting. 9th over: Australia 71-1 (Mooney 43, Villani 7) Villani goes hard off Shsubrole’s second ball back into the attack, recording the first six of the evening via a sweep over fine leg. A lot of hang-time, but did enough to clear the rope. That makes it Mooney’s turn to go again, the opener creating room before punching another boundary through the off-side. Her eighth four. Makes it 11 off the over. 8th over: Australia 60-1 (Mooney 39, Villani 1) Wouldn’t be a Manuka game if I didn’t mention the truly magnicicent Jack Fingleton scoreboard we’re looking at across the field, which sat proudly at the MCG until 1981. It was renamed after Fingleton when it made the journey to Canberra because he was a fine Australian opening bat of the Bodyline era that went on to live here as a political journo post-cricket. Nice, ay? Healy has picked out Knight at extra cover and it is a sharp catch! Looked to be preparing to launch herself after smacking Brunt through midwicket earlier in the over, but the Ian Harvey Slower Ball has done her in, miscuing the attempted slap. 7th over: Australia 54-0 (Mooney 38, Healy 15) Field out, but that ain’t a thing for Beth Mooney. She brings up the Australian 40 with another superb flick over backward square. 40 balls for Australia to reach their first milestone of the night. Jenny Gunn the new bowler here, I should note. A few singles through the rest of it. If Mooney bats 20 overs she’ll easily reach triple figures. Now I’ve said that, you can be sure this lovely little innings will be over inside ten minutes. Sorry in advance, Beth. 6th over: Australia 47-0 (Mooney 32, Healy 14) Katherine Brunt now from the Shops End. Could probably call that the Parliament House End as well, where I spent six years of my life. First ball of her night it is a familiar story, Mooney collecting another four! This is class, on the balls of her feet and steering past point. Fantastic batting. She clips two more from the hip, hard running earning warm applause. The quick does well to fight back, finishing the over with three dots and a single. And that’s the power play. A couple of those earlier boundaries. 5th over: Australia 40-0 (Mooney 25, Healy 14) Healy’s turn, inside-out over extra cover for another four! Hazell gave it some air, but the punchy keeper-bat was easily up to the task. And again: pulling with real force behind square for another! Boundaries six and seven. Tries to make it eight, but miscues, falling well short of Wyatt at deep midwicket. Mooney takes a quick single to finish it off. 11 from that one, and still another to go in the power play. 4th over: Australia 29-0 (Mooney 23, Healy 5) Beth Mooney is on one! Dances at Ecclestone and whacks her over the top, over her head. One bounce, two, over the rope. Then pulls the next, a short ball that sat up. This only bounces one time before registering the same result. Five boundaries for Mooney in four overs. A reminder: she didn’t play in the ODIs earlier this month. Down the ground for one more to keep the strike. Ten from it. They’re away. 3rd over: Australia 19-0 (Mooney 14, Healy 4) Hazell from the Pool End. Healy off strike straight away. Oh that’s filth, waist-high fully that Mooney helps on its way to fine leg for a third four in as many overs. Wyatt comes into the circle at deep point so they can push a second fielder out on the legside - only two allowed out in the opening six over power play. So Mooney goes down the ground instead. Healy retains the strike. This is a good start. 2nd over: Australia 12-0 (Mooney 9, Healy 2) Ecclestone, Sophie. From the Cathedral or Manuka Shops End. I love a joint with multiple names for their ends. Especially one named after some shops. Very Canberra. Nice stride in from Healy, taking one to cover. Looking solid early for her part. Mooney uses her feet wonderfully later in the over, making perfect contact with a flick and splitting the gap between long-on and deep midwicket for her second boundary. This game is live on the telly in both Australia and the UK. Pop it on. 1st over: Australia 7-0 (Mooney 5, Healy 1) Shoooot. First ball Mooney is away with a delicious square drive. She misses well wide of off-stump, the sundries underway as well. Shrubsole freely admits she hasn’t had her best tour, so she’ll be determined to fight back hard enough. Couple of singles rounds it out, Healy to keep the strike. Out they race. England on the sprint. Australia’s openers, Mooney and Healy, letting them wait. There are approximately 40 kids still on the field. As Henry Cowen, ECB media boss, says across the press box: “you can’t have that many people inside the ring, I’m afraid.” Good start. Righto. Anya Shrubsole has the ball in her hand, coming from the Manuka Pool End. PLAY! While we’re waiting for the main event tonight... Hard to avoid what’s going on in Brisbane. You’ve probably seen Nathan Lyon’s frolic. Now for the Matt Prior return of serve on twitter just before. Goodness me. Never a bad decision at Canberra, no matter what the format or what the occasion. As it happens, the nation’s capital has turned on another gorgeous night. We should be in for a spectacular sunset before the equally spectacular light towers take over. Teams, you ask? I have them. England are unchanged from the XI that won at the same group on Sunday. Australia the one change, the aforementioned leggie Amanda Wellington for seamer Sarah Aley. Australia: Mooney, Healy (+), Villani, Perry, Haynes (c), Gardner, Kimmince, Wellington, Jonassen, Strano, Schutt England: Wyatt, Beaumont, Taylor (+), Sciver, Knight (c), Brunt, Filson, Gunn, Ecclestone, Shrubsole, Hazell A month of quality cricket comes to an end in Canberra tonight. Sure, the series-at-large was resolved on Friday night - the Women’s Ashes trophy is staying in Australia. But England are determined to depart home with the T20 mini-series. I’m not sure if that warrants a trophy as such, but it’s certainly something ahead of next year’s World T20. If Heather Knight’s side do get up, they will also finish with an 8-8 points tally across the three formats. Not a bad effort after giving up the first four points on offer. Adam Collins with you here at Manuka Oval to take you through the first innings, before Geoff Lemon takes the OBO baton for the second. No sign of teams as yet from the warm ups, but I’m reliably informed Amanda Wellington has been recalled to the local XI. We’ll know all when the toss is run and won in a tic. Let’s hope for a fitting finish. Adam will be here shortly. In the meantime, have a read of Vithushan Ehantharajah’s feature on the fallout from England’s Women’s Ashes loss."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"law/2017/nov/20/no-british-judge-on-world-court-for-first-time-in-its-71-year-history","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T23:21:30Z","webTitle":"No British judge on world court for first time in its 71-year history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/nov/20/no-british-judge-on-world-court-for-first-time-in-its-71-year-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/nov/20/no-british-judge-on-world-court-for-first-time-in-its-71-year-history","fields":{"headline":"No British judge on world court for first time in its 71-year history","bodyText":"The UK will not have a judge on the bench of the international court of justice for the first time in its 71-year history after the British candidate withdrew following an acrimonious competition. Minutes after an 11th round of voting was scheduled to begin in New York on Monday, a letter was released by the UK mission to the UN announcing that Sir Christopher Greenwood would accept defeat and allow the rival Indian candidate, Dalveer Bhandari, to fill the final vacancy on the ICJ. The decision to bow to mounting opposition within the UN general assembly is a humiliating blow to British international prestige and an acceptance of a diminished status in international affairs. That the runoff for the last place on what is known as the world court was between Britain and India, a nation likely to feature as a more significant trading partner post-Brexit, may have been a contributory element in the final calculations. There have been calls in Indian media for the country to leave the Commonwealth if the UK exploited its position as one of the five permanent members of the security council to defend its weakened position. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges elected to nine-year terms by the UN general assembly and the UN security council. Four other judges, from Brazil, France, Lebanon and Somalia, had already been elected to the ICJ in the earlier rounds. In the last round of voting at the UN a week ago, Greenwood secured only 68 votes in the general assembly against Bhandari’s 121 votes. The British candidate, however, had nine votes in the UN security council against the Indian’s five. A majority in both the general assembly and security council was required to win a place on the ICJ bench. The race for the last place involved weeks of diplomatic lobbying and, in the end, the UK was partially the victim of residual international resentment in the UN general assembly of the dominance and privileges of the permanent five members of the security council – the US, Britain, France, China and Russia. Other factors also torpedoed UK efforts. Greenwood, a highly experienced and capable lawyer, was tainted in some eyes because of his advice to the Blair government in the run-up to the Iraq invasion in 2003. He was instructed by the then attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, to examine the arguments over the legality of using force against Saddam Hussein and concluded that use of force was justified. This is the second time the UK has been humiliated at the UN in recent months, amid signs that some EU nations no longer feel the need to automatically support an isolationist former partner. The outcome was seen as a significant moment in the history of the court. Dr Damian Gonzalez Salzburg, of Sheffield University’s centre for International and European Law, said: “It will be the first time in UN history where less than five judges from the most powerful regional group will sit at the ICJ. This may indicate the will of non-Western States to challenge Western privileges enshrined in customary rules for ICJ elections”. Another factor may have been continuing resentment of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and his undiplomatic put-downs of other countries. In a separate vote at the UN general assembly last June, the UK was defeated 94-15 when a Mauritian-backed resolution questioning the disputed legal status of the UK’s hold over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean was referred to the ICJ. The world court, which is based at The Hague, hears disputes over sovereignty and international borders from all over the globe. Greenwood had served one nine-year term as a judge there. The letter from Matthew Rycroft, the UK’s permanent representative at the UN, said: “The current deadlock is unlikely to be broken by further rounds of voting. “We have therefore consulted our candidate, Sir Christopher Greenwood, who has confirmed that his candidature for re-election to the international court of justice should be withdrawn. “In taking this step, we have borne in mind the close relationship that the United Kingdom and India have always enjoyed and will continue to enjoy, and the fact that both candidates fulfil the requirements for election and have already served the court diligently with impartiality and independence.” The letter added that had voting been stalemated again, there is a mechanism for resolving disputes – a joint conference between the UN security council and general assembly - but it acknowledged that “some thought needs to be given to this procedure before the next ICJ election in order that it might be used when it is clearly needed”. Rycroft added: “The UK has concluded that it is wrong to continue to take up the valuable time of the security council and the UN general assembly with further rounds of elections. “The UK congratulates the successful candidates, including Judge Bhandari of India. We are naturally disappointed, but it was a competitive field with six strong candidates. “If the UK could not win in this runoff, then we are pleased that it is a close friend like India that has done so instead. We will continue to cooperate closely with India, here in the United Nations and globally.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/20/justice-department-aims-to-block-atts-85bn-takeover-of-time-warner","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T13:38:11Z","webTitle":"AT&T's Time Warner takeover: justice department aims to block $85bn deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/20/justice-department-aims-to-block-atts-85bn-takeover-of-time-warner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/20/justice-department-aims-to-block-atts-85bn-takeover-of-time-warner","fields":{"headline":"AT&T's Time Warner takeover: justice department aims to block $85bn deal","bodyText":"The US Department of Justice on Monday moved to block AT&amp;T’s $85bn takeover of Time Warner, one of the largest media deals ever announced. The decision to file suit against the deal is likely to set off a high stakes court battle – AT&amp;T has already signaled it will go to court if the deal is blocked – and will start one of the biggest corporate merger legal battles in decades. The suit argues the deal will “substantially lessen competition, resulting in higher prices and less innovation for millions of Americans”. “This merger would greatly harm American consumers. It would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy,” said assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim of the department’s antitrust division. David McAtee, AT&amp;T’s general counsel called the suit “a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent”. The US authorities had already called for major changes before signing off on any deal. Critics have claimed the deal is being held hostage because of Donald Trump’s antipathy towards CNN, owned by Time Warner and which he has branded as “fake news”. The deal was first announced in October 2016, just weeks before the presidential election. During the campaign, and since his election, Trump has regularly attacked CNN, calling the network “terrible” and “fake news” at his first press conference after the election. Trump attacked the network again while on his recent tour of Asia, calling it “bad” and “FAKE”. Reports suggested that AT&amp;T, the world’s largest telecommunications company, had offered to sell CNN in order for a deal to go through. But the chief executive officer, Randall Stephenson, denied any such compromise had been offered. “Throughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so,” he said in a statement earlier this month. In a press conference after the news broke Stephenson acknowledged the speculation that Trump’s antipathy to CNN had sparked the legal move. “Frankly I don’t know,” he said. “But nobody should be surprised that the question keeps coming up.” Stephenson said the deal had “the whole world” questioning what the justice department “can and cannot do”. He said any deal would protect CNN’s “first amendment rights” and no deal would be struck without the news channel. Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO, Warner Brothers and other big-name media properties, does not compete directly with AT&amp;T meaning there is little argument against the deal on competition grounds. But the justice department argues that combining Time Warner’s assets with AT&amp;T and its DirecTV satellite television business would directly harm consumers, quoting statements from DirecTV that so-called “vertically integrated programmers” – which own the means of distribution as well as the content – can “much more credibly threaten to withhold programming from rival [distributors]” and can “use such threats to demand higher prices and more favorable terms”. “Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently,” said McAtee. “Fortunately, the Department of Justice doesn’t have the final say in this matter. Rather, it bears the burden of proving to the US district court that the transaction violates the law. We are confident that the court will reject the government’s claims and permit this merger under longstanding legal precedent.” The deal comes as tech giants Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix are increasingly challenging traditional media players and competing for their audiences. But the deal would hand some of the most powerful brands in media to the largest player in telecom. Comcast, the US’s largest broadband provider, took over NBC Universal, owner of the NBC network and Universal Studios in 2009 and that deal has been roundly criticised by senators who believe Comcast has used its cable dominance to quash competition. Stephenson has argued that it “borders on comical” to suggest AT&amp;T would be too powerful after a merger. The Writers Guild of America West welcomed the news. “As we have stated since this deal was first proposed, the size, scope and potential harm to both consumers and content creators provide ample reason to block the merger on its merits. “The proposed combination of must-have content with vast control over distribution would give the company broad power to undermine competition, restrict access to programming and raise prices,” the guild said in a statement. “With reports surfacing each week of other possible media mergers, blocking this deal has only become more critical.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/21/chile-election-pinera-guillier-frente-amplio","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T08:00:53Z","webTitle":"Chile faces new political landscape as leftwingers dent billionaire Piñera's hopes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/chile-election-pinera-guillier-frente-amplio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/21/chile-election-pinera-guillier-frente-amplio","fields":{"headline":"Chile faces new political landscape as leftwingers dent billionaire Piñera's hopes","bodyText":"Chile, so used to geological upheavals, faces a vastly changed political landscape after a progressive alliance surged ahead in Sunday’s general election, and left conservative presidential frontrunner Sebastián Piñera facing a tough fight in December’s run-off. Piñera, a billionaire and former president, had been widely expected to cruise to victory – and possibly even win outright in the first round. He still took first place, taking 36% of the vote, but faced a strong challenge by two main leftwing rivals who between them won 43%. Former TV news anchor Alejandro Guillier, who heads a centre-left alliance, came second in the presidential race, but the real political earthquake, was the emergence of a new political force, the Frente Amplio – or Broad Front – whose roots can be traced to student protests that shook the country in 2011. Often compared to the Podemos movement in Spain, the FA is an anti-establishment alliance of left-liberal parties, ecologists, humanists and grassroots organizations. Among the movement’s demands are the replacement of Chile’s neoliberal economic model together with the Pinochet-era constitution; broad changes to the country’s pension system; and major reforms in health, education, workers’ rights and wages. Led by Beatriz Sánchez, a 46-year-old journalist who came third with 20% of the popular vote, Frente Amplio will now also control 12% of the 155-seat chamber of deputies. According to political scientist Claudio Fuentes, the main outcome of the election is a fragmented parliament polarised between the right and left – and a complex, unpredictable scenario for the second-round presidential vote in which the FA finds itself a reluctant kingmaker. “After this triumph by Frente Amplio, the main issue is what proportion of that vote will now go to Alejandro Guillier,” said Fuentes. “Piñera will present a more moderate image to try and win over wavering centrists.” Frente Amplio supporters now face a choice: do they swing behind a Guillier-led coalition, which includes some of the parties in the current coalition government led by Michelle Bachelet, or do they carry on as radical independents and focus on building a popular base? Sunday’s election was also marked by a high level of voter abstention, continuing a trend witnessed in presidential elections four years ago when just under half of the electorate turned out to vote. “The main problem in Chile is a growing disaffection. Many people simply don’t have any interest in or identify with the country’s politicians,” said Claudia Heiss, a political science professor at the University of Chile. Such frustration with the political class motivated many of the reforms introduced during the present Bachelet government. One such reform was a gender quota law and women have certainly witnessed a strong improvement in their representation in the country’s parliament. Female deputies in the lower chamber jumped from 16 to 23%, with a similar hike in the country’s senate. According to Marcela Ríos, National Officer for Democratic Governance at the UNDP in Santiago: “We’ve never had an increase of more than 2 or 3% before in the congress – so this is really significant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/20/british-cycling-shane-sutton-bradley-wiggins-jason-cundy-tues","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T22:00:41Z","webTitle":"Shane Sutton claims of common use of TUEs to ‘find gains’ upset British cyclists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/20/british-cycling-shane-sutton-bradley-wiggins-jason-cundy-tues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/20/british-cycling-shane-sutton-bradley-wiggins-jason-cundy-tues","fields":{"headline":"British cyclists upset by Shane Sutton’s claims of use of TUEs to ‘find gains’","bodyText":"British cyclists are disturbed that their former technical director Shane Sutton considered therapeutic use exemptions an acceptable way for athletes to find a marginal gain in their ability to compete. Jody Cundy said he believed Sir Bradley Wiggins’s name had been “muddied” with the revelation that he had obtained therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), in effect a doctor’s note to permit banned substances to be taken for the legitimate treatment of a medical condition, on three occasions. They allowed Wiggins to take the corticosteroid Kenacort, allegedly a performance enhancing substance, before the biggest road races of his career, including his 2012 Tour de France victory. Sutton, who was technical director at British Cycling and remains a consultant for Team Sky, said it was common a few years ago for athletes to use TUEs to “find gains” if they had a minor injury which permitted them to apply for one. “If you have an athlete who is 95% ready and that little 5% niggle or injury that is troubling him, if you can get that TUE to get him to 100%, yeah of course you would in them days,” the Australian coach said in a BBC documentary, adding: “You definitely don’t cross the line and that’s something we’ve never done.” It is not clear if Sutton was referring specifically to Wiggins but Cundy, a seven‑times Paralympic champion in swimming and cycling, said he felt those comments would tarnish Wiggins’s reputation. “Shane just tells it as it is so that’s exactly what he said and that’s how it will have been perceived,” Cundy said. Asked if he was referring to Wiggins, Cundy said: “I don’t care who it is, if they are fiddling the system they are cheating, I can’t stand cheats. It annoys the hell out of me because you’re doing something to beat somebody without having to put in the same effort. “So, whether it be GB riders or other nations, to see people who are working the system is disheartening. To know there are people that do that 100% but then have extra things going on in the background, because they’ve got a signed piece of paper saying they can take X, Y and Z and whatever drug. If that’s the attitude people are taking to medical things then it’s a good job he [Sutton] has gone.” One of Britain’s best young riders Katie Archibald, an Olympic champion in the team pursuit, said she did not want to believe Sutton’s suggestion that the TUE system had been exploited. “That sounds outrageous and it is something that I struggle to believe has been true practice,” she said. “I naively want to hope that there’s been some sort of manipulation or mistranslation. That’s completely against the ethics of the sport.” As British Cycling strives to rescue its reputation after 18 months of allegations of mismanagement, bullying and discrimination, the 23-year-old said it was another blow. “Attaching a term like ‘marginal gains’ to that sort of practice is also quite distressing,” she said, “because it’s almost a trademark British Cycling phrase, isn’t it? Certainly nobody in my squad would attach that practice to the phrase marginal gains.” British Cycling’s chief executive, Julie Harrington, said no elite British Cycling riders currently had TUEs. “I was really disappointed [by Sutton’s comments],” she said. “When people are using language around TUEs they need to be very mindful of the effect that could have on the public’s perception and the athletes’ reputation. “They are issued on medical grounds. Not on performance grounds. As a national governing body our own medics have not supported any applications for our current GB athletes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/21/philip-hammond-budget-zombie-state-civil-war-brexit-fantasists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"Britain has become a zombie state.

He promised to ride one – but yesterday backed off: someone warned him driverlessness was a bad look on budget eve. If he is trying to mimic Harold Wilson’s 1964 “white heat of technology”, it may not be as popular. Few yet yearn for robots on the roads – certainly not the million professional drivers fearful of joining the unemployed, even if Philip Hammond wrongly claimed on Sunday that the unemployed don’t exist. But it’s a faithful image nonetheless. There was never such a driverless cabinet, crashing daily as its members split and split again like Trotskyite groupuscules. You might think the great fault line between Brexiteers and remainers was enough. But no. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson’s astonishingly aggressive letter to their prime minister called for her to cut out fellow Brexiteer David Davis and impose on the civil service Matthew Elliott, Brexit campaign architect and founder of the libertarian Taxpayers’ Alliance. Davis was reportedly “on the brink of resigning”. It won’t end there. Only plaster holds Johnson and Gove together: they will re-rat in their desired leadership contest. Note two full pages attacking Johnson in Rupert Murdoch’s Sunday Times this weekend. Murdoch favours his minion, Gove. I’m told Murdoch’s wife, Jerry Hall, is heard at dinners hymning Gove’s praises – “I just love him! He’s so clever!” – just as Gove (with his unrevealed master in the room), hymned Donald Trump in his exclusive interview. Surely remainers should be super-glued together? But no. Just when Theresa May most needs a strong phalanx of them, she undermines her chancellor, as others join the bullying. When craven former remainers such as Jeremy Hunt and Liz Truss bend in recantation, vowing they’d now vote Brexit, Hammond stoutly refuses. But too few in the cabinet pull on the other end of the rope against the Brextremists. We now know less about what May thinks, tugged this way and that, opaque on her Brexit plan, with futile acts of submission to ward off her enemies’ intended assassination. Watch them pick off every remainer, one by one. Expect torrential abuse when the Brexit divorce sum is revealed. This multidimensional Tory civil war will never end, except perhaps in the final destruction of the party. When the calamitous effects of Brexit become evident, watch the obsessives claim, like old Communists, that the full, hard, walk-away, Singapore-on-Thames, tax haven, red-tape-free Brexit was never really tried. At least, we can only hope it will never be tried. Non-Tory remainers, observing this wretched shambles of a government, are left in the peculiar position of praying May and Hammond hang in there, for fear of something much worse. But economically, what could be worse? In their eighth austerity budget tomorrow, see the screw turn yet again – whatever fake offerings sugar the pill. Good if housing is a beneficiary – but check how much money is to be spread over how many years, because no new money is the Treasury’s abiding mantra. Expect more of the same medicine that has brought us low, as cuts propel us into an ever downward spiral. The Brexit fantasy is that we are held back by moribund Europeans, chained to a corpse in a burning building. One bound will free us to stretch our wings. Do they avert their eyes from the OECD’s latest graphs? Four days’ work by the French takes our workforce five days. Hammond’s talk of our “world-leading” robotics looks plain delusional when you see the graph showing us last – yes, bottom – in robots per manufacturing worker – with Slovenia, Slovakia, Italy, Spain and everyone else miles ahead. The Tory manifesto pledge on minimum standard broadband connectivity to all has just been threatened with a three year delay. We are the zombie state. The OECD’s clinical analysis of the UK shows just how fantastically awry is the vaunting, nationalistic arrogance of our politicians and press. Growth, near the bottom of the league, may see forecasts lowered tomorrow, again. Our under-30s are near the bottom for technical qualifications, with low literacy and numeracy, while our research and development falls below the OECD average. Our low corporation tax encourages companies neither to invest – they sit on shedloads of capital – nor to upskill. Eurostat shows UK companies invest half as much as the EU average in training. Apprenticeships fell by over 60% last year, and investment in skills by 9% in the decade. Failure in early years education is just one more glaring error stressed by the OECD, while 54% of schools offer no computer science GCSEs. If you can bear any more reality, there’s plenty. No wonder John Redwood advises investors to flee the UK for Europe. Yesterday we learned that lucky Amsterdam had gained the 900 scientists of the EU Medicines Agency from the UK, and all the economists of the European Banking Authority are to leave our shores for Paris. Is it good riddance? As Gove says: “The people of this country have had enough of experts.” Hammond mocks ministers threatening Armageddon if he doesn’t find new money for their departments. But his Treasury orthodoxy ignores other debts built up since 2010: first is household debt caused by tax credit cuts, falling wages and rising inflation. Beyond that are equally real debts owed to plundered public services, more pressing for repayment than any on his balance sheets. The NHS is owed £4bn, with social care close behind: as Four Seasons’ 17,000 care beds teeter towards administration, the Treasury will be in hock. Schools are cut by £1.7bn, further education far worse. What of debts to the thinned-out border force and police, or social work, council services and public servants’ pay? If this is the future and these public service debts will never be repaid, then as the NHS head, Simon Stevens, said bluntly: admit it and start rationing openly. Stop pretending there’s “more for less”. Politics will prevail as voters rebel against less of everything for ever, in the name of growth-killing fiscal rectitude. Labour still lags in economic credibility, but when even the Institute for Government calls for annual capital investment of much the same as John McDonnell’s £25bn, and former Tory ministers want an end to austerity, the tide of opinion is on the turn. Hammond will tomorrow promise – probably repeatedly – to “build a country fit for the future”.

Hammond is understood to be preparing to unveil a plan to give the NHS up to £6bn by 2022 for three different purposes. Despite already rejecting a plea by the NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens, for £4bn extra for next year, Hammond is thought to nevertheless be ready to give the NHS approaching, but less than, £1bn more than previously planned in 2018-19 to meet its running costs and to maintain care standards. He is also expected to announce that the NHS in England will receive an extra £1bn for each of the next four years in capital funding, which is used to build new NHS premises, undertake repairs and buy new equipment. However, that is £6bn less than the £10bn extra capital funding Theresa May promised during the election campaign earlier this year. Hammond may indicate that selloffs of NHS land and property can plug most or all of that gap. Sources say that Hammond is also likely to indicate that the government will give the NHS some further money to help cover the cost of the pay rise its 1.4m staff receive next year now that ministers have decided to end the 1% pay cap. He is likely to say that the exact sum the Treasury will provide will depend on what the two NHS pay review bodies recommend. But sources estimate that Hammond’s pledge could ultimately yield several hundred million pounds for the NHS as each 1% rise in staff pay would cost £500m. Hammond angered NHS leaders by making clear on BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that he would not bow to the demands by Stevens to raise the NHS budget by £4bn next year. He said he was not persuaded that “armageddon will arrive” without that level of extra investment. Informed sources say that Hammond and May accept that they have to give the NHS more than the £124.4bn planned in 2018-19 in order to avoid breaking the Conservative manifesto pledge that health spending per head would grow every year of this parliament. Funding needs to grow by at least £310m to avoid that promise being broken. Chris Ham, the chief executive of the King’s Fund health thinktank, said: “If these numbers are confirmed, they will provide some relief to an NHS struggling to meet rising patient demands with budgets that have been constrained for eight years. However, they fall well short of the £4bn increase we estimate is needed in 2018-19 to prevent standards of care falling further.” Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, claimed ministers were expecting the NHS to make unrealistically ambitious improvements to productivity to meet the shortfall in the cost of covering the staff pay rise. He said: “The economy as a whole has seen average productivity gains of 0.2% a year over the last five years. The historical NHS average has been 1% a year. Thanks to the hard work of trusts, we’ve significantly exceeded both these – realising an average productivity gain of 1.7% a year between 2009-10 and 2014-15. “And we mustn’t forget that the spending review plans already assume productivity gains of 2-3% a year between now and 2021. Is it really credible to argue that a significant level of further gain can be realised? Or is this a way of justifying a decision not to make the extra investment in the NHS that is needed?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/20/west-bromwich-albion-tony-pulis-sacked-out-of-time","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T20:08:43Z","webTitle":"Escape artist Tony Pulis runs out of time after West Brom fans lose patience | Barry Glendenning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/20/west-bromwich-albion-tony-pulis-sacked-out-of-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/20/west-bromwich-albion-tony-pulis-sacked-out-of-time","fields":{"headline":"Escape artist Tony Pulis runs out of time after West Brom fans lose patience","bodyText":"The signs were ominous. The conspicuous presence of Guochuan Lai, West Bromwich Albion’s usually absent Chinese owner, for his team’s Premier League defeat at the hands of visiting Chelsea spoke volumes and the emphatic nature of the scoreline was enough to seal the fate of Tony Pulis. The Welshman, who took over in January 2015, had the air of a dead man walking in the wake of Saturday’s 4-0 gubbing. He was duly sacked on Monday and leaves the club a point and a place above the relegation zone. Fans who have long been bored witlessby an unattractive brand of football that was no longer yielding the kind of results that led to finishes in 13th, 14th and 10th over the past three seasons have finally got what they wanted. The question now is whether they will regret the decision to sack the first man they would almost certainly approach with a view to extracting them from the current pickle if it was not he who had got them into it in the first place. Pulis has famously never been relegated during a management career spanning nine clubs across 25 years. Arguably his greatest feat as a manager involved the unlikely rescue of Crystal Palace, who had four points in the Premier League when he took over four years ago this week but finished 11th, 12 points off the drop. It was an escape act that earned Pulis the Premier League manager of the year accolade, even if his relationship with the chairman, Steve Parish, subsequently ended in the most bitter of acrimony at eye-wateringly huge personal expense and embarrassment to Pulis in the high court. Pulis has been long renowned as a firefighter whose pragmatic, functional style of football was tolerated by fans as long as it yielded results, guaranteed top-flight survival and ensured the Premier League revenue kept rolling in. However, his touch appears to have deserted him in the past year. With the air of a man who seemed well aware his latest jig would be up sooner rather than later, he was in relaxed but defensive mood before the Chelsea game. “If I left tomorrow, I’d put my record on the table and put it in front of anybody and see what they think of what I’ve done here in three years,” he said. Examination shows that, when Pulis replaced Alan Irvine on 1 January 2015, West Bromwich were exactly where they are now: fourth from bottom of the table, one point above the relegation zone. Irvine won four of his 19 league games in charge before he was sacked seven months after being appointed. He had secured 20 points and Pulis added 24 to secure a finish with 44 points and five places clear of trouble. The following season they finished 14th with 43 points but dramatically fell away once the safety associated with the 40-point mark had been secured. Last season they finished 10th with 45 points but failed to kick on after guaranteeing their top-flight status, drawing two and losing seven of their last nine matches. More worryingly Albion, having won only four of their past 22 Premier League games, have not emerged victorious from a top-flight match since 19 August, have drawn only four of their past 10 and are on course for 31 or 32 points by mid-May. The end-of-season sluggishness with which many Pulis teams are associated, coupled with the fact that they have been beaten by sides such as Brighton, Southampton and Huddersfield already, suggest a sleepwalk towards relegation is – or certainly was – on the cards. Furthermore, in 107 Premier League matches under Pulis, West Bromwich have scored three or more goals on only eight occasions and have beaten teams in the current top six in five of 33 attempts. What Pulis has done at The Hawthorns in three years appears to be little more than the bare minimum expected: survival through turgid football, not many goals and even fewer surprises. It is small wonder the fans turned on a manager who, despite his net spend of £40m during the summer, appears to have succeeded only in making a very mediocre squad considerably worse. Despite the doom-merchants who insist West Bromwich fans should be careful what they wish for, all available evidence suggests that the time was right for the club and their manager to consciously uncouple. With players of the calibre of Jay Rodriguez, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Salomón Rondón and Nacer Chadli, among others, Albion have the makings of a team considerably better than the sum of the parts cobbled together in recent months. Pulis, meanwhile, leaves with a golden handshake and no shortage of credit in the bank. In these days of increasingly twitchy, trigger-happy owners desperate to remain in the Premier League, a man of his specialist talents is unlikely to be out of work for long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/21/outsourced-working-university-of-london","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T06:00:50Z","webTitle":"The security guards who could change the face of employment in Britain | Aditya Chakrabortty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/21/outsourced-working-university-of-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/21/outsourced-working-university-of-london","fields":{"headline":"The security guards who could change the face of employment in Britain","bodyText":"The University of London ranks among the grandest and most renowned higher education institutions, and it sports values to match: “that every member of staff is treated with dignity … at work”; “equality of opportunity … in which individuals are treated equitably”; “diversity, social inclusion and respect”. I have been reporting on the university for four years, during which time I have met a fair number of its workers. They include a grandmother, Marta Luna, employed as a cleaner at a Bloomsbury student hall, where the supervisor instructed her and her colleagues to throw their coats and bags in one giant box on the floor. Lunch was eaten in the laundry room. At the end of each shift, she remembered, “it was like a jumble sale”. Picture your grandma, kneeling in front of strangers to reclaim her own handbag. Another cleaner, Liliana Almanza, was a mother with three herniated discs that send pain shooting into her neck, hands and legs. Rather than adjust for her disabilities, her supervisor made her work twice as hard and called her a “bitch” and a “whore”. This treatment got so bad that at the end of a shift she’d walk to Euston station and stand dangerously close to the platform’s edge, just waiting for a tube to come. Imagine your mum, earning poverty pay in a job that drives her daily to contemplate killing herself. I’ve got more such stories, but more importantly I have a question: how does a body professing respect, dignity and fairness end up as a site of degradation, abuse and humiliation? The answer, I believe, lies in one word: outsourcing. The cleaners and security guards and others work for the University of London but are under contract to middlemen companies. It’s the middlemen who bid for the work, employ the staff – and take the profits. Outsourcing is the sham excuse for why one set of workers routinely get worse holiday, sick pay and pension rights than their colleagues employed directly by the university. Outsourcing is the blind eye turned by the university to the very staff who greet strangers at reception, clean its toilets and keep its students safe. Outsourcing breeds economic apartheid, in which workers who are nearly all from ethnic minorities, including cleaners who are almost without exception women, are exploited in a way that would never happen to the mostly white academics and managers whose employment contracts are with the university. This isn’t about one Bloomsbury institution. Outsourcing is one of the biggest growth industries in post-crash Britain. Universities, local authorities and NHS hospitals now run on it, while care services depend on it. Margaret Thatcher began the outsourcing revolution; her descendants David Cameron and George Osborne cut taxes to encourage ever more of it. Outsourcing is typically justified as being cheaper and more efficient. But in labour-intensive services such as care and cleaning, the only way to make it cheaper is by taking a shovel to workers’ pay and conditions. In 2015 the New Economics Foundation calculated that residential care workers earned £9.45 an hour on average; those in the private sector got only £7.23. Officers in privately run prisons earned a full £4 an hour below those in the public sector. Meet Omar Toryalae. For over 10 years, he has done the same job at the same place: security guard at the University of London. The identity of his employer, on the other hand, keeps shifting. He began with ISS, before the contract was passed to OCS. Then it was Balfour Beatty WorkPlace, until it was bought out by Cofely. In the takeover, “they literally sold us, the staff”. Cofely changed its name to Engie, until the contract was handed to Cordant. After reeling off all the intermediaries who have passed him and his workmates about like so much human cargo, he looks dazed. “It’s 21st century slavery.” Toryalae is smartly turned out, articulate and – everyone says – a grafter. He works an average of 70 hours a week, but only earns around £31,000 a year – which means he, his wife and his three kids rent a shared house on the outskirts of the capital. That’s considered lucky: a colleague, Glen Jacques, can only make outsourced work pay by living at home with his mum. Jacques is 46. In 2011, the University of London promised that all outsourced staff would go on the London Living Wage. According to correspondence I’ve seen, the university’s then-HR director confirmed that wages would keep rising for staff such as Toryalae. He should now be earning around 25% extra, according to his trade union, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. Instead, Toryalae’s pay has pretty much flatlined. Since 2011, the university has tripled the number of staff earning over £100,000 a year. The vice-chancellor of this charitable institution, Adrian Smith, has a salary of £173,000. As the customer, the university could insist Cordant look after the staff on its campus. Instead, it hides behind the fiction that pay, conditions and decent treatment are a matter for Cordant – while Cordant tells the workers that the university calls the shots. When I asked the University of London about bullying and harassment of workers, it responded: “[We] would encourage any workers affected to raise these issues with their employer.” That, dear reader, is the sound of well-manicured hands being washed. Having tried strikes and protests, Toryalae and his union colleagues are now turning to the law. This morning, the Guardian can exclusively reveal, they will launch a landmark case to try to compel the university to collectively bargain over pay and conditions with its outsourced workers. As if to demonstrate again the absurdity of outsourcing, Cordant’s comment on the case was to refer all queries to the university, while the university said it “does not employ any of these workers and does not accept that the relevant legislation recognises the concept of joint employment”. The university did say it had set up a group that would look into outsourced workers’ conditions – although it has not invited any outsourced workers or representatives to take part. A win would change the rules for all outsourced workers. Hospital support staff could take up grievances with their de facto employers, the NHS managers, as well as their direct contractor. Care workers cramming too many calls into a working day could put this to their local councils, rather than just the private equity cowboys employing them. This principle of joint-employment is new to Britain, but it’s been part of American law for decades – and it’s been used to chase giants such as Walmart and DHL through the courts. One of the biggest problems in Britain is corporations and managers that don’t pay their way. They rely on the state for protection yet siphon off their profits to tax havens. Their workers are monitored minute by minute on apps, but are labelled as self-employed. They want taxpayers to spend on infrastructure and R&amp;D, but prefer to divvy out their profits with shareholders rather than invest them. And they want the services provided by workers but they shrug off any responsibility to those doing the work. Our social contract with business needs a wholesale rewrite: of the duties of corporations to the rest of us. If Toryalae and his union win this case, they will have kickstarted that vital task. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2017/nov/30/long-before-harry-potter-the-box-of-delights-remade-childrens-fantasy","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-30T07:30:01Z","webTitle":"Long before Harry Potter, The Box of Delights remade children’s fantasy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/nov/30/long-before-harry-potter-the-box-of-delights-remade-childrens-fantasy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2017/nov/30/long-before-harry-potter-the-box-of-delights-remade-childrens-fantasy","fields":{"headline":"Long before Harry Potter, The Box of Delights remade children’s fantasy","bodyText":"My first memory of “appointment to view” TV is as indelible as it is vivid. It was the final episode of the BBC’s adaptation of John Masefield’s The Box of Delights, which I caught only by imploring my mother to let me stay for another half an hour while visiting a friend. The early special effects in the style of Doctor Who were as stardust to my young eyes; I still recall the thrill of watching Robert Stephens (as the villainous Abner Brown) fall to his watery fate. It wasn’t only the state-of-the-art animation and the compelling performances that captured my imagination, but also the magic of the story. Some 33 years later, when I found myself writing the first stage adaptation of this extraordinary book – which opens on Friday at Wilton’s Music Hall in east London – I realised quite how pervasive and enduring a spell the story had cast, not only on my imagination, but on a whole canon of childhood classics. In a curious way, Masefield is the unrecognised founding father of our current golden age of children’s literature. The 15th poet laureate, born in 1878, Masefield grew up in the reign of Queen Victoria, but his final published poem marked the assassination of President Kennedy. Described by his biographer Muriel Spark as a “born storyteller”, he was sent away to sea at the age of 13, where he devoured that other children’s urtext, Treasure Island, on board the merchant ship HMS Conway. Surrounded by characters seemingly drawn straight from its pages, he not only learned how to rig a sail, but also how to spin a yarn. The Box of Delights (1935) is a loose companion piece to The Midnight Folk (1927). They are the only two novels Masefield wrote specifically for children and they have the elastic, eccentric and winning charm of a mariner’s tale. Both stories pit orphan schoolboy Kay Harker against the greed, cunning and dark powers of the sorcerer Abner Brown, along with his bewitching associate Sylvia Daisy Pouncer. The story springs from a simple idea: would it be possible to stop a cathedral service – and, by extension, Christmas – from happening? Whether by design or accident, he ended up writing the first original children’s adventure of the 20th century, blending the folkloric mysticism of Albion with the lurid criminalities of the jazz age. There are ancient wizards, Christmas feasts and talking animals – but also bang-up-to-date thrills: criminal gangs of jewel thieves, machine guns and time travel. You can still see the book’s influence everywhere. The central trio – sensitive, orphaned hero Kay, who has a dormant gift for magic; the ferociously intelligent and independent Maria; and the loyal but slightly dim Peter (plus a flying car and a wise wizard mentor) – will feel familiar to readers of Harry Potter. Sylvia Daisy Pouncer, the witch in twinset and furs, feels like a direct ancestor of Dahl’s neighbourhood witches. Masefield had his children escaping to a fantasy world of deep magic through a domestic portal before CS Lewis ever opened his wardrobe; he was shrinking children on to toy sailboats before the borrowers were born. It could also be argued that the book’s exploration of history, time and space paved the way for children’s books to tackle the big ideas of the age. Before Northern Lights came The Box of Delights. But, more than any of that, Masefield took the Victorian and Edwardian fantasy of Christmas – presents, crackers, chocolates, trees, carols – and reminded us of the midwinter feast’s true origins (without killing the festive fun). He piled the snow up outside the windows while the fire roared inside and let wolves roam in the shadows beyond. He made the feast of the nativity as much a time to celebrate the legend of Herne the Hunter, Arthurian legend and Roman myth, as the son of God. Masefield allowed children to imagine, at this most traditional and domestic time of year, a thrilling sense of winter mystery that felt as old as Christmas itself. Before The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Dark is Rising and The Children of Green Knowe, and way ahead of Harry Potter and Northern Lights, Masefield allowed the darkness and mystery of old magic to seep into the modern light. For that alone, he should be cherished. The Box of Delights is at Wilton’s Music Hall, London, from 1 December until 6 January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/24/you-should-come-with-me-now-by-m-john-harrison-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-24T12:00:04Z","webTitle":"You Should Come With Me Now by M John Harrison review – stories ​for the uncommon reader​","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/24/you-should-come-with-me-now-by-m-john-harrison-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/24/you-should-come-with-me-now-by-m-john-harrison-review","fields":{"headline":"You Should Come With Me Now by M John Harrison review – stories ​for the uncommon reader​","bodyText":"One of these brilliantly told stories, “The Walls”, begins: “A man, let’s call him D, is seen digging his way out through the wall of his cell. To help in this project, D has only the thinnest and least reliable tools: two dessert spoons (one stainless steel, one electro-plated nickel silver); half of a pair of curved nail scissors; some domestic knives lacking handles; and so on. The cell wall, constructed from grey, squarish cinder blocks about a foot on a side has been carelessly mortared and laid without much attention to detail. But this lack of artifice makes no difference; none of the knives is long enough to reach the last half inch of mortar at the back of each block, and the more D uses them the shorter they get. Each block must, eventually, be loosened and removed by hand, a task which can take several months, and which leaves him exhausted.” A close attention to detail characterises this story and contributes much to its effectiveness, and yet, like the careless mortaring of the cinder blocks, it makes no difference in the end. Why and how does D have two dessert spoons? What does he live on during these months (which become years)? Who brings it to his cell? We have nothing with which to fill in unstated facts, as we’re used to doing when reading fiction, because the story is consistent only in pulling the carpet out from under its own feet. It is a play of imagination in a void. Its power is that of a dream, in this case a bad one, the kind that keeps repeating itself with variations in an endless loop of frustration. This holds for all the stories collected in You Should Come With Me Now. Some of them are surrealistic, some are spoofs, some are fables; many are funny, all are inventive; none entirely escapes the loop. I would describe “The Wall” as a fable. Imitating realism but freed from it by invention, the fable stands off from actuality, judges it, laughs at it, offers warnings and instructions and presents funhouse-mirror reflections of human nature. From Aesop and the Buddhist Jātaka Tales through Reynard the Fox to Borges and beyond, the fabulist speaks with detachment and as if from above. The humour is on the dry side, and catastrophes are recounted without emotion. Fables don’t entirely satisfy most of us “common readers” of fiction, who seek an involvement beyond the intellectual. Even a story as well written and vividly described as this may leave us feeling that the author has boiled up a fine broth only to throw it out and give us the bones. I think it’s fair, and useful, to say that M John Harrison writes for the uncommon reader. The collection contains many brief fabulations, some very brief indeed. The wit and effortless elegance of the writing are impeccable. But synopses of plots – ideas for stories, such as writers scribble in their notebooks or on cocktail napkins, however brilliant the conceits – are pretty dry bones. Such “flash fictions” are spaced out with stories of substantial length ballasted by developed narrative complexities, which I welcomed. Soup at last! The broth, however, lacks variety. Repeatedly, a narrator, whether the disembodied authorial voice or a character in the story, recounts events, mundane or bizarre, without involvement or explanation. The funny things that happen are sometimes very funny, but the humour is dry as ether. Fiction that abandons cause and effect makes a point about the nature of reality at its own expense. Narrative inconsequentiality offers the imagination limitless freedom, but the paradoxical result of such freedom is predictability. When you see that in this story nothing is going to happen which, by the ancient rules and rites of storytelling, “should” happen, interest wanes. Relationships are without effect, and therefore without affect. If surrealism is super-realism, and if reality is indeed as vacant as this, no wonder we make up lies about it. Merely realistic or merely fantastic fiction asks us not only to consent to suspend disbelief but to believe that actions have reactions, acts have consequences and moral responsibility exists. Storytelling of this kind seems to be a human survival tactic. Surrealism is the most cerebral and most cynical of genres, declaring and exhibiting the falsity of reason, the meaninglessness of meaning; it flaunts its courage in breaking the compact, the collusion, on which fiction depends. But such brave defiance runs the fatal risk of boring the reader. The passages in You Should Come With Me Now that most engaged me and that I most admire are those that describe having a “heart condition” – the physical experience and the medical response. In “Yummie” a man undergoes angioplasty, a violent procedure giving “the feeling of racing feet-first forward on rails under a weird light while your heart is reamed, plumbed, measured to its full physical depth and found wanting”. This is a valid surrealism: existence as a patient in a modern hospital is, in fact, surreal. Here the exactness, the acute self-consciousness and the vigilant self-restraint of Harrison’s writing give it piercing authenticity.

Gatland, who was depicted as a clown by one New Zealand paper before the Lions rallied from 1-0 down to share the series, expects more demeaning caricatures this week but said anyone looking to turn Saturday’s encounter at the Principality Stadium into a feud between him and the All Blacks’ head coach, Steve Hansen, would be wasting time. “People try to make a lot of stuff about Steve and me,” Gatland said. “From my point of view there are no issues between us. I have a huge amount of respect for what he has achieved in the game and the success he has had as an All Black coach. He has been absolutely outstanding. I look forward to catching up with him on Saturday and having a beer after the game. In recent years on a couple of occasions we have gone out as two management groups for meals during the week. The pressures we are under are not as a result of our relationship but about people trying to stoke the fires. He understands that; I understand that. “If there is [media] criticism of me this week I won’t be responding because you cannot win. At some stage I will be dressed up as a clown again; I will just take it on the chin and move on. That is the way it is and the way it has gone. It was tough [on the Lions tour] and I said so but Kiwis understand when you back someone into a corner they come out fighting. There was no way I was going to allow something to get the better of me and I got mentally tougher. “I felt like I was in a boxing match and was going to come out on top. No one was going to split the squad but there was some pretty underhand stuff going on. There are one or two people I would like to get into a corner of a room on their own with me but that might wait for another day.” Gatland was speaking after making an unscheduled appearance at Wales’s media briefing on Monday. He usually fronts up on the day of the team announcement but he wanted to clarify what happened towards the end of the match against Georgia on Saturday after the prop Tomas Francis was sent to the sin-bin in the last minute and, with the visitors awarded a penalty close to the Wales line, the match went to uncontested scrums because the other tighthead, Leon Brown, was suffering from cramp after being replaced by Francis. “It wasn’t us trying to pull a fast one or anything like that,” Gatland said. “We didn’t try and manipulate anything in terms of the laws. It was different to what France did against us at the end of this year’s Six Nations because they had a prop come off injured while another had been warming up. Leon’s calves were tight and there is video evidence to show he was injured. We were not trying to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes.” Wales’s laboured victory over a team who had never defeated a tier one opponent did nothing to suggest they will arrest a 64-match losing streak against New Zealand on Saturday but back in 2014, one week after they had hung on to beat Fiji 17-13 having failed to score in the second half, Wales led the All Blacks going into the final quarter before leaking three tries. New Zealand were holding on against Scotland last Saturday against opponents they had never lost to. “They will be disappointed with that game,” said Gatland. “Scotland took it to them but New Zealand still won and had that x-factor when they needed to turn it on. I have never seen an All Black team that is vulnerable. They will be disappointed they did not play better with the quality and depth they have but they coped with the pressure and won that game. That is what it is all about. “The All Blacks have made comments themselves [that] they have dominated the game for too long. People want to see the All Blacks come under pressure and teams pushing them close. We’ve had that in the last few weeks with Australia beating them and South Africa and Scotland pushing them close. It’s good for rugby that sides are able to push the number one team in the world really closely. We expect the All Blacks to front up against us, hurting a little but knowing they have not played to their potential, but we have got to put them under pressure and play some rugby.” Cane and able Sam Cane has vowed there will be no repeat of the attitude that nearly resulted in New Zealand losing against Scotland for the first time last weekend when they face Wales on Saturday in their final Test of the year. The match in Cardiff will be New Zealand’s 15th of 2017, including the victory against the Barbarians at Twickenham at the start of November, and the flanker Cane said the focus was on enjoying their final week together as a squad and making sure their attitude was right. “Last Saturday was a reminder that every team we are up against go out there to play the game of their lives,” he said. “We need to play to a really high standard. We turned up in Edinburgh and maybe our attitude was just a fraction off. It does not take much and this week we have to make sure we are exactly where we need to be. “Sometimes you can gauge if the attitude is not quite there, but even if you say something as part of the leadership group to get it back on track, it is often too late. The prep and the build-up to go out there and win little battles takes all week. It is pretty tough to just turn up and flick a switch. It was yes and no whether we did that last week as it is different for individuals. There were a couple of guys who thought ‘not sure’.” Cane said that the review of the 22-17 victory, which was secured when Beauden Barrett made a try-saving tackle on Stuart Hogg in the final minute, was not a video nasty. “We did not look at much footage,” he said. “There was a lot of discussion around different players’ processes in terms of turning up at kick-off to rip into it at a 10/10 level. Sometimes in the final week of the year less is more in terms of the training load. The key is to turn up on Saturday with a full tank of energy, together with the mental stuff.” It will mark a return to Wales for the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, who spent three years in Cardiff from 2001. “I have not had an inkling that he is treating it differently to any other Test,” Cane said. “Steve is one of the most competitive people I know. It does not matter who we are playing, he is keen to win. “We want to finish the season on the right note. We have learned a lot about ourselves this year, adversity teaches you a few things. We have been in pretty tough places in some games and guys had to step into roles they are not used to in this team. Next year we will have 40 or 50 quality players with experience of Test rugby and I think we are in a good place.” Paul Rees"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/21/man-on-manus-faces-deportation-order-despite-real-risk-of-torture-or-death","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T03:02:06Z","webTitle":"Man on Manus faces deportation order despite 'real risk' of torture or death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/21/man-on-manus-faces-deportation-order-despite-real-risk-of-torture-or-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/21/man-on-manus-faces-deportation-order-despite-real-risk-of-torture-or-death","fields":{"headline":"Man on Manus faces deportation order despite 'real risk' of torture or death","bodyText":"An asylum seeker held on Manus Island – who has collapsed three times this year from an acute heart condition – has now fallen into a legal limbo, simultaneously ordered for deportation while the PNG government recognises he faces torture or being killed if he is sent back to Iran. He faces a potentially indefinite detention. Samuel (not his real name) has been told by PNG immigration authorities he has not been formally recognised as a refugee and that a deportation order has been issued for his removal. However, a letter from PNG immigration to Samuel says a “deportation risk assessment” has found there is a “real risk you will be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life … the imposition of the death penalty”. The majority – more than 70% – of the men on Manus have been recognised as refugees. But Samuel’s case is potentially one of dozens where asylum seekers might fall outside the protection of the UN refugee convention but cannot be returned to their home countries because they face persecution or possibly death. Forcibly moved from Australia to Manus in 2013, Samuel initially refused to engage with PNG’s refugee status determination, arguing he never sought asylum in that country. He has since sought to submit to PNG immigration’s assessment process but he has been told he has been formally and finally denied refugee status, and under PNG law his claim for protection cannot be reassessed. Others from Iran who have claimed similar grounds for protection to Samuel’s have been recognised as refugees. Currently held in Lorengau, where the Guardian met with him, Samuel has been told by PNG’s immigration department the minister for foreign affairs and immigration “has ordered that you be detained and removed from Papua New Guinea”. However, the deportation risk assessment has found a “real risk” of torture or arbitrary execution in Iran, “and therefore the government of Papua New Guinea will not remove you”. Samuel finds himself in a legal purgatory. He faces indefinite detention for as long as he remains in PNG. “As you are not a refugee, you do not have a right to remain in Papua New Guinea and your removal and detention orders remain in effect,” he has been told. His only option out is to elect to voluntarily return to Iran, the country where, by PNG’s own assessment, he faces a real risk of being tortured or killed. PNG immigration has been contacted for comment. Samuel’s health has deteriorated precipitously while on Manus Island. Since February this year, he has collapsed three times, most recently on 5 November, when it took more than four hours for him to be taken from the now-closed Manus Island detention centre to Lorengau for medical treatment. When he arrived at Lorengau hospital, there was no working ECG machine and no capacity to do a blood test. “I have never seen nor heard of a hospital without capacity for blood tests nor access to ECG machine,” Dr Paddy McLisky from Doctors for Refugees, who has been in regular contact with Samuel, said. “Several doctors working in the immigration detention system, including a visiting cardiologist, have recommended various tests to elicit the cause of Samuel’s recurrent symptoms of varying severity of chest pain, collapse and palpitations or tachycardia,” McLisky said. McLisky said he was worried for Samuel’s long-term health after he suffered a heart attack in February, and injured his heart muscle. “In my opinion the most important test for Samuel is electrophysiological study which will determine if he has a short circuit in his heart, and if it can be fixed by ablation treatment, both of which are not available in PNG.” Simon Bruck, a lawyer from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, and who represents Samuel, said he was being denied necessary, possibly life-saving, medical care. “A cardiologist advised more than six months ago that my client needs tests overseas, as the tests he needs are not available in PNG. Because he is not getting medical tests he needs, my client is afraid the next heart attack could kill him. “Australian Border Force is denying appropriate medical care to a number of our clients. In our legal opinion, denial of medical treatment amounts to negligence.” Samuel’s case manager, Natasha Blucher from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said his mental health had suffered significantly over four years of detention and the ongoing uncertainty over his future. “A life-threatening illness is terrifying for anyone, even in a position where they receive proper medical care. For Samuel, knowing that he has a heart condition that is not diagnosed, and that he could have a heart attack at any time, is truly terrifying.” Blucher said Samuel’s current legal status was an “absurd limbo” that placed his life at risk. “While legally recognising that Samuel cannot return to his country of origin, authorities have denied him any clear pathway to protection. He has a document stating that he cannot be deported because he faces torture or death in his home country, but which also states that he has a deportation order current. “In effect, it appears that the only option for him is to remain detained indefinitely in Papua New Guinea.” (An earlier version of this story used a different pseudonym for the asylum seeker.)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/03/guns-and-phones-deal-maximum-carnage-to-papua-new-guineas-warring-tribes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T21:20:49Z","webTitle":"Guns and phones deal 'maximum' carnage to Papua New Guinea's warring tribes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/03/guns-and-phones-deal-maximum-carnage-to-papua-new-guineas-warring-tribes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/03/guns-and-phones-deal-maximum-carnage-to-papua-new-guineas-warring-tribes","fields":{"headline":"Guns and phones deal 'maximum' carnage to Papua New Guinea's warring tribes","bodyText":"“It was in the night, we didn’t see them coming. There was a guy who came in the house, and everybody without disabilities they decided to run off, leaving the place, [but] I couldn’t run.” Twenty-year-old Cathy Mek speaks in barely more than a whisper. She’s sitting on a thin bamboo bench in a quiet, private clearing above her village of Wapena, in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. It’s a region known for inter-tribal violence as much as stunning scenery and Wapena – perched on a hill overlooking the tidy crops and lush valleys of Western Highlands province – is no exception for either. But rape, indiscriminate destruction and automatic weapons are changing the face of traditional conflict, and PNG authorities and international non-governmental associations are struggling to get a handle on the deteriorating situation. On 28 June, the people of Wapena were attacked by a neighbouring tribe over political differences during the national election. The village’s men were at a counting station in a nearby town. Able-bodied women grabbed their children and fled. Mek, who has a permanently injured foot and deformities in both hands, could not. “They put a knife to me, they took me out and raped me,” Mek says. “I refused, I argued, but they slept here and ate here and then they continued on. “After that I started screaming. I was still screaming until a fellow from the other village heard my screams and came into rescue, and other people … came and helped me out.” Mek’s mother, Elisabeth Yong, and Wapena’s leader, Jerry Rombena, sit with us. As Mek talks Rombena, a former police officer, silently shakes his head in anger and sadness. He says the police know the who the rapists are but won’t make an arrest unless the men leave tribal land, for fear of triggering another battle. Justice for Mek is unlikely. She suspects the other women feel guilty for leaving her behind but says no one is helping her to overcome the trauma. “I am calling out for help but they don’t want to help.” Near a collection of huts covered in Red Cross tarpaulins, Mek’s fellow villagers share their stories of 28 June. They gather under the shade of a tree on the edge of the hillcrest, cradling children and phones and machetes. No one mentions Mek. Asked to raise a hand if their house was destroyed in the attack, nearly everyone does so. “They came from the other side of the creek,” Rombena recalls. “They walked, they came in groups with all the clansmen, with weapons like bows and arrows and high-powered ammunition. “We saw them coming from the other side, with their weapons and shouting,” says Susan Dupi, pointing across a field to the one dirt road in. “They burned the first place there, and we saw them coming in large groups so we decided to run with our children. We went to the other side [of the village]. They didn’t find us.” As well as assaulting Mek, the attackers burned down 36 homes, slaughtered 32 pigs and destroyed the grain stores, gardens and cash crops, says Gus Kasyaki. ‘Out of control’ Wapena was luckier than many villages in that the attackers brandished their military-grade assault weapons, but did not shoot anyone. Guns are now a common feature of the increasingly violent tribal fighting, replacing traditional bows and arrows. The region’s extensive stock of high-powered guns are believed to come from over the border, in Indonesian West Papua, illegally traded for PNG-grown marijuana. Some say they can also be bought from police and soldiers. Marijuana “grows like wildfire” in the highlands regions, and the black-market trade of weapons, including M16s, AK-47s and explosives, has often left police officers outgunned, says the acting provincial police commander for Enga, Epenese Nili. In a documentary produced by the Red Cross this year, the former PNG defence force commander Jerry Singirok says the use of weapons in the highlands is “out of control”. “That’s where 80% of the population of Papua New Guineans live. We know for a fact that every tribal fight guns are used, every roadblock guns are used, every murder guns are used, and we know that during elections guns are used to intimidate, to harass, even to murder opposing people, and we are very concerned.” Last week 11 men were shot dead in a dawn raid on a village in the Eastern Highlands region, the Post-Courier reported. About 30 people were reported to have been killed in election-related violence this year, the worst of which was in Wabag, Enga province, where the dead included two police officers killed outside a hotel. Hundreds of security forces were deployed to Wabag to control the violence after the contentious defeat of the former opposition leader Don Polye. On the outskirts of town a burnt-out ambulance rusts by the side of the road. More than 120 homes in the electorate were reported to have been destroyed. “We called troops to move in and camped out in the middle between two warring tribes,” Nili says of the Wabag violence. “Police from day one are still camping there now.” Nili says the groups agreed to lay down their arms, but during an amnesty they surrendered only homemade weapons, keeping the rest. “We saw those guns in the battlefield,” says Nili, shrugging. “We have search powers to go and search the premises, but somebody has to come and complain, give us the intel report about a particular house having a high-powered weapon. But who is going to come and talk to police?” The International Committee of the Red Cross, based in Mount Hagen, says it mostly sees homemade weapons during its fieldwork in the region. For this reason the organisation uses plastic rather than metal pipes when it builds water facilities in villages. But the Red Cross head of office for Mount Hagen, Kakhaber Khasaia, says the high-powered guns are a problem. “When you talk to the tribal leaders they’ll often mention that those guns are owned by young people who are not really controlled by the leaders, who think they are now the most powerful person, they don’t have much experience and they create problems,” Khasaia says. ‘A lot of lives lost’ Uma, in Southern Highlands province, is surrounded by groups at conflict with one another. The community leader, Jeffrey Amandi, who, other villagers are proud to note, is a Muslim leader in a predominantly Christian country, says the violence was at its worst in 2010-12. “A lot of lives lost, a lot of damage, as well as bombs being used,” he says. “I don’t know how the guns come but there is a market somewhere in Papua New Guinea, so we trade. “We take them for marijuana and then use them for tribal fights.” Asked if his people too had traded drugs for weapons, Amandi only notes they were “the very first people to become like a superpower in this area”. “But we said, fighting, OK, we experienced very much and it’s not good [so] we better give up with weapons and have peace, become advocates of peace.” Traditionally, tribal conflict followed rules that spared women, children, religious figures, health workers and community facilities. “[Now you can] hear someone say, ‘When we are fighting we don’t even want to see a chicken walking,’” says Janet Nakadi Angelei, a Red Cross field delegate. A local employee adds: “Nowadays in a tribal fight, fighters target everyone and everything on enemy territory and want to bring maximum damage to the enemy community.” Children – future enemies – are killed. So are health workers, who treat the enemy. Fighters no longer fear the wrath of God when they gun down a pastor. Khasaia says neutral people are still largely respected because tribal conflicts are still expected to be resolved in traditional ways, and that requires a peacemaker. “But … with the new weapons, with new technology like phones, they can organise and mobilise large groups much faster than before, and with cars they can attack faster than before.” A traditional system of peacemaking and compensation after conflicts remains in place, usually comprising cash and pigs, but with more deaths and damage the unaffordable payments can now force entire clan groups from their land. Conflict in Kagua-Erave escalated to such an extent in 2013 that hundreds of people were reportedly displaced, and an unconfirmed grenade attack on a safe house which contained mainly women and children killed up to 35 people – one of the worst episodes of tribal violence yet. The ICRC assists those affected by conflict across a number of provinces, beginning in the Southern Highlands in 2012. Tribal fighting “has a few causes”, says Angelei, the most common of which is land disputes, but it can also escalate from resource access issues, accusations of sorcery, adultery or jealousy. Stories abound of murders and multiple killings sparked by extremely trivial disputes. The clan war sprung from family disapproval of a teenage relationship, the dozen killed after a drunken brawl escalated, the threats of rocket launchers by disgruntled landowners unhappy with resource deals, arrows in eye sockets after an assault at a local market. In Wapena villagers were attacked over an accusation of vote tampering. “Often the trigger is quite small but has big consequences,” Angelei says. “The warlords are hunting their enemies, hunting them down,” a former mayor of Tari told Radio NZ after a man was killed in Hela province. “They’re driving around and shooting down people, killing people just like nobody’s business.” ‘We want to stop the suffering’ The ICRC works with communities to re-establish traditional “fighters rules” and discourage the goal of “maximum damage”, while also helping people in the aftermath of violence. Community representatives are brought together in peacetime to discuss and propose rules for future conflicts. The rules are taken to district governments for potential legislation, before being disseminated among the population. Provinces are at different stages of progress but Khasaia says people are responding positively to the idea of everyone returning to traditional rules of engagement. “At least if fighters understand and respect those rules it will reduce the number of women raped, children killed, disabled killed, healthcare facilities destroyed, houses burned,” he says. The Red Cross helps provide materials to rebuild burned homes and cooking and farming equipment for families whose houses have been looted. In one village, new guttering and tanks collect rainwater so women and girls do not have to travel to a river where a rival village would often attack them. At the end of the conflict near Uma a peace deal was brokered and the ICRC agreed to build a new health clinic. The clinic is staffed by four local nurses and cares for about 45,000 people from the surround district, Amandi says. The simple structure, built in part from “bush materials”, has not been targeted for five years and will now be replaced by a larger and better equipped facility. Wapena is rebuilding, and the people there say they have no plans to retaliate. They are still living under tarpaulins because there is none of the long grass they need to make their traditional roofs. Red Cross officers say there is only so much they can do. “We don’t have the illusion that we’ll stop the conflict, we don’t have the mandate to stop the conflict,” Khasaia says. “But we want to stop the suffering of individuals who are not part of the conflict.” • The Guardian travelled to Papua New Guinea with the assistance of the ICRC"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/20/charlie-rose-tv-sexual-harassment-groping","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T23:18:22Z","webTitle":"CBS suspends Charlie Rose after sexual harassment and groping allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/20/charlie-rose-tv-sexual-harassment-groping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/20/charlie-rose-tv-sexual-harassment-groping","fields":{"headline":"CBS suspends Charlie Rose after sexual harassment and groping allegations","bodyText":"Charlie Rose has been suspended by CBS News after becoming the latest media figure to be accused of sexual harassment when eight women came forward to describe unwanted advances, including lewd phone calls, parading naked, and groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas. The accusations, detailed by the Washington Post, were brought by women who were employees or aspired to work for the host at the Charlie Rose show from the late 1990s to 2011. It follows the suspension by the New York Times of White House reporter Glenn Thrush while it investigates claims he made unwanted advances on young women. The newspaper said the alleged behavior was “very concerning” and it supported Thrush’s decision to enter a substance abuse program. Thrush told Vox, which broke the story, that he apologized to any woman who felt uncomfortable in his presence. Rose, 75, whose eponymous show airs on PBS, also serves as a host on CBS This Morning and as a correspondent for 60 Minutes. PBS said it was halting distribution of the interview program and CBS suspended him in the wake of the news. According to the report, Rose’s accusers ranged in age from 21 to 37 at the time of the alleged incidents. Three went on the record by name. As with previous accusations against media, showbusiness and political figures that have surfaced almost daily since allegations first emerged against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, there are consistencies in the accounts. One of the women, Kyle Godfrey-Ryan, a former assistant, recalled at least a dozen instances where Rose walked nude in front of her. He also repeatedly, it is alleged, called Godfrey-Ryan, then aged 21, late at night or early in the morning to describe his fantasies of her swimming naked in the pool at his country house. Five described Rose putting his hand on their legs, sometimes their upper thigh. Two said he had emerged from the shower and walked naked in front of them. One said he groped her buttocks at a staff party. Six others contacted by the Post said they saw what they considered to be harassment, and eight said they were uncomfortable with Rose’s treatment of female employees. In a statement, Rose said he prided himself on being “an advocate for the careers of women with whom I have worked”. But he acknowledged that his behavior toward some employees had been inappropriate. “It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.” He continued: “I have learned a great deal as a result of these events, and I hope others will too. All of us, including me, are coming to a newer and deeper recognition of the pain caused by conduct in the past, and have come to a profound new respect for women and their lives.” Reah Bravo, who worked as an associate producer for Rose’s PBS show beginning in 2007, said the host’s unwanted advances occurred at his country home and while traveling with him in cars, in a hotel suite and on a private plane. “It has taken 10 years and a fierce moment of cultural reckoning for me to understand these moments for what they were,” she told the Post. “He was a sexual predator, and I was his victim.” Rose’s longtime producer Yvette Vega acknowledged that she should have done more to protect the young women who worked on the show. “I should have stood up for them,” she said. “I failed. It is crushing. I deeply regret not helping them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/nov/23/weatherwatch-rescuing-weather-records-from-ben-nevis","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T21:30:12Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: rescuing weather records from Ben Nevis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/23/weatherwatch-rescuing-weather-records-from-ben-nevis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/nov/23/weatherwatch-rescuing-weather-records-from-ben-nevis","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: rescuing weather records from Ben Nevis","bodyText":"In 1883 a weather observatory was opened on Britain’s highest peak, Ben Nevis.

This week around 3,600 “citizen-scientists” finished transcribing the 1.5m observations into digital form. “We will be able to better examine particular storms and unusual weather events during the time the observatory was open,” says Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading. The records will also help scientists to understand how wind strength and sunshine have varied over the past century, which could be useful to renewable energy providers. The remarkable weathermen who lived at the Ben Nevis observatory were often isolated for long periods during the winter months, with only a telegraph cable to keep in touch with the town of Fort William down below. In 1903 their measurements record a terrible storm, mentioned in James Joyce’s Ulysses because it uprooted lots of trees in Ireland. “We can now reconstruct the characteristics of this storm much better because it went right over the top of Ben Nevis,” says Hawkins.

A crunch meeting of the prime minister’s new Brexit sub-committee, set up to discuss the government’s strategy for critical negotiations, agreed to a calculation of the divorce bill that would result in a larger payment. But the leading ministers, including key leave campaigners Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, agreed that the government should be prepared to withdraw the divorce bill offer if they were unhappy with the final Brexit deal. Some sources claim the final figure could reach £40bn, but no specific figure was discussed in the meeting. “It remains our position that nothing’s agreed until everything’s agreed in negotiations with the EU,” a Downing Street source said. A source close to those attending the session made clear that this referred to the total package including the future trading relationship as well as the divorce agreement, which focuses on EU citizens’ rights, the Irish border and the financial settlement. Critics believe that such a deal would take years to conclude, although the government insists that an outline of the agreement must be hammered out before Brexit takes place in spring 2019. Sources made clear that May also expects reciprocity this December with the EU moving discussions onto trade talks and on Monday repeated her new Brexit mantra that the EU and the UK “should move forward together”. The reaction in Brussels is likely to be relief that the British government has moved on the divorce bill. However EU officials have said they will want to take time to drill into the detail of what the UK is offering before giving any response publicly or privately. There will also be concerns about any linking of payment of the financial settlement to a particular outcome in the negotiations. However, senior Brexit-supporting Tory MPs said May should not be increasing the UK’s offer at a time of instability in Germany, with the collapse of coalition talks in the country potentially impacting on Brexit negotiations. Iain Duncan Smith suggested the prime minister should “sit tight”, while Jacob Rees-Mogg said it would be foolish to up the figure at this time. The subcommittee, which also includes the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, spoke at length about what that future relationship with the EU might look like. One cabinet source said it was the first time a formal discussion had tackled that matter. The meeting came after the EU’s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, made clear that while the EU wanted an ambitious partnership on trade, the 27-country bloc would not compromise over trading standards. “The UK has chosen to leave the EU. Does it want to stay close to the European model or does it want to gradually move away from it?” he asked, warning that divergence from continental policies would make it difficult to secure agreement from the EU’s 27 remaining countries. Earlier this month, Barnier said May’s government had just two weeks to provide clarifications around its financial commitments if it wanted to shift talks from questions of divorce to the critical issue of trade. Last week, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, stretched that deadline by suggesting that progress on the financial settlement and the question of the Irish border “needs to happen at the beginning of December at the latest”. British negotiators are keen to avoid being forced into a timetable set by the EU but are acutely aware of the need to put forward any proposals that could break the deadlock at least one week before the next European council on 14 and 15 December. They believe that would mark the final opportunity to take action, but also think that waiting until the last possible moment is in their interest in negotiating terms. Monday’s meeting provided a principled agreement that the divorce bill could be calculated in a way that would result in a bigger figure being paid out. But the prime minister wants to stress that she expects reciprocity. Earlier in the day, she repeated her new Brexit mantra that “we’ve got to move forward together” in the talks. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has made clear that he sees the bigger picture as the final trading agreement, telling MPs: “It is only in this context, that we can finally settle this issue.” Meanwhile, sources have suggested ministers were poised to offer a concession to potential Conservative rebels in order to avoid the first possible defeat on the EU withdrawal bill. May was left facing the prospect of losing a vote in parliament on Tuesday when Labour’s Keir Starmer said his party would throw its weight behind Tory MPs over the question of the EU’s charter of fundamental rights. The shadow Brexit secretary said that opposition MPs were ready to back the former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, and nine other Conservatives on an amendment that would bring the charter into UK law after Brexit. That would ensure enough MPs to defeat the government. However, sources have told the Guardian that ministers are looking to offer assurances from the dispatch box that they will take another look at the issue. There was also a suggestion that at least one senior cabinet member was concerned about the idea of Britain still having to accept European court of justice rulings after Brexit. Although the government insists that the UK will no longer be under the direct jurisdiction of the European court at that point, the prime minister made clear in her Florence speech that European laws would be followed during transition. Grieve said a promise from the government to take time to consider his amendments between now and the bill’s report stage would prevent him from pushing it to a vote. “Throughout this process, in respect to these types of amendments, the purpose is not to defeat the government but concentrate the government’s mind on to the consequences of the changes and to ask it to reconsider its approach,” he said. The MP, whose amendments are backed by colleagues including Ken Clarke, Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Antoinette Sandbach, said there was good reason to give ministers time to consider how to respond if they promised they would scrutinise the matter further. However, the rebels could return to the issue at the bill’s next stage. Starmer called on the government to change course or face defeat, saying: “Labour will not let the government use Brexit as an excuse to roll back fundamental rights. The charter is vital for ensuring the rights of people living in the UK are protected, including the elderly and those from the LGBT community. And yet, ministers want to drop it for the sake of appealing to the extreme voices in the Tory party.” The human rights groups, Liberty and Amnesty, the Unison union and the Public Law Project, have teamed up to urge MPs to support the amendments on the charter with cross-party support. In a joint statement, they said: “Abandoning the charter is not a necessary part of the Brexit process. The future of human rights protections should not be snuck into the already complicated withdrawal bill debate. If the government wants a smooth and orderly transition, now is not the time for major policy moves and arguments over rights. “MPs who believe in freedom, fairness and standing up for their constituents’ rights should vote to keep the charter today.” Daniel Boffey in Brussels contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/nov/21/sevilla-v-liverpool-champions-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T21:58:08Z","webTitle":"Sevilla 3-3 Liverpool: Champions League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/nov/21/sevilla-v-liverpool-champions-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/nov/21/sevilla-v-liverpool-champions-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Sevilla 3-3 Liverpool: Champions League – as it happened","bodyText":"Here’s a match report. It’s been remarkable. Bye! When they needed an experienced player to lead the team through a difficult moment and out the other side, none was available. Lovren (28) and Klavan (32) were too busy panicking, and Henderson (27) might know how to gee a side up but has no idea how to calm one down. That was pure madness from Liverpool. Moreno made a couple of key errors at key moments, and the path of the game was turned on its head. He will get much of the blame, but the entire team crumbled in adversity. Players who were irresistible in the first half became invisible. Oh yeah, that’s the one. Liverpool, with a home game against Spartak Moscow to go, top Group E with nine points and by some distance the best goal difference (+10). Sevilla, who are away at Maribor, are on eight (and a goal different of zero), and Spartak on six (their goal difference is +3). Maribor are out, with two points (and, for completeness, a goal difference of -13). 90+7 mins: That wasn’t it, but now it is it. Or something. A remarkable match is over. Two halves of the same game, or something. 90+6 mins: Sevilla mount one last attack, but Correa is offside and surely that’ll be it. 90+4 mins: Ludicrous. Remarkable. Phenomenal entertainment, but how did it come to this? They’ve done it! The corner comes in, falls to the floor, and is poked through a thicket of legs and past Karius by Sarabia! 90+3 mins: Sarabia, desperate, does a ludicrous dive outside the penalty area. The ball rolls on to Geis, whose shot is deflected wide. 90+2 mins: Lovren just gets a foot in to stop Muriel spinning and heading towards goal. The ball is booted clear. Two more minutes. 90+1 mins: There will be four minutes added on for stoppages. 89 mins: There was no penalty: Mane dived ludicrously when Geis tapped him gently on a shoulder. 88 mins: Mane goes down in the area. There’s no whistle and the ball falls to Milner, who drives it across goal but there’s nobody there to tap in! 88 mins: The clock ticks. Liverpool have possession deep in Sevilla’s half. 86 mins: One last substitution for Liverpool, which seems Alex Olade-Chamberlain come on for Mo Salah. 85 mins: Oooh! Vazquez goes clear on the left and his cut-back is just too far from Correa, who flings a leg at it and misses. 82 mins: Emre Can is booked for absolutely nothing. Well, not entirely nothing: he brushed Mercado’s shirt with a palm, but the reaction was totally absurd. 81 mins: Another fine chance for Liverpool! This time Mane is played through, and with the goalkeeper advancing he tries to slam a drive inside the post, but slams it outside the post. 81 mins: There will be no hat-trick for Ben Yedder. He’s off, and Joaquin Correa is on. 78 mins: What a chance for Liverpool! Salah runs down the right and passes inside to Can inside the area, and he need only slide it across to Mane whose task would have been simple, but Banega flings out a leg and diverts the pass behind! 78 mins: Um, don’t tweet too soon. Sevilla win a corner, but Karius punches it clear. 75 mins: Whistles from the stands as Liverpool keep the ball for a bit. “In hockey, this would be described as a game of three periods. I’m not sure what the equivalent is in football,” writes Rob Edwards. 74 mins: A vague semblance of calm has briefly settled over the game. “Yeah, yeah, I know. Liverpool build a lead, and their opponents come right back, yedder, yedder, yedder! Tell me something I don’t know!” writes Peter Oh, channelling Seinfeld. 72 mins: Sevilla bring on Luis Muriel, and take off Nolito. 71 mins: Chance for Liverpool! Rico needlessly fumbles a weak right-wing cross and Sevilla fail to clear. Firmino steals the ball which rolls to Salah, who takes an unnecessary touch before shooting. It’s deflected wide. 70 mins: Sarabia reacts furiously to an offside decision going against him. He was clearly offside. 68 mins: Henderson is booked for fouling Escudero. “It’s a shame there isn’t a term of common parlance to describe a fixture where the first 50% of the contest is strikingly different from the subsequent 50%,” writes Paul Griffin. 66 mins: Football, though, eh? Isn’t it? 65 mins: That Vazquez chance would not have counted, because there was a Sevilla player basically standing on Karius’s toes, in an offside position. 63 mins: Liverpool make a double substitution, putting Moreno out of his misery and Philippe Coutinho a breather, and bringing on James Milner and Emre Can. 62 mins: Sevilla hit the bar! Vazquez chests the ball down in the penalty area and shoots goalwards, and it hits the underside of Karius’s body and bounces up into the bar! 62 mins: Now Vazquez escapes from Moreno and blasts a shot at goal, which Karius catches. 61 mins: This is remarkable stuff. Moreno is making a concerted attempt to win Sevilla’s man of the match award. Karius goes the other way, and so does Ben Yedder. Goal! It’s on! 60 mins: Ben Yedder sends it into the corner, but the referee spots some encroachment and tells him to retake it! 59 mins: Moreno miscontrols, the ball runs between his legs, and Ben Yedder runs onto it. Moreno sticks out a leg in an attempt to win it back, and treads on Ben Yedder’s toe. The reaction is comically ridiculously over the top, but it is a penalty. 58 mins: Liverpool have barely been out of their half since the break. 56 mins: Escudero has three opportunities to cross, in quick succession, his efforts getting better each time and ending with Moreno heading clear, with Karius poorly positioned and unable to assist. 55 mins: That gives Sevilla another attacking free-kick, but three of their players are caught offside as the ball goes in. 54 mins: Mercado is booked for angrily screaming at the referee after Sevilla awarded a free kick. Probably – rightly – telling him that it was never a free kick, and he should have just waved play on. Moreno commits an unnecessary foul just outside the penalty area on the right, and Banega’s cross is headed across goal and in by Ben Yedder at the near post. Game on! 50 mins: Gomez has made a couple of mistakes at right-back, though they haven’t really been punished. One led to Nolito’s excellent chance in the first half, and he just let a ball bounce in his own penalty area that he should have just headed clear, with a Sevilla player behind him, and got away with that as well. 48 mins: Banega floats a ball into the area, and Sarabia runs onto it with no defender anywhere remotely near. Surely, you think, he’s offside? Well it turns out he was, but only just, and also he got clattered by Karius. 46 mins: And Sevilla nearly score in the first minute, Lovren rescuing a worrying situation caused by Moreno’s poor header with a fine challenge. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! The visitors get the second half started. The players are back out, and Sevilla will replace N’Zonzi with Franco Vazquez for the second half. It is true that Sevilla are defensively enfeebled. Kjaer and Pareja both started at Anfield. Carrico had an operation last month and is out for a bit. The game has hinged on a couple of chaotic minutes in which Sevilla missed two great chances to equalise, and then Liverpool ran up the other end and scored a second. Since then, Sevilla have crumbled and might have already conceded half a dozen as Liverpool rampage at pace around the field. 45+2 mins: Sevilla’s best move for a while ends with Karius beating Ben Yedder to a through ball. 45+1 mins: There’ll be two minutes or so of stoppage time. And another Liverpool player has scored: 45+1 mins: Salah passes to Coutinho, who is in a ludicrous amount of space in midfield. He sends a vicious shot dipping goalwards, but straight to Rico. 45 mins: Now Banega is booked, for pulling back Coutinho. 44 mins: A poor Sevilla cross lands on the head of an unchallenged Moreno, who charitably heads behind. He atones for the error by heading away the corner. 42 mins: Liverpool are ripping Seville to shreds here. Mane has time and space on the left, and Salah to pick out in the middle, but his cross is too close to Rico. 41 mins: Mane’s comedy late, cynical trip on Banega is somehow not punished with a yellow card. 40 mins: Liverpool should have had a fourth! Sevilla give the ball away in midfield, it’s passed to Coutinho and from him to Salah, running all alone into the penalty area, but his low left-foot shot is saved! 40 mins: Firmino looked the other way before scoring his second, and Liverpool’s third, which is just showing off. “Nice no-look welter into the open goal from Firmino,” writes Ian Copestake. “That was for the ball-boy!” 38 mins: Moreno is booked for fouling Mercado. Both went in one-footed for a bouncing ball – Mercado got the ball, and Moreno scraped a calf. Not a lot in it, though you wouldn’t know that by looking at Mercado’s reaction. 37 mins: They don’t. Coutinho’s corner falls perfectly for Lovren to volley goalwards, but he totally misses his kick. The ball is poorly cleared and Salah has a shooting chance from 20 yards, which he hoofs high. 36 mins: Coutinho and Salah exchange passes in and around the Sevilla penalty area, and it ends with another corner. They couldn’t … 34 mins: Sevilla have conceded 12 goals in 12 La Liga matches, which is neither exemplary nor disastrous, but their defence is entirely unable to keep up with any of Mane, Salah or Firmino, and it’s causing them no end of grief. Extraordinary! A simple long ball sets Mane sprinting down the left. He cuts onto his right foot and shoots, much as Firmino did a few minutes ago, too close to Rico, but this time the goalkeeper’s touch carries the ball not behind for a corner but straight to the feet of Firmino, who has time to control, pause, and shoot into an empty net! 28 mins: There’s a bit of a kerfuffle as a ball boy gives the ball to Gomez in a rather aggressive manner and is told to calm down by Gomez, followed by Klopp, followed by the referee. 27 mins: The second has led to a slight dip in tempo, from absurdly high to just average. 25 mins: There was a camera positioned at just the right angle to show Mane’s header curling beautifully inside the post. But though the players involved inside the penalty area weren’t identical, it is extremely unusual to see two such similar goals in the same game. Liverpool score the same goal again! Coutinho’s fine, firm, dipping cross from the right, a flick-on by Firmino this time, and Mane is at the far post, diving to head back across goal and into the corner of the net! 21 mins: Now Liverpool miss a great chance! Henderson sets Firmino on a foot race with Lenglet and the Brazilian wins it with ease, runs into the area, and then hits a low shot too close to Rico, whose touch takes it wide. 20 mins: Ben Yedder misses a sitter! This time Sevilla find a player in space on the right of the penalty area, and he slides the ball past the onrushing Karius and just past the far post! 19 mins: Sevilla hit the post! Ben Yedder finds Nolito, running beyond Gomez down the left. Gomez catches up, whereupon Nolito cuts onto his right foot, Gomez falls over, and the forward curls the ball towards the far post. Karius touches it, and it hits the post and bounces back to the keeper! 18 mins: Firmino dramatically goes over a sliding Sevilla challenge, five yards outside the penalty area. The referee tells him to get up. 17 mins: Lovren goes on a run down the right wing, is picked out, and then tries to dance around Lenglet. His right-winger impression isn’t great, though, and he ends up losing control of the ball and bungling it into touch. 16 mins: Salah is robbed in his own half by Escudero. Nothing much comes of it, but the visitors’ attempts at high-speed rapid-passing escapes from their own defence are causing danger only to themselves at the moment. 15 mins: Escudero doesn’t so much make a meal of a Joe Gomez challenge but opens an entire restaurant chain of it. It was basically no challenge at all. The referee isn’t fooled. 14 mins: Nice to see Nolito in action again. I’ve always enjoyed his resemblance to Jamie Woon. 13 mins: Nolito finds Escudero in space with a nice little pass, and Escudero attempts to blast the ball inside the near post from an acute angle, and hits wide. 9 mins: Benega disects Liverpool’s two-man defensive midfield with a lovely pass to Sarabia, who then messes everything up by mishitting a pass straight out of play. 8 mins: Lightning doesn’t strike twice: Rico comes out to punch this one to safety. 8 mins: Mane motors down the inside left channel, fails to spot Salah to his right and instead has a shot from the edge of the area, which is deflected wide. Liverpool have their second corner. 7 mins: A prolonged period of high-tempo midfield to-and-fro, which ends for now with Lovren chesting the ball back to Karius. 4 mins: Back at Anfield Sevilla took the lead in the fifth minute, and thought they’d started well. Pah. And it leads to a goal! Coutinho sends in a lovely, pacey, dipping cross, Wijnaldum flicks on at the near post, and Firmino crashes in at the far! 2 mins: An early corner for Liverpool, won by Mane on the right. 1 min: Peeeeeep! The home side get the game started. Before the teams emerged there was a fine light show, or rather a lack of light show, as the stadium lights were dimmed but for a few coloured spotlights. Up with this kind of thing. The players are out, and currently enjoying the Champions League anthem. Jurgen Klopp has had a pre-match chat: I think Hoffenheim had a longer [unbeaten] run before we came there. We know how strong they are, how special the atmosphere is here. I tried to prepare the boys for it and we’ll see how they handle it, but it’s special, 100%. [The first game, drawn 2-2] was one of our best games we played. We should have scored much more often and the goals we conceded were, well, like the goals we conceded so far. It was a really good game. The performance, when was it, six weeks ago, was already really good. Of course we need to do better tonight. This is their home ground, we need to do the right things in the moment, we need to fight, really fight, be aggressive, but not too aggressive. We have grown since then, and that’s the reason we have the chance to go in the next round. I was not, with all the games, unhappy [with the defence]. It’s not that I think we can never concede a goal any more, unfortunately. There will be a few challenges for us tonight. They are good, really experienced, and they use this special atmosphere. It’s different to England, it’s different to Germany, so whoever’s here tonight, enjoy it. Sevilla’s away dressing room is a little furniture-light, isn’t it? “Watching the pre-match feed, I saw them showing many members of the crowd wearing white watch-like wristbands,” writes Mark Imrie. “What are they?” Anyone? So two changes for Liverpool: Loris Karius, who has played every Champions League game this season, replaces Simon Mignolet in goal, and Joe Gomez comes in at right back, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold. The team sheets are in, and they look like this: Sevilla: Sergio Rico, Mercado, Geis, Lenglet, Escudero, Nzonzi, Banega, Pizarro, Sarabia, Ben Yedder, Nolito. Subs: Soria, Corchia, Krohn-Dehli, Correa, Jesus Navas, Muriel, Vazquez. Liverpool: Karius, Gomez, Lovren, Klavan, Moreno, Wijnaldum, Henderson, Coutinho, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Mignolet, Milner, Sturridge, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Can, Solanke, Alexander-Arnold. Referee: Felix Brych (Germany) Hello world! So, the Champions League comes roaring back, with Liverpool attempting to atone for a slightly irritating 2-2 home draw in which, to quote Andy Hunter’s match report, “Liverpool dominated for long periods and recovered impressively from conceding an early goal to a wily Sevilla side but, and it is a recurring theme, individual and collective defensive lapses showed the Champions League what the Premier League has long suspected – that Klopp has constructed an exhilarating attacking force on weak foundations.” It won’t be an easy task. Seville have a 100% home record in Group E, and have won six of their last eight European home matches, last losing on – telling date coming, omen fans – 22 November 2016. Liverpool, meanwhile, have lost on their last three visits to Spain and always by the same score, 1-0. A win would carry Liverpool into the knock-out stages. They have conceded considerably fewer goals than Sevilla – three to the Spaniards’ eight – and scored considerably more – 13 to their eight – but for all that have but a single point more going into the game. With a fair wind behind it it should all be tremendous fun. Welcome! Let’s share these happy times together."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/20/kent-grammar-school-announces-plans-for-unsafe-space-including-mein-kampf","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-20T21:22:28Z","webTitle":"Kent grammar school plans 'unsafe space' including Mein Kampf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/20/kent-grammar-school-announces-plans-for-unsafe-space-including-mein-kampf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/20/kent-grammar-school-announces-plans-for-unsafe-space-including-mein-kampf","fields":{"headline":"Kent grammar school plans 'unsafe space' including Mein Kampf","bodyText":"A grammar school that has previously been criticised for inviting the right-wing controversialist Milo Yiannopoulos to speak has announced plans to create an “unsafe space” incorporating texts including Mein Kampf. Sixth form pupils at the Simon Langton grammar school for boys in Canterbury will take part in a forum which is described as “an antidote to the poison of political correctness” and examine “the most beautifully disturbed and disturbing ideas, all of them presented without trigger warnings”. The school’s headteacher, Matthew Baxter, said that the forum would not involve the study of Mein Kampf but simply incorporate it in “wider debate”. But the optional classes for 17- and 18-year-old pupils were criticised by some students, who were told about the plans on Monday. The scheme’s name appears to be a play on the phrase “safe space” – a zone in which a person or category of people can feel confident that they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment, or any other emotional or physical harm. Two pupils said that the teacher in charge, Professor James S, had joked about LGBT groups by presenting the term with a string of random letters and numbers appended to it. The school has also scheduled lectures on the subjects “Women versus feminism” and “not all cultures are created equal”. James S, director of humanities at the school – which is mixed in the sixth form – told pupils that the first session would be devoted to a controversial memo circulated by the fired Google employee James Damore that claimed that women were innately less capable as engineers. James S defended it as a “much-needed forum for debate”. But Sarah Cundy, 18, said: “When [James S] was talking about doing this, he said we’ll look at the memo and highlight the pros and cons of his argument. To hear a teacher say there are any pros at all in the argument did make me feel pretty uncomfortable. “I think female and minority students are going to face more issues. I think there will be a rise in sexism, which I would say is already an issue at the school – especially with it being an all-boys school except sixth form.” Connie Kissock, also 18, agreed, saying: “As a female student, when I hear male teachers promoting anti-feminist ideas it makes me worry, particularly in an all-male environment. Especially among younger students, it can seem like a joke but end up being taken further.” She explained that while she “definitely support[s] discussing a broad range of ideas in academic environments” she believes the speaker events organised by James S have “become an attack on what they see as leftist bias. We’ve had a speaker on women’s antifeminism, we’re going to have one on why all cultures aren’t equal, implying that non-Western cultures are inferior”. Students said that a PowerPoint presentation given by James S. on Monday included “a joke at the expense of the LGBT community”. Alice Lefever, 18, explained: “LGBT was mentioned in the PowerPoint, followed by a string of letters and numbers, none of which were intended to give representation, but instead to mock.” Last year, the school was criticised for inviting Yiannopoulos, a former pupil, to speak. The event, which was also organised by James S, was cancelled because of “the threat of demonstrations at the school by organised groups and members of the public”. James S told the Guardian: “The Unsafe Space is a much-needed forum for debate about a host of issues seen from both sides of the ideological spectrum. We are not interested in fomenting xenophobia, racism or sexism. We are interested in evaluating arguments, not putting stilts under postures.” The school librarian, Janeen Barker, said she helped him put together the PowerPoint presentation and said the LGBT acronym was a real one and not a joke. She said: “I wanted to be as inclusive as possible by trying to use an LGBT-friendly term. I found the acronym LGBTQQIP2SAA on the following websites, both of which I thought were respectful of the community, as am I.” Headteacher Matthew Baxter said the course was designed to enable pupils preparing for university to discuss ideas outside of the conventional curriculum. He said: “These are topics which sixth form students routinely discuss in their own time and ones which they should be able to discuss with adults in a school which encourages ‘free speech’ in all the highest academic traditions of such a phrase. “This does not mean that inappropriate language is permitted – as this is checked and modelled when students are much younger.” • This article was amended on 14 February 2019 to remove some personal information."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/08/robert-mercer-offshore-dark-money-hillary-clinton-paradise-papers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T15:01:57Z","webTitle":"Robert Mercer invested offshore dark money to sink Clinton.

He must be delighted","bodyText":"Even as he attempts to retreat further into the shadows of dark money, Robert Mercer can’t hide. The reclusive hedge fund billionaire recently turned over his political operations to other family members, but his outsized role in electing Donald Trump keeps reverberating. A cache of leaked documents known as the Paradise Papers and further reporting by the Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Mercer used secret offshore companies in Bermuda to avoid taxes and fund his efforts to sink Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Leaked documents and newly obtained public filings showed how the Mercer family built a $60m war chest for conservative causes inside their family foundation by using an offshore investment vehicle to legally avoid US tax. Among the gifts from the foundation was $4.7m the Mercers gave to the Government Accountability Institute run by Steve Bannon. Mercer used the Bermuda companies to avoid a little-known US tax of up to 39% on tens of millions of dollars in investment profits amassed by the foundation and a retirement fund for the staff of Mercer’s hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies. Bannon’s group was crucially important because it helped create the only dossier on Russian collusion that actually affected the outcome of the 2016 election. This was not the infamous document compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, which had its own secret funding (more on that below). It was the manuscript for the book, Clinton Cash, written by Peter Schweizer and paid for by the Government Accountability Institute. Schweizer is now editor-at-large at Bannon’s Breitbart News, also funded by the Mercers. Clinton Cash included material derived from investigative reporting by legitimate journalists and some new donor records from the Clinton Foundation, adding a few original nuggets here and there. Its most damaging finding focused on a Russian uranium deal and a multimillion-dollar contributor to the Clinton Foundation. The book laid out a corrupt quid pro quo in which Hillary Clinton’s state department approved the deal for Russia to acquire large US uranium assets after large contributions to the foundation from the donor and his associates. There were obvious holes in the story. Clinton herself said she had nothing to do with approving the deal. The state department was one of nine federal agencies involved in the 2010 decision and usually approved such foreign transactions. When Trump seized on the story as a central part of his Crooked Hillary brief, Politifact rated it “mostly wrong”. Still, Bannon, flush with the cash from Mercer’s tax-averse foundation, had amazing success getting the Schweizer dossier into the right hands, the mainstream media. The New York Times and Washington Post forged “exclusive” deals to see the Clinton Cash manuscript (AKA dossier) before publication and to use it for leads. In April 2015 the Times published a splashy takeout on the uranium deal, also suggesting, albeit more carefully than Schweizer did, a quid pro quo. Bannon, according to the book Devil’s Bargain, considered this a triumph. Injecting a clearly partisan book into the bloodstream of the mainstream press was indeed a feat, one that damaged Clinton, as her trust and honesty ratings began a nosedive in polls. The manuscript of the 2015 book was really the only “dossier” to do damage in the campaign. The Steele dossier, commissioned first by a conservative newspaper during the Republican primaries and then funded by a law firm that represented Clinton, became public only after the election and remains one of the murky clues in Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Just as Mueller’s expected indictment of Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, began to dominate the headlines, President Trump began ranting about the uranium deal all over again and calling on the FBI to investigate. This was classic Trump, the master of distraction. As the Russia noose was moving closer to his own neck, he let loose on Twitter and in White House statements. “Your real Russia story is uranium,” he repeated, once again decrying any allegation of Russian collusion with his own campaign as “a hoax”. Fox and the rest of the rightwing press have also dusted off the uranium story, pinning their hopes on an FBI informant and a story published by a Washington DC newspaper, the Hill. The informant’s Republican lawyer claims he has more damaging information that may become public. We’ll see. Another old scandal, Clinton’s supposedly unholy deal with the Democratic National Committee to screw Bernie Sanders out of the Democratic nomination has also come roaring back. This reprise comes via a new book by Donna Brazile, the Democratic apparatchik. But the early party help Clinton got was more or less known last summer when the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee’s emails was first disclosed. As the Democratic convention began, Brazile’s predecessor resigned. On 24 July, 2016, the Washington Post reported, “Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida was forced aside by the release of thousands of embarrassing emails among party officials that appeared to show coordinated efforts to help Clinton at the expense of her rivals in the Democratic primaries.” Brazile’s book provides more details, but so what? Between President Trump on uranium and the big headlines about Brazile’s book, you’d think Hillary Clinton was still running for president. No doubt, the Clinton-hater Robert Mercer must be delighted. His original investment in the Government Accountability Institute has more than paid off. He not only managed to finance the successful election of Trump, but also to see his original plan to kill Clinton come back to life. And, according to the Paradise Papers, all of this was accomplished at a very nice tax saving. It’s a Trifecta. Call it the Bermuda Triangle.

Visitors to the temple will now descend through steep, black stone-lined stairs, in Bloomberg’s new European headquarters, to seven metres below the city streets where in Roman times the smelly river Walbrook once flowed sluggishly through marshy ground. In approximately 240AD, the Romans built a temple next to the river to one of their most mysterious cult figures, Mithras the bull-slayer. The virile young god from the east was beloved of soldiers who worshipped him by the light of flaring torches in underground temples, where the blood of sacrificial animals soaked into the mud floor. The reconstruction of his rites includes the soundtrack of shuffling sandalled feet and voices chanting in Latin the names of the levels of initiates taken from graffiti on a temple in Rome: the god still guards many of his secrets. “It was a mystery cult and its rites remain very well guarded mysteries. There is nothing written about what went on in the temples, no book of Mithras,” said Sophie Jackson, the lead archaeologist from the Museum of London Archaeology who has spent years working on the excavation and reconstruction. “The one thing we do know is that no bulls were sacrificed there. It was a very confined space and I don’t think anyone would have got out alive.” The temple was a sensation when it was discovered in 1954 and swaths of London still lay in ruins after the war, but its redisplay was generally regarded as one of the most disappointing tourist sites in the city, with all the mystery of a suburban front garden. The site was identified as a Mithraeum when in the last hours of the excavation the carved head of a handsome young god was found. A newspaper photographer happened to be nearby and as the word spread thousands joined queues that stretched for half a mile around the block, waiting patiently to view the muddy foundations. The public excitement and the keen interest of the then prime minister Winston Churchill forced Legal &amp; General to abandon plans to demolish the foundations to make way for its grim new office block. Instead, after eight years in storage in a builder’s yard, in 1962 the walls were partially reconstructed 100 yards from the original site, inaccurately and incorporating new stone brought in to fill gaps and material lost over the years. The god’s head and other beautiful carvings went to the Museum of London and the original timber benches, which archaeologists now regard as rare treasure, were thrown away. Bloomberg’s European headquarters, designed by Lord Norman Foster, stands on one of the richest archaeological sites in London – by one estimate a 10th of the Roman objects on display in the Museum of London come from a century of excavations on various patches of the land. Much was destroyed by the excavations of deep basements of later buildings, but where the archaeological layer survived, the soggy ground led to startling preservation, including hundreds of wooden tablets faintly preserving the oldest handwritten documents ever found in Britain, from the first years after the Roman invasion, including the first recorded use of the word Londinium. Michael Bloomberg, the founder of the company, said they were stewards of the ancient site and its artefacts. “London has a long history as a crossroads for culture and business, and we are building on that tradition.” The Mithraeum incorporates a new daylit art gallery at ground level with an opening installation, Another View from Nowhen, by the Dublin artist Isabel Nolan. A huge glass case displays more than 600 of the 14,000 objects found on the site, including a wooden door, a hobnailed sandal, a tiny gladiator’s helmet carved in amber, and a wooden tablet with the oldest record of a financial transaction from Britain. London Mithraeum, at Bloomberg SPACE, will open every day except Monday from 14 November. Entrance is free but advance booking is advised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/nov/12/starwatch-1ioumuamua-first-interstellar-visitor-hawaiian-sighting","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-12T21:30:05Z","webTitle":"Starwatch:  First interstellar visitor's name is nod to Hawaiian sighting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/12/starwatch-1ioumuamua-first-interstellar-visitor-hawaiian-sighting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/nov/12/starwatch-1ioumuamua-first-interstellar-visitor-hawaiian-sighting","fields":{"headline":"Starwatch:  First interstellar visitor's name is nod to Hawaiian sighting","bodyText":"Astronomers finally have a name for the first known object from interstellar space to visit our solar system. The International Astronomical Union announced last week that it is to be called 1I/‘Oumuamua where “1I” designates it as the first interstellar object and ‘Oumuamua is a Hawaiian word that is said to reflect the way that this is akin to a scout or messenger reaching out to us from the past. The name was chosen by the astronomers who used the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope in Hawaii to discover the dim visitor on 18 October. It had already swept through perihelion within 38m km of the Sun on the 9th and 24m km from the Earth on the 14th. Its path is shown on our diagram where it is plotted in yellow when it lies above the Earth’s orbit of the Sun, the ecliptic, and in blue as it passed below. The initial reaction was to name it as the comet C/2017 U1 (PANSTARRS) but it soon became clear that it was no ordinary comet. The more than 5,000 comets that have been analysed to date have all been members of the Sun’s family. Some follow closed elliptical paths, returning to the Sun periodically, while others plunge towards the Sun along almost parabolic orbits from the Oort cloud, a postulated spherical reservoir of billions of icy bodies at the edge of the solar system. The new object was clearly in a hyperbolic orbit that had brought it from beyond the Oort cloud at a relative speed of 26km per second. Having passed the Sun, it is now speeding away in a very different direction, towards the Square of Pegasus, never to return. More observation also failed to detect any trace of a tail or coma, the diffuse envelope of gas and dust that we expect around every comet, at least while they are in the inner solar system. This makes it look asteroidal in nature and led to its relabelling as A/2017 U1, the first time this had been done. But all known asteroids follow elliptical orbits and are firmly in the Sun’s grip. The time was ripe for the newly conceived title of 1I/‘Oumuamua. The name itself is a surprise, and not only because of its leading Hawaiian punctuation, called an ‘okina. Hitherto, asteroids have usually been named only after they have been tracked for several years. In fact, because of its faintness, there is every prospect this object will be lost from view very quickly. It is thought to be less than 200 metres wide, rocky in nature with a reddish surface and it probably escaped from an alien star system millions or billions of years ago, perhaps being flung out by a Jupiter-sized planet during the process of star formation. It approached the solar system from a direction close to that of Vega in Lyra, the bright star 25 light years away and high in our W sky this evening. Vega, though, is probably not the parent star since it was elsewhere when ’Oumuamua passed that point about 300,000 years ago. Although there are attempts to trace it back to its origin, the chance of success is slim since that star may be many thousands of light years away, or even on the far side of our Milky Way galaxy. And it is worth remembering that if ‘Oumuamua is ever spotted by alien astronomers in the distant future they would be mistaken if its motion led them to regard it as an escapee from our Sun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/08/simple-facts-catalan-secessionism-selfish-goal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T12:40:17Z","webTitle":"Catalan nationalism isn’t the progressive cause you might think | Aurora Nacarino-Brabo and Jorge San Miguel Lobeto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/simple-facts-catalan-secessionism-selfish-goal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/simple-facts-catalan-secessionism-selfish-goal","fields":{"headline":"Catalan nationalism isn’t the progressive cause you might think","bodyText":"For many Europeans, it was impossible not to feel sympathy for Catalans when images of riot police suppressing an illegal election appeared all over the media at the beginning of October. Then came the dismissal of the Catalan government by Madrid after the Spanish senate approved the execution of article 155 of the constitution. Finally, a judge in Madrid ordered eight members of the deposed Catalan government to be remanded in custody pending possible charges of rebellion, sedition and embezzlement of funds, among others. These events have aroused controversy in the sphere of European public opinion and garnered Madrid some criticism for its handling of the crisis. However, most analyses lack understanding of the movement behind the Catalan drive for independence, namely Catalan nationalism. In the runup to the next regional elections scheduled for 21 December, it might be useful to provide English-speaking audiences with some facts that have remained somewhat obscured. To begin with, Catalonia is far from oppressed under any sensible analysis. It’s one of the highest-income regions in Spain, representing about a fifth of its GDP. Catalans are more educated and have lower unemployment than the Spanish average. Since 1977, Catalans have enjoyed a regional government vested with extensive powers in tax matters, education, public services and foreign representation, and they use and promote their own language to the point of marginalising Castilian, which happens to be the most widely spoken language in Catalonia. Although regional institutions were suspended from 1938 to 1977, Catalan bourgeois elites have displayed remarkable survival instincts, entering into alliances with the forces of the Spanish right whenever they deemed it necessary to maintain order. Catalan conservative nationalists have ruled the region for more than three decades in the democratic period. These same nationalists have voted in favour of about half of the national budgets during this period. If changes are to be made in Spain’s federal structure, they shouldn’t be based upon the false assumption that Catalonia has had no role in national politics. It is worth reminding ourselves of which Catalans have had a role in Spanish politics. It has been, overwhelmingly, the Catalan elites, which brings us to another important detail: Catalan nationalism is neither inclusive nor progressive. Catalonia is inhabited by two cultural communities, each representing about half the population. But in terms of income, social status and influence the difference is stark. The Spanish-speaking population, immigrants or descendants of economic migrants who arrived in the 20th century, is, on average, less wealthy, less educated and less politically mobilised. Contrast this with the extraordinary degree of mobilisation among Catalan nationalists, who have colonised all the regional power centres, and a subsidised press and civil society. Lower-income citizens vote overwhelmingly for non-secessionist parties such as Ciudadanos (liberal), PSC (social-democrat), Catalunya Sí Que Es Pot (left) and PP (conservative) that today add up to about 48% of the vote, more than the ruling coalition. This bloc is more popular in urban Catalonia, as opposed to the more nationalistic rural interior. Catalan nationalism has featured clear appeals to ethnicity, and any reader can search on the internet for dog-whistle or outright supremacist statements. Common messages have included “Spain steals from us”, “Subsidised Spain lives off productive Catalonia”, or posters showing ragged kids from southern Spain living off the taxes paid by the Catalan middle class. In the last few years, secessionists have attempted to give a sheen of democratic legitimacy to an essentially ethno-linguistic movement, conveniently sidestepping concerns over the rule of law. “This is all about democracy”, they said. Nothing was said, though, about the fundamental nature of the vote, which was nothing other than an attempt to deprive non-secessionist Catalans, the majority, of their citizenship rights. Arnaldo Otegi, a former member of Eta, turned activist for the Catalan nationalist cause, said on Twitter: “Democracy consists in respecting what people say. Laws come after.” This movement’s nationalism and populism are reinforced by the current international context. The last great recession spurred the ascent of leaders wedded to identity politics and plebiscites, two factors that frequently lead to polarisation and social fracture. It’s not hard to find parallels with other phenomena in Europe and the world. Think about them rather than pondering romantic ideas about oppressed peoples fighting for their civil rights. Catalan secessionism, like the Padania version in Italy or Brexit, is at its core a questionable, selfish goal. It may be up for debate, for sure, but it’s not right to present that debate as being one of freedom versus oppression, when there is clearly so much more to the picture. • Aurora Nacarino-Brabo and Jorge San Miguel Lobeto are political scientists, serving as advisers to the Ciudadanos party in the Spanish parliament"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/09/the-retreat-review-sam-bain-kathy-burke-adam-deacon","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"The Retreat review – gag overkill in new comedy from Peep Show's Sam Bain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/09/the-retreat-review-sam-bain-kathy-burke-adam-deacon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/nov/09/the-retreat-review-sam-bain-kathy-burke-adam-deacon","fields":{"headline":"The Retreat review – gag overkill in new comedy from Peep Show's Sam Bain","bodyText":"You’d expect plenty of jokes from the first play written by Sam Bain, Bafta award-winning co-creator of Peep Show and Fresh Meat. He doesn’t disappoint: there’s an avalanche of them in this three-hander directed by Kathy Burke and set up a Scottish mountain where former high-flying city boy Luke (Samuel Anderson) has retreated to become a Buddhist monk. The problem is that too often these laugh-out-loud one-liners don’t emerge from the situation or character, but are imposed upon them instead, resulting in tedium and a lack of tension. You’re just waiting for the next killer line as Luke’s path to spiritual enlightenment is derailed by the arrival of his older brother, Tony (Adam Deacon). Like Luke, Tony only wants to get high. But his drug of choice is cocaine rather than meditation. Luke plans to sell off the London flat where the two brothers have been living and donate the money to a Buddhist centre, run by Tara (Yasmine Akram), who walks around in green body paint and calls non-believers muggles. The stage is set for a stand-off, but it never quite materialises in a play that doesn’t allow plot, character development or credibility to get in the way of a good joke. We hear some backstory about the brothers’ alcoholic mother and their parents’ death in a car crash, and there are references to Luke’s divorce and Tony’s daughter. It becomes clear that Luke’s devotion to Tara is more than just spiritual, and she has her own reasons for stringing him along. But there is no room for subtlety, subtext or any kind of thematic development. It doesn’t help that it’s hard to feel sympathy for any of this self-obsessed, navel-gazing trio, so Tara and Tony’s struggle for Luke’s soul – and the proceeds of his flat – never really amounts to much. From its clumsy, over-extended opening, the production searches vainly for a rhythm to power the narrative. While the actors struggle valiantly with a script that is little more than a joke machine, they can’t help but fail to inject life into a disappointingly inert evening. The Retreat is at Park theatre, London, until 2 December.

Friends keep asking how we’ve managed to fit all our things into such a small space. My answer is that we didn’t, that we are merely living around them in a sort of domestic Tetris, which my six-year-old finds most entertaining. I don’t. But I do have great affection for this small second-floor flat, which shares an internal courtyard with a bread shop and trattoria, as in many ways it is the reason I began writing about food in the first place. Stuffed to the gunnels we may be, but we are woken by the thick scent of bread being paddled from the ovens. Then, later in the day, as the trattoria comes to life, the siren scent of cured pork meeting a hot pan, sulphurous greens and the steam from baskets of pasta makes its way up two floors and through our front door. It was at the trattoria below and in the flats of neighbours on either side where I first tasted many of the classic Roman pastas for the first time: gricia, carbonara, amatriciana, the spicy arrabbiata clinging to quills of penne; where I first enjoyed spoonfuls of pasta e fagioli (pasta and beans); and rosemary-scented pasta e ceci (pasta and chickpeas). Also sturdy pillows of ravioli dressed with melted butter and sage, ribbons of pasta with chicken livers and – my desert-island dish – a tangle of spaghetti and clams. Years before, as I diligently tried and failed to wind the strands around the fork, I told my mum spaghetti was maybe my favourite meal. I must have been eight. I was 32 when I knew it was. I knew little about Roman food and spoke no Italian when I first arrived. This was frustrating but, in retrospect, quite useful with regard to cooking, as it meant that advice was best demonstrated. You don’t need words to understand that the Italian love of pasta is visceral, that it is synonymous with home, nor to understand the strength and tenacity of Italian food habits and their single-minded belief about how things are best done. I did find it intimidating, especially when combined with the often hurtful thoughts about the English and their food. Dented I was, but none of this was enough to puncture my enthusiasm or determination. I had cooked pasta all of my adult life, but had never tasted anything like the dishes in Rome – and later Sicily. I was happy to relearn the most basic things: how to cook pasta, to sauté a clove of garlic and make the simplest tomato sauce, how to match a shape with a sauce, to flip a pan and bring disparate parts together. I watched and I copied. Add to this a new partner whose nonno was a Sicilian tomato and wheat farmer – which explains his dogged devotion to a plateful of pasta, which isn’t so much a meal as a way of life. These days Oretta Zanini De Vita’s encyclopedia of pasta never leaves my desk. Every time I look at this astonishing compendium of 300 shapes and 1,500 regional variations, I realise that my experience of pasta, despite my years and travel, is minimal, and that Roman influences prevail. We eat pasta almost every day and they are everyday pastas, which means the no-nonsense sort – a few ingredients combined boldly in a way that makes sense, respecting tradition but never letting that get in the way of a meal. I have written about most of them here – pasta and chickpeas or beans or potatoes, spaghetti with clams, pasta al pomodoro (with bursting tomatoes), Cinzia’s baked pasta, pasta with courgettes cooked rather like carbonara, a classic bolognese ragù and this, another ragù. Inspired by tomato-red southern ragus, todays recipe provides two meals. Like so many Italian recipes, the foundations are fundamental: pancetta and a great handful of chopped carrot, celery and onion cooked until soft and fragrant. Then the meat – in this case a whole piece – which is browned and followed by wine and tomato, and which bubbles away until the sauce is glossy and the meat tender. The meat has a double role here, lending rich juices to the sauce while retaining enough flavour for another course or meal, ideally with green sauce. I have adopted the Roman habit of tossing the pasta first with cheese, which creates a better surface for sauce to cling to. Whether you add cheese before or after, toss vigorously, sending steam and alluring aromas to your neighbours. Pasta with braised beef ragu Serves 4-6 100g pancetta, diced 4 tbsp olive oil 2 white onions, peeled and finely diced 1 celery rib, finely diced 1 large carrot, peeled and finely diced 8 sprigs parsley, finely chopped 600-800g boneless beef in a single piece (braising steak) 500ml red wine 400ml passata 2 bay leaves Salt and black pepper Extra stock or simply water 500g dried or fresh pasta Parmesan, for serving 1 In a large, heavy-based pan with a lid, fry the pancetta in the olive oil until it has rendered its fat, then add the vegetables and parsley and cook until soft and wilted – about 10 minutes. 2 Add the beef to the pan, turning to brown on all sides. Raise the heat a little, add the wine and let that bubble and evaporate for a few minutes before adding the passata, bay leaves, a pinch of salt and grinds of pepper. 3 Lower the heat so the sauce simmers gently, then cover the pan for two hours or until the meat is very tender and the sauce reduced and thick but still very much a sauce – check by lifting the lid from time to time, adding stock or water if the sauce seems too thick. Remove the meat and save it for the second course or another day (you could of course add some back into the sauce). 4 Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add salt, stir, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reheat the sauce if it has cooled. Tip the pasta into a large warmed bowl, add a handful of grated parmesan and toss, add the sauce and toss again. Divide between bowls, handing round more parmesan for those who want it. Serve meat as a second course with green sauce, perhaps.

The cheap eats challenge only increases when you find yourself at lunchtime at one of its most popular attractions. But hidden down a side street there is always the chance to come upon a traditional bacaro bar serving bite-sized cicchetti and panini, or a classic trattoria whose dish of the day is a steaming plate of pasta topped with a simple but tasty ragù. Piazza San Marco Birreria Forst Finding anywhere decent to eat around the Piazza San Marco can seem like Mission: Impossible. The Calle delle Rasse is lined with touristy trattorie, but right in the middle is the Birreria Forst, a legendary watering hole favoured by raucous gondoliers and water-taxi drivers for almost 50 years. For a real slice of Venetian life, grab one of the wooden, bierkeller-style tables and order the signature square rye sandwiches called tramezzini (€10 for two, including drinks), which are stuffed to bursting with everything from wafer-thin slices of roast beef and pork to local cheeses and sopressa salami. Rushing around everywhere is feisty young owner Kevin Xu, who carries on a non-stop banter with the gondoliers in the local dialect. • 4540 Calle delle Rasse, on Facebook Rialto Bridge H2 NO The Rialto market heaves at lunchtime with locals doing their shopping; there are some great bars, but all are crowded. A few minutes’ walk away, in the quiet Campo San Silvestro, is a newcomer on the foodie scene. With a name like H2 NO – No Water – there is a great selection of craft beers, organic and natural wines. But chef Davide Verna, who runs the place with his sister Mariangela, also creates an irresistible range of cicchetti, Venice’s take on tapas. The choice depends on what Davide finds in the market: a succulent butterfly prawn nestling on a bed of curried green cabbage; an octopus slice on pickled vegetables; smoked salmon with ricotta and asparagus – a plate of seven cicchetti costs €15. Otherwise there are big, fresh salads and three or four different soups each day. • 1105 San Polo, on Facebook Gallerie dell’Accademia La Rivista After viewing the Accademia’s collection of Venetian masterpieces by Titian and Tintoretto, Carpaccio and Canaletto, take the street towards the Zattere. The smart art deco-style Rivista restaurant has outdoor tables and a snack bar service at lunch and dinner with a good selection of pasta, salads and sandwiches that are reasonably priced (primi piatti €12-€14, salads €10-€11), with no added service or cover charge. • 979/a Dorsoduro, restaurantlarivista.com Palazzo Grassi Bacaro Da Fiore François Pinault’s Palazzo Grassi regularly hosts blockbuster art exhibitions, and currently Damien Hirst holds court until December with his controversial shipwreck show. Just by the grand Campo Santo Stefano, Da Fiore is a local institution, serving Venetian cuisine for the past 50 years and a firm favourite with students from the nearby university. For a budget lunch, though, go to the bacaro bar rather than sitting down in the more formal ristorante’s dining room. The bacaro counter is filled with tempting cicchetti (a selection for €10-€12) and the chef is forever coming out of the kitchen with plates of piping hot polpette meatballs, grilled baby squid, octopus salad and delicate courgette flowers stuffed with mozzarella and anchovies. • 3461 Calle delle Botteghe, dafiore.it Murano Osteria Ai Cacciatori Everyone visiting Venice comes over to Murano at least once to see the island’s famed glass-blowing workshops. Stop off at this venerable 150-year-old osteria, where locals play cards and there is always a buzzing atmosphere. Glass-blowers troop in for their midday menu operai (working man’s lunch) but the genial 84-year-old owner, Toni Regazzi, says he is happy to serve the daily pasta (€8) to tourists if they are not sold out. All the rest of the food comes straight from the kitchen to the bar counter: delicious mozzarella in carrozza (a type of sandwich), battered mozzarella with anchovies, tiny pizzette, delicious tramezzini (€1.50-€1.70) and panini. House wine is €1 a glass, but it’s worth trying the local (red) Raboso at €2.50, a favourite tipple of Ernest Hemingway. • 69 Fondamenta Vetrai, +39 041 739 845 Burano Trattoria Alla Maddalena The colourful fisherman’s island of Burano is one of Venice’s most popular destinations, but for eating out it is better to walk across the wooden bridge to bucolic Mazzorbo and sit out on the water at the friendly, family-run Trattoria Alla Maddalena. A full meal here can cost €35-€40, but the perfect plan for lunch is to order just a copious helping of the traditional lagoon dish, risotto di gò, which has all but disappeared in most Venetian restaurants. Made from the ghiozzi fish – known locally as gò – which lives in the mudflats of the wetlands, the risotto is complex to prepare. And though it may not look very appetising, the taste is out of this world. • 7/b via Mazzorbo, trattoriamaddalena.com Guggenheim Museum 60/40 The modern art hanging in Peggy Guggenheim’s palazzo – Picasso, Magritte, Max Ernst, Pollock – is a stark contrast to the old masters on display around the rest of Venice. And the same is certainly true of 60/40, a bright new eatery one bridge across from the museum. “We thought up the name 60/40 because this is a hybrid: part takeaway, part take a break and eat here,” explains the young owner, Andrea Perini. The speciality is giant panini (€5.50) prepared to order with fresh produce – mortadella, mozzarella, mountain cheeses and smoked ham. They also have a big selection of fruit and vegetable juices created on the spot, artisan ice-creams and tasty pastini pastries baked each morning by a nearby pasticceria. • 128 Rio Terà dei Catecumeni, +39 041 476 4997 Jewish Ghetto Osteria Al Bacco The world’s oldest Jewish ghetto commemorated its 500th anniversary last year. Rather than the restaurants inside the ghetto itself, the most fun place for lunch is just across the canal in one of Venice’s most beautiful osterie. Al Bacco boasts a romantic wood-panelled dining room, shady garden and waterside terrace. Its copious lunch menu (€13.50 plus €2 cover charge) is one of the best deals in town: a choice of three pastas, such as spaghetti all’aglio olio peperoncino, or a vegetarian option, followed by a main course, plus grilled vegetables or mixed salad. The cuisine may be traditional Italian, but Bacco represents modern multicultural Venice – it’s owned by a friendly Jordanian, Haitham Hasan, an ex-architecture student who stayed on; the maitre d’, Afi, is from Tunisia; Moldovan Lili runs the bar; while your waiter could be Slava from Ukraine. • 3054 Fondamenta de le Capuzine, 39 041 525 6093, osteriaalbacco.com Isola Di San Giorgio Da Sandro San Giorgio draws visitors for its famed Palladian church and stunning views over Venice from its bell tower. But there is just a basic cafe on the island, so hop on the vaporetto for one stop across to Le Zitelle on Giudecca. A narrow alley right opposite the boat stop takes you to Da Sandro, an old-fashioned pizzeria with a lovely garden.

Simon Stevens said that the waiting list for hospital operations could hit 5 million, warned the service “has a funding problem” and that spending on the NHS is expected to “nosedive” over the next two years. In an impassioned speech to NHS leaders, Stevens urged Theresa May to give the NHS in England at least £4bn more in 2018-19 – six times higher than currently envisaged – in the budget Philip Hammond will deliver on 22 November. Stevens acknowledged that the coalition and Conservative governments since 2010 had given the NHS “modest” budget increases at a time when they were dealing with the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis. But he said Britain should seek to emulate the levels of healthcare investment in countries such as Germany, France and Sweden, which would lead to a £20bn-£30bn rise in the NHS’s budget. “We have a care fragmentation problem and a funding problem,” Stevens said. Directly contradicting claims made minutes earlier by the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the NHS boss added: “Some may say, ‘Aren’t we spending at the European average?’ Well, only if you think that bundling austerity-shrunken Greek and Portuguese health spending should help shape the benchmark for Britain. “If instead you think that modern Britain should look more like Germany or France or Sweden then we are under-funding our health services by £20bn-£30bn a year.” Stevens won praise from Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, at whose conference he was speaking. “We strongly welcome the directness, honesty and clarity of what Simon Stevens has said today. We have been arguing for some time that the NHS can no longer deliver what it needs to on the funding available and it is important that Simon Stevens has said this for the first time clearly and publicly. “He is right to warn that without extra funding there will be consequences for patients, who will have to wait longer and may not get the treatment they should have when they need it. We are all now clear about the importance of the decision that the government faces in the forthcoming budget.” Stevens added: “The budget for next year is well short of what’s needed to look after our patients and their families at their time of need.” Under current government plans the NHS budget is due to go up from £123.7bn this year to £124.4bn in 2018-19 – a rise of just 0.58%. Stevens also suggested key targets guaranteeing how long patients have to wait for care may have to be abandoned unless the NHS is given significantly more than the £8bn ministers have pledged to put in by 2022, a move that could prove unpopular and controversial. In an unprecedented plea to the prime minister and chancellor that may put his job at risk, Stevens urged them to start the “transition” to the NHS receiving the £350m a week extra that was pledged by leave campaigners on the side of their battlebus in last year’s EU referendum campaign. If that happened that would mean the NHS received an extra £18.2bn a year. He displayed for his audience of hospital trust bosses the promise leave made then: “Let’s give our NHS the £350m the EU takes every week – Vote Leave, take control on 23 June.” And he cited an admission earlier this year by Dominic Cummings, a key leave campaign organiser, that the pro-Brexit camp may well not have won the vote if they had not deployed that argument. “The government has rightly supported the NHS through difficult times, it protected the NHS budget immediately after the financial crash, and funded modest growth ever since. But that growth rate is set to nosedive next year and the year after,” Stevens said. But challenging government claims that its £8bn is enough for the NHS to do everything expected of it, he added: “As I have told parliament on many occasions: ‘For the next three years we did not get the funding the NHS had requested. So 2018, which happens to be the 70th anniversary of the NHS, is poised to be the toughest financial year.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/09/in-dulci-jubilo-cd-review-as-classy-as-christmas-albums-come","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T16:00:20Z","webTitle":"In Dulci Jubilo CD review – as classy as Christmas albums come","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/09/in-dulci-jubilo-cd-review-as-classy-as-christmas-albums-come","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/09/in-dulci-jubilo-cd-review-as-classy-as-christmas-albums-come","fields":{"headline":"In Dulci Jubilo CD review – as classy as Christmas albums come","bodyText":"Apologies for the advance seasonal selection, but this is as classy as Christmas albums come: music from an important Swedish archive of northern European baroque music (the Düben collection at Uppsala University), delivered with razor-sharp clarity by Paul Hillier’s Theatre of Voices and on luminous period instruments.

But it’s more than that, too, and there’s something very endearing (and possibly very British?) about the way Riley deflects the beauty and sincerity at the heart of his pieces by giving them names such as Bob or A Cool Carfuffle, and framing his serious moments with music that fools around. Inspirations include Genesis, John Martyn and Joy Division; there’s a delicate set of Lyric Pieces, and a closing piano solo in dreamy soft-grain called As the Tender Twilight Covers. The title work is a collection of six miniatures, whose lopsided rhythms are cut with snippets of gentler stuff.

That’s the reality facing thousands of people as a result of the move from the disability living allowance (DLA) to personal independence payments (Pip), and it’s having a disastrous impact on people with long-term conditions such as Parkinson’s. I started as a welfare rights adviser in 1986 and, while the situation wasn’t ideal back then, it was far better than now. I help people appeal against Pip decisions. This year I have worked on 34 appeals, with five more pending. I have won every one so far because the process is flawed. People are being presented with barriers from start to finish, and the assessors’ knowledge of conditions is simply not good enough. Analysis by Parkinson’s UK shows it will cost the government £3m to reassess everyone with the condition for Pip. About £1.3m of this will be spent on people previously identified as having the highest need under the DLA. With a condition such as Parkinson’s they will not have improved so to put these people through another assessment is completely unnecessary. The new system is not working. We know that 25% of people with Parkinson’s have lost some or all of their award under Pip. One of my clients went from the highest rate under DLA to nothing – he lost his money and his car because it was said he failed to attend an appointment. In reality, he had never received the letter asking him to go. His wife was looking at cheaper houses because they couldn’t afford to stay where they were. Eventually, after medical evidence was reviewed, he was awarded the highest rate again. But it can take nine months for an appeal to be resolved – and while payments are backdated for successful appeals, you cannot give people back the sleepless nights or repair the damage the stress has caused to their personal relationships. People are frightened; some stop eating, while others have to repeatedly go back to their GP for extra medication because of the stress. Another of my clients was diagnosed with Parkinson’s as a teenager. It is advanced and he struggles to walk but has managed to stay in work thanks to a supportive employer. While his wife was on maternity leave, he was reassessed from DLA to Pip, his award was reduced and he lost his Motability car. He couldn’t afford to pay the bills; how could he get to work if he couldn’t use public transport? It took months to force the Department for Work and Pensions to reassess him using the evidence we had already provided. It’s not unusual for clients to say they don’t want to live any more; the majority have to be encouraged to appeal against decisions. The process makes people depressed and feel like they are exaggerating their condition, which in turn increases the stigma of applying for benefits. I’ve helped people from all walks of life, including pilots and former doctors. Parkinson’s UK set up a support service for benefit applications in 2015. We have gone from a team of two to a team of five, who could easily work day and night to meet the demand for the service. I shudder to think how many people don’t know where to go for support and just give up. They say money can’t buy happiness, but happiness is demonstrated by the people we support when their Pip claim is successful. Actually, it’s not just the money; it’s the realisation that finally someone has acknowledged they are living with a condition that has affected every area of their life and they do need the support Pip is supposed to offer. It is time for the government to get a grip on Pip.

Some are obvious (spinal curvature, no functioning bladder), others not so; I had no penis to speak of. At puberty, they gave me something approaching a short (under 2in) but functional penis. At school I was bullied, but not hugely – I avoided confrontation and did my best to be likable. But I never dated for fear of ridicule. My first sexual adventure was as an 18-year-old man with a lovely woman in her 40s. She was shocked when she realised that she had taken my virginity. She was perhaps the safe option: mature, experienced, caring. Once I had overcome that huge hurdle, I went on to explore with more confidence. Over the next 10 years, I met a handful of women. I learned to be a compassionate and skilful lover, because I had to. I’ve had a few serious relationships and sex was never a problem. In this day and age, when so much importance is placed on genital proportion and physical perfection, I fear some have missed the trick. I’m settled in what I hope is my last major relationship. She tells me it’s the best sex she’s had. I grew up terrified that I would never have a proper relationship; I’m grateful to have met so many wonderful, non-judgmental women who have shown me my fears were unfounded. It was never about the disabilities, always about the abilities. I try to make a woman feel loved and wanted, and to take her to the edge and back in ways that someone who hasn’t had those fears growing up might never understand the need for. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life.

Sir Christopher Greenwood QC, who provided controversial legal advice to the UK government before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, is one of six candidates competing for five positions at the UN-backed court in The Hague. He has already served one nine-year term and has reapplied to serve a second. There has been a British judge on the court since it was established in 1946. In a separate vote at the UN general assembly in June the UK Foreign Office was humiliated when a Mauritian-backed resolution questioning the legal status of Chagos Islands was referred to the ICJ by 94 votes to 15. Many EU members decided to abstain in that vote after Britain’s decision a year earlier to leave the bloc. The general assembly vote was seen as a blow to the UK’s international prestige and demonstrated the limited diplomatic influence wielded by the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, at the UN. There has already been heavy lobbying at the UN in New York by the Foreign Office in favour of Greenwood’s reappointment to the ICJ. Along with Greenwood, four other candidates are incumbents: Ronny Abraham (France), president of the court; Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia), vice-president; Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade (Brazil); and Dalveer Bhandari (India). The sixth candidate is Nawaf Salam, who is the permanent representative of Lebanon to the UN. A human rights lawyer who declined to be identified told the Guardian: “For the UK to fail to get their candidate elected would be extraordinary but then the vote on referring Chagos to the ICJ was extraordinary and unexpected. There has always been a British judge on the court. Greenwood was very controversial because of his Iraq war advice.” To be elected, any candidate must obtain a majority of 97 votes or more in the UN general assembly and also a majority of eight votes in the security council. Voting will continue until five candidates have obtained the required majority. Greenwood, who is in his early sixties, was previously professor of international law at the London School of Economics. His most controversial public role was in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. He was instructed by the then attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, to examine the arguments over the legality of using force against Saddam Hussein. In 2008, Mark Durkan, then MP and leader of the SDLP, tabled a parliamentary motion opposing Greenwood’s initial appointment to the court on the grounds that he provided legal backing for the invasion. At the time, Durkan said: “He provided the government and parliament with the flawed and untenable argument that war with Iraq was justified on the grounds that the UN security council had authorised the use of force.” Greenwood was nonetheless elected by a large majority at the UN in 2008. Critics have suggested that he will not find his reappointment so easy on this occasion. The ICJ in The Hague declined to comment on the judicial selection process. A number of human rights groups and lawyers declined to comment because they did not want to be seen to be influencing that process. The Foreign Office also declined to comment. Greenwood taught law at the University of Cambridge for more than 20 years and appeared in many high-profile international law cases, including those involving the Lockerbie bombing, General Pinochet and Guantánamo Bay. At the time of his appointment in 2008, the then foreign secretary, David Miliband, described Greenwood as being “highly respected within the international legal community, and an outstanding academic and practitioner of international law”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/10/john-lewis-christmas-ad-2017-meet-moz-the-monster-under-the-bed","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T10:32:32Z","webTitle":"John Lewis Christmas ad 2017: watch the video of Moz the monster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/10/john-lewis-christmas-ad-2017-meet-moz-the-monster-under-the-bed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/10/john-lewis-christmas-ad-2017-meet-moz-the-monster-under-the-bed","fields":{"headline":"John Lewis Christmas ad 2017: watch the video of Moz the monster","bodyText":"Some of the world’s top creative minds have been employed. Millions have been spent. The film has been months in the making and shrouded in secrecy. But this is not the release of a Hollywood blockbuster – it is the launch of the John Lewis Christmas advertising campaign. Over the past decade the department store chain has turned its festive adverts into an annual media moment. It has produced a stream of heart-warming, tear-jerking ads, from a romance between two snowmen, to Monty the Penguin, the sad tale of a lonely man on the moon and last year’s bouncing boxer dog. This year it has once again pulled out all the stops to come up with a memorable campaign featuring Moz, a huge, snoring under-the-bed monster with puppy dog eyes. Academy award-winning screenwriter Michel Gondry, the director behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, was called in to make the two-minute TV advert. Aside from working with middle England’s favourite shop he is known for his video collaborations with artists including Radiohead, Björk and Daft Punk. The soundtrack to the ad is a classic Beatles song, Golden Slumbers from the 1969 Abbey Road album, re-recorded by rock band Elbow. The cost of this extravaganza – all designed to boost sales and sprinkle a little glitter on the John Lewis brand – is reckoned to be about £7m. It will premiere in the advertising breaks in Friday night’s Gogglebox on Channel 4. Such was the pre-launch secrecy that journalists wanting to view the advert first had to sign a legal non-disclosure agreement. The feelgood factor generated by the John Lewis campaigns has prompted retail rivals to up their game – and steal from the JL playbook. Marks &amp; Spencer, which in 2016 gave us Mrs Claus, a James-Bond style character, has this year turned to Paddington, with TV adverts designed to cash in on the Paddington 2 movie. Sainsbury’s, which in recent years has produced a touching commemoration of the famous first world war Christmas Day football match and an animated family saga accompanied by a song performed by James Corden, will unveil its 2017 campaign on Sunday night.Boots, House of Fraser and Waitrose will also launch their Christmas campaigns this weekend. They are part of a total advertising splurge of nearly £6bn planned for the final quarter of 2017 – £140m more than last year, according to the Advertising Association, as stores and big brands attempt to persuade shoppers to forget their straining household budgets and enjoy a festive binge. “The festive season accounts for such a significant proportion of sales that there can be no holding back on ad spend,” says Leo Rayman, chief executive of Grey London, the ad agency behind Marks &amp; Spencer’s Paddington-led campaign. “A bad Christmas can make or break a company’s year.” Retailers are facing a nail-biting run up to Christmas this year and a good advert could be the difference between a good and bad festive season. Inflation, an unseasonal warm start to autumn, consumer fears about the uncertainty of Brexit and a squeeze on disposable income have all hit sales in recent months. A recent survey by the CBI business lobby group showed high street sales falling at their fastest rate since the height of the recession in 2009. John Lewis is particularly hoping for a good end to 2017 after its profits halved at its parent group, which also owns Waitrose, in the first part of its financial year. In recent weeks the department store has revealed a string of poor sales numbers, with takings down around 4% on the same time last year. Homewares and technology – big ticket items – have been particularly badly hit. Fashion chain Next has also reported falling sales, along with New Look and Debenhams. Christmas advertising is also rapidly moving online. The amount spent on TV ads in the coming weeks is expected to fall slightly to £1.3bn, as big brands switch spending into social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Spending on social media video ads is expected to increase 40% to £234m, according to advertising analysts WARC. Retailers now make special versions of their ads to be shared on Instagram and Facebook and some have piggy-backed on the frenzy that now accompanies the annual John Lewis ad by making amusing rip-off versions for social media. John Lewis itself is putting its Moz video on social media a full 13 hours before he appears on TV. Moz the monster was created by John Lewis’s long-term agency Adam&amp;Eve and shot in a London studio. It stars seven-year-old twins Ethan and Tobias, who both play the same young boy in different scenes. Moz is an enormous Sesame Street-style puppet with two adult men inside. The monster puppet was filmed live and its expressions were added later using CGI technology partly created by mapping the face of an actor. Craig Inglis, John Lewis’s customer director, said: “This year’s Christmas campaign brings to life the power of children’s imaginations and the joy of great friendships. Moz and Joe’s story is magical and heartwarming.” Sarah Vizard, news editor of trade journal Marketing Week, described it as standard John Lewis schmaltz but warned that one Christmas soon the department store might need to come up with some new ideas to keep customers interested. “John Lewis is still the best at this kind of heartwarming story campaign. They follow a set playbook and don’t err far from that. It obviously works for them but I think at some point they might need to shake it up.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.

The Football Association and German Football Association (DFB) confirmed on Wednesday that both teams will wear them in remembrance of members of the armed forces, past and present. Last year, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were fined by Fifa for displaying poppies as part of the Armistice Day commemorations, the world governing body having considered it a political symbol. However after the rules were revised in September, the four home nations said it was their intention to request permission from their opponents and Fifa to wear poppies during their games in the days before and on Remembrance Sunday. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also be wearing armbands bearing poppies for their international fixtures. Martin Glenn, the FA chief executive, said: “Remembering and commemorating the men and women who have served this country is ingrained in our nation. Many have made the ultimate sacrifice and we will be honouring them, both on and off the pitch, for our match against Germany. I would like to thank the German Football Association for also agreeing to wear the poppy for the match, in a show of solidarity and unity at this important time.” Reinhard Grindel, the DFB president, said: “I positively welcome the decision to allow both the English and the German national teams to wear poppy armbands, because these are not about political propaganda in any way. They’re about remembering the kind of values that were kicked to the ground in two world wars but are cherished by football: respect, tolerance, and humanity.” A replica of the Truce statue, which depicts the first world war ceasefire when peace and games of football broke out between English and German troops on Christmas Day in 1914, will also be on temporary display beside the Bobby Moore statue at Wembley."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/14/sex-slang-steak-views-leave-remain-worlds-apart","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-14T15:18:55Z","webTitle":"Sex, slang, steak: views that show remainers and leavers are worlds apart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/14/sex-slang-steak-views-leave-remain-worlds-apart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/14/sex-slang-steak-views-leave-remain-worlds-apart","fields":{"headline":"Sex, slang, steak: views that show remainers and leavers are worlds apart","bodyText":"If you think Britain has felt like a divided country since the European Union referendum, you are not alone. Since June 2016, YouGov’s surveys have consistently shown that leave voters and remain voters are likely to argue about just about everything. Here are some of the things that set them apart. Leave voters want well-done steaks Nearly a quarter of leave voters (23%) say they prefer their steaks well done, compared with only 12% of remain voters. The most popular way to cook steak for remain voters is “medium rare”. Six percent of both remain and leave voters say ketchup is their favourite sauce to go with a steak. They really like eating meat Surveyed in April 2017 about the environmental impact of eating meat, 24% of leave voters said they were “very unwilling” to consider “eating less meat and fewer meat products in the future”. Only 9% of remain voters felt so strongly carnivorous. Unless Ed Miliband is doing it Leave voters overwhelming declared that Ed Miliband eating a bacon sandwich was far worse than Theresa May’s chip-eating face: 76% said Ed looked worse; just 6% said Theresa. Remain voters were more evenly matched, with a quarter saying Theresa’s chip moment was worse, and half plumping for Ed. They are less likely to have watched PMQs In February 2017 YouGov asked questions about the public’s reactions to prime minister’s question time in the House of Commons. Over half of leave voters, 57%, claimed to have never seen it or any clips of it. Remain voters were slightly more likely to have witnessed the spectacle, although 46% of them still said they hadn’t, raising questions about the extent to which PMQs performances can dictate the political mood outside Westminster. Leave voters are twice as likely to want to ban the burqa Seventy percent of leave voters told YouGov they supported “a law against wearing a full body and face veil” aimed at Muslim women. Only 32% of remain voters felt the same way. And half as likely to think that gollies are offensive Asked “Do you think it is or is not acceptable to sell or display a golliwog doll?”, 71% of leave voters said “acceptable”. Remain voters scored 37%. Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, who commissioned this particular piece of research, said: “The remain/leave split, to be honest, was pretty much what I expected. Research shows that age, identity and values – as opposed to, say, economics – played a big part in which way people voted, and they’re also exactly what drives what people think about gollies.” More leave voters thought Donald Trump would be a good president Asked on the weekend of his inauguration whether Trump would make a “great” or “good” president of the US, 30% of leave voters said they believed he would. Zero percent of remain voters said they thought Trump would be a “great” president. Three pecent said he would be “good”. They are more likely to want to leave the Paris climate change agreement Pulling out of the Paris accord would mean the UK joining the US as the only major nations outside the global agreement. That’s where 26% of leave voters would prefer to be. Only 5% of remain voters want to quit. Leave voters also want out of Eurovision Forty-one percent of leave voters say they have made their mind up that the UK should permanently exit the Eurovision song contest. They are sure Gibraltar is British Seventy-one percent of leave voters believe Gibraltar should “remain a self-governing British territory”. Just over half of remain voters, 54%, share this view. Additionally, asked: “If the status of Gibraltar was the only thing preventing the UK from getting a much better Brexit deal, would you support passing at least some sovereignty over the territory to Spain?” 48% of leave voters said they would prefer the worse deal. They are keener on reducing time limits on abortions, or banning them altogether In September 2015 YouGov surveyed members of the Conservative party about their views on abortion. They also asked how people intended to vote in the referendum. Even within this small sample, there was a marked difference between leave and remain voters. There was a lead (30% to 25%) among leave voters in preferring there to be a reduction in the abortion time limit, to below 24 weeks. And twice as many leave-voting Tories (8%) as remain-voting Tories (4%) wanted to see a total ban on abortions. They are less likely to think prison is about rehabilitation Leave and remain voters have very different views on the purpose of prison. Asked what should be the primary reason for prison, leave voters said “to punish the criminal” (35%), to “act as a deterrent” (24%) or to “get violent criminals off the street” (20%). By contrast, 41% of remain voters said the main purpose of prison should be to “rehabilitate the morals and skills of criminals”. They think the royal family have shown Princess Diana’s memory too little respect On the 20th anniversary of her death, YouGov asked the British public whether the royal family had shown the right amount of respect to Princess Diana. A third of leave voters (33%) felt the royals had shown too little respect to her memory. Only a quarter of remain voters felt the same. They think the Doctor in Doctor Who votes Tory Asked which way fictional characters would vote in the 2017 general election, 12% of leave voters said the Doctor would vote for the Conservatives – more than thought the character would vote for any other party. Remain voters were more likely to think the Doctor would vote Green or Labour. They think the BBC should be privatised Leave voters are twice as likely as remain voters to think the BBC should be privatised. Thirty-two percent of leave voters would prefer a privately run corporation. They see news with views as a problem In a survey looking at attitudes to “fake news”, leave voters were much more worried about “news organisations that are honest, but have a clear political viewpoint or agenda”. Thirty-two percent of leave voters described this as a problem, compared with 17% of remain voters. They think our schools are well funded Asked “generally speaking, do you think schools are well funded or in financial difficulty?”, 34% of leave voters said they were well funded. That’s twice as many as the 17% of remain voters who think education budgets are ample. They are more likely to think fracking is safe Thirty-five percent of leave voters think fracking is safe; only 19% of remain voters back the technology. On the whole, though, both leave and remain voters have doubts about fracking. Attitudes to terrorism and privacy In the context of terrorism, “more should be done to help the security forces combat terrorism, even if this means the privacy of ordinary people suffer” was a statement that 64% of leave voters could agree with, compared with 44% of remain voters. Leave voters, in the same survey, were also more likely to be concerned about terrorism. Over half of them (53%) think the the threat of terrorism in Britain has increased a lot in the last five years, compared with 33% of remain voters who feel the same. Almost half of leave voters consider gay sex unnatural Asked “personally speaking, do you think gay sex is or is not natural?” just under a half of leave voters – 47% – say they believe gay sex is unnatural. Twenty-one percent of remain voters agree with them. They are more likely to think being gay is a choice Asked what makes people gay, less than half of leave voters echoed Lady Gaga and said “born this way”. Thirty-five percent agreed with the statement: “Being gay or lesbian is just the way some people choose to live,” compared with 28% of remain voters. You’re having a giraffe, mate In February 2017, YouGov surveyed the British public on their knowledge of cockney rhyming slang. Asked if they could correctly identify the meaning of 10 phrases, including “Jack Jones”, “Ruby Murray” and “dog and bone”, leave voters significantly outperformed remain voters, getting a higher score on every question. Leave voters say no to facial hair In November 2016 YouGov divided the sexes and asked them how they felt about men having facial hair. More than half of leave-voting women (53%) said they preferred men without a beard, compared to 40% of remain voters. The men were asked if they had facial hair, and leave voters revealed that by a narrow margin more of them (64%) were clean-shaven than their remain-voting brethren (60%). This possibly explains how short-lived Nigel Farage’s moustache was, and suggests the British gene pool may continue to evolve with parallel leave and remain identities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/09/laura-perrudin-poisons-antidotes-review-compelling-rb-and-soul-from-maverick-harpist","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T18:00:09Z","webTitle":"Laura Perrudin: Poisons & Antidotes review – compelling R&B and soul from maverick harpist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/09/laura-perrudin-poisons-antidotes-review-compelling-rb-and-soul-from-maverick-harpist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/09/laura-perrudin-poisons-antidotes-review-compelling-rb-and-soul-from-maverick-harpist","fields":{"headline":"Laura Perrudin: Poisons & Antidotes review – compelling R&B and soul from maverick harpist","bodyText":"It will be intriguing to see how this maverick French musician re-creates her extraordinary second album at a London jazz festival event on 19 November. Perrudin makes every sound here, using her voice and a custom-made chromatic harp: her vocals are often multi-layered into audacious harmonies, while the harp can sound like any number of instruments. On Inks and Auguries of Innocence, she bangs it with a mallet to create junkyard hip-hop beats; on Diurnal Fireflies and Ghosts, her woozy tangle of low chords recalls Thundercat’s six-string bass guitar; on Train, the tumbling phrases sound like an African kora. Best of all is the clipped, Erykah Badu-ish neo soul of The Ceiling’s Maze, where Perrudin’s harp sounds like D’Angelo’s guitar, playing clipped phrases over a sluggish J Dilla-style vocal breakbeat. Such versatility could easily become a variety-show gimmick, but Perrudin’s strong melodies and poetic imagery make each song uniquely compelling.

However, they did win hearts, and since re-forming in 2007 have become a hot live ticket. Sensibly, they haven’t rushed into the studio, but waited until they had the songs to match their back catalogue. For their first album in 16 years, producer Youth has brought bells, whistles, trumpets, female backing vocals, strings and presumably the studio kitchen sink to embellish their trademark jangling swagger. There are some surprises: People Will Talk echoes, of all people, the Nolan Sisters. Rick Witter’s lyrics have an everyday charm (“I fell for ya, Victoria”), but few bands are as adept at turning indefinable, touching, northern melancholy into huge, uplifting anthems. There are plenty of those here, and Nothing to Live Down, Invincible and especially Better Days – their best song since 1996’s Chasing Rainbows – should prolong the quintet’s unexpected Indian summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/10/curse-of-feature-why-scoring-global-hit-became-stumbling-block-for-mo","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"The curse of the feature: why scoring a global hit became a stumbling block for Mø","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/10/curse-of-feature-why-scoring-global-hit-became-stumbling-block-for-mo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/10/curse-of-feature-why-scoring-global-hit-became-stumbling-block-for-mo","fields":{"headline":"The curse of the feature: why scoring a global hit became a stumbling block for Mø","bodyText":"In a recent interview with i-D magazine, Danish pop star Mø outlined the reasons behind her delayed second album. “Everything changed after Lean On,” she says, referring to the global success of her featured vocal on Major Lazer and DJ Snake’s 2015 banger. “So many people have opinions and try to guide you, and everyone has the best intentions, but it makes it harder to cut through the noise.” The video broke the 2bn mark on YouTube, yet Mø has struggled with the realities of being an accessory to a hit and the pressures that come with it. As a rising artist, a feature on an established act’s song is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and while some have alchemised it into success, others have become defined by it. “Shoehorning a developing artist on to a song by a bigger act only works when the featured singer has a clear vision for who they are,” says Robbie Daw, news correspondent for US station Sirius XM Volume’s Feedback. So for every Bruno Mars (BoB’s Nothin’ on You), there’s a Mr Hudson after Jay-Z &amp; Kanye West’s Why I Love You, an Ella Eyre after Rudimental’s Waiting All Night or a Kimbra after Gotye’s Somebody That I Used to Know. In Mø’s case, her desired trajectory was in conflict with the success of Lean On. Her debut album No Mythologies to Follow arrived a year prior and was more stripped down compared to the electronically cinematic delivery of Major Lazer. Post-Lean On, her recent singles have seen her collaborate with LA-dwelling radio big-hitters Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco and Cashmere Cat but the sense was that the top-tier collaborators were looking for instant repeat success rather than matching Mø’s solo artistic vision. Her recent, more stripped-back EP When I Was Young speaks more to the earliest iteration of Mø, but would surely confuse anyone whose initial encounter with her came via Lean On. “It opened all these doors,” she told Entertainment Weekly. “I wanted to find my own sound as well.” The road to features is paved with good intentions. It’s David collaborating with Goliath, and can be mutually beneficial. For the upcoming artist, it’s a chance to shine, hitching a ride to a moving wagon. For the larger artist, it’s a two-fold win: it’s cost-effective to feature a neophyte over a seasoned singer with deep pockets. And if the newbie blows up, they too are part of the circus. The real challenge, though, is what happens to the newer act after that. “For every Bruno, there are a dozen feature artists left twitching in pop’s scrapheap,” Daw says. Is it worth the risk? Certainly. But proceed with caution. When I Was Young is out now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/08/qatar-airways-plane-forced-to-land-after-wife-discovers-husbands-affair-midflight","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T13:48:06Z","webTitle":"Qatar Airways plane forced to land after wife discovers husband's affair midflight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/08/qatar-airways-plane-forced-to-land-after-wife-discovers-husbands-affair-midflight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/08/qatar-airways-plane-forced-to-land-after-wife-discovers-husbands-affair-midflight","fields":{"headline":"Qatar Airways plane forced to land after wife discovers husband's affair midflight","bodyText":"A Qatar Airways plane has been forced to land midflight after a woman who used her sleeping husband’s thumb to unlock his smartphone discovered he was having an affair. The couple and their child were flying to Bali, Indonesia, for a holiday after boarding in Doha. The woman repeatedly hit her husband after learning of his infidelity and the captain was forced to make an unscheduled stop in Chennai, India, when the cabin crew was unable to restore order. The family was then taken to a detention centre at the airport as they did not have an Indian visa before being put on a flight to Kuala Lumpur. “The Qatar Airways flight QR-962 (Doha-Bali) was diverted to Chennai after the pilot requested it citing unruly passenger on board as the reason,” an officer from India’s central industrial security force (CISF) told the Hindustan Times, which first reported the incident. “The woman and her husband, along with their child, were offloaded and the flight departed for Bali.” The newspaper said the plane’s crew failed to calm the wife, who it said was an Iranian national. “The woman had unlocked her husband’s phone using his thumb impression when he was sleeping and then blew her top after discovering his infidelity,” it reported. The Times of India said the Iranian woman made “such a ruckus” that the plane had no other choice but to make an unscheduled landing. The family spent the day at Chennai airport and left for Malaysia on a Batik Air flight at 10.30pm.

Analysis of the wealth of America’s richest people found that Gates, Bezos and Buffett were sitting on a combined $248.5bn (£190bn) fortune. The Institute for Policy Studies said the growing gap between rich and poor had created a “moral crisis”. In a report, the Billionaire Bonanza, the thinktank said Donald Trump’s tax change proposals would “exacerbate existing wealth disparities” as 80% of tax benefits would end up going to the wealthiest 1% of households. “Wealth inequality is on the rise,” said Chuck Collins, an economist and co-author of the report. “Now is the time for actions that reduce inequality, not tax cuts for the very wealthy.” The study found that the billionaires included in Forbes magazine’s list of the 400 richest people in the US were worth a combined $2.68tn – more than the gross domestic product (GDP) of the UK. “Our wealthiest 400 now have more wealth combined than the bottom 64% of the US population, an estimated 80m households or 204 million people,” the report says. “That’s more people than the population of Canada and Mexico combined.” The report says the “billionaire class” continues to “pull apart from the rest of us” at the fastest rate ever recorded. “We have not witnessed such extreme levels of concentrated wealth and power since the first gilded age a century ago.” Forbes celebrated 2017 as “another record year for the wealthiest people in America”, as “the price of admission to the country’s most exclusive club jumped nearly 18% to $2bn”. That was a tenfold increase on the amount of money needed to enter the list when it first started in 1982. Josh Hoxie, another co-author of the thinktank report, said: “So much money concentrating in so few hands while so many people struggle is not just bad economics, it’s a moral crisis.” The report says many Americans are joining an “emerging anti-inequality movement”. “A century ago, a similar anti-inequality upsurge took on America’s vastly unequal distribution of income and wealth and, over the course of little more than a generation, fashioned a much more equal America,” it says. The rise at the wealthiest end of society comes as one in five US households live in what the report’s authors call the “underwater nation”, with either zero or negative wealth. Inequality is even more stark among minorities. Three in 10 black households and 27% of Latino ones have zero or negative wealth, compared with 14% of white families. Just two African Americans made the Forbes 400: Oprah Winfrey (number 264 with $3bn) and the tech investor Robert Smith (226 with $3.3bn). Five members of the Forbes 400 have Latino backgrounds, including the property magnate Jorge Pérez, the LA Angels baseball team owner Arturo Moreno and three members of the family of late Colombian beer magnate Julio Mario Santo Domingo, a major shareholder of SABMiller. The top 25 people in the survey are all white. The richest is Gates, the Microsoft founder, with $89bn, followed by Amazon’s Bezos with $81.5bn, then investor Warren Buffett with $78bn and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg with $71bn. Since the Forbes 400 was published last month, Amazon’s share price has increased by more than 10%, lifting Bezos’s fortune to an estimated $95bn, putting him in the provisional number one spot. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/nov/13/heres-what-to-consider-before-choosing-an-online-degree","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-13T12:13:25Z","webTitle":"Here's what to consider before choosing an online degree","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/13/heres-what-to-consider-before-choosing-an-online-degree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/nov/13/heres-what-to-consider-before-choosing-an-online-degree","fields":{"headline":"Here's what to consider before choosing an online degree","bodyText":"For most students, choosing a university is as simple as counting up Ucas points, checking a league table or two, and signing up to a few open days to whittle the list down. But things are more complicated for distance learners, for whom studying off-campus brings a whole new set of considerations. What’s the learning platform like? “The technology can vary widely between courses,” says Tom Taylor, head of degrees at work at Anglia Ruskin University. “Students want to know what it will be like to learn online; whether they will get to communicate with other students, and how interactive the course will be.” To get a feel for the learning environment, you should ask universities if they offer a taster session, according to Ian Myat, director of educational enterprise at Birmingham University: “Some providers allow students to sample a module and try the course in the same way you would if you were enrolled,” he says. Is it the real deal? Fake institutions are an ongoing issue with internet degree courses, so it’s worth taking the time to make sure a course you’ve chosen is the real deal. You can do this quickly on the gov.uk website. With traditional degree courses, university league tables are a popular way to get a feel for a institution’s reputation. But Myat warns that these may not include some of the best online courses. “Newer courses may not feature in league tables as there is not yet enough data, but these often take advantage of new technology like video conferences and streaming,” he says. “So it’s a trade off for students between the security of established courses that might be less cutting-edge, and newer, more advanced courses.” Many providers will also let you talk to current students or give you information about graduate paths. Worried that her Open University qualification wouldn’t be seen as a “real” degree, Georgina Crop, who is studying for a BA in English literature and language at the Open University, did her due diligence: “I checked its accreditation and also read success stories about recent graduates,” she says. How much does it cost? Another factor to consider is budget. Although online learners can often cut the cost by being based off-campus and working alongside their degree, tuition fees still tend to be in the thousands. “There is sometimes a perception that online learning is free,” says Myat. “In fact, the costs are often similar to campus courses and if you want to gain a recognised qualification, you should expect to pay for it.” Prices fluctuate based on where an institution sees itself in the market, so costs can be a rough indication of quality. Are there any offline options? If you like the idea of doing part of your course on campus, it is sometimes facilitated and can even be compulsory. “Some subjects, such as sports science, have elements that are harder to teach online and require a face-to-face module,” says Taylor. Is it flexible enough? One of the big draws of distance learning is that there are fewer timetabled events and study can be fit around your lifestyle. “My course allowed me to go Kärsämäki in Finland for six months, doing European Voluntary Service,” says Crop, who also spent time in Greece on an Erasmus young entrepreneur programme. “No traditional university course would’ve allowed me to do that while studying,” she says. But if you want to fit work, travel or volunteering around your studies, find out whether your schedule will actually allow it. “Although most online study is part-time, the concentration of the hours you need to put in can vary between institutions and courses,” says Myat. Everyone’s requirements are different and universities will be happy to give you as much information as they can. The main thing, Myat says, is to remember that online learning is changing all the time. “It’s an evolving market, so I’d encourage students to speak to course providers and ask lots of questions,” he says.

Audible’s romance widget speeds readers to 'the good parts'","bodyText":"Are you looking for “flirty banter”, or a “proposal”, or are you just “hot hot hot”? Fans of romantic fiction – like me – can now get straight down to business with a new feature from Audible called “take me to the good parts”. According to Quartz, editors from Amazon’s audiobook arm came up with 10 classic plot points and then used computers to run “searches for words associated with each”. Listeners can dispense with boring practicalities such as plot and character development and head to “it might be love”, where the hero and heroine are dancing around each other, or jump right away to “I want you”. With Audible’s warning that “the good parts might be explicit” ringing in my ears, I tried it out with Max Monroe’s Tapping the Billionaire, which comes in at “hot damn” on the site’s new “steamy meter”. I thought I’d steer clear of “hot hot hot”, so plumped for “flirty banter”. “‘God you’re adorable,’ he said, biting back a laugh. ‘No,’ I pouted. ‘I’m sexy and naked and ready to fornicate.’” Well – crikey. Time for Lauren Blakely’s The Sexy One. The “sexual tension” selection caught my eye with an explainer that was remarkably unsexy and untense: “Simon kindly helps Abby with a blueberry sauce issue”. “This moment is like a match on kindling,” the narrator intoned, “and now I’m lit up”. But what moment? What match? What was the issue with the blueberry sauce? Romance fans will find plenty to enjoy in Audible’s new romance package. I like how they’ve devised a whole host of subcategories, from Scottish to Roaring Twenties, from Sports to Time Travel. And, um, Animal and Beasts, which it turns out is less worrying than you might think – it features your average werewolf and dragon shifter-type heroes. They’ve also categorised by character type, for those who want to read about rock stars or viscounts, reformed rakes or tortured souls. While the ability to categorise romance so easily does rather highlight its writing-by-numbers aspects, I can see why it’s useful. Sometimes, all you want is a “brought together by a bet” storyline, or the “best friend’s sibling” trope. But the “take me to the good parts” option is just depressing, with its unavoidable implication that the books are really nothing more than the dirty bits. It’s just bizarre to hop into a story halfway through in order to listen to a sex scene. Perhaps people are using the feature in “very different ways”, as Audible’s chief content officer Andy Gaies told the Verge, to check out a book before they buy it, or to “revisit moments from their favourite listens”. But I won’t be using it any more. All I’d like to know is what Audible’s romance package software would make of books outside the genre. Is Molly Bloom’s “yes I said yes I will Yes”, at the end of James Joyce’s Ulysses, just “flirty banter”? Or is it “hot hot hot”?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/11/writing-day-antonia-fraser-forced-to-learn-typing","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T10:01:22Z","webTitle":"Antonia Fraser: ‘I was forced to learn typing as a punishment for being uppish’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/11/writing-day-antonia-fraser-forced-to-learn-typing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/11/writing-day-antonia-fraser-forced-to-learn-typing","fields":{"headline":"Antonia Fraser: ‘I was forced to learn typing as a punishment for being uppish’","bodyText":"A close encounter with cats begins my writing day. Ferdy and Bella were originally Mayhew Animal Home rescue kittens; nowadays they have a way with technology that means that printing out overnight emails becomes a sophisticated version of cat-and-mouse. I eject them from my eyrie, as my writing room is known: they lie outside the door, hoping for another technological treat. The room is on the fourth floor of the house, views both ways towards Southall and our beautiful garden square (my desk faces Southall) and was originally the nursery; so I changed the name firmly from nursery to eyrie to promote the notion of solitude. Now the day will progress with total calm, won’t it, since the telephone bell is turned off, while the mobile is banished during the morning. I’ve also invested in a special computer for work, so that while I’m upstairs I do not receive those delightful distracting emails for which my baser self is secretly longing. I’ve always written on some form of typewriter, now a computer, since I was forced to learn typing on Saturdays at my convent school as a punishment for being uppish. In consequence I’m a touch typist – actually the most useful skill I ever acquired; so much for uppishness. At this point in my day, I work with aforesaid total calm from about 9.30 until lunchtime. Ideally I then go out to a local Italian restaurant, preferably with someone who talks brilliantly about themselves, not totally impossible to achieve in London W11. I can then covertly mull over the morning’s work. I never work in the afternoon, preferring to go swimming in a local health club, for more mulling as I slowly and happily traverse the pool for 20 minutes. Swimming is the best sport I know for reflecting seriously on history. In the early evening I go back upstairs, but it will be for reading over the day’s pages, and correcting them, rather than something more creative. I have never worked after dinner since 1968 when I was writing Mary Queen of Scots and my then husband [Hugh Fraser] was away in his constituency. I took the opportunity to work until 4am. When I read it through in the morning, it was total rubbish. This taught me a sharp lesson. Harold [Pinter] was the exact opposite: he regularly worked all night or half the night or most of the night, depending on where the inspiration took him. In that respect we were, like many happy married couples, the embodiment of Jack Sprat and his wife. The reason that this pattern of work-in-the-morning-only is something so deeply ingrained in me, is that I began trying to write history seriously when I had six children born in 10 years. I have actually written all my life, but history was It. So I devised a way of working like a bat out of hell, or anyway a bat out of the nursery, the moment I could cram the children into cradles, kindergartens, schools ... with the wild hope they would stay there. (There are wicked stories of notices on my door saying “Only come in if you have broken something”, which I utterly deny.) Under the circumstances, I never ever suffered from writer’s block. Today the discipline remains. I still feel odd if I don’t work in the morning, and if I am not alone in the eyrie (with Ferdy and Bella outside). The computer is quite companion enough: “Dear Google, what year did Robert Peel die?” So much easier than combing the four biographies of Peel I possess, looking at me reproachfully from the bookshelves that wallpaper the room. Although over the years I have collected reference books to which I am profoundly grateful, such as The History of Parliament in seven volumes (available online, but for serious work I still prefer cuddling up to a heavy tome), which was invaluable for my last two books. I will end on the ideal break, since every routine needs the occasional interruption. For me, this would be attending a literary festival crowded with amiable well wishers, who have only one ambition, which is to buy my book at the end of the talk. For their sake, I will put up with the first question I am now most frequently asked: “Lady Antonia, are you still writing?” The answer is: “Yes.

She is about to publish her memoirs, and I tell her it’s a great gossipy read. “What’s that darling, endoscopy?” Her hearing isn’t what it was. but she’s grinning mischievously. “I thought that was something medical.” Fielding is probably still best remembered for her star turn in Carry on Screaming! as voracious vamp Valeria. The title of the book is taken from her famous line in the film: “Do you mind if I smoke?” (At which point whirls of smoke rise from her writhing body.) Half a century later, her lipstick is still blood red, her hair dark brown (a wig, of course, as it was in Carry on Screaming!), and her voice unchanged: plummy, breathy, sexy, every word perfectly enunciated. The book charts her topsy turvy life – from the autocratic father who ran a cinema,to success on stage and screen, bankruptcy and a life on benefits, and a renaissance in recent years. Fielding was born Fenella Feldman in London to Jewish parents in 1927. Her mother was Romanian, her father Lithuanian. She was super bright, learning to read well before school. She describes her father as a “street angel and house devil”. Nobody outside the family had a bad word to say about him, but at home he was violent. When she told him she wanted to go to university, he said: “I’d rather see you dead at my feet.” She eventually went to drama school, but he made her leave early. She went on a shorthand course, and he cut that short, too. “Home life was horrid. Daddy used to knock me about with his fists, and my mother would egg him on,” she writes in the book. At the age of 27 she was working as an incompetent shorthand typist still living with her parents in Edgware, north London, when she decided she’d had enough. “I thought, what’s the point if I can’t achieve anything, and my family are not fond of me? So I took lot of tablets. I thought if you took a lot you died, instead of which I began to feel terrible. Which is quite another matter. I wanted to be dead, but as that didn’t seem to be happening, I thought I’d better reverse it if that’s possible. So I went into Mummy and Daddy’s bedroom and said what I’d done, and Mummy started fluttering. She didn’t know what to do. So I said go downstairs and ring Boots in Piccadilly, and they’ll tell you what I should do so I don’t die. They said tell her to drink lots of mustard and water so I did, and I vomited all night. In the morning I felt dreadful, I can tell you. Well you would, wouldn’t you?” Fielding is a phenomenal storyteller. She reminds me of the great raconteur Quentin Crisp – the same love of language, mastery of its rhythms, perfectly formed sentences, and a joie de vivre even when relating her profound despair. Has she carried that sense of pointlessness through her life? “Oh no, darling. This was the only hopeless time I’ve had.” Actually, she says, there was one other time. After the first suicide attempt she focused on her acting career. She left home, and got bits of work. But three years later, at the age of 30, the despair loomed again. “I was feeling ‘Oh God everybody’s doing well and I’m not’, you know. Everybody tells me I’m smashing, but I’m not doing anything smashing. All actors get like that sometimes because you do depend on people thinking you’re smashing and then them giving you things to be smashing in. And this time I thought I will have to kill myself. Now what I’ll do is make some spaghetti and eat it.” Did she really think she could kill herself with spaghetti? She laughs. “No darling! But I thought it will make me fat and make me feel sick.” As she was planning her death by spaghetti, the phone rang. It was her friend, the composer and lyricist Sandy Wilson, saying he had turned Ronald Firbank’s novel Valmouth into a musical and asking if she would be in it. Fielding played a man-eater (not for the only time) and it was a huge hit. By the end of the 1950s she was appearing with Kenneth Williams in the comedy revue Pieces of Eight, written by Harold Pinter and Peter Cook. Fielding became in demand on stage, TV and radio. She was naturally funny so an ideal guest on Just a Minute (where she talked ingeniously for 60 seconds without hesitation, repetition, or deviation on the subject of soirees) and Morecambe and Wise (in sketches where both Eric and Ernie were swooningly in love with her). But what Fielding really wanted was to be acknowledged as a serious actor. Her Hedda Gabler was described by The Times as “among the theatrical experiences of a lifetime”. When the novelist Doris Lessing, who became a friend, saw it she said: “Fenella, you don’t know what you’re doing there on stage. It’s so marvellous.” Fielding found it patronising – she knew exactly what she was doing. I tell her I love it when she describes Lessing’s comments in her book as “The department of fucking cheek”. “Oh well,” she says. “There you are, darling. There are always people who don’t think you should be able to climb out of your cave.” But you did? “I did, yes.” However, Fielding’s serious roles were few and far between. Fellini asked her to star in a film as the incarnation of six different men’s desires. Unfortunately, she was booked into a play at Chichester theatre at the time. Why was she not offered more serious roles? “Because you’ve got to show you’re not just a lark.” But hadn’t she done Hedda? “Well, you’ve got to get lots of people to realise that. When I did Hedda people came to see it in Leicester, but it’s not like sitting in a theatre with 1,000 people in the West End. Then you’ve got to get people to let you do one after another after another, before it obliterates the comedy you’ve done.” She never quite managed that. Fielding talks about working with famous men. It was often difficult, she says. “The more famous comedians don’t want you to be funny, they want you to be straight and allow them to shine. They want you to be appreciative of how funny they are being by smiling a lot and laughing engagingly.” She fell out with Kenneth Williams in Pieces of Eight. He was put out in rehearsals when he saw a newspaper article that praised her as a “beautiful butterfly of comedy”. “Kenneth came out of the wings and he had the paper in his hand and he had the most terrible temper about it. I thought, God! I can’t help the fact they’ve said something nice about me.” Is this envy common in showbusiness? “Well, I’ve never had somebody so open about it! I couldn’t believe my ears.” In the book she writes of comic actor Norman Wisdom: “Not a very pleasant man. Always making a pass – hand up your skirt first thing in the morning. Not exactly a lovely way to start a day’s filming.” That doesn’t sound much different from the allegations we are hearing today about such people as Harvey Weinstein? “Well,” she says, “there was a time when every man I met … it was really something horrid.” And for once she doesn’t form a perfect sentence. “Misogynists.” I ask if she was as sexually confident as the women she often played. “Sometimes yes and sometimes no. Hehehehe!” Fielding never married, and there was conjecture that she was either a lesbian or a lonely spinster. In fact, she says, she has had a wonderfully full love life. For a 20-year period, she had two lovers. Neither of the men knew about the other. How did she keep them apart? “I don’t know really. I think it’s just an art.” She giggles. Would she have found life boring with just the one man? “Well, it was more exciting. But I never thought it would be boring just with one. I didn’t go around boasting about it, darling.” No, but you decided that’s how you wanted to live your life? “Yes. That’s right. Yes. Yes. Yes, it was. Yes.” Fielding’s older brother Basil Feldman is an ex-Conservative member of the House of Lords (unrelated to the Lord Feldman, the former Tory party chairman). Did she ever consider joining the Conservative party? She looks appalled. “It never occurred to me to touch them with a bargepole.’” In the late 1970s, as she hit her 50s, Fielding fell out of fashion. And how she fell. It was a humiliating time. After being swindled by an agent, she ended up broke and had to sell her home. “It’s rather awful sitting in a room waiting for benefits and everybody knows who you are. I had a terrible feeling I was finished. You’ve gone from this to that, and it’s just like you’re a failure. You think what happened? Wow! WOW!” Fielding gradually clawed her way back. She starred in a one-woman show at the Lyric Hammersmith, toured in a production of Lady Windermere’s Fan and featured in Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson’s film Guest House Paradiso in 1999. She also recorded readings of literary classics (including TS Eliot’s Four Quartets and JG Ballard’s Crash). Now she is even doing a few live shows to promote the book. Is she still as tough on herself, or does she regard herself as a success these days? She smiles. “I do feel I’ve done all right, yes.” What is she most proud of? She doesn’t mention her work. “Ah! I’m very happy that I’ve managed to have marvellous love without being pushed into the wrong sort of love by my parents. Yes. It makes for a much happier life. I’m very happy about that.” Do You Mind If I Smoke? by Fenella Fielding and Simon McKay is published on 16 November. Fielding launched the book at the Homotopia festival in Liverpool, which runs until 1 December. To order a copy for £12.74, go to guardianbookshop.com This article was corrected on 9 November 2017.

The minister quit after being summoned back from a trip to Uganda and Ethiopia by Downing Street after it emerged she failed to be candid with May about 14 unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers, businesspeople and a senior lobbyist. The prime minister will now need to carry out another reshuffle that will create disruption and add to the sense of instability across Whitehall and Westminster as her minority government battles to retain control of the political agenda. May and Patel met for just six minutes in the early evening. In her resignation letter, released moments after she left No 10, Patel admitted her actions “fell below the high standards that are expected of a secretary of state”. The prime minister said Patel’s decision was the correct one. She argued in a letter to the former cabinet minister that the UK and Israel were close allies and should work closely together. “But that must be done formally, and through official channels. That is why, when we met on Monday, I was glad to accept your apology and welcomed your clarification about your trip to Israel over the summer.” But she added: “Now that further details have come to light, it is right that you have decided to resign and adhere to the high standards of transparency and openness that you have advocated.” Six days of revelations about Patel’s meetings dominated headlines. On Monday it emerged that she had spoken to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in August in a meeting that May did not know about and with no officials present. Thirteen meetings were held in the presence of Lord Polak, an experienced Tory lobbyist. The move piles pressure onto May’s government following a string of controversies. The sex harassment scandal has already resulted in the resignation of the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, while one of the prime minister’s closest allies, Damian Green, is being investigated by the Cabinet office over allegations. Meanwhile there have been calls for May to sack her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, after an intervention risked lengthening the sentence of a British woman jailed in Iran. The development will also be seen as a blow for Brexiters, for whom Patel is a standard bearer. She was also the only minority ethnic woman in the cabinet. Patel could become an outspoken backbencher and help exert pressure on May from the pro-Brexit wing of the party. MPs supportive of Patel claimed she had been subjected to a Foreign Office “hatchet job” – claiming that senior individuals in Johnson’s department had briefed against her. A replacement for Patel was expected to be announced on Thursday. One senior MP said that May would be determined to maintain “balance” within her cabinet, both in terms of gender and the divide between ministers who backed the leave and remain campaigns in the EU referendum. Names under discussion include Penny Mordaunt, the welfare minister who was a prominent campaigner for out, and Andrea Leadsom, the pro-Brexit leader of the House of Commons. Remainers who could be in line for promotion include Claire Perry, the climate change minister, and Alistair Burt, whose current brief spans the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office. Patel’s return to Britain on a flight from Nairobi, Kenya, had been closely followed on the internet and in the media, with broadcasters even airing pictures of the plane she had been travelling in as it landed. It appeared that the MP for Witham had broken ministerial rules when the BBC disclosed on Friday that she met politicians and businessmen from Israel while on holiday in August without informing departmental officials, the FCO or Downing Street in advance. In an interview with the Guardian on the same day, she made misleading claims that Johnson had been aware of the meetings and that FCO mandarins had briefed against her. Patel told the Guardian: “Boris knew about the visit. The point is that the Foreign Office did know about this, Boris knew about [the trip]. It is not on, it is not on at all. I went out there, I paid for it. And there is nothing else to this. It is quite extraordinary.” But on Monday she was forced to apologise and withdraw her claims about the FCO and Johnson after a meeting with May. She also admitted that she had held 12 meetings in Israel with officials, businessmen, Netanyahu and the country’s security minister. Patel’s downfall was triggered by a failure to be entirely candid with the prime minister on Monday. It is understood that Patel told May in person that there were no other revelations due to emerge about her visit. But her reassurances collapsed on Tuesday when it emerged that DfID officials had been asked to explore whether it would be feasible to send UK aid money to the Israeli army for humanitarian work in the occupied Golan Heights. Her fate was sealed late on Tuesday after Downing Street confirmed that Patel had two further unauthorised meetings with senior Israeli officials after her return from Israel. Gilad Erdan, the Israeli security minister, met Patel in parliament on 7 September. She also saw Yuval Rotem, an official from the Israeli foreign ministry, for a meeting at the UN general assembly in New York. Polak was present at both meetings. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz claimed on Wednesday that Patel had visited an Israeli military field hospital in the Golan Heights, a disputed area that the UK does not recognise, and failed to declare it. DfID said it could neither confirm nor deny the report. Downing Street insisted that May knew nothing about Patel’s meetings until the controversy broke in the media late last week. However, Burt said in the Commons that the British embassy, FCO and DfID had been informed on 24 August, immediately after the meetings took place and while Patel was still in the country. Neither the FCO nor DfID were able to explain why No 10 had not been informed. Patel’s resignation will prompt further calls from the Conservative right to merge DfID with the FCO. Johnson appeared to make a play for his department to absorb DfID last month, saying it was a “colossal mistake in the 1990s to divide the Department for International Development from the Foreign Office”. Labour’s Tom Watson claimed that he had been informed of a further meeting by Patel during her holiday with officials from the British consulate general in Jerusalem, suggesting the government had been formally notified of the situation. “The existence of such a meeting or meetings would call into question the official account of Ms Patel’s behaviour, and the purpose of her visit,” wrote Watson in a letter to the prime minister last night, which listed a series of fresh questions. The development comes seven days after Sir Michael Fallon resigned as defence secretary over accusations of inappropriate behaviour towards women, which he categorically denies. Damian Green, May’s righthand man, remains under investigation by the Cabinet Office for alleged inappropriate behaviour towards a female activist and for allegations connected to claims that pornography was found on a laptop seized by police. He denies both of these claims. May’s administration has been hit by a series of crises since she lost her House of Commons majority in June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/09/ellen-andrea-wang-blank-out-review-jazzland","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"Ellen Andrea Wang: Blank Out review – jazz fusion with staying power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/09/ellen-andrea-wang-blank-out-review-jazzland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/09/ellen-andrea-wang-blank-out-review-jazzland","fields":{"headline":"Ellen Andrea Wang: Blank Out review – jazz fusion with staying power","bodyText":"Norway’s classy young double bassist and vocalist Ellen Andrea Wang has a burgeoning singer-songwriting life, as well as a role as leader of the ambient-jazz quartet Pixel and working on a side project with drums star Manu Katché.

The CFI’s honorary president arranged a dozen meetings during Patel’s summer holiday in Israel and was in attendance at all but one of them. He also accompanied her to meetings in September with an Israeli minister, Gilad Erdan, and Yuval Rotem, a government official. Lord Polak has spent 28 years lobbying on behalf of the Israeli state, first as its director, and now – after being ennobled by David Cameron in 2015 – its honorary president. “He’s given his entire life to CFI, when the Conservatives have been in government and out, and when Israel has had lots of friends and few friends. It’s his life’s work,” said an associate. “He’s built up contacts over generations of Tory MPs, and in the [Jewish] community he’s seen as someone who’s really put in the graft. In a world of people always trying to get ahead or promote themselves, Stuart is seen as someone who really cares about the issue. He’s a decent guy.” Another associate said: “Stuart is a very serious wheeler-dealer, mover and shaker within the Conservative party. Everything to do with lobbying [for Israel] goes through Stuart.” CFI, according to its website, organises events in and around Westminster, takes Conservative MPs and parliamentary candidates on (all-expenses-paid) visits to Israel, campaigns for Tory candidates in target seats, and “works to ensure that Israel’s case is fairly represented in parliament”. It has more than 2,000 members, including a very large proportion of the parliamentary party. It hosts an annual lunch for hundreds of guests, often addressed by the leader of the Conservative party. One former Tory MP said CFI was “extremely well-funded and has a long reach throughout the party”. In February this year CFI organised a delegation to Israel headed by the former Tory party and CFI chairman Eric Pickles to celebrate his knighthood. Pickles was accompanied by the former education secretary Nicky Morgan, the former pensions secretary Stephen Crabb, the former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, a Tory high-value donor, Jitesh Gadhia – and Polak. The itinerary included political and security briefings, cultural and historical visits, and a trip to the West Bank. Polak’s role at the heart of the Patel meetings may have been an uncharacteristic misjudgment, according to some. “He’s not a headline grabber – not because he’s some shadowy figure, but because he doesn’t look for a public profile himself. He was chuffed to get a peerage because it gave him a place even closer to government to do what he does. But it was never his intention to become part of the story,” said a former colleague. Another person who has observed Polak over a number of years said: “I’m not terribly surprised by Stuart’s role in this. He does throw his weight around and let you know how important he is – and this episode shows how much weight he has. “But Stuart of all people understands how politically sensitive Israel is. Should he have known better? Yes. For someone who’s been around for so long, I’m surprised his antennae didn’t go off. Perhaps he thought he could get away with it.” The Tory MP Hugo Swire, a former Foreign Office minister, said in the Commons on Monday that Patel’s meetings raised questions about the influence of lobbyists. “What people want is transparency and accountability. It is time, finally, to address the issue of privileged access and lobbying and funding, if we are not to have this repeating time and time again,” he said. Polak is also chair of the advisory board of TWC Associates, a “boutique consultancy specialising in the development of political strategy”, which lists among its clients several Israeli defence companies, including Elbit Systems which specialises in defence electronics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/08/the-fiver-australian-diplomacy-socceroos-honduras-world-cup-play-ff","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T16:08:27Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | A long and proud tradition of Australian excellence in international diplomacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/08/the-fiver-australian-diplomacy-socceroos-honduras-world-cup-play-ff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/08/the-fiver-australian-diplomacy-socceroos-honduras-world-cup-play-ff","fields":{"headline":"A long and proud tradition of Australian excellence in international diplomacy","bodyText":"SCREAMING BLUE MURDER The Fiver didn’t get where it is today peddling lazy national stereotypes, even if our didgeridoo-playing, Ramsay Street-dwelling, stubby-swilling, shrimp-throwing, strewth-saying Australian cousin G’day Mate Crocodile Dundee Fiver and assorted other foreign cousins might disagree. Truth is, G’Day Mate and his compatriots have more important things to worry about at the moment, what with a couple of their late night TV presenters having riled up the population of an entire country before the first leg of the World Cup showdown between the Sheilaroos and Honduras to be played in San Pedro Sula this weekend. Interviewing the Sheilaroos striker Tim Cahill on their Channel 10 news and current affairs show, The Project, presenters Waleed Aly and Peter Helliar continued a long and proud tradition of Australian excellence in the field of international diplomacy by joking about the fact that Australia were travelling to a city that was once the murder capital of the world and asking if, in the event of victory, Cahill and his team-mates would have to play Isis next. These banter-tastic comments by two men apparently seized by the spirit of Boris Johnson and Donald J Trump have been predictably well received in Honduras, where the local media have accused the Aussies of racism and the country’s FA president has criticised them for “telling lies” about their hosts. It gets worse. During a recent interview, Sheilaroos coach, Ange Postecoglou, joked about the logistical difficulties in getting his team’s kit and equipment to Honduras, prompting the newspaper El Heraldo to sniffily observe that “Australians seem to have a lot of fun with the social problems of other countries”. Honduran journalists were further incensed this week when the Sheilaroos touched down in San Pedro Sula and proceeded to blank the assembled local media who had waited for their arrival at the airport in the hope of getting some face time with the visitors. “As players, we respect the country and people, which is most important,” said Cahill, upon being forced in front of his own country’s media in full-on grovel mode. “What media say is different to what players think. I’m happy here in Honduras. It is a country I already respect a lot but we want to get a good result in the match.” While the possibility of the Sheilaroos joining USA! USA!! USA!!! on the list of conspicuous absentees for Russia 2018 was already very real, the comments of their cultural attaches Aly, Helliar and Postecoglou have made it even more likely. Having incurred the ire of their hosts in the build-up to their game, the Aussies are unlikely to be afforded a particularly warm welcome to the Estadio Olímpico by any of the 40,000 Honduras supporters or 1,200 police officers and soldiers present. “It’s about football and enjoying that occasion and us taking in the surroundings,” declared Cahill, who will no doubt be calling on some of his experiences as a Millwall player to inform some of his less well-travelled young team-mates just how enjoyable an occasion this weekend’s game might be.

Unlike most cryptocurrency hacks, however, the money wasn’t deliberately taken: it was effectively destroyed by accident. The lost money was in the form of Ether, the tradable currency that fuels the Ethereum distributed app platform, and was kept in digital multi-signature wallets built by a developer called Parity. These wallets require more than one user to enter their key before funds can be transferred. On Tuesday Parity revealed that, while fixing a bug that let hackers steal $32m out of few multi-signature wallets, it had inadvertently left a second flaw in its systems that allowed one user to become the sole owner of every single multi-signature wallet. The user, “devops199”, triggered the flaw apparently by accident. When they realised what they had done, they attempted to undo the damage by deleting the code which had transferred ownership of the funds. Rather than returning the money, however, that simply locked all the funds in those multisignature wallets permanently, with no way to access them. “This means that currently no funds can be moved out of the multi-sig wallets,” Parity says in a security advisory. Effectively, a user accidentally stole hundreds of wallets simultaneously, and then set them on fire in a panic while trying to give them back. “We are analysing the situation and will release an update with further details shortly,” Parity told users. Hard fork Some are pushing for a “hard fork” of Ethereum, which would undo the damage by effectively asking 51% of the currency’s users to agree to pretend that it had never happened in the first place. That would require a change to the code that controls ethereum, and then that change to be adopted by the majority of the user base. The risk is that some of the community refuses to accept the change, resulting in a split into two parallel groups. Such an act isn’t unheard of: another hack, two years ago, of an Ethereum app called the DAO resulted in $150m being stolen. The hard fork was successful then, but the money stolen represented a much larger portion of the entire Ethereum market than the $300m lost to Parity. The lost $300m follows the discovery of bug in July that led to the theft of $32m in ether from just three multisignature wallets. A marathon coding and hacking effort was required to secure another $208m against theft. Patching that bug led to the flaw in Parity’s system that devops199 triggered by accident. Parity says that it is unable to confirm the actual amount lost, but that the $300m figure is “purely speculative”. The company also disputes that the currency is “lost”, arguing that “frozen” is more accurate. But if it is frozen, it appears that no-one has the ability to unfreeze the funds. “The Parity vulnerability was the result of an incorrectly coded smart contract used by the Parity wallet to store tokens on the Ethereum network,” said Dominic Williams, founder of blockchain firm DFINITY. “The vulnerability made it possible for anyone to ‘freeze’ the tokens held by that smart contract, making them immovable. At this time, the only method we are aware of to ‘unfreeze’ tokens held by the vulnerable smart contract would be to create a new ‘hard fork’ Ethereum client that deploys a fix. This would require every full node on the Ethereum network to upgrade by the date of the hard fork to stay in sync, including all miners, wallets, exchanges, etc.” Ethereum has rapidly become the second most important cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin, with its price increasing more than 2,500% over the past year. One token of Ether is now worth a little over $285, up from $8 in January. This article’s original headline has been amended for greater clarity. The original version of this article also suggested Parity introduced a new flaw into the system; the company did not introduce the flaw into the system, but did fail to eradicate it.

Provocateurs such as Jake and Dinos Chapman seem sadly adrift in today’s deeply strange world when a sculpture of a suicide vest elicits only a brief shrug among the much more surreal stuff reality keeps chucking at us. Ken Currie deserves credit for breaking through this moribund mood with grotesque new paintings that genuinely nauseate. You’d have to be a stone to see these without a few shudders, and anyone with a weak stomach should avoid them like the plague – and I mean a plague that causes bubbling pustules bursting out of dead flesh. Two colossal canvases, each more than four metres wide, face each other across a fairly small space. The Flensers (2016) is a nightmarish vision of the whaling industry 100 years ago, except it is more timeless than that. Flensing is the bloody work of skinning and gutting a whale to get at its commercially valuable blubber. Gigantic pink and purple intestines swarm like foul invertebrate creatures at the centre of Currie’s painting, while workers with horribly sharp and bizarrely shaped (but authentic) flensing tools go about their gruesome task. Vast strips of flayed whale skin, showing marbled red and white insides, hang above the meaty labourers as they wade among shiny guts. This is in no sense a realist painting. One man’s legs have turned into tentacles as if infected by the snaky intestines. A huge dead eye looks more like a shark’s than that of a whale. The space created by the theatrical tableau of suspended skin is eerily artificial, the poses of the flensers exaggeratedly formal. They stand heroically like people in an 18th-century history painting by Jacques-Louis David or Benjamin West. In the distance, a shadowy row of factory sheds is the most oddly haunting aspect of the entire morbid vision. Krankenhaus (2016) on the facing wall is, if anything, even more horrific. In a nightmare version of a first world war hospital, patients and doctors enact rituals that have little to do with real healing. A man with an antique prosthetic arm is cutting up meat. A doctor looks into the mouth of a naked male patient, who has sagging female breasts like the “withered dugs” of Tiresias in TS Eliot’s The Waste Land, using a spoon and candle to light his investigation. The face of the doctor is compassionate and sensitive, his gaze caringly intent, until you start to wonder how he is actually helping his patient – or victim. Then you find yourself staring at a big, dangerous pair of scissors in his pocket. Another medic is forcing a red rubber tube into a prone patient’s mouth. The tube is suspended from the ceiling; following it along the length of the picture, you discover it originates from the patient’s genitals. He is being force fed his own effluents. Meanwhile a nurse conducts a concert by a blind violinist and a facially injured man who plays the flute from a hole where his mouth should be. This hospital is not making anyone well. It is monstrously industrialising sickness. It might have been painted by the early 20th-century German artists Max Beckmann or Otto Dix if they had seen the films of David Lynch. What makes it and The Flensers truly horrible, however, is their perverse beauty. Currie is a very skilled painter in an old-fashioned way. Details of painterly excellence in Krankenhaus catch the eye: the way he paints hair standing on end made my hair stand on end. Most unexpectedly of all, the whaleskin draperies in The Flensers are clearly inspired by a pink piece of cloth that hangs up in Titian’s masterpiece Diana and Actaeon. So what’s it all about? Is this veteran painter, whose expressionism first made him known in the 1980s as one of the “New Glasgow Boys”, merely playing grisly aesthetic games? A third monumental canvas that hangs on an end wall makes clear the serious moral purpose of his apparent sensationalism. Currie has painted the tragically damaged face of a victim of the Hiroshima bomb on a gargantuan scale, so big and pale and torn it is hard to look at. Looking at it, however, is a uniformed general who stands with his back to us, gazing close up at what a nuclear war does to the survivors. It is a blast of anger at the masters of war who play with our world as if it were their little toy. This is what Currie would like to do: make a warmonger stand up close to see the real face of his handiwork. This furious, vomiting scream of a show proves that art can speak to our vile days after all, if it has brains, imagination and passion.

As this monologue hit full speed, West bellowed the following statement to nobody in particular: “Picasso is dead, Walt Disney is dead, Steve Jobs is dead. Name someone living that you can name in the same breath as them.” This question has remained unanswered … until now. Because, although I don’t know the name of the genius in question, an heir has finally been discovered. The pattern now goes Picasso, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs and whoever invented Netflix’s “skip intro” button. I’m increasingly of the persuasion that this tool is the greatest invention of the 21st century so far. It’s certainly the most satisfying. If you’re yet to experience its magnificent wonders, let me walk you through it, step by glorious step. You turn on Netflix. You choose a show. Its interminable title sequence lurches into action. A little rectangular button pops up in the bottom right of the screen. It says “skip intro”. You hit it. As if by magic, the title sequence goes away and you’re slap-bang into the show itself. It’s miraculous. One little-discussed downside of Peak TV is that 95% of all title sequences are terrible. This is because there are too many prestige dramas and they’re all trying to prove that they’re more prestigious than the others. The fastest way for them to do this is to hurl every last ounce of pretension they can at the opening sequence. The signifiers have almost become rote now: if there’s atonal music and tiny writing and you start to lose the will to live about halfway through, you know this must be a really important series. Prestigious opening titles have become such a lazy trope that lesser shows are starting to misuse them. The intro to Star Trek: Discovery, for instance, is as toweringly self-important as anything since the first series of The Leftovers. It is a monument to codswallop, dripping with references to the Renaissance up to and including Michelangelo’s fresco of The Creation of Adam, set to the sort of ambient chiming they play in tall lifts to stop people from freaking out. Worse still, just when you think it’s done – because the words “Star Trek Discovery” pop up – it lumbers on for 13 more agonising seconds. This would be good if Star Trek: Discovery was actually prestigious, but it isn’t. It’s a workaday spin-off of three or four better predecessors. Show me someone who wouldn’t skip the Star Trek: Discovery intro, given the chance, and I’ll show you a masochist. Same with Mindhunter. Its title sequence is novel the first time around – hey, a tape recorder really does look like a bit like a dead person’s face! – but watching all 95 seconds of it 10 times in a row, and listening to the title music, which sounds like someone tuning a railway station piano as slowly as possible, is too much to ask. We just want to see some serial killers. Of course we’re going to skip the intro. Netflix has toyed with intro-skipping before. It used to start episodes automatically once the opening titles were finished, but the lack of choice irritated some. Now, though, you need only hit a button and – bang – the whole thing blows up, never to be seen again. It’s destruction of the most satisfying kind. It’s the televisual equivalent of being a drone pilot. I can’t get enough of it. In an ideal world, all title sequences would be as short as the one for The Good Place, which is just a momentary white-on-green screen. A sequence like that proves that the show is desperate to tell you as much story as it can before time runs out. It tells you there’s no time to waste. Its exciting. But, until that happens, at least we’ve got this magical button. Its unknown creator should step forward immediately, so we can all throw flowers at them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/09/grammers-turn-as-the-dad-with-a-penchant-for-tall-tales-is-the-best-part-of-this-middling-musical-paean-to-narcissistic-fantasy","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T00:00:06Z","webTitle":"Big Fish review – Kelsey Grammer can't save this musical from sinking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/09/grammers-turn-as-the-dad-with-a-penchant-for-tall-tales-is-the-best-part-of-this-middling-musical-paean-to-narcissistic-fantasy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/nov/09/grammers-turn-as-the-dad-with-a-penchant-for-tall-tales-is-the-best-part-of-this-middling-musical-paean-to-narcissistic-fantasy","fields":{"headline":"Big Fish review – Kelsey Grammer can't save this musical from sinking","bodyText":"Anyone drawn to this musical by the prospect of seeing Frasier’s Kelsey Grammer is in for a bit of a shock: although Grammer is the pivot of the story and the best thing in the show, he is off stage for long periods. For the most part we get a mix of father-son story and spiralling fairytale that never achieves the moment of ecstasy we look for in a musical. The show has a complex pedigree. Daniel Wallace’s 1998 novel and Tim Burton’s 2003 film jointly inspired a short-lived Broadway musical in 2013. John August, who wrote the screenplay and the musical book, and Andrew Lippa, who did the music and lyrics, have tinkered with the Broadway format but the story remains essentially the same. Edward Bloom, a travelling salesman, has a stroke and recapitulates the tall stories, involving witches, giants, mermaids and circus showmen, he has long told to entertain his son, Will. As Edward approaches his end, the sceptical Will tries to come to terms with a father whose life seems to have been built on exuberant fabrications. I am not sure that right now the world needs a paean to a narcissistic fantasist like Edward, whose idea of a joke is to hijack his son’s wedding by announcing that the bride is pregnant. Even on its own terms, the story doesn’t make much sense. It is rather as if Death of a Salesman had been crossed with Into the Woods – and the two don’t mix. On one level, the show is about a son’s belated recognition that there was hidden virtue in his bombastic tale-spinning father. But, since that realisation depends on accepting there was a grain of truth in the father’s lies, the show ends up having a nervous, each-way bet on fact and fantasy. As in the movie, but unlike on Broadway, this version splits the role of Edward into his bedridden and storybook selves. Grammer plays the former with great elan and makes something almost endearing out of this grown-up Alabama Billy Liar. He tells us that “our town was so small our phone book was the Yellow Page”, and radiates the bonhomie of a man who lives in his dreams and cannot see a lily without wishing to gild it. But much of the narrative is handed over to his younger fabulating self, rather doggedly played by Jamie Muscato. Although there is lively support from Dean Nolan as a gentle giant and Forbes Masson as a boisterous showman, the women in the story are marginalised and Matthew Seadon-Young struggles to excite our interest in Edward’s son. Nigel Harman’s production has shrewdly abandoned the spectacle that supposedly stifled the Broadway version and presents us with more homespun magic arising, in Tom Rogers’s design, from a hospital bedroom setting. But in a musical one looks for memorable songs and Lippa’s score falls sadly short. There’s a cheery wartime number, Red, White and True, with just a hint of the Andrews Sisters, and I was touched by Clare Burt’s rendering, as Edward’s wife, of a song signalling her marital devotion. Otherwise there is little to lodge in the mind in a middling musical that fails to exploit, in the manner of Follies, Edward’s split selves, and that doesn’t give us nearly enough Grammer. • At the Other Palace, London, until 31 December.

Widespread anger with politicians who were seen as lazy and intent on feathering their own nests made this intake more determined than ever to exert their independence. The new MP for Witham – described as a Thatcherite on the right of the party – was soon being viewed as a rising star, elected quickly on to the executive of the 1922 Committee that represents Tory backbenchers and tipped for promotion into a ministerial role. Years later, the charismatic MP who performed well on TV would be talked about as a possible future leader. Although she was sometimes perceived as outspoken and rebellious in her first years in the Commons, her voting record tended to be relatively loyal, as she maintained a strong reputation both within the ranks of government and among her party’s MPs. However, that Patel was part of a major rebellion in October 2011 over an issue that would go on to dominate David Cameron’s leadership – Britain’s membership of the EU – should not have been a surprise. Patel, a former press officer for the anti-EU Referendum party funded by Zac Goldsmith’s father, James Goldsmith, was known to have long-held and passionate views on the subject, along with a number of her new colleagues. Still, Cameron was rocked by the decision of 81 Tories (including a third of the new 2010 intake) to vote against him in favour of an EU referendum. It was the start of a campaign that resulted in him offering the country the 2016 vote that killed his own political career. Because of the scale of the rebellion, many of those who voted against Cameron that October (including Andrea Leadsom, Tracey Crouch and Patel) were forgiven and later promoted into ministerial roles. Patel – whose parents, Sushil and Anjana, were immigrants originally from the Indian province of Gujarat but whose families had moved to Uganda – was first appointed as the UK’s Indian diaspora champion in 2013. In July 2014 she was made exchequer secretary in the Treasury and then in May 2015, she became employment minister in the Department for Work and Pensions – the job she held when the government embarked on the EU referendum. As Cameron relaxed ministerial collective responsibility, Patel quickly became one of the most visible and outspoken members of the Vote Leave campaign team, even escalating a row in government over the treatment of Brexit ministers. She accused the cabinet secretary, Jeremy Heywood, of an “unconstitutional act” after he told civil servants that they might have to bypass ministers who were campaigning for leave. Patel – who backed Theresa May in the Conservatives’ post-referendum leadership battle – was rewarded with a cabinet role as the government tried to ensure a balance of pro-leave and pro-remain ministers around the table. Patel’s elevation to international development secretary was controversial, not least given she once suggested replacing it with a department for international trade and development, with the aim of enhancing economic links with the developed world. Sources also said that she told staff within the department that her priority would be protecting British taxpayers. After May was stripped of her majority in June’s general election, talk of Patel as a possible leader grew, with a Conservative Home survey placing her third favourite, amid a clamour for a candidate from the next generation. Patel is by no means a Cameroon from the modernising wing of the party. She was even once described as a “modern-day Norman Tebbit”. As well as her fierce campaigning for Brexit, including over the need to rein in immigration, she had also called for the death penalty to be reintroduced (an opinion that she has since reversed) and faced controversy over her work as a spin doctor to help a tobacco giant counter negative publicity. But the 45-year-old, who is married with one son, is seen as a slick operator who, as an Asian woman, can show a different face of Toryism. Her background breaks with some of the stereotypes of the Cameron years. Patel’s parents were left penniless and homeless under the murderous regime of Idi Amin and came to the UK, where they set up a chain of newsagents. Patel was born in London, and educated in a comprehensive school in Watford before studying economics at Keele University and taking on a postgrad at the University of Essex: a strong fit for the Tory hope to present itself as a party of aspiration. However, whether through naivety or worse, her failure to let the prime minister and Foreign Office know of invitations for a series of meetings in Israel could be Patel’s downfall, not just as a cabinet minister, but perhaps as a potential future leader too. It was certainly notable in parliament that colleagues were not lining up to support her. And what will be perceived as a closeness to the Israeli government, not matched by efforts with Palestinian counterparts, could be damaging in the longer term. However, this scandal is unlikely to break her resolve: she remains an impressive media performer, who would offer a completely different feel to the Tory party, with a political ideology more sharply in contrast to Labour than many of her peers. And she will certainly not keep a low profile on the backbenches. • This article was amended on 9 and 10 November 2017 to change “regime” to “government” in the penultimate paragraph.

James Finley, Keith Barnett and Louis Zuurhout, who worked in the company’s energy division, entered the plea following parallel investigations by US and UK authorities into whether bribes were paid to secure overseas contracts over a 14-year period between 1999 and 2013. They are accused of being involved in schemes whereby foreign government officials received bribes in exchange for deals that benefited a Rolls-Royce subsidiary in the US, including a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from central Asia to China. A further individual, Andreas Kohler, who worked for an international engineering consulting firm instructed by Rolls-Royce’s former customer in Kazakhstan, also entered a guilty plea. Another individual, Petros Contoguris, who worked as an intermediary for Rolls-Royce has been charged by FBI. “Today’s indictment and guilty pleas reveal that those associated with this corruption did knowingly conspire to break the law for their own personal gain,” said Stephen Richardson, assistant director of the FBI’s criminal investigative division. “No one is above the law, so let today’s announcement be a warning to those who may try to perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will aggressively pursue those who attempt to bribe foreign officials for an unfair advantage in the global marketplace,” he added. A spokesperson for the company said: “Rolls-Royce has committed to full ongoing co-operation with the Department of Justice and cannot comment on action against individuals.” Rolls sold its energy business in 2014. In January this year, Rolls-Royce agreed to pay £671m in penalties after long-running investigations into claims it paid bribes to get export contracts. The settlement meant the FTSE 100 company would avoid prosecution by anti-corruption investigators in the UK, US and Brazil, but it did not exempt individuals. The US Justice Department said its prosecutors and FBI agents had worked closely with their counterparts in Brazil and with the SFO. Kenneth Blanco, acting assistant attorney general of the US Justice Department’s criminal division, said the defendants would face justice, “which represents another important step towards levelling the playing field for all ethical and honest businesses.” The SFO said its investigation into conduct of individuals in Rolls-Royce civil, defence, marine and former energy divisions continues, in parallel with a US Department of Justice investigation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/22/we-could-build-something-revolutionary-how-tech-set-underground-music-free","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-22T09:50:16Z","webTitle":"'We could build something revolutionary': how tech set underground music free","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/22/we-could-build-something-revolutionary-how-tech-set-underground-music-free","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/22/we-could-build-something-revolutionary-how-tech-set-underground-music-free","fields":{"headline":"'We could build something revolutionary': how tech set underground music free","bodyText":"In the 20th century, the vast majority of music you heard and bought was controlled by a small number of companies: record labels, radio stations and other dominators of the media. Artists needed them to reach the public and the public’s choice was prescribed by what these gatekeepers believed could best turn a profit. You liked it or lumped it. Now, however, a networked world is giving artists and audiences the tools to reject those companies for ever. The arrival of illegal filesharing on Napster in 1999 changed everything: it was a collision between a new format (MP3) and a new distribution system (the internet), both of which sat outside of the control of the traditional music business. It made the first cracks in the music culture cartel and gave the underground a hotline to a global audience for the first time. As with all utopianism, though, there were many false messiahs. MySpace presented itself as a DIY revolution for artists, but spread itself too thin – it was simultaneously an audio player, a blog, a photo gallery, a video player, a sales window and a community platform where the users were also the creators. Other platforms learned from this and focused on doing one thing well: community (Facebook, Twitter), video (YouTube), audio (SoundCloud), sales (Bandcamp), ticketing (Songkick, Dice), self-serve distribution (TuneCore, CD Baby), alternative funding (Pledge, Patreon, Kickstarter) and so on. This decentralisation of the music industry became its reimagining as a Meccano set – where underground acts could choose the services they wanted based on their needs. “After Napster, it was absolutely clear that digital technology was going to provide a platform that would allow artists to communicate with and sell directly to their fans,” says Tim Clark of management company ie:music. “If they were clever, they could forge an independent path.” Today, the tools have ripened to the point where, if musicians build enough momentum, a record label becomes an indulgence, rather than a necessity. “Technology has democratised creativity,” says Brian Message, a partner at artist management company ATC. “The tools are in everybody’s hands to be able to create and to promote at any level.” This is exemplified most in 2017 by Chance the Rapper – Forbes estimates he made $33m (£25m) this year without the need for a label or even to sell physical music. But, before him, the dubstep and grime scenes in the UK saw a new generation of artists using YouTube for distribution, broadcast and community. Luke Hood set up the channel UKF on YouTube in 2009 to support and showcase drum’n’bass and dubstep. It has since diversified across genres and drawn enormous audiences along the way, with 6.1 million subscribers to its dubstep channel alone. “YouTube was a free, easy platform that everyone was using,” he says when asked why he was drawn towards it. “A lot of acts on UKF can speak to their fans directly and establish a genuine connection that you couldn’t do before in underground music.” Manchester grime act Bugzy Malone also built his following on YouTube. “It was definitely my main platform,” he says. “I put things out there and I took feedback from the fans. I built it from scratch so that eventually I had a formula that worked.” He now has close to a quarter of a million subscribers to his channel; his biggest video, Moving, has nearly 10m views. YouTube allowed him to get to a level where he can work with record companies on terms he sets himself. He has a label-services deal with ADA, which offers functions such as disc manufacturing, physical and digital distribution, marketing and sales reporting. “The guys are cool and massively helpful,” he says of ADA. “But they’re taking the lead from me and what it is that I want to do. They are there to back up the vision and be on the wagon that is already moving.” Yet record companies still profit from deals such as Bugzy’s and take a cut of artists’ earnings. Plus, their grip on companies offering services to independent artists is getting tighter. Sony Music now fully owns distribution firm The Orchard, while, on the label-services side, Warner Music owns ADA, Universal Music owns Caroline International and Kobalt owns AWAL (Artists Without a Label). All the record labels, major and indie, have an equity stake in Spotify. But while the teeth marks of the old music business can be found in the emerging one, there are still ways acts can remain totally independent. Benji Rogers set up direct-to-fan platform PledgeMusic in 2009 to allow acts to pre-sell, distribute and market their music. “It turns out that direct communication makes the artist the most money,” he says. Rogers is also an early investor in SuperPhone – a supercharged communication and engagement tool built by musician Ryan Leslie, whereby all contacts and fans are managed through one phone number. “He is not in the mainstream,” says Rogers. “He is literally the definition of independent.” Leslie was signed to Universal, but left to pursue a career where technology would give him the independence to create a new type of fan engagement that he felt the label system was too ossified to bend towards. “Selena Gomez has 128 million Instagram followers, but she is definitely not selling 128m albums,” says Leslie of the fundamental disconnect between social media profile and sales, from where the idea for SuperPhone sprang. “What I realised is that social media connections are very weak.” In 2013, he gave his phone number to his Twitter followers to sign them up to SuperPhone. Within six months, 35,000 people had texted the number and, of that, 33,000 had responded to an automated request for more information about themselves. The following year, he went on tour and announced it to his fan database. “We sold 40,000 tickets with no label, no manager and no PR,” he says. “All straight off SuperPhone.” After raising $75,000 in seed funding, he opened it up to all artists, including rappers such as Lil Wayne and Cardi B. They are all vetted in advance, so that they don’t abuse the tools to spam fans, but rather use it carefully to maintain regular contact with them. “Success, in any iteration, happens at the speed of communication,” he says. All this comes as a reaction against the three-card trick Facebook has played on users: if you have a million followers, at best 2% of your audience will stumble across your posts, unless you pay Facebook to boost them, according to research by Ogilvy. “Every artist you know is – in some way, shape or form – paying Facebook and Instagram to reach their fans,” argues Rogers. “What you get here is a sickness cycle. Would I build my business on Facebook? Hell, no! Because, in their business, I am the product. What is it giving me back?” In a similar vein, social app EscapeX was set up to “decentralise social media” and give artists new levels of autonomy by putting them, rather than the major social networks, in charge of their communities. “The engagement economy is different,” argues Sephi Shapira, the company’s CEO. “It’s not really the amount of fans that you have; it’s how engaged you are and the spending power of your fans.” Thirteen-year-old Danielle Cohn – a megastar on lip-sync video app Musical.ly, where she has more than 8 million followers – recently signed up with EscapeX to take more control of her fanbase. In the app, she has a monthly subscription option, but Shapira says this only accounts for 10% of the money she makes there. The other 90% comes from fans paying to rocket themselves up the leaderboard to be in her top-three fans, where, according to the app’s description, they will be guaranteed to “be seen by Dani Cohn” – effectively buying their way into her line of vision. The Faustian pact of these apps and social media platforms is that musicians get data about their fans in return, but become dependent on the service in question still being in business – and relevant – six months from now. As MySpace crumbled, artists made SoundCloud the main place to upload their music. But SoundCloud is teetering on the brink of insolvency, recently laying off 40% of its staff and raising emergency funding of $170m to stay afloat. If it goes down the tubes, the underground will lose one of its biggest tools. Musician and tech activist Mat Dryhurst believes, however, that a new wave of funding and technological disruption is brewing that will finally put artists in the driving seat – moving them beyond apps and social media altogether and propping up their underground communities in perpetuity. He laments a world “in which platforms rise and fall based, not on a lack of demand, but on a lack of ability to return profits to a small group of venture capitalists”. He argues that the cryptocurrency community – the people behind online cash such as Bitcoin – could create alternative to the ad-funded models beloved of Silicon Valley. He suggests an “ICO” – initial coin offering – to fund a music hosting and sharing platform – a kind of cryptocurrency IPO. “It would allow for open-source utopian developers to raise significant amounts of money with an engaged user base and build something potentially revolutionary,” he says. “It’s best thought of as crowdowning – we could distribute governance of these platforms to the people who care the most about them. In return for your contribution, you receive something of value that can be used within the ecosystem – and also potentially a portion of ownership that gives you decision-making rights. “Royalties are possible under a cooperative model, like Resonate.is’s proposed model for more equitable streaming payments. You could also make membership and uploading entirely free in return for contributing value in other ways to the platform.” One artist making the first steps into this space is Bjork, whose new album, Utopia, can be purchased using various cryptocurrencies. SuperPhone, EscapeX and ICO-powered platforms are early indicators of a self-sustaining 21st-century counterculture. In that world, artists own and control everything – data, copyrights, fan relationships. For now, however, they are trapped, toggling between Tin Pan Alley and Silicon Valley."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/08/priti-patel-israel-trip-analysis-uk-foreign-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T12:12:22Z","webTitle":"What did Israel hope to gain from Priti Patel's secret meetings?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/08/priti-patel-israel-trip-analysis-uk-foreign-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/08/priti-patel-israel-trip-analysis-uk-foreign-policy","fields":{"headline":"What did Israel hope to gain from Priti Patel's secret meetings?","bodyText":"For the second time in less than a year, Israeli efforts to discreetly influence British policy has been disclosed. In January, the embassy official Shai Masot was caught in an al-Jazeera sting to “take down” politicians regarded as unfriendly to Israel. This time a bigger fish has been caught: the UK’s international development secretary, Priti Patel. Official visits to Israel by senior British political figures are common, but the sensitivities are usually acute; embassy and consulate staff carefully vet the locations and personnel visited by British diplomats and ministers. Visits are always accompanied by diplomatic staff, with agendas designed to reflect UK policy – for example, making sure to include meetings with Palestinians and groups and individuals who may not be popular with the Israeli government. Patel’s summer trip, organised with the head of the Conservative Friends of Israel lobby group, skipped all those protocols, despite a timetable that was highly orchestrated – including a reported visit to an Israeli field hospital in the occupied Golan Heights, which could have taken place only with both Israeli military and political clearance. To Israeli officials her private visit would have seemed like a gift, not least because those involved would have been immediately aware that, unaccompanied by diplomats, Patel was operating freelance. Embedded in the more humdrum elements of her tour were three key encounters. The first was with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was “interested” in meeting her, officials told the Guardian. Also significant were meetings with Yuval Rotem, the director general of Israel’s foreign ministry (a key appointment for Netanyahu, who is also Israel’s foreign minister), and Gilad Erdan, the abrasive minister from Netanyahu’s Likud party, who is in charge of public security, strategic affairs and information. The three – as Lord Polak would have known – represent key pillars of Israel’s international diplomacy. “[Lord Polak] has his own network,” one senior figure involved in Israeli-British advocacy told the Guardian. The source was unaware of Patel’s visit, and suggested it had been clumsily handled. Israel’s interest in Patel is less hard to fathom. As well as wanting to promote Israel’s image, Patel’s department is at a key intersection of Israeli interest. The Department of International Development (DfID) gives aid to the Palestinian Authority as well as human rights groups that criticise Israel, including Amnesty International. Israel has pressed DfID to cut aid to the Palestinians due to the payments given by the Palestinian Authority to the families of people killed or jailed for involvement in attacks on Israeli targets. Patel ordered a review of some funding in 2016. Netanyahu also raised the issue of (it turns out, non-existent) UK funding for the Israeli civil rights group Breaking the Silence with Theresa May earlier this year. But it is Erdan’s presence in meetings with Patel that is most telling because his role is largely unconnected with the work of DfID. As public security minister he has oversight of Israel’s police; as information minister he has a propaganda role; but of most interest is his position as strategic affairs minister. Erdan has emerged as the key figure in Israel’s international efforts against the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement [BDS], and against other groups and movements that Israel accuses of seeking to delegitimise it through criticism of its human rights record. In that context, Erdan’s ministry was asked in 2015 to “guide, coordinate and integrate the activities of all the ministers and the government and of civil entities in Israel and abroad on the subject of the struggle against attempts to delegitimise Israel and the boycott movement”. Most controversially, Erdan has been put in charge of large-scale efforts to target foreign individuals and organisations, reportedly including staff recruited from the Mossad foreign intelligence agency, the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency, and the military ntelligence directorate. Among those who have fallen foul of Erdan’s ministry have been Isabel Phiri, a Malawian official in the World Council of Churches who was detained arriving at Ben Gurion airport and deported for alleged involvement in the BDS movement. Earlier this month, Raed Jarrar, advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International – some of whose international projects are supported by DfiD – was prevented from crossing from Jordan into the West Bank. A spokeswoman for Israel’s interior ministry said Erdan had recommended he be denied entry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/19/how-i-fell-in-love-with-a-song-called-delia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-19T02:31:58Z","webTitle":"How I fell in love with a song called Delia | Gareth Hutchens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/19/how-i-fell-in-love-with-a-song-called-delia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/19/how-i-fell-in-love-with-a-song-called-delia","fields":{"headline":"How I fell in love with a song called Delia","bodyText":"I fell in love with a song called Delia a few years ago. It’s an old blues song. Traced to the early 1900s when the blues was in its infancy. It’s one of those haunting tunes generations of singers have passed down to each other, like a whisper. People like Reese Du Pree, Blind Willie McTell, Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan. It’s about a murder that took place on Christmas Eve in 1900, in the Yamacraw neighbourhood of Savannah, Georgia, in the United States. Two African Americans, Mose “Cooney” Houston and his girlfriend, Delia Green, were at a house party. The pair had only been together a few months but Houston, who was drunk, was big-noting himself in front of the guests, telling everyone he’d been sleeping with Green. Green called him a liar and a son of a bitch, offending his ego. “That is a damn lie,” Houston spat back. “You know I have had you as many times as I have fingers and toes.” Houston was asked to leave the party. On his way out the door he stopped and pulled a pistol and shot Green in the groin, then bolted. He was chased down and caught by the owner of the house. He confessed to the shooting, saying he’d do it again because she’d called him a son of a bitch. Green was carried to her mother’s house a block away, where she died a few hours later, around 3am on Christmas Day. The murder was so shocking it was reported in the local papers and Houston’s trial was eagerly covered when it started a few months later. What made it newsworthy? Houston and Green were just kids. Only 14 years old. A young teenage boy had been bragging at a party about sleeping with his girlfriend, then shot her dead when she called him a liar. His age would play a crucial role in the trial. He was tried as an adult because Georgia didn’t have a separate juvenile court system in 1901. The jury took pity on him, and he was given a life sentence rather than the noose. Delia was buried in an unmarked grave. The newspaper editors didn’t like it. Despite the leniency shown to Houston, dispatches from the courtroom portrayed the boy as ungrateful. He had apparently thanked the judge and walked out cheerily. When a sheriff’s deputy asked him what he thought of his sentence, Houston said “I don’t like it at all, but I guess I’ll have to stand it.” The public was left with the impression that Houston had beaten the system. Within a handful of years, the murder had been turned into a blues song, the identity of the composer unknown. We know the facts of the real life story because of the work of the ballad expert John Garst, and the folklorist Robert W Gordon, who collected dozens of versions of the song. Sean Wilentz, the renowned Dylan biographer, has written about it beautifully in Bob Dylan in America. When you discover the song’s origins, and read about the journey it’s taken over the decades, you can learn more about the blues in one sitting than from years of passive listening. You understand how various versions of the song (“Delia”, “Delia’s Gone,” “One More Rounder Gone”) percolated in the US south for decades, and travelled to the Bahamas and back eventually, giving it two distinct musical branches. How critical details of the story were forgotten. The earliest versions of the song make no reference to Houston’s or Delia’s age, so a powerful dramatic element of the story was never exploited by generations of singers. How references to race were subtly dropped as the years went by. “Cooney” eventually becomes “Cutty” or “Curtis” or “Tony.” And you appreciate how popular culture can reproduce sexism and misogyny. Every version of the song I’ve heard is sung from Houston’s perspective. Delia is never given a voice. The poor girl’s dead, murdered by her immature boyfriend, and all we hear are complaints from the boy about how he’s in jail and lost all his friends. Delia is often described as a gambler, or a prostitute. Dylan’s version of the song, released in 1993, is a special one. He discovered pathos in the story that had long been forgotten. He starts his retelling with a well-worn but inventive description of Delia: Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around, Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down. He then anchors every verse with the refrain “All the friends I ever had are gone”, which doesn’t make sense at the beginning of the song, but which clicks towards the end when you realise the refrain is being sung by Curtis – from prison. We hear about the grief of Delia’s parents, about Curtis’s paranoia about being spotted by people in the street, about Curtis’s hatred of people richer and classier than him. And we can’t avoid his murderous jealousy. Delia, oh Delia, how can it be? You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me. All the friends I ever had are gone Curtis is a pathetic figure. Delia never stood a chance. It affects me every time I listen to it. Do you have a story about the moment of discovery when a pastime became a passion?

The breach, which opens up free backdoor access to company search histories, including by investigative journalists and finance industry professionals, remained live on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission site on Wednesday night. Asic was alerted to the problem 12 days ago and it is understood that its legal team has been considering a response. The breach involves a new feature on Asic’s online registry which is intended to allow users to search its database for information on companies. But the page showing the link to “Search ASIC’s registers for companies, business names, documents and more” leads to another page where anyone can retrieve details of another person’s search history simply by entering the person’s email and a date range. No other verifying information is required. It also enables them to bypass the paywall to easily download company documents the other person has paid for. A businessman who discovered the breach was able to trace searches by Guardian journalists and employees of private equity firms that are involved in buying stockmarket-listed companies. The businessman, who asked not to be named, said the breach opened potential for an inadvertent form of insider trading, or the use of undisclosed material information relating to public companies. “Concerningly, we got to a few private equity firms, some people that we know are looking at acquisitions of public companies, and we can see the searches they make,” he said. “So you could in theory realise that public company X is looking at acquiring private company Y because suddenly they’re all over it. “This has an obvious implication for investigative journalists and there’s also a potential issue with insider trading as one could look up a mergers and acquisitions department’s email addresses and retrieve companies which publicly listed entities are looking up.” The businessman first contacted Asic about the breach on 27 October. He said he took an Asic staffer through the steps to retrieve other people’s search records and “they acknowledged this was wrong verbally”. He had followed up four times with the regulator since, including on 3 November when “they told me their legal team are looking in to it and would contact me this week”. Asic’s failure to close down the loophole after almost a fortnight prompted him to contact the Guardian, he said. The Guardian confirmed user records remained compromised as of 7pm on Wednesday. Phil Green, the Queensland privacy commissioner, said if the breach remained open 12 days after Asic was first alerted, “that’s cause for concern for people who are affected”. “Ideally they would have acted more expediently because the risks seem high – but I don’t know all the facts,” Green told the Guardian. “The federal privacy commissioner has guidelines for good practice in this situation which seem to be applicable.” Tim Buckley, an energy industry analyst formerly of Citibank, said it was a “ludicrous” situation and a sign of “sheer incompetence by Asic”. He said the issue appeared to be more about a privacy breach and a potential “source of mischief” in private business than a likely trigger for illegal insider trading involving stockmarket listed companies. The Asic register only contains unlisted companies, although “the fact someone’s looking at is a signal that might have flow-on implications for another listed company”, Buckley said. “It’s still appalling they have that loophole.” One insolvency practitioner told the Guardian he was shocked at the breach, saying the regulator’s company search facility was used by “liquidators, lawyers, finance companies, insurance companies – everyone”. The businessman who discovered the breach said he dealt with start-up companies, which led him to use the Asic register “all the time to make inquiries around potential acquisitions, etcetera”. He realised there was a problem after using his email address to access Asic’s retrieve history feature, which had been introduced several months earlier. “I thought, hang on a second – how does it know who I am?” Neither Asic nor the office of the Australian information commissioner responded to queries. It comes just months ahead of a new scheme that will force government agencies and businesses to report certain data breaches under the federal Privacy Act. From 22 February, organisations will have to notify and give advice to any person who is likely to be at risk of serious harm by a data breach, as well as the information commissioner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/08/danica-roem-virginia-first-transgender-person-elected-state-legislature","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T16:41:35Z","webTitle":"Virginia elects transgender woman to state legislature","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/08/danica-roem-virginia-first-transgender-person-elected-state-legislature","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/08/danica-roem-virginia-first-transgender-person-elected-state-legislature","fields":{"headline":"Virginia elects transgender woman to state legislature","bodyText":"A transgender Virginia politician has been elected to the state legislature, unseating one of the state’s longest serving and most socially conservative lawmakers. The Democrat Danica Roem, a former journalist for the Gainesville Times, beat the Republican Bob Marshall, who sponsored a bill this year that would have required transgender people to use bathrooms corresponding with the sex on their birth certificate. David Toscano, the Democratic leader in Virginia’s house of delegates, said: “It’s historic ... It sends a message to politicians everywhere that the politics of bigotry is over.” In a good night for diversity in US politics, Andrea Jenkins clinched the ward eight Minneapolis city council seat, becoming the first transgender person to win such a seat in a major city, and Ravinder Bhalla became the first Sikh mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey, despite an aggressive campaign that turned ugly when he was labelled a terrorist in flyers. Overall, Democrats did well in key contests on Tuesday night. Ralph Northam decisively beat Ed Gillespie in the Virginia governor race, and in New Jersey, Phil Murphy romped to victory against the state’s incumbent lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno. Roem will be the first transgender member of the house of delegates and the second trans woman to be elected to a statehouse. Althea Garrison, a black woman who won as a Republican in Massachusetts in 1993, was the first. Roem discussed her gender identity during the campaign, but focused more on jobs, schools and northern Virginia’s traffic congestion. The Democrat underwent therapy to begin her gender transition when she was 28, and said in an interview earlier this year that politics should be inclusive of all. “No matter what you look like, where you come from, how you worship or who you love, if you have good public policy ideas, if you’re qualified for office, you have every right to bring your ideas to the table,” Roem said. Roem also argued that Marshall, who has served in the House since 1992, spent too much time on social policy. He was the author of a now-void constitutional amendment that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, and sponsored a bill banning gay people from openly serving in the Virginia national guard. Roem has played in a heavy metal band, Cab Ride Home, since 2006. The quintet, with Roem roaring vocals over high-speed, chugging guitars, has independently released four albums, supported metal bands such as Cannibal Corpse and Amon Amarth, and toured the UK in 2012. The band describe their style as “drunken thrash metal” and say on their Bandcamp page: “Cab Ride Home represents one thing: partying ... Our songs are about drinking and our shows are about raging.” “Just because I sing in a heavy metal band while spinning my head in circles and getting paid to do it, why can’t I run for government?” Roem told Noisey earlier this year. “[Metal is] not just what you listen to in your car on the way home.

Tim Martin said warnings from companies such as Sainsbury’s and Whitbread about the risks of a “no deal” Brexit were “factually incorrect and highly misleading”. “The misinformation from directors and trade organisations seems to be designed to support the view that staying in the EU for an additional two years is necessary to avoid a ‘cliff edge’,” Martin said. “There is no cliff edge. Wetherspoon is ready now to leave the EU, since almost no preparation is required – as is almost certainly the case for Sainsbury’s and Whitbread, and the vast majority of companies,” he added. Martin, a vocal Brexit supporter in the run-up to the EU referendum said it was false to claim that no deal would result in higher food and drink prices. He said it would actually knock 3.5p off the price of a Wetherspoon meal, and 0.5p off a pint. “The lowest food prices can be obtained by the UK, without the need for the agreement or consent of any third party, by avoiding a ‘transitional deal’ – which would keep EU tariffs in place – and leaving the EU in March 2019,” Martin said. “This would enable the UK to scrap EU food tariffs, as permitted under World Trade Organisation rules, on food imported from outside the EU. Under WTO rules, tariffs would not then be charged on imports from the EU either.” Last week the National Institute Economic Review warned that UK shopping bills would rise sharply if Britain walks away from Brexit talks without a trade deal. It predicted that the cost of European imports would jump if the UK fell back on World Trade Organisation rules. Martin made the comments as Wetherspoon reported a 6.1% increase in like-for-like sales – stripping out sales at pubs opened in the last year – for the first quarter. Total sales for the 13 weeks to 29 October were up 4.3%. Martin said the company had had a positive start to the year, but warned that costs had been significantly higher than last year, with further increases expected in areas including labour, business rates, utilities and sugar taxes. Mark Brumby, an analyst at Langton Capital, said: “The group is a superlative operator and, with Mr Martin’s views on Brexit well known, the company is likely to continue to pull out all the stops to show that Brexit and the uncertainty that surrounds it will not prevent it from reporting good numbers.” Wall Street banks do not share Martin’s relaxed view about Brexit, though. According to the Financial Times, they told the US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross that jobs will soon start to shift out of the City, unless there is more clarity about Britain’s future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/10/nigel-pearson-interview-leuven-belgium-leicester-ostrich","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T16:52:00Z","webTitle":"Nigel Pearson: ‘Would I do one or two things differently?

Yeah, of course’","bodyText":"It is a beautiful autumnal morning at OH Leuven’s training ground, the sunshine beaming down over the top of the trees that flank the practice pitches as eight men, one woman and a black labrador watch Nigel Pearson’s players put through their paces. Give it a few more weeks and OH Leuven’s coach will probably know the spectators by name. “Normally I’d spend five minutes having a chat with them,” says Pearson, smiling. “They were a bit down this morning, on the crest of a slump, bless them.” Back in work since the end of September after the best part of a year in the wilderness – quite literally in one respect given that some of it was spent walking the 87-mile Ridgeway Path that stretches from Wiltshire to Buckinghamshire – Pearson is anything but downbeat. Managing abroad for the first time in his career has put a spring in his step as he pulls up a chair in the canteen to discuss everything from Brexit and beer to ostriches and open training. “I find it quite amusing that it’s feasible that your opponents can have somebody watching you,” says Pearson, chuckling. Perhaps most strikingly of all, the 54-year-old looks and sounds like a man who has rediscovered, via the modest but welcoming surroundings of a Belgian second division club, just how much football means to him. “That’s what this has done for me; if I was questioning whether I had fallen out of love with the game, then maybe this has given me a bit of perspective back on that,” Pearson says. “There’s a realism to it here, a humility.” Working at OH Leuven, where the average attendance is around 4,500 and the players share a drink with the supporters after a match, has been liberating in that sense. “When I first saw that, it just made me smile,” Pearson says. “It’s fantastic. The way football has evolved in some of the bigger leagues in the world, you’d have to say there has become a bigger distance between the contact that you have, for everybody really. It’s quite refreshing actually to experience something as simplistic as enjoying winning a game, and the players and the fans being together.” Pearson has always fancied a stint overseas, yet he could never have imagined his opportunity would come about in this way. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Leicester’s chairman, had not spoken to Pearson since firing him in 2015 after their relationship broke down in the wake of an unsavoury incident on an end-of-season tour in Thailand, where the manager’s son, James, was one of three players sacked for taking part in filmed sex acts with local women. A little more than two years later, and not long after completing a takeover at OH Leuven, Srivaddhanaprabha was at the other end of the phone again – this time with a job offer. “It did come very much out of the blue,” Pearson says. “I had some contact with the owners and they asked me if I’d like to meet up and discuss the possibility of coming out here, and I said: ‘Why not?’ It was done in quite a low-key way because I think what was going to be important for myself and Vichai, especially with what had happened with the Leicester situation, was just to do it between us. There will be a number of people out there who might be slightly taken by surprise by the fact that we’re working together again, albeit in different circumstances. But I think there was an element of that which made it even more attractive.” In between working for Leicester and OH Leuven, Pearson had an unhappy five-month stint at Derby County that ended with him departing by mutual consent after a furious row with Mel Morris, the club’s owner. “I think all I can say about that is that it was a bad choice by me and it was a bad choice by them probably,” Pearson says. “We all make decisions which turn out to be not necessarily the right ones, but this feels a lot more like what I’m looking for. It’s got a different feel, there are possibilities here, and I think it’s a stimulus that I need.” Football is not the be-all and end-all for Pearson, who seems to disappear from the game whenever he is out of work. He gives the impression that he would prefer to be trekking across the countryside for days on end, losing himself on national trails, rather than in a TV studio as a pundit, which he describes as “just not my scene”. Although he remains good friends with Steve Walsh and Craig Shakespeare, his former assistants at Leicester, Pearson gives an interesting insight into his personality when he explains why the other two see each other more. “I like my own space and they’re more gregarious people – I think that would be a fair way of putting it,” he says. Critical self-analysis appears to come easy to a man who has been involved in his fair share of scrapes in the dugout. Honest and candid about mistakes he has made in the past, Pearson acknowledges that the pressurised world of football management “brings out the best of me and the worst of me as well”. “I’ve been in a few tangles in my time,” he says. “And a lot of them have been of my own making because of how I feel I need to protect the people I’m working with – that is the players. And if sometimes that manifests itself into doing rather strange things then, yeah … I have to accept the trouble I’ve got into. A lot of it has been either decisions I’ve made, or probably not thought long and hard enough about. But that’s what it is. “When I say it brings the worst out of me, it doesn’t matter where and at what level you work, if you are totally committed to doing something, what you have to accept is that some of the trade-off for getting a buzz out of doing what you do is that it can be all-consuming, and that can be detrimental to your health and sometimes your behaviour and how you interact with people, because I can be very, very intense in those sorts of situations. Part and parcel of trying to understand and recognise your strengths and weaknesses is to be brutally honest with how you reflect on what you are yourself. I can’t fundamentally change what I am. But if you said to me: ‘Would you do one or two things differently?’ Yeah, of course I would. But anybody can say that.” The night that Pearson called a journalist an ostrich springs to mind and it is arguably one of the first things people think of whenever his name is mentioned these days. “I can’t do anything about that, so there’s no point worrying about it. And if that is how people remember me,” Pearson says, breaking into laughter, “then I’ve probably not done very much in the game, have I?” His track record suggests otherwise. As well as enjoying a distinguished playing career, Pearson won the League One and Championship titles as Leicester’s manager across two separate spells, and masterminded the remarkable great escape that culminated in the club winning seven of their last nine matches to survive in the Premier League in 2015. In Pearson’s eyes, however, his greatest achievement at Leicester was building a new team after “dismantling a side that didn’t function” when he replaced Sven-Goran Eriksson in 2011. Shakespeare was his assistant in those days and Pearson hopes that his former No2 will “be bitten by the bug” despite being sacked only four months after his appointment as Leicester manager. “I was really disappointed for him,” Pearson says. “But there’s no damage done to his reputation, so he’ll be fine. And your earning power as a manager is considerable compared to being a coach, so it’s hardly been a bad experience for him. He’ll have learned an awful lot and he’ll have a bit more money in the bank than he would have done – and good for him on that.” For Pearson right now the primary focus is on adapting to his new life in Belgium. The fact that everyone speaks English is a huge help, and keeping in touch with his family should be easier once the internet is connected at his apartment in nearby Ottenburg. As for Leuven, which is less than half an hour on the train from Brussels, Pearson smiles when it is pointed out to him that as well as having a reputation for being a vibrant student city, it also happens to be the home of Stella Artois. “It’s interesting, because it’s the weakest beer I’ve drunk here,” he says, laughing. His expression is rather different when asked how an Englishman working abroad feels about Brexit. “I’m a remain man. Absolutely. I think it’s a travesty, personally,” Pearson says. “It’s all right for the Scots and the Welsh to say that they’re Scots and Welsh. But I’m an English-European. I don’t agree with it [Brexit]. I was bloody annoyed, if I’m honest.” Getting out of the Belgian second tier seems only marginally more straightforward than exiting the European Union. There are only eight clubs in the division and the season is split into two separate tournaments, with the winners meeting in a two-leg promotion play-off. There are also relegation and Europa League play-offs based on an aggregate table. “To guarantee automatic promotion you need to win both halves of the season, so clearly we can’t do that,” says Pearson, whose team are about to start the second 14-game tournament after finishing runners-up in the first. “Last season Lierse were the side that won the most points overall and they didn’t go up. It is complex but there’s no point getting bogged down with all that.” Not when life in Belgium is ticking so many other boxes for Pearson. He smiles. “I was asked by somebody: ‘Are you still ambitious?’ I replied: ‘Yeah.’ So they said: ‘What are you doing here then?’ People will have their opinions about the level of football – ‘Why there?’ – but there’s more to it than just football. For me it’s very much a case of embracing the whole idea of being involved in a different culture. It’s been a very refreshing experience and I suppose it’s what I needed as well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"law/2017/nov/10/uk-humiliated-as-international-court-election-goes-to-runoff","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T11:18:30Z","webTitle":"UK humiliated as international court election goes to runoff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/nov/10/uk-humiliated-as-international-court-election-goes-to-runoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/nov/10/uk-humiliated-as-international-court-election-goes-to-runoff","fields":{"headline":"UK humiliated as international court election goes to runoff","bodyText":"The UK’s candidate for the international court of justice (ICJ), Sir Christopher Greenwood, has been forced into a run-off election for the final remaining place on the court, in a humiliating blow to British diplomatic prestige at the United Nations. After five rounds of simultaneous voting in the security council and the general assembly in New York, four other judges from Brazil, Lebanon, France and Somalia were all elected to what is known as the “world court” in The Hague. Greenwood, who has already served one nine-year term on the court, now faces an Indian candidate, Dalveer Bhandari, in a battle for the last place on the ICJ when voting resumes late on Monday. There will be a weekend of intense lobbying by diplomats at the UN to secure their candidate’s position. There has always been a British judge on the court since it was established in 1946. It hears disputes over sovereignty and international borders from around the world. Losing a British presence on the court would be an international political embarrassment. During voting in the general assembly on Thursday evening, support for Greenwood progressively seeped away. In the first round he secured the support of 147 countries; by the fifth round he was down to only 76 votes, fewer than half of the states in the assembly. The vote will be interpreted as a blow to the UK’s international standing post-Brexit and demonstrates the increasingly limited diplomatic influence wielded by the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, at the UN. Greenwood, who is in his early 60s, was previously professor of international law at the London School of Economics. His most controversial public role was in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. He was instructed by the then attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, to examine the arguments over the legality of using force against Saddam Hussein and concluded that the use of force was justified. To be elected, any candidate must obtain a majority of 97 votes or more in the UN general assembly and also a majority of eight votes in the security council. Voting will continue until five candidates have obtained the required majorities. Greenwood, who did win a narrow majority in the UN security council, may yet scrape through in Monday’s vote. His rival, Bhandari, secured 115 votes in the general assembly but failed to obtain a majority in the security council. At the time of his appointment in 2008, the then foreign secretary, David Miliband, described Greenwood as being “highly respected within the international legal community, and an outstanding academic and practitioner of international law”. The other judges elected by the UN on Thursday evening were Ronny Abraham of France, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf of Somalia, Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade of Brazil and Nawaf Salam of Lebanon. It is the second setback for the UK at the UN in recent months. In a separate vote at the UN general assembly last June the UK was defeated by 94 states to 15 when a Mauritian-backed resolution questioning the disputed legal status of the UK’s hold over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean was referred to the ICJ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2017/nov/10/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27346","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T12:00:18Z","webTitle":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,346","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2017/nov/10/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27346","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2017/nov/10/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27346","fields":{"headline":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,346","bodyText":"A adjudges AD(vertisement) + (Book of) JUDGES B Barbie doll BAR BI  LL C Camelot CA  T D defence D(esperat)E/FENCE E Erebus (dir)E/REBUS F fain FA(g)IN G genius loci CLUES GO IN 1 (anag) H Honiton HO  ON [Honiton lace; Geoff Hoon, ex-Defence Minister] I iodine 10 dine [atomic no 53] J jolt JO&lt;(meta)L&gt;T K ketch (s)KETCH [Jack Ketch, executioner] L Lebanon LE  AN ON M meld cryptic def [Spice Girl following Mel B and Mel C?] N note wheN radiO broadcasT + certitudE [do, re, mi etc] O oil slick OIL (painting) + SLICK [dark film on water] P Porterhouse Blue PORTER/HOUSE/BLUE [Tom Sharpe novel] Q quantum QUAN(go)/TUM(my) R recitalist REALISTIC (anag) + (stun)T S Sherman S(pineless)/HERMAN [General William Sherman] T toilet seat ELIOT (rev) + STATE (anag) [George Eliot] U urinal UR  AL [Ural River] V violence L(abour) in ONE (anag) in VICE W what’s the big idea?

Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover and Deal, who had the party whip withdrawn on 3 November, said in a highly charged speech to party members that the Tories’ handling of reports of misconduct was “a mess”. Elphicke was suspended amid a flurry of accusations against MPs across the political spectrum concerning sexual harassment. His comments come as the Welsh Labour party faces scrutiny over its handling of allegations against Welsh cabinet member Carl Sargeant, who took his own life two days after allegations of sexual misconduct emerged. In a speech delivered on Thursday night to the executive of the Dover and Deal Conservative Association at a meeting in Deal, Elphicke said: “Let me say some things about the way our party has handled this. First, I want to echo what the Labour MP Chris Bryant has said: if this fortnight teaches anything it is there must be a fair proper process for those who feel they have been harassed or abused, and fair due process for those facing allegations. “I think that’s spot-on. The fact is that this whole area of reporting misconduct and managing allegations of misconduct is a mess. I have every sympathy with people who have been harassed or victimised and feel they have nowhere to turn. That is a denial of justice. “It is also a denial of justice when people who have had allegations made against them, lose their job or their party whip without knowing what those allegations are. I believe this is fundamentally wrong. Wrong because it’s an injustice to those who stand accused, but also wrong because it undermines our values as a country.” Elphicke insisted he was still unaware of the details of the allegations and they were first brought to his attention by a journalist. “I received a call from a journalist just after 9pm on Friday evening saying he had heard I was having the whip withdrawn in time for the 10 O’Clock News and asked me what was going on,” he said. “I said I had absolutely no idea.” Minutes later, Elphicke said, the chief whip called and told him “serious allegations” had been made and he was to be suspended. He added: “Finally let me say that whatever it turns out I stand accused of, I deny any criminal wrongdoing.” Elphicke had the whip withdrawn 48 hours after the former defence secretary Michael Fallon quit following sexual harassment allegations. Two other Tories – including the first secretary of state, Damian Green – face Cabinet Office inquiries. Three more are reportedly under investigation by the Conservative party’s disciplinary board. Within Labour, MPs Kelvin Hopkins, Clive Lewis and Ivan Lewis have all faced allegations. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has said those accused of misconduct should be given support while allegations are investigated. At an event with students at Queen Mary University of London, Bercow said: “In terms of protection of the frailties of the accused, I think that’s incredibly important in light of what has happened in Wales, but it was predictable. “Even if people are suspected of wrongdoing, they may well need, and should be given help, understanding, support.” He added: “If a member is going to be sacked or denied the whip of his or her party, for God’s sake that member is entitled to know of what he or she is accused.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/10/british-surfer-andrew-cotton-breaks-back-huge-wave-portugal","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T07:55:33Z","webTitle":"British surfer breaks his back riding huge wave in Portugal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/10/british-surfer-andrew-cotton-breaks-back-huge-wave-portugal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/10/british-surfer-andrew-cotton-breaks-back-huge-wave-portugal","fields":{"headline":"British surfer breaks his back riding huge wave in Portugal","bodyText":"A British surfer has broken his back after falling off his board while riding a huge wave.

This occurs while racist taunts, threats and outright violence are directed at racial minorities on a daily basis. The harassment of Labor senator Sam Dastyari this week in that regard is nothing but banal and ordinary, except for its intended impact on him and “those like him”. When minorities watch such videos, they don’t experience shock, they experience a sense of recognition and dread about when they might be next. This is the desired effect of uploading the video; it is less a display of power to white Australia and more a display of threat to potential victims. Dastyari, in the video of his victimisation and harassment, notes a number of times that he is often harassed by white nationalists who follow him around the country; racism is never spontaneous, it is always a considered act designed to intimidate and silence. The labels of “terrorist” and “monkey” – the desire to denigrate and humiliate Dastyari, almost come second to his being made an example of by being videoed. Acts of racism, even when they target individuals, are, ultimately, intended to target the social group. Here there are multiple groups being targeted, Muslims and migrants. The video doesn’t render the daily discriminations that minorities face. It shows nothing of the structural racisms that limit and thwart everything from legal rights to employment prospects to mortality rates for racial minorities. However, it does reveal, and viscerally so, the freedom racists now have to express their hate, but not how we arrived at this point. Dastyari explained this as being about white racist nationalism and the political messaging coming from our federal parliament. But the reality of this racism is better demonstrated by senator Pauline Hanson, when she minimises and negates the violence against Dastyari by suggesting he is a “big boy”, and then apportions him equal responsibility for his victimisation as his perpetrators by suggesting that he was using the incident to sell his book. It is important here not to allow for the deflection that both the perpetrators and Hanson are peddling. While only Dastyari can speak to his experience, what occurred to him was deeply threatening to both one’s sense of physical and psychological integrity. From watching the video, it appeared designed to scare him and belittle him publicly. He was at more than one point surrounded by a group of men acting in a very intimidating manner. The senator may have felt able to contend with the situation, but many of us would have been terrified and profoundly affected by the experience. There is also the more obvious point that he should not have to contend with the situation, nor be a “big boy” whatever that might mean. The prime minister stated that there is zero tolerance for racism in Australia. There is a sense that he does not quite know the country he presides over. We are a multicultural society, but that is the problem for racists. Neither can he acknowledge, publicly at least, the role of his fellow politicians in the last two decades in encouraging and treating as respectable overt expressions and acts of racism. Perhaps, he, like many of us, cannot quite focus on who we are as a nation and how it is core to who we are. It is not only that in the act of turning away we pretend to not see, we also lie to ourselves about who we are and what racism is. Racism is not a random expression of prejudice and menacing buffoonery by the fringes of society or by the white disenfranchised class. It is a system in which all parts of society are engaged. It is about power and domination that is exercised through a complex set of social and political strategies. Whenever an act of racist violence is enacted, understand that the perpetrator knows that he/she has the tacit approval of his society. The video of Dastyari’s harassment reflects how societies, by design or default, collude with racism, discrimination and racist violence through failure to appropriately contend with perpetrators or by failing to adequately protect victims. Australian society provides the framework, both cultural and ideological, in which the marginalisation, domination and degradation of minorities is possible; a framework that ultimately asserts that this nation belongs to white Australians.

Ten years later, hearts and minds are yet to be won. The Prevent strategy (2011) and the subsequent Prevent duty (2015) – whereby public authorities are required to have “due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism” – have instead become a “significant source of grievance” among students, teachers, academics, human rights groups and broader civil society, encouraging “mistrust to spread and to fester”. In a year when we have suffered a series of terror threats, it is clear we need a counter-radicalisation strategy that is effective and has the trust of our entire society. The Home Office’s latest attempt to reverse the loss of trust over the past decade, therefore, is very welcome. In a new report, it has opened a small door into the inner workings of Prevent: who is doing the referring, what happens to those referred, who is being referred and for what reason? There are, of course, significant limitations in the data provided: the lack of any faith or ethnicity indicators, age categorisation that does not allow one to distinguish between nursery, primary, secondary and tertiary education, and a limited data split explaining which groups had no action taken or were signposted to alternative services. In addition, case studies of most categories are sorely lacking – how, where and why are so many young children being referred to Prevent by the police? Notwithstanding these limitations, the transparency has added to the evidence base, bringing with it useful insights, the ability to challenge and ultimately greater accountability. For example, we can see that “Islamist” extremism makes up 65% (4,997 people) of all Prevent referrals – down from 70% in 2015 – and “extreme rightwing” extremism makes up 10% (759 people), down from 15% in 2015. Crunching the numbers, this means that Muslims have an approximate 1 in 500 chance of having been referred to Prevent last year, approximately 40 times more likely than someone who is not a Muslim. The threat, quantified by the number of terror arrests, is approximately five times greater from “Islamist” terrorism compared to “extreme rightwing” terrorism. This may explain concern from Muslim communities who feel disproportionately and unfairly targeted by Prevent. This concern is only magnified when we see that despite the claim that the Prevent duty is solely about safeguarding, it is not applicable in Northern Ireland, even though the MI5 threat rating for Northern Ireland-related terrorism is the same as from international terrorism. A government official is reported to have told Gavin Robinson MP: “Don’t push the issue too far. It is really a counter-Islamic strategy,” after he asked why Northern Ireland was not included. The only non-discriminatory reasons for not applying the Prevent duty in Northern Ireland are either that it has a better system or due to the sectarianism inherent within communities, which would mean, for example, that a Protestant teacher wrongly referring an innocent Catholic child to Prevent might be deeply counter-productive. Yet in the UK, the idea of referring innocent Muslims is not deemed to be equally counter-productive. A significantly smaller proportion of those referred for “Islamist” extremism are actually acted upon (16% are discussed at an early intervention multi-agency programme – a Channel panel; 5% receive Channel support), compared to “extreme rightwing” extremism (25% and 13% respectively), suggesting an over-referral for “Islamist” extremism. It is possible that some of this is due to them actually being signposted to other agencies, but the data is not publicly available to test that hypothesis. Some flag-bearers of Prevent may claim that there is no real over-referring and in fact, the overall proportion of those referred with no action taken (37%), compares favourably to other forms of safeguarding (35%). However, this does not explain why a smaller proportion of “Islamist” extremists referred to Prevent are discussed at a Channel panel, compared with “extreme rightwing” extremists. The assertion that Muslim communities appear to be at the forefront of reporting terrorism, is also supported by the data, as a higher proportion of referrals come from community, friends and family for “Islamist” extremism (10%) as opposed to “extreme rightwing” extremism (5%). The biggest concern among many, including Conservative MP Lucy Allan, is how the Prevent duty is affecting education, undermining trust between teachers and pupils. The new statistics show that these represent a third of all referrals – forming the greatest source of Prevent referrals. Half of these are under the age of 15, meaning that more than 2,000 young children in a one-year period have been referred to Prevent. What this means is that teachers considered these children as having exhibited signs of radicalisation and that these children will have a permanent note on their record to that effect, even though they did not require further support. It is possible that some of these were signposted to other support services, but the data is not broken down to provide that information. The over-referral of Muslims, the apparent disproportionate targeting of Muslims and the focus on young children are not just issues with the implementation but appear to be part and parcel of the design of Prevent. Why else would Ofsted use the example of a “hidden Qur’an in a child’s bedroom” as a very clear sign of radicalisation? Why else would there be no real concern by the Home Office when Bob Blackman, an MP, hosts an anti-Muslim extremist in the House of Commons citing the freedom to discuss views – a freedom not provided to universities for “Islamist” speakers? Why else would there be a “crackdown on free speech” when it comes to issues of interest to Muslims, such as when a Palestinian Society was forced to cancel the appearance of an academic in a discussion about boycotting, divestment and sanctions against Israel – a requirement not made of pro-Israel talks? While there are clearly some community-based Prevent initiatives that have had a positive impact, and individual success stories that have understandably been promoted by the Home Office, there is little doubt that there are serious, legitimate questions about the Prevent strategy, which the latest figures corroborate. Let’s regain trust and win the hearts and minds of Britons across all communities. Let’s have an independent review of Prevent. • Miqdaad Versi, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, is writing in a personal capacity"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business-to-business/2017/nov/28/the-green-van-gogh-cleaning-up-the-cityscape","type":"article","sectionId":"business-to-business","sectionName":"Business to business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T07:30:02Z","webTitle":"'Cities have become machines that kill people': the Dutch inventor fighting smog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2017/nov/28/the-green-van-gogh-cleaning-up-the-cityscape","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business-to-business/2017/nov/28/the-green-van-gogh-cleaning-up-the-cityscape","fields":{"headline":"'Cities have become machines that kill people': the Dutch inventor fighting smog","bodyText":"When Daan Roosegaarde wanted to pump Oxford Street air into a London museum to demonstrate the life-limiting effects of pollution, health and safety officers refused to give him permission. “You would see a sign saying that if you were in this room for one hour, it would take away 15 minutes of your life,” the Dutch inventor and artist explains from his studio in Rotterdam. “The health and safety regulator letters we got then, you don’t want to know! Indoors, there are rules, laws and inspectors, but outdoors nobody cares.” Roosegaarde is behind an award-winning smog-filtering tower, and an anti-smog bicycle that works by sucking in smog and releasing purified air in a cloud around the cyclist. These inventions are part of his studio’s Smog-Free Project to reduce pollution in cities. Roosegaarde is not alone in his desire to tackle smog. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth are taking the British government to court for a third time for illegal air pollution rates, Delhi has seen a public health emergency declared because of smog levels, and the Lancet estimates air pollution caused 6.4 million premature deaths in 2015. Motivated by a general fascination with the world and “irritation” at the status quo on air pollution, the 38-year-old Roosegaarde has an obsessive passion for inventing things to improve the natural environment. This passion has earned him the title of young global leader at the World Economic Forum, a visiting professorship at Tongji University in Shanghai and a library full of awards. “When pollution becomes physical, maybe I can use that to design with,” he muses. “Like Van Gogh has paint, maybe I have my small particles.” He found his environmental calling on a trip to Beijing, one of China’s most polluted cities. “I was looking out from my room in Beijing four years ago,” he says. “On a good day, I could see the world around me, and three days later I couldn’t see the other side of the street. We live six years shorter, children have lung cancer … cities have become machines that kill people.” He invested €1.2m, two years and the combined energies of a 12-strong team to come up with a solution. His memory of playing as a bored child at parties with the static energy generated by balloons inspired the idea of using positive ionisation to build “the largest smog vacuum cleaner in the world” for the dangerous tiny PM2.5 and PM10 particles that make up smog. To generate cash, his studio compressed the soot they were collecting into black diamond-like rings and invited the public to purchase them through a Kickstarter campaign that raised €113,153. With Bob Ursem, a nanoparticles expert at the Delft University of Technology, and Dutch company ENS Technology, he developed a seven-metre air purifying tower, which was opened in 2015 by the mayor of Rotterdam. Roosegaarde was invited to Beijing to build a tower there in September 2016. His studio has now sold the country rights for it to the Chinese environmental technology company Film Method Works, which he says is now manufacturing hundreds of the towers for China. There has been some debate about the tower’s effectiveness, however: the China Forum of Environmental Journalists published an assessment of the Beijing trial run, concluding that the tower is limited in scope and its effect on PM2.5 levels was “unstable”. But Studio Roosegaarde has commissioned a study – yet to be published – by Dr Bert Blocken of Eindhoven University of Technology, which has reportedly found that the tower captures and removes up to 70% of the PM10, and up to 50% of the PM2.5 particle. Blocken told the Guardian: “The tower has an effect, but it is very local as it is also just a local instrument.” Protoypes of Roosegaarde’s anti-smog bicycles are due out later this year, and he says he is working on agreements with governments in India, Colombia, Mexico and Poland to launch his smog-filtering towers and bikes in 2018. His other projects include an energy-harvesting kite, windvogel, that can generate up to 100kW in strong wind, and the glowing lines pilot initiative to light up highways. This uses road markings that absorb the sun’s energy and glow for up to eight hours. Roosegaarde says he has also been invited to advise on a new smart highway programme in the UK. Although half of his work is self-commissioned, industry and government partnerships are essential – but not without hazards. “Entrepreneurs realise that advertising with logos isn’t working any more and are looking for social engagement,” says Roosegaarde. “We had one of the biggest oil companies in the world coming to us and offering €2m for the Smog-Free Project. We said: ‘Look at your portfolio: that’s greenwashing.’” He sees his role as a conscientious activator: “Government should have a long-term vision for clean air and clean energy, NGOs should tickle the status quo as much as possible. I can design a clean air park. Will it solve a whole city? No. But step by step, I can design and engineer. I’m not going to wait for government – you see in the US the regime changes and we go back. It’s too fragile.” Similarly, consuming less isn’t the answer. “A lot of the sustainability movement has been about less waste, less showering, and I don’t feel comfortable with that. It’s about setting a new value and accepting the consequences, which is maybe more electric cars, or not buying that one thing, or designing smarter things. You can fly less, or build smarter aeroplanes: we should do more, not less.” So what next for this man who likens himself to a kind of cleaner – a “schoonmaker” in Dutch? Space waste, of course. “Right now there are 23,000 objects of about 10cm floating in space,” he says. “It’s the smog of the universe, created by us. And if we continue, [it] will get worse until we cannot launch satellites any more.” The office in his studio is equipped with a “yes, but” chair, which gives people a mild electric shock if they say these words when sitting on it. So it’s probably wise not to argue with Roosegaarde’s mission to scrub up cities, the skies and even the universe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2017/nov/10/what-more-can-be-done-to-engage-girls-in-school-sports","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T16:36:24Z","webTitle":"What more can be done to engage girls in school sports?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/10/what-more-can-be-done-to-engage-girls-in-school-sports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2017/nov/10/what-more-can-be-done-to-engage-girls-in-school-sports","fields":{"headline":"What more can be done to engage girls in school sports?","bodyText":"New research from Women in Sport, in partnership with the Youth Sport Trust, shows girls still turn away from school sports in high numbers.

The telecoms regulator, Ofcom, said that the new scheme – which will make providers pay automatically for slow repairs, missed appointments and delayed installations – could result in customers receiving a total of £142m a year in payouts. Currently, providers pay out only about £16m a year to customers who make complaints about repairs, installations and engineer visits. If a broadband connection or landline is not fully fixed after two working days the provider will have to pay £8 a day until it is repaired. The payment will be £25 if an engineer does not turn up for an appointment or cancels with less than 24 hours’ notice. Should a provider fail to start a service on a particular date it would have to pay £5 for each day of delay, including the missed start date. Customers will receive the compensation as a credit on their account. “Waiting too long for your landline or broadband to be fixed is frustrating enough without having to fight for compensation,” said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom’s consumer group director. “So providers will have to pay back automatically whenever repairs or installations don’t happen on time, or an engineer doesn’t turn up. People will get the money they deserve, while providers will want to work harder to improve their service.” Ofcom said many people are not getting the standard of service they expect, or are not being adequately compensated when service falls short. At present, compensation is paid out in only about 15% of cases where providers have failed to meet their obligations, working out at a meagre £3.69 average per day of loss of service, and £2.39 per day for delayed installations. Following a review and consultation with the industry, Ofcom has beefed up the payment levels to “reflect the harm consumers suffer when things go wrong”. “We are pleased that compensation for poor broadband is going to become automatic, as it is now such an essential part of all of our everyday lives,” said Alex Neill, managing director of home services at Which? “For all consumers to get what they are entitled to it is vital that all providers play fair and sign up to this scheme.” Ofcom said that BT, Sky, TalkTalk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet, which together account for about 90% of landline and broadband customers in the UK, have agreed to introduce the automatic compensation scheme. It is understood that Plusnet and EE have also indicated that they intend to join the scheme. Other broadband providers including Vodafone and O2 have not signed up to the scheme. Ofcom’s research shows that 5.7 million consumers experience a loss of landline or broadband service each year. Engineers fail to turn up to around 250,000 appointments a year and about 1.3 million people are affected by late installations. Ofcom said it will take 15 months to implement the automatic compensation scheme because of the complexity of providers’ having to change their billing systems, online accounts and call centres. The regulator said it would “closely monitor” the scheme and review it after one-year to make sure it is working for consumers. “If not, we will step in,” it added. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2017/nov/10/twelfth-night-review-ade-edmondson-kara-tointon-royal-shakespeare-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T12:47:05Z","webTitle":"Twelfth Night review – fun and fury from Ade Edmondson and Kara Tointon at the RSC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/10/twelfth-night-review-ade-edmondson-kara-tointon-royal-shakespeare-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/nov/10/twelfth-night-review-ade-edmondson-kara-tointon-royal-shakespeare-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Twelfth Night review – fun and fury from Ade Edmondson and Kara Tointon at the RSC","bodyText":"Christopher Luscombe’s decision to set this peerless comedy in 1890s England yields some fine sets by Simon Higlett, some lively tunes by Nigel Hess and lends the evening an air of Wildean gaiety. Yet, while it promises to be as big a popular success as Luscombe’s recent pairing of Love’s Labour’s Lost and Much Ado About Nothing, I missed that delicate intertwining of melancholy and laughter that makes this Shakespeare’s most Chekhovian play. One of the production’s best touches is to remind us of Queen Victoria’s delight in employing an Indian attendant, Abdul Karim. Here Kara Tointon’s poised, elegant Olivia turns to Beruce Khan’s Feste as her musical munshi (or secretary) for light relief, much to the fury of Adrian Edmondson’s severely censorious Malvolio, who even hisses like a snake at his Asian rival. That makes sense, as does the casting of Dinita Gohil as the male-disguised Viola who occupies pride of place in the languidly luxurious, sexually ambivalent household of Orsino (Nicholas Bishop). Gohil, in the best performance of the evening, is a bright-eyed figure who surrenders happily to Orsino’s kisses and who delivers the famous “willow cabin” speech with a level of rapture I have not heard in ages. The production’s determination to cram in as many Victorian references as possible is, however, taken to excess. I believed in Edmondson’s Malvolio until the point where, having donned yellow stockings, he turned into a parody of Bunthorne from Gilbert and Sullivan’s Patience and built a patter-song out of the phrase “please one and so please all”. It seems equally perverse to transform Feste’s song about the wind and the rain, the play’s sublime musical coda, into a jaunty music-hall number delivered during the nocturnal drinking scene. While it is also ingenious to treat Antonio as a dandified aesthete sporting a green carnation, it hardly fits with the original text’s description of him as a “saltwater thief”. But there is much to enjoy. John Hodgkinson makes Sir Toby a hectoring predator not above thieving from Aguecheek’s suitcase, Sarah Twomey, in a legitimate gender-switch, turns the normally anonymous Fabian into a lively scullery-maid and the designs, ranging from railway stations to statuary-filled gardens, are a delight. Yet, for all the production’s cleverness, I rarely felt that poignant sense of mortality that suffuses the play’s romantic comedy.

Its initiator, Eleanor Dulles, a sister of the head of the CIA at the time, announced Berlin’s House of the Cultures of the World in 1956 as “a bright beacon shining light into the east”. Yet a year into the Trump era, the building that lies a stone’s throw from Angela Merkel’s chancellory is one of several places in Germany that is prompting questions over America’s cultural influence. A new exhibition, Parapolitics: Cultural Freedom and the Cold War, which is on show at the historic building in Berlin’s Tiergarten park until 8 January 2018, charts how CIA front organisations such as West Berlin’s Congress for Cultural Freedom enlisted the art world in a propaganda war between two ideologies, which came to be known as “the battle for Picasso’s mind”. By promoting modern art movements such as abstract expressionism – and artists including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko – as showcases of America’s creativity and freedom of expression, foreign intelligence services ended up shaping the modern world’s aesthetic sensibilities. Mixing archive pieces and works by contemporary artists, the Berlin show criticises the gallery’s own role in the cold war period, in a similar way to the analysis applied by German institutions in relation to the the Nazi period. “My belief is that public institutions like mine need to take responsibility for what they do,” said Bernd Scherer, director of the House of the Cultures of the World. “It has to be clear what position you are speaking from.” While the Soviet Union professed its belief in the use of art as a class-war weapon from the start, America’s support for liberal left but anti-communist organisations had been covert: when the CIA’s methods were revealed by US media in 1967, it caused a scandal and led to resignations, such as the British poet Stephen Spender stepping down as editor of the literary journal Encounter. But 50 years later, in a year in which the CIA has proved a pernicious opponent to a US president with autocratic ambitious, the picture is more ambivalent. Scherer said he found fault with the CIA’s cultural programme for the way in which it “functionalised and thus corrupted the term ‘freedom’”, pointing out the paradoxes of an intelligence agency funnelling money to anti-apartheid organisations abroad while helping to sabotage the Black Panther movement at home. “But you cannot overestimate the CIA’s intelligence and efficiency: making culture part of their strategy required a genuine artistic sensibility. When you examine the individual measures employed, you quickly end up in a grey zone,” Scherer said. The centre piece of the Parapolitics exhibition is a display of the more than 20 artfully crafted literary magazines that were financed across the globe via the Congress for Cultural Freedom, such as Der Monat in Germany, Jiyu in Japan and Hiwar in Lebanon. While many of these publications worked as platforms for cold warriors such as the US diplomat George Kennan and helped to squash intellectual debate of the Vietnam war, others became radical trailblazers almost by accident: Nigeria’s Black Orpheus was one of the first journals to publish traditional Yoruba poetry and art, and is now considered a key shaper of postcolonial modernism. “It’s hard not to admire the CIA’s employees for their infallibly good taste,” wrote the art critic of Berliner Zeitung after viewing the display. Reactions to the show mirror a wider German debate over the future of transatlantic relations. In a recent article in weekly Die Zeit, a group of academics and thinktank directors called for a responsible long-term foreign policy that would “build a bridge into the era beyond Trump’s presidency”. While conceding that Europe and America could be headed for trade wars and that the EU would have to act alone in reforming global asylum rules, the authors warned that “it would be a historic mistake to play off ‘more Europe’ against the transatlantic alliance”. In a response published a week later, however, two of Die Zeit’s leading writers replied that “those who think we can just wait for the US to return to its old role after Trump are deceiving themselves”. The transatlantic crisis, argued Jörg Lau and Bernd Ulrich, “didn’t begin with Trump, and will not end with Trump”. Their article ended in a manifesto for a Germany unshackled from US influence, which would “support France without condescending to it”, “manage Brexit without punitive fantasies”, as well as “reduce the appeal of Europe to Africa’s aspiring population and simultaneously allow for controlled immigration”. They argued that China should be brought in from the cold on trade and climate policy but confronted on human rights and intellectual property theft. “One could almost be grateful to Donald Trump”, Lau and Ulrich wrote. “By undermining the transatlantic partnership, he has heightened Germans’ recognition of how much this relationship has benefited them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/nov/12/international-rules-rlwc-melbourne-city-v-western-sydney-sportwatch-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-12T10:27:34Z","webTitle":"Melbourne City and Wanderers draw, Australia beat Ireland in international rules and more: sportwatch – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/nov/12/international-rules-rlwc-melbourne-city-v-western-sydney-sportwatch-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/nov/12/international-rules-rlwc-melbourne-city-v-western-sydney-sportwatch-live","fields":{"headline":"Melbourne City and Wanderers draw, Australia beat Ireland in international rules and more: sportwatch – as it happened","bodyText":"Goodnight Alright everyone, thanks for joining me for another enjoyable edition of Sportwatch, and thanks to all those in particular who contributed below the line. Hope you enjoyed the coverage of the quirky game of international rules, as well as our minute-by-minute A-League amongst W-League, Rugby League World Cup, NBL and WNBL results. Stay tuned next week for another edition of Sportwatch. Ireland put the finishing touches to an impressive World Cup with a 34-6 win over Wales in stifling heat at the Rectangular Stadium. Second-row forward Oliver Roberts scored two of his side’s six tries as the Irish comfortably secured their second victory from their three group games but still head home before the knockout stages. The result leaves Wales still looking for their first World Cup win since 2000 but, after conceding 122 points in their first two games, at least they were competitive for much of the game, which was played as a curtain-raiser to England’s clash with France. Queensland-born half-back Josh Ralph made a lively contribution on his Wales debut and veteran forward Phil Joseph hung up his boots at the end of the game knowing he had given his all in the final match of his career. With thanks to Press Association Fitzgerald runs onto a loose ball with pace, but the whistle beats him. Western Sydney make it six away draws in a row, after Janjetovic made several impressive saves. McCormack will rue a number of golden opportunities to strike for his side. Newcastle Jets stay on top of the ladder - with City second. Who would have thought? Player of the match to Schenkeveld - well deserved. He says: “I feel really shit. We had to win that game. I’m sad”. Never a truer word spoken - I’m sure all City fans are feeling it. Janjetovic, meanwhile says the Wanderers keep “letting teams off the hook”. Reckon they’ll be satisfied with the draw today, given how many chances City had. A-League 93:30 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW McCormack has a late chance at a free-kick, it’s out rather wide, and he drives it in too low for the header. A-League 93:00 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Cejudo with a lifted pass but Sotirio can’t make anything of it - he looks out on his feet. Sotirio tries to take the corner off Galekovic - who isn’t impressed, and promptly punches the ball out of his hands. Those two have had several run-ins tonight. A-League 90:00 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Five minutes added on - thanks largely to the VAR. Wouldn’t be surprised if we got a score with the tired legs out there, but then again City have had a mountain of near-misses. A-League 89:40 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Jakobsen with another beautiful back-heel, and it opens up space for Schenkeveld, who can’t get a shot away in dangerous proximity. A-League 87:00 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Cejudo forces the corner for Western Sydney - and Sotirio stays down with what looks like cramp. It’s just cramp, as some trademark hamstring stretching does the trick. Interesting how that works, no matter the injury. The corner amounts to nothing as Cejudo continues to cause headaches for City. This time he finds Bonevacia but it’s too tight for him to weave his way through the defence. A-League 83:00 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Fitzgerald’s footwork gets too fancy for his own good, and he leaves the ball behind in the box. Disappointing after a brilliant back-heel flick by McCormack, who has plenty of his own missed chances. A-League 82:00 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW The crowd is getting into the game at AAMI park - but it’s the Wanderers who are pressing. Yellow card to Santalab who almost gets past the entire City defensive line. Good thing he hit the ball and not the player - it was a poor boot from him - and Schenkeveld takes his time getting to his feet. On replay Riera can be seen slapping away the handshake of coach Gombau as he was subbed off. Looked filthy. A-League 77:00 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW 15 shots on goal to 6 for City - but they can’t break the deadlock, yet anyway. McCormack may live to rue his multiple opportunities. He’s had eight shots on goal, six on target, six inside the box and two outside. This time Bonevacia has a golden opportunity in a 1-2 play with Sotirio - Cejudo looks certain to score but there’s a deflection. Wanderers corner to Cejudo, who fires an in-swinger - and Galekovic gets stuck trying to make his way through. Missed opportunity for Western Sydney to capitalise on his mistake. Riera off for Santalab. Riera looks highly displeased. A-League 72:00 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Kamau now coming off for Budzinski. Cornthwaite takes McCormack down in what was surely a professional foul - and it’s a yellow for him. A-League 68:30 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW McCormack can’t find the goals AGAIN! That’s an incredible eight shots for him - and another near-perfect delivery, this time from Jamieson. The header won’t go past Janjetovic, and he can’t volley the deflection from his own strike. City can thank Fitzgerald for that chance - he’s in career-best form - but is he under consideration for the Socceroos? A-League 65:30 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Sotirio gets a one-on-one, but he doesn’t have a teammate, hesitates, takes an unnecessary extra touch and can’t trouble the keeper. Down the other end, McCormack misses a gilt-edged opportunity after the perfect lobbed pass from Fitzgerald - but he can’t nod it in. An action-packed couple of minutes yields no result. A-League 63:30 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Great cut-back from Kamau to Fitzgerald, who hits it nicely on the half-volley, but there’s a deflection. Corner to McCormack lacks menace. Unlucky for City. Another clear foul is missed - this time to Sotirio. A-League 60:00 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Baccus continuing his excellent distribution - 29 passes at 86.2% accuracy today. Looks like Cejudo will come on - despite his wrist being strapped. He comes on at the expense of Jumpei. First yellow of the evening goes to Jakobsen for his clumsy tackle on Bonevacia. A-League 57:40 Melbourne City 1-1 WSW Free-kick to Wanderers is taken by Bonevacia after Sotirio won another in good position for his team. Cornthwaite can’t get his head to it. Who will break the deadlock? City looking the superior side, again, but that’s what we said before the Wanderers scored last time. McCormack steps up to the spot - and surely Janjetkovic can’t save another. It’s in! City finally equalise. Fourth goal to McCormack this season. A-League 55:40 Melbourne City 0-1 WSW Malik with the sliding tackle in the midfield - and *surely* he won a penalty after Llorente tunnelled into him in the box. VAR is in play... and McCormack is waiting with the ball. Overrule - and a penalty. A-League 52:00 Melbourne City 0-1 WSW Nothing doing again for McCormack who goes for a long-range blast, and blazes it well over the bar (again). Yet another wasted chance for Melbourne, who have started this half as they did the first - with plenty of running. A-League 48:00 Melbourne City 0-1 WSW Carrusca comes on for Mauk in a half-time substitution. Kamau, meanwhile, falls in the box, but there’s no foul called. McCormack finds Carrusca on the burst - but he hits it far too hard, well over the bar and into the crowd. Papua New Guinea crushed the United States 64-0 to top World Cup Group C and secure a quarter-final against England in Melbourne next Sunday. The Kumuls ran in 11 tries, three of them from winger Justin Olam, for a predictable victory that snuffed out the faint hopes of Ireland and delighted a third successive full house of 15,000 at the national stadium in Port Moresby. It was another harsh lesson for a United States team coached by Leeds’ Grand Final-winning boss Brian McDermott but consisting largely of part-time domestic players who have conceded 168 points in their three matches. Lachlan Lam, the 19-year-old son of former Wigan and PNG scrum-half Adrian Lam, made a fairytale debut for Papua New Guinea, scoring the first try on eight minutes and adding another before the first water break on 20 minutes, while Rhyse Martin kicked 10 goals from 11 attempts. With thanks to Press Association A-League half-time Melbourne City 0-1 Western Sydney Wanderers Just the one minute of stoppage time, and the ball goes end-to-end for most of it. Strange first half, really, City came out well on top, with considerable swagger, and then conceded a poor goal. They created no shortage of chances, but couldn’t convert - largely thanks to a brilliant save by Janjetovic. Back shortly. A-League 43:00 Melbourne City 0-1 Western Sydney Wanderers Mauk to Kamau on the right who hits the perfect cross, but Fitzgerald can’t find the tap-in. Here comes Mauk again with a through ball to McCormack, but he loses his feet. No foul play. McCormack can’t get anything right this half - much like this team. I was just about to retract that, as Fitzgerald looked to have one of the best chances for City so far -and he finds the hand of Cornthwaite. Could have been a card. Can McCormack finally find the net? He fights off Jakobsen for the ball and almost hits the left, top-hand corner with a near-perfect shot. Brilliant save to Janjetovic. That’s four for him tonight - and he leads all-comers with 22 this season. A-League 40:00 Melbourne City 0-1 Western Sydney Wanderers 55% possession now for Western Sydney. La Rocca has had the most passes for City with 27 (85% accuracy) while Thwaite has 35 and (88%) and Llorente 25 (84%) Here comes Kamau down the wing - but Thwaite heads it away. McCormack couldn’t get near it. Needs to try and find front position with his inferior heading capacity. A-League 35:00 Melbourne City 0-1 Western Sydney Wanderers Fitzgerald with the sliding tackle on Jumpei in the box - and it’s a good one. Risky - but well-played. Still, the Wanderers now have a corner, but Jakobsen heads it clear easily. A little lull in play here as Jumpei collects Mauk - no card. A-League 32:00 Melbourne City 0-1 Western Sydney Wanderers Sotirio is causing all kinds of headaches for the City defence, they’ve got no answers for his bursts of speed. Schenkeveld has been some find for the City - he repels a dangerous-looking Riera this time, as he did Jumpei earlier. A-League 30:00 Melbourne City 0-1 Western Sydney Wanderers Suddenly the swagger of the City is gone - as their own fans start to boo Jamieson and others’ slow movement through the middle. Fitzgerald with another great chance for Melbourne - he came steaming down the left-hand wing, everyone waited for the flag, but it doesn’t look offside on the replay. City blow another one-on-one with the keeper. A-League 25:10 Melbourne City 0-1 Western Sydney Wanderers How good has Fitzgerald been for City? Still, they can’t find a breakthrough, despite a few chances directly following the Sotirio goal. Meanwhile, Sotirio has another chance on goal - after Riera finds him at the back of the defensive six. It’s a perfectly-weighted pass from Riera, who has four of his own goals this season to date. The header, however, is repelled by Galekovic. Schenkeveld - who stymies Jumpei’s run forward - plays the ball back to Malik, who is far too slow with possession. Llorente wins the duel - and it’s a perfect pass for Sotirio, who finds the goal on the second attempt after Galekovic got his hand to the first. Disappointing for City to concede after they dominated early play. A-League 18:00 Melbourne City 0-0 WSW Sotirio does his best to force a corner off Jamieson, but he’s too smart for him - and wins back the throw. Little doing for the Wanderers in terms of any fluency in their movement forward. Bridge, however, is able to find a gap in the defence and Riera almost gets onto the through ball (nicely timed run, but the pass is too heavy for him). Better from Western Sydney. A-League 15:00 Melbourne City 0-0 WSW 56% possession to the Wanderers (according to the A-League website) - I’m finding that hard to believe, and wondering if it’s an error. It feels as if the Wanderers have hardly touched it. City have certainly looked far more dangerous - while the Wanderers look to be second-guessing themselves. Wonder if the change of coach has unsettled them. Hayden Foxe certainly did well at the helm, all things considered. A-League 11:00 Melbourne City 0-0 WSW The pace of Sotirio (in for Cejudo) is already worrying the City defence. Schenkeveld does well to stop his forward foray, and the corner for the Wanderers fails to trouble Galekovic. Corner for City as a backwards header goes astray for Western Sydney. McCormack whips another dangerous ball in, but La Rocca’s header is over the bar against his old side. Oh no! McCormack has a rare opportunity (in space and with plenty of time) to score after a horror turnover, but it’s a wonderful save by Janjetovic, who was left one-on-one. A-League 07:13 Melbourne City 0-0 WSW McCormack upended by Baccus just on the edge of the 18 yard box. What can he produce? He’s already scored two from set-pieces this season. This time he’s unselfish - and it’s off a defender for another corner. Nice flat delivery. This one is cleared, but City are pressing early. A-League 04:20 Melbourne City 0-0 WSW Alright! We’re finally on after a hole was found in Janjetovic’s net. We had to wait for some trusty gaffa tape to get it fixed. You couldn’t make this stuff up. First shot of the game goes to Fitzgerald. The deflection is off the Wanderers so the City have a corner through McCormack. Jackobsen whips in the cross - and it’s headed out for a second corner. Jamieson tries a long-range volley but doesn’t connect sweetly. Reigning W-League champions Melbourne City returned to form with an ominous 5-2 comeback win over unbeaten league leaders Newcastle Jets on Sunday. City’s international players made the difference with Wales captain Jess Fishlock and Matildas striker Larissa Crummer both netting two goals. American Ashley Latch and Australian international fullback Steph Catley provided two assists each in a powerhouse performance from a City side hunting a third successive championship. Newcastle defied the run of play to take a 2-1 first-half lead at AAMI Park thanks to a quickfire double from striker Katie Stengel, but they had no answer as City scored four unanswered second-half goals. A-League Melbourne City v WSW In case you’re wondering, Cejudo has been relegated to the bench thanks to a wrist injury - so we’re not sure we’ll see him at all tonight. That’s a blow for the Wanderers. This game WAS about to start - but we’ve got another hold up to check on Janjetovic’s net. We think. Honestly. The players are having a little kick-to-kick. While we’re (still) waiting... Former Cairns import Travis Trice has come back to bite the Taipans, stepping up to nail back-to-back three-pointers and seal Brisbane’s gutsy 82-74 NBL home win. The Bullets bounced back from last week’s record 31-point home loss to Illawarra to notch just their third win of the season after a fast-finishing Trice helped deny the Taipans a stirring comeback. Brisbane (3-4 record) delivered on their promise to tighten their defence following last week’s humiliating Hawks rout - their biggest home loss to Illawarra - by limiting the Taipans to the NBL’s lowest half-time total of the season, just 24. With thanks to AAP A-League Melbourne City v WSW There is a delay. Players on the ground now. Yes, we know. But the Wellington game went overtime, and then the earlier game in this double-header - the W-League clash between Melbourne City and Newcastle - went overtime (will bring you more on City’s 5-2 win shortly, but for those who saw it - how good was Fishlock? I caught her brilliant long-range goal on my dinner break!) A-League Melbourne City v WSW Some interesting stats for you as we wait for this game to get underway. None of the last 11 games between these teams has seen the same result in consecutive games, with the last fixture between these teams ending in a 3-1 victory to the Wanderers. Melbourne City have won three of their last four meetings with the Wanderers at AAMI Park, including each of the last two. 10 of the Wanderers’ last 13 goals against Melbourne City have come in the second half. Melbourne City have scored three goals from outside the box this campaign, more than any other team. Bruce Kamau has a shot conversion rate of 60%, the best of any player to have attempted at least five shots this campaign. A-League teams Western Sydney Wanderers (4-2-3-1) Starting XI - Janjetovic (GK); Hamill, Cornthwaite, Thwaite, Llorente; Bonevacia, Kearyn Baccus; Kusukami, Bridge, Sotirio; Riera. Substitutions - Hall (GK), Cejudo, Santalab, Aspropotamitis, Keaunu Baccus. Melbourne City (4-2-3-1) Starting XI - Galekovic (GK); Muscat, La Rocca, Shenkeveld, Jamieson; Malik, Jakobsen; Kamau, Mauk, Fitzgerald; McCormack. Substitutions - Bouzanis (GK), Kilkenny, Carrusca, Brattan, Budzinski. A-League Melbourne City v Western Sydney Wanderers Now to the second part of the football double header at AAMI Park (following Melbourne City v Newcastle Jets in the W-League) and our feature match of the day: Melbourne City v Western Sydney Wanderers, the latter who are tonight officially, for the first time, under the stewardship of the returning Josep Gombau. We haven’t seen the Spanish coach in the A-League since his days in charge of Adelaide United - heady days indeed - and if you’re a Wanderers fan, you’re probably a bit excited. He’s said he wants to bring free-flowing, attacking football to Wanderers and takes over a team just waiting to make good on that promise. The form of Oriol Riera, Alvaro and Raul Llorente has been encouraging so far this season, even though their first win of the season only came last week. Still, they’re one of just three unbeaten sides and will fancy their chances of coming away from AAMI Park with something come 9 o’clock tonight. City, who ceded top spot on the ladder with defeat to Sydney FC last week, will be looking to bounce back and get back in the winning column. Anyway, kick-off is nearly upon us, so stay tuned. Should be a decent game. I’m back... sort of Just my luck, my monitor has died. So I’m here, with my tiny laptop screen. I’ve tried literally everything to fix it and it just isn’t happening. Give me a few more minutes and then we’ll get stuck into the A-League. Taking a break Alright, I need a dinner break, but I’ll be back later on to take you through the A-League match between Melbourne City and Western Sydney Wanderers, as well as W-League and RLWC results. Cheers! The Melbourne Boomers have flashed their WNBL championship credentials by knocking off three major contenders in the space of seven days. Slow out of the gates after injuries to key signings Jenna O’Hea and Louella Tomlinson, the Boomers are now clicking into gear with recent wins over Dandenong, Sydney Uni and a dramatic 77-74 victory against Adelaide on Sunday afternoon. Liz Cambage is back to her dominant best, averaging 29 points and nine rebounds in the past three games; including a 44-point, 12 rebound performance against the Lightning; with her presence in the paint creating open shots for her teammates. With thanks to AAP Both Fyfe and Betts miss very gettable goals at the death - which means the Australians don’t quite close the game out as they should have. Zach Tuohy had a long-range shot at goal with a minute or so left, and chose to put the ball on the grass - going for a free-kick style soccer goal, but missed everything. As far as these tests go, this was a fairly one-sided contest. Nat Fyfe looked dangerous - and is unofficially ‘best on ground’ for the commentary team (Freo fans would’ve loved every minute of this). Scott Pendlebury, meanwhile, has apparently re-injured his troublesome finger, which is awful news for Pies fans. Zorko is also getting some ice and strapping to the ribs at the conclusion. Just over 25,000 is the official crowd figure, apparently - lauded as ‘impressive’ but I’d say pretty disappointing. Sounds as if average fans might have been priced out. A relatively fun affair from a viewing perspective - will you be tuning in for the second leg? Next stop for this series is Perth. International Q4 13:30 Australia 62-50 Ireland OK I’ve just cottoned on to the fact that Kade Simpson is sporting a ‘mo’ - I was wondering why I hadn’t recognised him despite the fact that’s had 39 disposals! Fyfe misses an easy over - to keep the Irish close enough to give them hope for the series overall. International Q4 10:30 Australia 58-44 Ireland Kade Simpson has had 35 disposals, Hibberd 31, and Zach Merrett 34 - of those I’d say Hibberd has had the biggest influence. It’s a tap in by Shuey for six! That might just do it for the Australians. Great set-up from Gunston, and the Irish goalkeeper stayed back - gifting Shuey the chance to ‘dunk’ a goal. Sloane then misses, failing to put Ireland away. It’s a ‘cumulative’ series, so the margin here matters. Aka Ireland will want to stay close even if they lose. International rules Q4 05:30 Australia 51-44 Ireland Michael Murphy manages to open the account for the Irish in this final quarter - have been super impressed with his game. Think the Irish might have too much of a differential to claw back, but these games are fast-paced (and close) if nothing else. On cue, Conor McManus (nine scores from ten disposals!) scores a long-range over for his team, and things start to heat up again. Paul Geaney almost makes another long-range bomb for the Irish, but it’s an impressive save from Goddard (impressive agility on display). He’s performed admirably in Fletcher’s absence - the man I thought might never retire. Gaeney finally makes an over - and it’s a seven-point game. W-League Thanks Blue, for your below the line live blogging on the W-League - I regret that today’s shift didn’t work so that I could cover a game - but rest-assured I will be trying to do one ASAP! I’ll bring you results of Canberra United v Sydney FC and Melbourne City v Newcastle as soon as I can. Wellington Phoenix have recorded their first win of the A-League season, downing Perth Glory 5-2 in an entertaining and controversial match in Wellington on Sunday. The decisive blow in the thriller came in the 74th minute when the video assistant referee adjudged Glory defender Scott Neville had blocked Andrija Kaludjerovic’s volley with a hand. The penalty was eventually awarded, Kaludjerovic converted and Wellington opened out a two-goal lead in the action-packed end-to-end match. Kaludjerovic extended the margin in the 87th minute, heading home Adam Parkhouse’s cross to grab a brace and boost his tally to five goals for the season. The win over fifth-placed Perth finally shifts Wellington off the bottom of the ladder into eighth place, adding a much-needed three points to their two draws and three losses for the season. With thanks to AAP International rules three-quarter-time Australia 50-35 Ireland DrRudi tells me (below the line) that tickets for International Rules were $70 - really? Can’t understand how they can be so expensive, especially given they’ve struggled to draw a decent crowd in Australia. Agree with you that publicity has been poor - and there’s no live stats either, which is disappointing for me! Get the impression Ireland care about this series more than Australia (or the AFL does). Is that fair? Meanwhile, on field, the Aussies have pulled away with an over to Paddy Ryder and ALMOST a six-pointer to Eddie Betts with a tap over the goalkeeper that was millimetres from crossing the line. Dangerfield then gets stuck into Chris Barrett (Ireland’s number two) after he appears to trip him. Some feeling in this. International rules Q3 12:00 Australia 44-34 Ireland Fyfe! Possibly best on ground, he manages the first six-pointer for the Australians - he’s pumped, and his teammates come from everywhere. You get the sense he’s popular. The Australians have managed a 21-point turnaround, at 41-30, before the Irish hit back with an over and a behind. Speaking of hybrid naturals - Hibberd looks at ease, as does Dangerfield - as in the AFL, he looks to have all the time in the world. Alright, confirmation Joel Selwood isn’t playing. Says he’s struggled with less preparation than his teammates, and should be back for the next test. Meanwhile, Eddie Betts wins a contested mark and resultant over - and is clearly the favourite of this Adelaide crowd. International rules Q3 06:55 Australia 35-30 Ireland Speaking of Fyfe, here he is on the end of a nice pass from Shaun Burgoyne (who was the unexpected choice for captain in an Australian side heavy on leadership - Fyfe, Boak, Pendlebury and Selwood are the club captains named in the Australian side). To be honest with you, I’m not even sure Selwood is playing - if he is I haven’t spotted him! Fyfe converts, but the Irish respond quickly with an over of their own. This game has settled into a score for score pattern. Shuey then hits the post - and some of the Aussies are slow to respond (probably not used to the rule that a poster is play on!) FYI you can also ‘knock through’ a goal, unlike in AFL - meaning you can punch through a six-pointer. The latest over goes to Hibberd - who has had a mountain of possession. Just spotted Bec Goddard in the coaches’ box. What a year for her! Can’t wait to see what she can do with the defending AFLW champions, the Adelaide Crows. International rules Unfortunately there aren’t a lot of pictures coming through from this contest - but here’s one of Adelaide star Eddie Betts, who was warming up prior to the game by dribbling the round ball between his legs, basketball style. It’s a tight contest so far - reflective of the tight nature of the series to date. Ireland have the edge over the Australians - having won 10 series to 9 (and 21 test matches to 17). The Irish have dominated in recent times, including in the most recent test in Ireland (Croke Park), where they triumphed 56-52. International Rules half-time Australia 28-27 Ireland A couple of overs to Nat Fyfe breathes some life into the Australians. So good to see the former Brownlow medallist running unrestricted. Scary stuff for those who’ll line up on him next season. Ross Lyon is also in attendance from the Fremantle football club, as the Australian defensive coach. Now the Australians hit the lead with a neat, round the body snap to Ben Brown. He’s made his way to Adelaide from Iceland (where I believe he was on his honeymoon!) to represent his country. FYI: I have been to Iceland, and it is, in my opinion, the most beautiful place on the planet. Let’s just say I wouldn’t be trading Iceland for Adelaide. International Rules Q2 10:30 Australia 17-27 Ireland A lovely goal to Dayne Zorko gets the Australians on the board in the second quarter, but it’s soon matched by another McManus goal. Zorko looks the most ‘natural’ of the Australians with the round ball, as our commentators have reminded us six, maybe seven times. Meanwhile Travis Boak and Zach Tuohy resume hostilities after Boak rode Tuohy into the ground as he tried to zip away deep in Brendon Goddard’s defensive area. Looks to be a fairly disappointing crowd in Adelaide. From memory these games have only sold out twice in Australia - in Perth in 2003 and 2014. Irish leading in the kicking efficiency stakes - 71% to 54% - no surprises there. International Rules Q2 3:00 Australia 14-24 Ireland Michael Murphy again – this time for the first ‘goal’ or six-pointer (soccer style) of the day. What do you think readers, do you enjoy a hybrid sport? What are the best examples out there, in your opinion? Ireland have hit the ground running in this second quarter - with a big, long curler to McManus (only he and Murphy have scored for the Irish - not that that has been a problem so far!) While we’re taking a break here at Adelaide Oval, it looks like Melbourne United bounced back their heavy defeat to Cairns by running out 108-90 winners over Sydney. After being out-hustled in a big loss on Thursday night to the Taipans, United won the rebounding battle with the Kings and shared the scoring load for their fifth win of the season at Hisense Arena. “We weren’t happy about the way we lost the other night,” Melbourne coach Dean Vickerman said after his side’s much-improved effort against Sydney. “I thought there was a physicality that was really missing with our group so that was a priority tonight.” With thanks to AAP International Rules quarter-time Australia 14-15 Ireland For those wondering, this series owes its origin to the Australian Football World Tour, organised by sports broadcaster by former VFL umpire Harry Beitzel and Irish-born Melbournian, James Harkin in 1967 and 1968. This particular iteration - the International rules series - started in 1984, as a three-match format with the team who took the most wins/series points were crowned winners. However, things haven’t always been smooth - there was a break in the series between 1990 and 1998 after lack of interest and poor Australian crowds (it returned in 1998 in a two-match aggregate format). In 2014, the series was reduced again to a one-off test match (with only All-Australian players in the green and gold) - to try to revive flagging interest. The tests were also indefinitely called off by the Gaelic Athletic Association in 2007 after a history of violent, on-field incidents (it then returned in October 2008, with new rules agreed upon by the two nations). I must admit that when I think of the International Rules series, I think of the ‘biff’. True to form, we’ve already had some fracas today - with the Australians seemingly targetting the Irish No24 Aidan O’Shea. International Rules Q1 11:20 Australia 8-11 Ireland The Irish look the better of the two teams so far - have been impressed with the form of Michael Murphy – a man who has purportedly knocked back many an offer to join the AFL. The Irish of course have the advantage of the round ball, while the Aussies have the advantage of the tackle. Speaking of, Goddard has started well, pushing up the ground and catching a few Irish forwards unawares. The first Australian over went to Chad Wingard - with a lovely checkside of the round ball. Dangerfield follows up with another, this time a low, floater. But it’s Michael Murphy for his second over - he’s dominating. Rory Sloane, on the bench, talks up the ‘wonderful’ Adelaide weather, which I must say looks a little grey on the television. International Rules Q1 05:00 Australia 1-6 Ireland You’ll notice some familiar faces in the Irish side - Zach Tuohy is playing for his home country, as is Pearce Hanley. The first ‘over’ goes to Conor McManus (the second-most capped player in the series). He has apparently been looked at by Essendon, who have thought about recruiting him as an international rookie. This is something of a depleted Irish side - it’s the first time since the ‘formal’ resumption of the series in 1984 that there will be no All-Ireland champions in the squad. The Irish follow up with another over to Michael Murphy (from a Goddard turnover), while Eddie Betts can only manage a point for the Australians. International rules - the rules We’re just about to get underway here, but for your benefit as much as mine, here are some key rules: There are 15 players on the field per team. There are no boundary throw-ins (whoever touches it last concedes a free-kick), and no shepherding allowed. Tackling, however, is permitted – which is not something the Irish are used to (it’s not part of their game!) If the ball hits the post, it’s play on (unlike in AFL!) As for scoring, a behind = 1 point, ‘over’ = 3 points (through traditional AFL goal-posts) and ‘goal’ = 6 (through soccer-like goals). International rules - teams Here are your teams for this match - with plenty of star-power representing the Australian team.

Shane Walsh Welcome Hello everyone and welcome to this Sunday’s edition of Sportwatch. I’m here to take you through today’s live action, whatever your preferred shape of ball. Today’s feature games are the International rules game one between Australia and Ireland, at Adelaide Oval, which is about to get underway. It will be interesting to see what the crowds are like for this one, given the hybrid game’s flagging interest in previous years. Then we’ll have a minute-by-minute account of the Melbourne City v Western Sydney Wanderers A-League game at 7pm AEDT, which I’ll preview closer to. I’ll also endeavour to bring you the results of other A-League, W-League and Rugby League World Cup fixtures as we go.

The FTSE100 closed down 51 points, or 0.7%, at 7432. That’s its lowest level since the start of October, despite this morning’s better-than-expected trade figures. Packaging firm Bunzl shed 6%, after Morgan Stanley warned that it could be threatened by Amazon’s business-to-business distribution project. Here’s the damage: This means the FTSE 100 has had its worst week in two months, dragged down by retail stocks (amid signs that consumers are cutting back). David Madden of CMC Markets says: European equity markets are in the red today as traders feel uneasy about being long going into the weekend in light on the sharp correction yesterday. The rapid move lower yesterday got traders thinking about how much markets have come in recent months, and that prompted some profit taking. And on that note, it’s time to wrap up. Hope you have a great weekend. GW Some late news before the weekend; US consumers have become a little gloomier. The University of Michigan’s monthly gauge of morale fell to 97.8 in October, a big fall from September. Time for a quick recap. Uber drivers are celebrating after the company failed to overturn a ruling that they are actually workers, not self-employed contractors. Lawyers say it is a landmark ruling, that means Uber faces liabilities for national minimum wage, sick pay and holiday pay. However, the taxi app company could appeal again. Kevin Charles, consulting barrister at Crossland Employment Solicitors, argues that the UK’s gig economy faces a major shake-up. “The decision signals what may be viewed as a curtailment of the use, or misuse, of thousands of ‘workers’ within the rapidly growing modern business phenomenon, known as the ‘gig economy’. Whilst each case will have to be decided on its own facts the EAT’s decision will no doubt make it easier for many people working in the ‘gig economy’ to argue that you have to look at the reality of the situation and not just the contract and that they now fall within the definition of ‘worker’ where previously they had been treated as ‘self-employed’ and denied access to any employment rights. “The EAT’s decision will no doubt be welcomed and celebrated by the 40,000 Uber drivers working in the UK and many others in a similar position. However, they may wish to leave the champagne on ice pending any appeal by Uber to the Court of Appeal which will undoubtedly follow.” But... free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute argues that the law needs to catch up with the 21st Century: Sam Dumitriu, the ASI’s Head of Projects, says: “Uber drivers choose to use the app because they want the freedom to pick when they work and which trips to take. Granting drivers worker status may force Uber to schedule shifts and cut pay at peak times, leading to less choice for drivers and longer wait-times for consumers. “It may also discourage rivals to Uber, like Lyft and Taxify, from coming to the UK hurting competition. “Today’s ruling reveals the problem of relying on employment legislation written before the word ‘app’ even existed. Minicab drivers have been traditionally classified as self-employed, but drivers who are able to choose their own hours, trips and simultaneously use a rival app are now classified as workers. We should update the law to take into account the added flexibility that gig economy platforms like Uber bring.” The ruling came amid a flurry of economic news from the UK, including... Britain’s trade deficit narrowed in September, thanks to a rise in exports to the EU. Manufacturing output has jumped, as firms benefit from the weaker pound and global economic growth But construction output shrank sharply as firms refuse to commit to new offices and factories UK GDP expanded by 0.5% in the last three months, a little faster than before Here’s Larry Elliott’s take: Britain’s economic growth rate rose to 0.5% in the last three months, according to a new report. NIESR, the think tank, estimates that the UK growth rate picked up last month. That pushed growth in the August-October period up to 0.5%, they believe, from 0.4% in July-September. That’s up from 0.3% in the first and second quarters of 2017, suggesting the economy is recovering from its early slowdown. Amit Kara, Head of UK Macroeconomic Forecasting at NIESR, says: Although economic growth is likely to be stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when growth in other OECD countries has strengthened. Looking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand. NIESR also predict that the Bank of England will have raised interest rates to 2% by 2021 My colleague Rob Davies was at the Employment Appeal Tribunal this morning. Here’s his take: The ride-hailing firm Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights rather than as self-employed. The landmark Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) ruling could have major ramifications for labour rights in Britain’s growing gig economy. The US company said it would launch a further appeal against the EAT decision. Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, backed by the GMB union, won an employment tribunal case last year after arguing they should be classified as workers with rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than self-employed as Uber claimed. Uber challenged the ruling at the EAT in central London, saying it could deprive drivers of the “personal flexibility they value”. The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed the drivers during the appeal, said the decision showed that firms were choosing to deprive workers of their rights. Aslam said: “I have been campaigning against Uber since 2014 and, although I always knew I was on the right side, it has always been a struggle that has brought enormous pressure on us. “I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully.” Farrar said: “Uber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum-wage rights. We have done everything we can, now it is time for the mayor of London, Transport for London and the transport secretary to step up and use their leverage to defend worker rights rather than turn a blind eye to sweatshop conditions.” More here: Today’s ruling is a hammer-blow to the argument that Uber was merely providing a service to drivers who used its app to find customers. Tim Goodwin, associate at Winckworth Sherwood, says it also shows that companies can’t simply declare that workers are “self-employed”, if the evidence doesn’t back it up. He explains: Rather unsurprisingly, the appeal tribunal has agreed with the employment tribunal’s findings – specifically that the drivers are not self-employed, and that Uber is not some sort of technological middle-man but essentially a transportation service. “This is a hugely significant decision for Uber, and also the gig economy more generally. Increasingly, we are seeing that courts and tribunals are reluctant to allow businesses to have their cake and eat it, by exercising enormous control over their workforce whilst also denying them basic rights like paid holiday, sick leave and protection from discrimination. “The test appears to remain the same. If a business wants to have significant control over its workforce, it has to be prepared to treat its workers fairly. If the business is prepared to allow the worker a significant degree of latitude in his or her dealings, then it will be more likely that it can get away with calling them a self-employed contractor. Either way, self-employed status cannot be imposed from the top down – it has to reflect the reality of the arrangement between the worker and the business.” Carolyn Brown, employment partner and head of RSM Legal, believes today’s ruling has a significant impact on Uber’s business model. She suggests that the company could now find itself facing claims for national insurance payments, and backdated VAT too. Brown explains: With control being a critical factor in the assessment of the taxi drivers’ working status but a key requirement for the service Uber provides, something may have to give. ‘Probably a more pressing concern for Uber though is the possible consequences it may have on their exposure to tax and National Insurance Contribution liabilities. As it stands, Uber would not be obliged to pay employer NIC in respect of their drivers if they are self-employed. If they are workers though, they may be exposed to a significant NIC liability. There may also be a substantial VAT liability.’ Frank Field MP, who chairs the House of Commons work and pensions committee, says today’s ruling is a ‘huge success for workers’. He adds: [Labour MP] Rachel Reeves and I will next week be proposing to our select committees a draft bill which would make these individual, but important, skirmishes a thing of the past as legislation would protect all workers in similar situations.’ Oxford law professor Jeremias Prassl is tweeting the key points from today’s ruling: UK law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite, which represented Uber’s drivers, are understandably delighted to have won today’s ruling. They argue that it is a critical moment in ending exploitation of workers in the gig economy. Paul Jennings, partner at Bates Wells Braithwaite, sums up the mood: “We are delighted with today’s judgment which is ethically and legally the right outcome. The ruling will have significant implications for approximately 40,000 Uber drivers and, more broadly, individuals engaged across the so called ‘gig economy’. We anticipate that tens of thousands drivers will now seek to make substantial back-dated claims. “Our clients have fought tirelessly to gain the rights that they clearly should have been afforded from the outset.” Uber could continue its battle, by appealing to the court of appeal or even the supreme court. Nick Elwell-Sutton, partner at Clyde &amp; Co, warns that this will mean more uncertainty for UK companies and workers. “The final outcome of this case will provide employers with much needed clarity in this area. But uncertainty is likely to linger until the supreme court has and possibly beyond that, if the government commits to legislative changes.” “The cloud of uncertainty looming over the gig economy has undoubtedly made new businesses in the UK cautious about building a business model around a self-employed ad-hoc workforce, which may be further stagnating growth and therefore damaging the UK economy.” “This is particularly concerning as the Brexit clock keeps on ticking – the UK needs to ensure it is demonstrating that it is open for business and at the very least showing business that there is legal clarity around alternative employment practices.” Jamie Jenkins, barrister at St John’s Buildings, predicts that Uber will appeal again. Ruth Kennedy, barrister at 2 Temple Gardens, tweets: Crowley Woodford, employment partner at law firm Ashurst, believes Judge Eady’s ruling has massive consequences for other companies, as well as Uber. “The implications of this appeal decision reach far beyond the price of a taxi journey home. Uber’s business model for its workforce has again been found to be fatally flawed; the so-called “self-employed” drivers are in fact workers entitled to basic rights such as holiday and sick pay. This decision has re-opened a can of worms which will have a ripple effect on the financial viability of the gig economy in its current form and beyond that into mainstream industries.” Unions are urging Uber to accept today’s ruling and “throw in the towel”, rather than continuing its fight. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: No company, however big or well connected, is above the law. “Uber must play by the rules and stop denying its drivers basic rights at work. “This ruling should put gig economy employers on notice. Unions will expose nasty schemes that try and cheat workers out of the minimum wage and holiday pay. “Sham self-employment exploits people and scams the taxman. The Uber drivers’ union GMB deserve huge credit for their work on this case.” You can read the full ruling in the Uber case, here. In it, her honour Judge Eady QC explains that the Employment Tribunal was correct to conclude that an Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on, was within London, and willing and able to accept assignments was working for Uber London Ltd (ULL) under a “worker” contract. As she puts it: If the reality is that Uber’s market share in London is such that its drivers are, in practical terms, unable to hold themselves out as available to any other PHV operator, then, as a matter of fact, they are working at ULL’s disposal as part of the pool of drivers it requires to be available within the territory at any one time. Today’s ruling confirms that Uber’s drivers in the UK are entitled to various workers’ rights such as holiday pay and the national minimum wage. It’s another victory for the two Uber drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who argued successfully that they and fellow drivers were effectively employees. The ruling has significant ramifications for the gig economy, and firms whose business model is based on flexible working patterns. Legal firm Leigh Day say it’s a landmark ruling. Newsflash: Uber has lost its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are actually workers. An employment tribunal in London has backed the original ruling, last year, that Uber drivers are not self-employed. More to follow.... Britain’s construction industry, though, had a bad September. Construction output slumped by 1.6% during the month, the biggest fall since March 2016. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, says Britain’s exit from the EU is hurting the building sector: “Today’s figures indicate the shadow of Brexit still looms large over the industry – the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum causing imported building materials costs to rise, while company and UK investors caution is holding back investment in new projects, so many contractors’ margins are shrinking. “Commercial and industrial sectors that rely on ambitious multi-million pound construction projects are the hardest hit, and only new builds in the private house sector, propped up by the likes of Help to Buy loans, are offering any glimmer of hope at the moment. Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, points out that the construction sector is now in recession: Yael Selfin, chief economist at HSBC UK, reckons UK exporters should be doing better... Britain’s economy may finally be benefitting from stronger global growth and the effect of the weaker pound, says James Smith of ING. He’s encouraged by the jump in manufacturing growth in September, saying: One of the big ‘good news’ stories of 2017 is the global pick-up in growth. That, along with the weaker pound, has seen UK manufacturing sentiment rise noticeably. But for much of this year, you wouldn’t know it by looking at the production numbers. But a sharp 0.7% month-on-month rise in production during September, following some better readings over the summer, suggests these positive drivers may finally be being reflected in higher output Capital Economics have stripped out oil and ‘erratic’ factors from today’s UK trade figures to show how the underlying picture is improving. Despite September’s decent figures, Britain’s total trade deficit actually widened over the last quarter to £9.5bn. More good news! Britain’s factories were running full steam ahead in September. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7% over the month, easily beating expectations of a 0.3% increase. A stronger-than-expected manufacturing performance benefited the broader measure of industrial production, which also beat forecasts with a 0.7% increase according to the ONS data. The figures mean that the production sectors - which include mining and utilities as well as manufacturing - made a stronger contribution to the economy in the third quarter than previously thought, growing by 1.1% between July and September. A rise in factory activity over the three months was largely driven by the production of cars and medical equipment, the ONS said. Here’s the official explanation of how Britain grew its exports to the EU in the last quarter: Exports of goods to non-EU countries decreased by £1.7 billion (3.8%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. As shown in Figure 2, this was due to decreases in exports of fuels (£1.6 billion) and chemicals (£1.0 billion), which offset increases in exports to non-EU countries of other commodities over the same period. Exports of goods to EU countries increased by £0.9 billion (2.2%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. The main contributor was increases in exports of transport equipment (predominately cars), which increased by £0.7 billion. Breaking: Britain’s trade deficit has narrowed by £700m, partly due to a rise in exports to European countries. The gap between what Britain imports and exports fell to £2.75bn in September, a better result than expected. August’s trade gap has been revised lower, too, to £3.45bn. The Office for National Statistics says the improvement is “ primarily due to increased exports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold)”. The trade in goods deficit is also better than expected, coming in at £11.2bn. August’s dire figure has been upgraded to £12.3bn, not the £14.25bn initially reported. The report also shows that the UK exported £900m more goods to European countries in the three months to September, but sold £1.7bn LESS to non-EU countries. Imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries increased, by £1.7bn and £1.5bn respectively over the last quarter. The ONS says: The increase in imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) and fuels from non-EU countries represents the largest increase in import commodities, alongside increases of mechanical and electrical machinery, material manufactures and fuel imports from EU countries. German business leaders have weighed in on the tricky issue of Brexit, warning that time is running out to agree a comprehensive deal between the two sides. Reuters has the details: The European Union and Britain will not be able to reach a comprehensive deal on their future economic relations by the March 29, 2019, exit deadline, Germany’s largest industry group BDI warned on Friday, adding that a hard Brexit was very likely. The two sides will need many years to complete a comprehensive deal on trade and investments, BDI managing director Joachim Lang told Reuters. The comments come ahead of showdown talks between prime minister Theresa May and business leaders from the UK and Europe, on Monday. UK and EU negotiators are due to wrap up the latest round of talks in Brussels later today. The latest rumour is that Northern Ireland could remain inside the European customs union and single market after Brexit. This would avoid “a hard border on the island of Ireland”, reports the Financial Times. It offers the intriguing prospect that City banks could move operations to Belfast rather than, say, Frankfurt to retain passporting rights in the EU.... It’s a dank, grotty morning in the City of London, as traders await today’s trade figures. The FTSE 100 is bobbing around the 7485 mark, up one meagre point. The French CAC and German DAX are equally subdued, as the markets slope towards the weekend. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is hoping that this morning’s trade data will provide some intrigue. The FTSE has struggled in the last couple of days, with a volatile commodity sector and a flagging set of retail stocks dragging the UK index back below 7500. As for the pound, while its seen some progress in recovering last week’s post-Bank of England losses, it’s still nowhere near its pre-hike highs. Against the dollar sterling’s the wrong side of $1.315, while against the euro the currency is straining to keep its ahead above €1.13. We’ll see whether the latest manufacturing and industrial production figures can make anything better a bit later. The former is forecast to fall from 0.4% to 0.3% month-on-month, while the latter is expected to nudge higher, from 0.2% to 0.3%. There’s also the goods trade balance reading, with analysts estimating the deficit to have shrunk from £14.2bn in August to £12.9bn in September. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It’s known as Britain’s ‘other’ deficit problem -- the gap between what Britain buys from the rest of the world, and what it sells back. New trade figures due out today may show that the UK managed to narrow this gap, a little. Economists predict that the trade deficit dropped to around £4.5bn in September, from August’s disappointingly large £5.6bn. That would be a welcome sign, but frankly the broad picture is that Britain is still struggling to rebalance its economy. There’s also been no sign, yet, that the weak pound is boosting exports. In August, the trade in goods deficit expanded to an alarming £14.2bn -- dwarfing Britain’s surplus in service. This goods deficit is expected to drop to £12.8bn in September - still a yawning gap in historical terms. In a flurry of data, the Office for National Statistics will also publish new UK industrial production figure. UK manufacturing output is expected to have grown by 0.3% in September, down from 0.4% in August. Then at lunchtime the National Institute of Economic and Social Research will estimate how fast the UK’s economy grew between August and October. We know that the UK grew by 0.4% in July to September, so these figures will show if growth slowed last month. Also coming up today... World stock markets seem a little edgy today after yesterday’s selloff. Some traders blame uncertainty over US tax ‘reform’ plans, amid complaints that the richest Americans will benefit the most. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains: President Donald Trump and corporate America may not be satisfied with the revised Senate Republican tax plan. The dollar and global equities received a hit on news that Republican senators are likely to delay the introduction of corporate tax cuts until 2019. The reaction in markets wasn’t a surprise, given that investors have been pricing in a lot of good news and further pullback may continue for a couple of days or weeks, as many stocks look overbought at the moment. The Senate wants to maintain the seven tax brackets, rather than the four proposed by the house. They also want to tax foreign profits held by offshore U.S. companies at a different rate. However, the timing of the corporate tax cuts will likely determine how markets move for the remainder of 2017. Meanwhile in London, Uber will discover whether its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are employees has been successful. And finally (as they say on the TV news), John Lewis are launching their Christmas advert, starring a large and cuddly creature named Moz who lives under the bed. A damning indictment of Britain’s housing crisis, no doubt, but can he match the success of Monty the Penguin?....

The Paradise Papers, with its trove of information on how companies shuffle money around the planet in order to reduce their tax liabilities, highlight just how warped the economic system has become. The system in which we operate is one where the impetus is always towards lowering taxation for companies, and which is partly justified on the basis that doing so will reduce the incentive for companies to engage in the kinds of tax minimisation practices revealed in the Paradise Papers. And thus we have a race to the bottom in order to make ourselves attractive to companies who will continue, regardless of our tax rate, to shuffle money around the globe so as to reduce their tax obligations. The race to the bottom was given some theoretical heft this week from a paper by three economists within the Treasury department which suggested that, were the US to cut its tax rate by the amount Donald Trump hopes – from 35% to 20% – then we would likely need to follow suit or face lower GDP growth and lower real wages. But, for a paper that focussed on the impact of the US tax policy, the reporting was rather curious. The Australian ran it on its front page as an exclusive and pushed the line that the research revealed “the full rollout of the Turnbull government’s company tax plan will deliver a $30bn revenue return to the federal budget.” This was a rather curious lead given the report did not actually provide any such new information. What it did was repeat a line from another widely reported Treasury research paper written in May last year : “the total revenue loss from the company tax cut that is recovered in the long run through second-round effects is estimated to be around 45 cents per dollar of net company tax cut with 8 cents accruing to sub-national governments and 37 cents to the federal government”. We’re in a pretty weird place where a line repeated from research written 18 months ago is now held up as new information deserving of a front-page headline. And we’re in an even more weird place when the suggestion that 37 cents of every dollar lost in revenue returning to the federal government is “effectively halving the claimed total cost of the policy.” Thirty seven percent of $65bn is just over $24bn, which is a bit short of the “$30bn boost for Turnbull’s tax reform plan” which the Australian chose as its front-page headline. The Treasury research suggested eight cents in the dollar would go to the states. It seems a bit of a stretch to claim that a potential $5bn in state revenue would reduce the cost to the federal government’s budget. It also says something about how warped the economic debate is in this country that the impact of policy which everyone agrees will cause revenue to fall is described as a “boost” because some research estimates net revenue will fall only $35bn, not $65bn. But the suggestion that this somehow means that the company tax cut will cost less than the previous estimate of $65.4bn – included in the Treasurer’s own statement made in parliament in May – is rather dopey. Firstly, the estimate of 45 cents in the dollar return has been known for a year and a half, and secondly, budget papers don’t include second-round impacts. You can’t say you will cut tax but then argue this will spur growth and thus the drop in revenue will not be as bad. The problem is such second-round impacts are based on a multitude of assumptions, any tweaks of which greatly change the outcomes. Budget numbers that worked like that would become meaningless very quickly as governments would see all sorts of theoretical benefits to accrue from their policies that would create magical revenue figures. At any rate, this new Treasury paper was not really about the cost of the plan, but more the impact of Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the company tax rate in the US from 35% to 20%. The paper suggests that if the US were to cut the company tax rate by that much, capital dollars would flow to the US from other nations (including Australia) and thus our GDP and wages would suffer as a result. There are a few problems with suggesting this is a reason to pass our own tax cuts. Firstly, it is hard enough to assume the economic impact of policy that might be implemented in Australia, let alone things that possibly will occur in the US. Given the corporate tax cut is not popular with US voters and unlikely to be feasible without massively increasing either the US deficit or taxes on individuals, it might be best to hold off on working out its impact until we see what legislation actually makes its way through Congress. And secondly, the whole suggestion that a company tax cut leads to greater investment and improved wages growth is something that always looks a lot better in the economic modelling than in reality. The UK, for example, has cut its company tax rate from 30% in 2007 to 19%, and yet real wages in the UK are lower now than they were in 2007. And while it is nice to believe that a lower rate will bring greater investment, the issue is always what kind of investment will be attracted by a lower rate. As the Reserve Bank assistant governor, Luci Ellis, explained to a parliamentary committee in February, we want to attract direct investment – i.e. companies setting up shop here – as that “builds new things, versus, say, purchasing of existing securities or purchasing of existing assets.” The Paradise Papers certainly show that companies and high-worth individuals like to purchase assets and securities in a manner to avoid paying tax, but it is less of an issue for direct investment, which instead looks at labour costs and skills, location of assets, infrastructure, incentives for research and development, and the whole regulatory system. We seem trapped in an debate in which, despite the benefits of an economy and political system which make us attractive to investors, it would appear as though all a country has going for it is its tax rate – a tax rate, which we have seen this week, is often avoided."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/10/fever-has-broken-says-hillary-clinton-after-democrat-election-wins","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T06:16:29Z","webTitle":"'Fever has broken,' says Hillary Clinton, after Democratic election wins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/10/fever-has-broken-says-hillary-clinton-after-democrat-election-wins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/10/fever-has-broken-says-hillary-clinton-after-democrat-election-wins","fields":{"headline":"'Fever has broken,' says Hillary Clinton, after Democratic election wins","bodyText":"Hillary Clinton has hailed Democratic victories in elections this week as proof that “the fever has broken” and the fightback against Donald Trump has begun. The defeated presidential candidate was speaking to nearly 2,500 people at Milwaukee’s Riverside Theater on Thursday, exactly a year after she delivered her concession speech to tearful supporters in New York. Praising an outpouring of activism and engagement in the resistance to Trump over the past 12 months, Clinton said: “And just this week we saw what a difference that can make because in elections across America – hope beat hate, right?” The audience erupted in cheers. Democrats swept to victory in governor, state legislative, county and mayors’ races across the country on Tuesday. Clinton claimed that voters sent a clear message: “The fever has broken. America’s not going to put up with the kind of political machinations that emanate from this administration and their allies in Congress. We’re going to chart a different course.” She cited the wins of Danica Roem, the first openly transgender person elected and seated in a state legislature, over a social conservative, and Chris Hurst, whose girlfriend was shot dead on live television, over a rival backed by the powerful National Rifle Association. “You know what? Despite the NRA’s best efforts, he won in Virginia.” Clinton continued: “So, this was a resounding affirmation of the values we share and, as of Tuesday night, we are one step closer to an America that is kinder, fairer, more equal, where we embrace the fact that our diversity is a strength not a weakness, where we keep striving for progress and for a more perfect union.” The 70-year-old praised a huge grassroots organisational effort that involved volunteers knocking on thousands of doors. “And none of that would have happened if people had got so discouraged that they decided to give up and leave politics to the dark forces that have been in the ascendancy over the last years in states like Wisconsin and now in Washington. “So we should celebrate those wins but we cannot let up for one minute because, as you know, right here in this state, there are some critically important elections on the horizon. The best way to show personal resilience is to get up and the best way to show political resilience is to win elections.” Critics might be tempted to say Clinton’s visit to Wisconsin was too little, too late. She infamously did not campaign here during the general election and became the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the state since 1984. Along with Michigan and Pennsylvania it proved decisive. She did not address the issue directly during a 65-minute conversation with actor Bradley Whitford, who hails from Wisconsin. But when she walked on stage to a standing ovation and deafening cheers and screams that lasted 78 seconds, her opening line got a laugh: “Well, I should have come back to Wisconsin sooner.” Clinton added: “I couldn’t think of any place I’d rather be than right here to start the year after the year I just had. This year’s been kind of hard, for obvious reasons. It’s not an anniversary I’ve been looking forward to, but it felt really good on Tuesday. It bodes well if we all stay focused for what’s ahead of us and there’s nowhere I’d rather be than here with all of you.” In her book she suggests that voter suppression in Wisconsin – which some experts say wiped out tens of thousands of votes – was more significant than her failure to hold rallies. On Thursday she described it as a civil rights issue and said: “There is no better example of an attempt to rig an election than the massive voter suppression we experienced here in Milwaukee … Wisconsites who desperately wanted to vote were turned away at the polls despite having all kinds of identification.” The former secretary of state also attacked Trump for handing China the initiative in renewable energy and for stating, during his visit to Beijing, that he gives China “great credit” for taking advantage of the US on trade. “That is not the right answer.” She predicted that the Chinese president would run rings around Trump. “I know Xi Jinping,” she said. “I know Xi Jinping is sitting there thinking, ‘Man, this is going to be easier than I thought.’” In contrast to her sombre tone at the New Yorker hotel a year ago, Clinton bantered with Whitford, best known for playing White House deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman in The West Wing and a Barack Obama supporter with a dark secret in the horror comedy Get Out. “I have no idea what he’s going to say or what he’s going to ask,” she said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be West Wing or Get Out.” Whitford gushed over his interviewee – “I just want to say I love you” – offered a Bill Clinton impression unlikely to trouble Tim Watters and failed to question her over former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile’s explosive new book. But the actor did deliver some memorable lines about Trump including “You’re running against a guy whose language is the verbal equivalent of a chimpanzee” and “It’s like having a pilot who’s never flown a plane before – and thinks planes are stupid.” And watching the press deal with Trump is, Whitford said, “like a bunch of professors giving an oral exam to a professional wrestler”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/nov/12/australia-v-england-womens-ashes-test-match-day-four-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-12T10:17:44Z","webTitle":"England keep Women's Ashes series alive with draw in only Test – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/nov/12/australia-v-england-womens-ashes-test-match-day-four-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/nov/12/australia-v-england-womens-ashes-test-match-day-four-live","fields":{"headline":"England keep Women's Ashes series alive with draw in only Test – as it happened","bodyText":"So ends four days of absorbing moments that has, ultimately, proved fruitless for the series.

Ric Finlay breaks down the numbers: Heather Knight says the hardest thing she had to do in her first Test as captain was watch Ellyse Perry bat. “We probably weren’t happy [with their first innings total of 280]. A lot of our top-order got starts but didn’t go on.” On her own form, Knight’s pretty happy: “I’m enjoying batting at the moment. O’m hitting them well. I’ve really enjoyed the challenge of the pink ball under lights.” “We’ve got a massive battle on our hands now, having to win every match.” 105th over: England 206-2 (Knight 79, Elwiss 41) – lead by 38 runs Just before this over, Rachel Haynes is in discussion with the umpires, perhaps asking about pulling out early. Heather Knight and Georgia Elwiss wait, mid-pitch, watching on. Jonassen continues to Elwiss. With a ball to go, Jonassen walks to deep mid off to meet her captain and kill some time.

It’s off-spin, but the sort of off-spin every Tonya, Di and Sally can bowl. Knight gets on strike and thumps one through cover for her 11th boundary. 103rd over: England 201-2 (Knight 75, Elwiss 40) Here we go... a couple of fours for Knight takes her to 75, as Jonassen over-pitches. The England captain might be the only one who wants to stay out there with that hundred in the offing... 102nd over: England 193-2 (Knight 67, Elwiss 40) – lead by 25 runs Wellington continues from around the wicket and Knight nails a sweep straight at midwicket. Frustrated, she dabs the next ball straight to backward point and charges off. Georgia Elwiss, gloves in her left hand, is not ready and ends up putting in a dive to make her ground. Replays show the bails being removed with just a smidge of bat over the line. A frame in it, but Not Out... 101st over: England 190-2 (Knight 66, Elwiss 40) – lead by 22 runs Good shot from Elwiss, who pushes back off her front foot and lashes a cut through backward point. The outfield ensures it’s pulled up for just two, so Elwiss punches through cover to get another couple. 100th over: England 186-2 (Knight 66, Elwiss 36) – lead by 18 runs Total attendance over the Test has been 12,674. That’s great stuff, though they – the fans and the players – have deserved a better pitch considering the skill and atmoshpere in the last four days. 99th over: England 185-2 (Knight 66, Elwiss 35) – lead by 17 runs Just a bye. 98th over: England 184-2 (Knight 66, Elwiss 35) – lead by 16 runs Turn from the rough outside of leg stump that Wellington is using well, it has to be said. LBW taken out of the equation of course, even if Wellington’s still appealing, but she almost draws a leading edge as Knight lazily tries to work something into the leg side. 97th over: England 184-2 Knight 66, Elwiss 35) – lead by 16 runs Knight pulling out the trickshots. An under-edge grazes off stump, nutmegs Alyssa Healy and runs away for a single to nick the strike. Can’t teach that... 96th over: England 182-2 (Knight 34, Knight 65) – 14 runs Change of approach from Wellington – over the wicket, now, to the right-handers. The kind of variation that would have excited a few hours ago but is now just something to cross off amid the tedium. 95th over: England 182-2 (Knight 65, Elwiss 34) Nicely done by Knight, who steps across and gets in line with Jonassen’s arm ball to lap it around the corner for a single. Keeps the strike. 94th over: England 180-2 (Knight 64, Elwiss 33) England’s running between the wickets really hasn’t been great this Test. In another match, there’d have been a few dreadful run outs. Knight and Elwiss lose their voices and end up having to call with their feet after the latter punches out to cover. 93rd over: England 178-2 (Knight 63, Elwiss 32) – lead by 10 runs Somehow, Elwiss has edged a full toss through the legs of Healy and just over the helmet behind the Australian wicketkeeper. Not great cricket, all told. Oh and forget Heather Knight Century Watch – all in on this: 92nd over: England 174-2 (Knight 63, Elwiss 28) – lead by 6 runs Knight cashing in as Wellington floats one up outside off stump and the England skipper plants her front foot and punches the ball through extra cover. England have a lead... but also nearly lose Knight as she edges wide of first slip. 91st over: England 168-2 (Knight 57, Elwiss 28) Think we’re basically on Heather Knight century watch now. The commentators are discussing how best to make Yorshire puddings. Unsurprisingly, Charlotte Edwards knows what she’s doing. 90th over: England 168-2 (Knight 57, Elwiss) Knight bunts through midwicket and is only robbed of a boundary by the chase of her opposite number. Australia captain Rachel Haynes keeping it to two. Nevermind – Knight gets a wide delivery and plays it through point for four. And with that... the defecit is no more! Now, about that leave: 89th over: England 162-2 (Knight 51, Elwiss 28) Wow wow wow – how close was that?! Good leave, technically, but Georgia Elwiss needed every drop of fortunte there as she leaves a ball from Jonassen which gives off stump a peck on the cheek. 88th over: England 162-2 (Knight 51, Elwiss 28) A sweep around the corner for four and then a couple to square leg take Heather Knight to 51 from 163 deliveries. Amanda-Jade Wellington’s the bowler. Aside from that *speccy* to remove Tammy Beaumont, we’ve not see much else... 87th over: England 156-2 (Knight 45, Elwiss 28) – trail by 12 runs A bit of turn but more or less a regulation six as the sands of time pass. Elwiss threatens to open this game up as she nearly edges behind. Then she bunts a full toss through cover for four. The players are making their way back out to the middle. Australia look like they’ve had too much sugar. Heather Knight and Georgia Elwiss take their time. Jess Jonassen gets us underway... Something to keep an eye on... 86th over: England 152-2 (Knight 45, Elwiss 24) Here we go – last over before the 40-minute break and Ellyse Perry is coming around the wicket to Heather Knight. The first ball is whipped away to deep square leg, where the fielder stationed in that region means Elwiss is back on strike. Sways again to avoid a couple and then punches a single to cover to allow Knight to face the last ball of the session... which is defended into the off side. And off we go. A wicketless middle session sees Australia drag themselves off with a wry smile or two. Knight and Elwiss look pleased as punch. Back soon... 85th over: England 149-2 (Knight 44, Elwiss 23) – trail by 19 runs A short ball from Schutt this time. She’s not got as much behind her as Perry, so not only does Elwiss not need to hurry on the pull shot, but she can also readjust, checking the shot so that it grounds a couple of feet in front of that catching midwicket. 84th over: England 149-2 (Knight 44, Elwiss 23) – trail by 19 runs Better from Perry! A snorter to Elwiss, who sways out of the way, dropping the hands in the process. Well played. Can’t say the same for the last ball of the over... Elwiss gets another short ball and just helps it around the corner. However, the fielder at fine leg can only get to it on the bounce. Single taken. 83rd over: England 148-2 (Knight 44, Elwiss 22) – trail by 20 runs Catching midwicket now for Schutt – Haynes – who dives to her left to stop Knight pilfering more runs. They may as well shake hands here and now. 82nd over: England 148-2 (Knight 44, Elwiss 22) – trail by 20 runs Perry starts full with her first ball and Knight punches her through cover for a couple. Three balls later, she drops-and-runs into the same region. Easy pickings. With Elwiss on strike, Perry digs in a bouncer that’s pretty decent in terms of height, but innocuous as it holds its line outside off-stump. 81st over: England 145-2 (Knight 41, Elwiss 22) – trail by 23 runs Oooooo how’s that one?! First delivery with the second new ball, Megan Schutt gets it to hoop big and strike Knight on the front pad. Luckily for her and England, it’s done too much. A single gives Elwiss the last few and Schutt gives her a bit of a working over, with two balls that jag in off the surface, too. Only one slip though. No harm in chucking in a bat-pad or catching cover, surely?? 80th over: England 144-2 (Knight 40, Elwiss 21) – trail by 24 runs Forward press, thick inside edge behind square leg and Elwiss has her first run in yonks. Penultimate ball of that Wellington over, Knight sweeps around the corner for a single that moves her to 40. And in line to face the new ball, which will be taken... 79th over: England 142-2 (Knight 39, Elwiss 21) – trail by 26 runs “I like the plan from Elyse Villani,” muses former Southern Star Mel Jones on commentary. “Just lulling England into a false sense of security,” she finishes, tongue firmly in cheek, as Knight cuts loose through cover point for her third boundary in as many overs. 78th over: England 138-2 (Knight 35, Elwiss 21) – trail by 30 runs The ball’s back in Wellington’s hands, at least for the next couple of overs before the new pink pill. Another maiden played out by Elwiss. 77th over: England 138-2 (Knight 35, Elwiss 21) – trail by 30 runs Heather Knight’s not going to look a part-time bowler in the mouth: another wide delivery from Haynes and the England captain rocks back and cuts behind point this time for another boundary. 76th over: England 134-2 (Knight 31, Elwiss 21) – trail by 34 runs Elwiss reaches her Cowan (100 balls) for 21, as Tahlia McGrath forces her into a play and miss outside off stump. Shame that this pitch is taking the spoils. A harder surface would have really spiced this up. It also would have destroyed the pink ball after 20 overs. 75th over: England 134-2 (Knight 31, Elwiss 21) – trail by 34 runs Oi oi – Rachel Haynes into the attack. The stand-in commander-in-chief brings herself on for some left-arm wobble around the wicket. We’re skipper-to-skipper here, a la Vaughan v Ponting in 2005: Knight wins this round, though, as Haynes drops short and Knight pops her through cover pont for four. 74th over: England 130-2 (Knight 27, Elwiss 21) – trail by 38 Pace on the ball now as Tahlia McGrath comes on. Alyssa Healy stays up to the stumps and is doing her best to lift her 10 other mates in the field. Elwiss again plays out a maiden but only because of some good fielding at backward point. 73rd over: England 130-2 (Knight 27, Elwiss 21) – trail by 38 The kids in the crowd are turning on each other, using the Cricket Australia “boing sticks” to slap each other around the head. Anarchy rules in North Sydney. A couple of runs taken off that Wellington over. Trying to think of other ways we can settle this particular Test, even if a draw keeps the series alive into the T20 leg. Give this from 2015 another go? 72nd over: England 128-2 (Knight 25, Elwiss 21) Elwiss fancies some runs and a red inker. More power to her. Great opportuity for her to put on a decent score. Jonassen’s left-arm twirlers are driven classily but straight to fielders, though, so somehow that’s a maiden. What a tidbit this is, by the way, regarding that Elwiss boundary in the previous over... 71st over: England 128-2 (Knight 25, Elwiss 21) G’day, OBO-ers. Pleasure to be with you for the last session-and-a-half of this Test match. Amanda-Jade Wellington continuing but losing her line, understandably, in her 25th over. A couple of sweeps don’t do much damage, but a full ball outside off is driven classily by Georgia Elwiss for four through cover. The new ball is now eight overs away. Unless it’s stuffed full of candy, it’s unlikely to bring Australia much joy this evening... 70th over: England 122-2 (Elwiss 16, Knight 24) Ten overs until the new ball is due. Jonassen over the wicket to Knight. Has a ring field and only slip catching. All a bit drab. “She looks like she could still be here batting on Thursday,” Mel Jones says on the radio. Not wrong. She’s up to 117 balls now, adding one to her total with another well-struck sweep. Elwiss plays out the rest. They’ve earned their drink. Only 28 runs in the hour, but the England pair couldn’t care less about that. They are doing a job and doing it well. And with that, I’m out of here. Thanks for your company on the OBO this weekend. Over to Vish in London who steer it through to the end. Bye! 69th over: England 121-2 (Elwiss 16, Knight 23) Wello to Knighter. Once again takes a single early in the over to the gap at midwicket. Elwiss makes her own excitement, taking a relatively quick single to point. Knight makes it three for the over (wow!) with one to cover. One more over to drinks. 68th over: England 118-2 (Elwiss 15, Knight 21) The Bolton Experiment is over. Sad. Jonassen back instead. Knight clips into midwicket with nice timing, collecting a single. Elwiss sees it out. So that gets the deficit to an even 50. Let’s call that the #auspol equivalent of a budget deficit 1% of GDP - i.e. under control and nothing much to worry about. Right? Sorry. 67th over: England 117-2 (Elwiss 15, Knight 20) Oh there it is. Wellington gets one to talk at Elwiss. Serious bounce and turn, so much so that it evades Healy’s gloves. Maiden, that. 66th over: England 117-2 (Elwiss 15, Knight 20) Bolton clocks a maiden. Suggesting that Knight has reached the point where she doesn’t care what is coming down at her, she will be defending. Understandably. The deficit is 51. Very managable. 65th over: England 117-2 (Elwiss 15, Knight 20) Mel Jones raises an interesting point. Get Villani on, because no England player would dare want to get out to her very grotty medium pace. I like it. Get her on. Better now than, you know, in a World Cup semi-final. The last time she was asked to have a trundle. Wellington drops short early and Elwiss takes one, Knight gets a single to the same sweeper (why is there a sweeper?) off the front foot to finish it off. She’s made it to 20 from 100 balls. The second number more important than the first. 64th over: England 115-2 (Elwiss 14, Knight 19) Well, there it is. Knight takes a single down the ground, no concerns there. But Bolton beats the bat of Elwiss! Done by a distinct lack of turn there, I fancy. 45 minutes into the session. That clock pressure will start influencing Haynes soon enough. 63rd over: England 113-2 (Elwiss 13, Knight 18) It’s drifting. Knight has faced 94 balls and Elwiss 59. They are both very much in. That’s 65 for the latter by the time she sees off another Wellington maiden without any real trouble. Has to play throughout, but that seems to be working for her. 62nd over: England 113-2 (Elwiss 13, Knight 18) Elwiss gets off strike first ball, leaving the captain to deal with Bolton. She does so without temptation. Another song, then? 61st over: England 112-2 (Elwiss 12, Knight 18) Wellington to Elwiss, who has faced 53 balls now. Her scoring area, tucks into midwicket, is found again for one about half way through the over. Short leg is no longer in play for Knight. Why is that, then? She nearly finds the other fielder under the lid though, silly point in the game. A song to break things up? I have a reference point: 60th over: England 111-2 (Elwiss 11, Knight 18) It is Bolton! They must be listening! I like this. She bowls inoffensive off-spin, but it seems to work. Took more than a handful in the WBBL last year and claimed a couple of World Cup wickets against India (from memory) back in July. Loved it to, wheeling around like she had won the 100m at the Olympics. Knight cuts a shot one to point for one. There’s a full toss in there not capitalised on. Elwiss keeps the strike with a push to the legside. The over has It has Got Things Happening though, so that isn’t for nothing. 59th over: England 109-2 (Elwiss 10, Knight 17) The conversation continues on the radio about how Haynes might change it up. The consensus is that they should set-and-forget with Wellington from the Fig Tree End before some blue-sky thinking from the City End. Villani? Bolton? Haynes? Cases can be made for each. For now, Wellington isn’t posing as many problems as she has in previous overs, Elwiss into double figures with a tuck then Knight sweeping as she does so well to take another. The deficit narrows to 59. 58th over: England 107-2 (Elwiss 9, Knight 16) Perry does go at it again from the City End. Knight is looking better by the ball. Lisa Sthalekar is backing in some funky fields, but also some unorthodox bowling changes. Rachael Haynes is her choice, with some cheeky left-arm mediums. “Because England might just switch off when it isn’t a Wellington or a Schutt,” Charles Dagnall adds. They are right in saying that there have been quite a few wickets in this Test from poor deliveries. Perry does get one to jag back at Knight with the fourth ball of this set, but the inside edge spills safely into the legside. She’s back outside the off-stump to finish off, Knight happy to leave alone. Maiden. 57th over: England 107-2 (Elwiss 9, Knight 16) A rare full toss from Wellington, but Elwiss slaps it back to the bowler rather than over the fence. She’s more comfortable, it seems, when the leggie is on the mark, defending with the pad well forward. She had a crack at a full-blooded sweep, but doesn’t make good contact. Indeed, had deep backward square been at more a catching 45, it would have been out. Not sure why they have two out for Wellington at this stage. Lead is still 61, but runs aren’t really that important, are they? It’ll take until deep into the session until they overtake Australia. As it happens, they agree with me on the radio, having the same discussion as I tap this post out. 56th over: England 105-2 (Elwiss 7, Knight 16) Another Perry no-ball. That’s her fourth of the day. Don’t see them that often in the modern game. Knight very solid here. Really hitting those drives hard. Not sure if they will stick with Perry here. McGrath and Schutt both more effective before tea as they generate more natural variation through the air. Even with the old ball, it seemed. 55th over: England 104-2 (Elwiss 7, Knight 16) Wellington generates a whole lot of overspin. It’s part of her charm, getting that natural dip that can so easily do players on length. That she then turns it a a foot or more is cream on the cake. In that first WBBL a couple of summers ago she bowled Meg Lanning around her legs first ball on a game that had no TV or live stream. One of the moments of that tournament (that we got very excited about at the ground) that must have played a hand in making sure every game had a camera on it in season two. True to form, a beautiful delivery to end the probing over, beating Elwiss’ outstretched bat. Had to play with it pitching on about middle stump. Top shelf. 54th over: England 102-2 (Elwiss 6, Knight 15) I must admit, I missed the ball where Knight picked up a single to move England to 100, but I’m sure she got to the other end and a run was recorded. So there we have it, another little milestone. Another front foot no-ball - Perry’s third today - then a single from Elwiss around the corner makes three from the over. Positvely blistering! 53rd over: England 99-2 (Elwiss 5, Knight 14) Knight’s first run for the session comes, sweeping Wellington. Plays that shot expertly. Elwiss looking the part early on here. Very content with the dead bat. What they need. I don’t like code war stuff, but I would note here that more people watched the Women’s ODI the week before last (500k) than popped on the Socceroos yesterday morning. How many would have chucked it on last night when Perry was nearing 200? We’ll never know. 52nd over: England 98-2 (Elwiss 5, Knight 13) Perry has swung around to the City End this time around, with Wellington bowling the last over from the Fig Tree End before the breather. Steady as she goes to begin. Oooh, until the last ball - that’s a very good slower one coming back at the no. 4, leaving it to just pass by the off-stump. Players are back. Some instructive shots on TV before they return of the ball. It is 51 overs old and looks pretty much cooked. 29 overs until they get a new one. So it’ll be the old-school women’s cricket spin to win if Australia are to make a big mark in this middle session. Perry has the first one though. Bowling to Elwiss. A result that both teams probably would have taken to begin the day. England have got through the opening two hours losing two wickets and adding 55 runs, leaving them 70 in the black. Beaumont and Winfield nearly got through the first hour unscathed, but that was until Wellington stamped her influence on this final day with a genius piece of leg-spin bowling. It’s a replay that won’t get old any time soon, hitting the England opener’s middle stump after pitching outside leg stump. Delicious. Winfield was ticking along solidly, but was the second to fall when McGrath came into the attack and slipped a yorker onto her toe on the full, making the leg before decision a formality. The captain Knight was joined by Elwiss, the two getting through the last half-hour slowly but solidly. No concerns there so far. Righto. Time for a sandwich. Back in 15. 51st over: England 98-2 (Knight 13, Elwiss 5) Wellington versus Knight for the final leg of this session. It’s going as planned to begin - probing length, committed defence, But the leggie misses her line and the England captain plays her most effective shot, the sweep. She hits it hard to the sweeper McGrath but it is misfielded and goes for four! Looked like she was trying to take it just as sun morphed into shade. I’m sure that will be her reasoning. And that is tea! 50th over: England 94-2 (Knight 9, Elwiss 5) Fantastic from Australia, doing exactly as I guessed and rushing through a Jonassen maiden in no more than 90 seconds. Elwiss had to defend as well, meaning the ball got back quickly. So Wellington once more it will be. Again: very good cricket. 49th over: England 94-2 (Knight 9, Elwiss 5) Yes, Wellington does get another jam roll before the interval. It’ll only be one, as they will break in five minutes. From the other end to where she operated earlier. Has a slip, silly point and short leg, rolling to Elwiss over the wicket. Oh, close leave near off-stump to begin. The bowler likes it too, though. Has a decent wrong’un in her kit bag - will we see that? Nup, a full toss. Elwiss then reaches wide when she probably should have left again, but gets off strike. Knight’s turn, fielders again around the bat. But she has the composure to pat the last couple down. Can Jonassen get though a 90 second over to get Wellington another before the break? The England pair taking their time between overs to do what they can to prevent that. That’s good cricket as well. 48th over: England 93-2 (Knight 9, Elwiss 4) Knight has Jonassen’s measure here. She’s drawing her forward from around the wicket, but the England captain is very solid. Another over, another maiden. She has three of those in this five over spell from the City End. Four of the last six overs in the game have been maidens as well. 47th over: England 93-2 (Knight 9, Elwiss 4) Better from Elwiss to begin, pushing McGrath for a couple. Getting a nice stride in when defending as well. Felt for Elwiss as England celebrated that World Cup win. Didn’t do a lot wrong when Mark Robinson took over as coach, moving her to no. 3 in the process. She was essentially sqeezed out of the starting XI by Fran Wilson, who hadn’t played in about six years at that stage. And never got back. But has her chance now to play an influential hand in a very important day of cricket in the context of this series. Remember, if England lose today the trophy remains in Australia regardless of what happens in the T20s. 46th over: England 91-2 (Knight 9, Elwiss 2) Took Jonassen a couple of overs to find her length, but she has done so now. Knight is up to the task defending then driving, but unable to pick a gap. Reckon we might get another blast from Wellington before lunch, actually. Can’t hurt. 45th over: England 91-2 (Knight 9, Elwiss 2) McGrath running away from us here in the Molly Dive Stand. She’s yet to miss her length across three overs. She wins Elwiss’ outside edge too, but along the ground. Two runs down to a vacant third man gets her off the mark. Then beats her with a slower ball! Very, very impressive cricketer, Tahlia McGrath. Expect her to get the ball quite a lot over the next few hours. 44th over: England 89-2 (Knight 9, Elwiss 0) Knight picks cover time and again, then get her head well over the ball in defence. No runs from it, but six more balls absorbed. Good batting from the England captain. 43rd over: England 89-2 (Knight 9, Elwiss 0) Wicket maiden complete, giving Georgia Elwiss no chance to get off the mark with five more excellent dots. Fantastic bowling. Elwiss was brought back into the England XI after a year in exile to bolster the batting. Did well to face 100-odd balls in the first dig. Would the visitors would give for a similar stay at the crease from her today. Oh yes, that is very out! McGrath yorks her, getting it on the toe. No question about where that was heading. Her debut gets better and better. Winfield was looking excellent in the first hour but slowed down a bit since she lost Beaumont. England trail by 79 runs. 42nd over: England 89-1 (Winfield 34, Knight 9) Jonassen versus Knight. And the latter gets the better of it, sweeping with power down to the rope. That’s their shot, England making four times the amount of runs from the sweep shot than any other country in ODIs in 2017. 41st over: England 85-1 (Winfield 34, Knight 5) Schutt’s tidy spell is complete, Tahlia McGrath given a chance from the Moreton Fig Tree End. The 22-year-old all rounder has had an excellent Test debut, grabbing a couple of first innings wickets then putting on 103 with Perry yesterday before giving it away three runs short of a half-century. A single to Knight but nothing further. Tidy. 40th over: England 84-1 (Winfield 34, Knight 4) Righto, Haynes has changed it up from the City End, replacing the wicket taker Wellington with spin of another kind, Jonassen’s left arm orthodox. And she beats Knight first ball! Excellent drift from around the wicket. The England skipper gets off strike with a sweep when the finger spinner misses her line. Then when missing her length, Winfield cashes in for a rare boundary! It was a long hop, but the England opener got into position with purpose and flogged it through midwicket from deep in the crease. Certainly one way to transfer pressure back onto Australia is getting this to a stage where they have to bat a second time. 84 runs away from that. 39th over: England 79-1 (Winfield 30, Knight 3) Another big shout for LBW, but Winfield is saved by the considerable swing that Schutt gets into the right hander. The replay confirms it is doing plenty, but that’ll encourage the hosts as it is still hooping around from her end. She’s right on middle stump to finish the over, knocked on the head by the opener off the back foot. England trail by 89. 38th over: England 79-1 (Winfield 30, Knight 3) Winfield into the 30s hitting the sweeper at cover when Wellington overpitches. Nothing else to see here. Australia need to find another way through. 37th over: England 78-1 (Winfield 29, Knight 3) Charlotte Edwards is pitching up Elyse Villani for a bowl to mix up England’s thinking. Very tongue in cheek, even though it was the Perth Scorchers player who had to deliver the 50th over in the World Cup match between these two teams in July. Fair to say that didn’t go so well. It is Schutt for now. She is getting enough natural movement with her action into the right handers. Knight uses that movement to take a couple out to straight midwicket. No further runs. The deficit is 90. 36th over: England 76-1 (Winfield 29, Knight 1) Wellington is throwing it up from over the wicket this time around at Winfield. Still has the cover out. But silly point in. Maiden, both sticking to their very clear plans. Seven runs in seven overs since England lost their wicket, Ric Finlay reports on the ABC. 35th over: England 76-1 (Winfield 29, Knight 1) Knight off the mark for real this time, with a single off Schutt out to midwicket. “If this situation is built for anyone in the England team it is Heather Knight,” says Charles Dagnall on the radio. Winfield now. Who is hit on the pad! Big shout turned down. Rightly so - it is going well down the legside. She strays down that way again and the opener gets a single to fine leg to ensure she’ll be up against Wellington again next over. 34rd over: England 74-1 (Winfield 28, Knight 0) I like this a lot, Wellington now around the wicket to Winfield. Leg slip introduced. “I don’t know why they have a deep cover,” Charlotte Edwards says on the radio. The opener is forward, good footwork to score down the ground for a couple. Silly point also in for the last ball, with Wellington back over the wicket. She leaves. Also, note that I’m adjusting Knight’s score back to zero. Her alleged run was actually a leg bye, with the various scoreboards now updated. 33rd over: England 72-1 (Winfield 26, Knight 1) Last over before drinks and it is Schutt to Knight. There’s a pattern emerging from this end already with the Australian seamer, dropping it on a length with the England captain happy to get her eye in pushing into the field. So that is the first hour done. England have added 32. More importantly, they nearly got through without loss, until Wellington’s piece of magic. Another couple before lunch and it’ll be game on big time. On the other hand, if Winfield - who is going very well - can combine with Knight for the next hour, England will be well on the way to sharing the honours. 32nd over: England 72-1 (Winfield 26, Knight 1) Catchers around the England captain at short leg, silly point and slip. The intensity up several notches immediately with that Wellington wicket, the second time in the match she picked up Beaumont with a ripper in this match. It gets better with every replay. Take a Captain Cook for yourself. Adam Gilchrist compared her to Shane Warne when watching her run amok on telly as an 18 year old in the WBBL a couple of summers ago. Geoff Lemon and I were calling that game for White Line Wireless and made similar bold calls. Vindicated when she does stuff like this. And that’s all the time. WHAT A BALL! Wellington has pitched outside leg-stump with ample drift before ripping it past the outside edge and clipping off-stump. Oh, that is perfection from the 20-year-old. Not much Beaumont could do about that. The stuff dreams are made off for leg spinners. It has taken the better part of an hour, but the Australians are away on this fourth and final day. “An absolute peach!” Mel Jones says on the radio. Too right. Magnificent. 31st over: England 71-0 (Winfield 26, Beaumont 37) A rare boundary, Lauren Winfield waiting on that drive from Schutt that does enough to trickle away to the rope behind point. Schutt is back on her very full length to end the over, Winfield playing and missing. Lucky not to hit off-stump. England’s deficit is now under 100. Small milestone, but not for nothing. 30th over: England 66-0 (Winfield 22, Beaumont 37) Winfield sweeps another. A couple of sundries when Wellington gets through Beaumont off a length. More of that required. Looks up for this, the young leggie. 29th over: England 63-0 (Winfield 21, Beaumont 37) Shooooter. Megan Schutt it is to replace Perry. But Beaumont is a fan of that, cutting to the gap she missed in the previous over, smashing into the advertising boards in front of the Doug Walters Hill. A real loosener that. “You cannot fault England so far today,” says Mel Jones on the radio now. “I’ve been really impressed by their running between wicket.” She maintains quite a wide line thereafter to the England opener, Beaumont very happy to watch into the gloves of Healy. Given how accurate Schutt is, I expect that’s intentional. OBO regular Andrew Benton poses a question to me on the email (you can too, dont’t you know?): “What can the England men’s team learn from the England women’s team?” One thing all teams can learn is that they are fiercely positive about improvement. Mark Robinson and Ali Maiden have fostered a brilliant culture under the captaincy of Heather Knight. With most of the centrally contracted players living in Loughborough, they also seem to legitimately like each other. Can’t hurt. Any other thoughts on the cricket side? What are they doing that the England men could replicate this Ashes summer? 28th over: England 59-0 (Winfield 21, Beaumont 33) So close! Wellington gets the topspinner to fizz at Winfield, but she gets the bat down just in time. Next up, with a fraction more time, she gets off strike turning into the gap at midwicket. It is a massive gap two, only short-leg between mid on and long leg on that side of the wicket. Beaumont misses out on a long hop later in the over, cutting it straight to point. Keeps the strike with a conventional sweep to end the set. A lot more going on from Wellington’s City end so far today, that’s for sure. 27th over: England 57-0 (Winfield 20, Beaumont 32) A fifth for Perry now. Must be very close to spent. “Australia haven’t hit the right length,” says Lisa Sthalekar no TMS as Winfield pushes a full toss into the covers to move into the 20s. Perry back in the blockhole to finish, Beaumont digging it out with timing but wonderfully stopped by the bowler in her follow through. Fantastic cricket. 26th over: England 56-0 (Winfield 19, Beaumont 32) Quickish single towards midwicket requiring Winfield to scamper, but she’s back. Beaumont takes another to midwicket It prompts a field change, Elyse Villani coming in under the lid at silly point. So there are three around the bat, alongside a short leg and slip. Nice bowling from Wellington, winning Beaumont’s edge with flight. But no gully in there. Looks the bowler more likely of the two currently in operation. 25th over: England 53-0 (Winfield 17, Beaumont 31) Perry’s fourth over of the spell. She isn’t doing a lot wrong here at all, but Beaumont far too disciplined to do anything other than drive length deliveries into the ring along the ground. No risks here. Maiden. 24th over: England 53-0 (Winfield 17, Beaumont 31) Winfield keeps it ticking over, flicking Wellington through midwicket for a couple early in the over. Not a lot going on out there at the moment. “You could play a timeless Test on this pitch and it wouldn’t start going along the ground until day 18,” quips Jim Maxwell on TMS. Correctly. “It is very hard to make something happen on a surface like this. You are relying on a mistake from the batsman. It would be lucky to bounce above bail height if you banged it in short.” 23rd over: England 51-0 (Winfield 15, Beaumont 31) Perry again. Operating with a catching cover, Alex Blackwell, who has the helmet on despite standing about 15 metres from the bat. A bit like when Joe Root used to pop it on at shortish third slip. First proper slower one we’ve seen from the seamer today, dropping an off-cutter to Winfield. She gets down the other end with a push through cover, retaining the strike. That’ll work nicely. I heard this exchange on TMS as well. To echo Daggers, let’s hope Charlotte has been misinformed. It would be a very bad decision to use this track again for the T20 on Friday. 22nd over: England 50-0 (Winfield 14, Beaumont 31) Wellington might not get that much assistance from the final day pitch, but she sure is giving it a chance to turn by throwing it up well above the eyeline. Singles to each - Beaumont sweeping, Winfield driving - brings up England’s 50. The solid start they desparately needed. 21st over: England 48-0 (Winfield 13, Beaumont 30) A second no-ball for Perry. Not overly potent as yet. Must be spent after her work yesterday. Winfield is picking out cover time and again, but hitting the ball well. Top scored in the opening ODI but hasn’t made a run since. But I’ll back her in here. 20th over: England 46-0 (Winfield 13, Beaumont 28) Only one over from Jonassen, Amanda Wellington getting the third over of the morning. I mean, afternoon. “I think the rough marks are too wide for any great grip or purchase and they are not that deep,” says Charles Dagnall on the TMS call. Three singles to start her day, all to cover, Beaumont twice and Winfield once. Good start here from the visitors. No real zip out there yet. 19th over: England 43-0 (Winfield 12, Beaumont 27) Perry to open up from the Moreton Fig Tree End. We’re very lucky with our press box position here at North Sydney, just to the right of that peaceful landmark. We also have a balcony, which feels a bit like Buckingham Palace. At least in my head. Perry delivers a massive no-ball second up, overstepping by at least three inches. After her heroics over the last few days, we’ll give her that. She blasted through England on the final day of the Ashes Test in 2015 in similar circumstances to this, claiming nine wickets in that match. Winfield up to the task. A reminder what Perry did on the final day of the Ashes Test in 2015, running through England with 6-for-32 to bowl them out for 101. 18th over: England 41-0 (Winfield 12, Beaumont 26) First ball earns a bit of an ooh and an ahh when Jonassen pushes through her quicker one, but Beaumont is down in time. She gets away with the second ball, paddling fine. Expect to see plenty of that from her today if she plays a long hand. Winfield forward in defence for the rest. And we’re away! The Australians racing out ahead of the England openers, who are going at a more leisurely place. No hurry for them, or any of their colleagues, out there today. 100 overs. Count them down. Jonassen to bowl the first over. PLAY! “What are you two talking about?” “Football.” Team England bloody love having a kick. Any old time. In warm ups, at every interval, even after stumps a couple of them had the ball out last night. World Cup champions, support staff, they’re all into it. Good energy. Before play today that extended to a pair who were intergral in winning the World Cup on this very ground in 2009, Charlotte Edwards and Isa Guha. During this Test they have been running between the TV and radio commentary boxes for the entire day - hard yakka, make no mistake. But had time to show off their other skills first. And a fourth glorious Sydney day to match. One where England will need to dig deep if they are to survive 100 overs and keep the series alive. They resume with 128 runs to find in order to get back in the black after Ellyse Perry completed an unbeaten double hundred that turned this match on its head. Ten brisk wickets today, and they will hold the Women’s Ashes aloft at this beautiful ground. No further incentive required. The good news for England is that Tammy Beaumont and Lauren Winfield both reached the close last night, knocking off 40 of those runs without losing a wicket. If the theme of the match continues, it will be a lot easier to bat today than it was then. And the track doesn’t look like its about to start turning square any time soon either. Adam Collins with you here at North Sydney Oval steering the OBO for the first half of the day before I slap hands with Vish when he wakes up in London. You know the drill, let’s talk throughout on the email or the tweet or anywhere else you can hunt me down. England emerged from a lengthy huddle before breaking into warm-ups just before. Their task is a simple one: bat all day. Resilience, they say, underpinned their World Cup triumph in July. This presents another ideal opportunity to show what they’re made of. Adam will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s a quick look at the state of play in this series:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/nov/11/australia-v-england-womens-ashes-test-match-day-three-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T11:00:56Z","webTitle":"Ellyse Perry scores 213 for Australia on day three of Women's Ashes Test match – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/nov/11/australia-v-england-womens-ashes-test-match-day-three-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/nov/11/australia-v-england-womens-ashes-test-match-day-three-live","fields":{"headline":"Ellyse Perry scores 213 for Australia on day three of Women's Ashes Test match – as it happened","bodyText":"Right, that’s all from us here. England return tomorrow having chipped that first-innings lead down to 128, with Tammy Beaumont set and Lauren Winfield steady. Perry’s remarkable knock showed that the odds are still in your favour as a batsman. If Australia are to make inroads tomorrow, they’ll be relying on misjudgements through movement in the air rather than off the pitch. We’ll be back then to take you through proceedings. Cheers for your company. Enjoy your Saturdays! One of the great things about the women’s game. Regardless of what might have happened in the day – good or bad, the players always make time for the fans: Perry speaks. You should listen: 17th over: England 40-0 (Winfield 12, Beaumont 25) Slip, silly point, bat pad – all three gagging for a chance before the day is done. There’s a sniff for bat pad when an inside-edge falls short. What looks like a googly is covered well by Beaumont, before a wider delivery is swept away for... well, byes, apparently. The swish of the bat doing for Healy down the leg side. Wellington gets her cap back and the bails are flicked off. What a day. For the second-time in the last couple of hours, Ellyse Perry leads the players off to rapturous applause. Just to reiterate – her hand of 213 not out, the highest score by an Australian in women’s Test, established a lead for Australia and underlined Perry’s standing as one of the greats of the women’s game. Reaction as it comes... 16th over: England 37-0 (Winfield 12, Beaumont 24) Winfield just having a cheeky net, now, as she works on a few high-elbow drives, with no intention of running. Think this is the penultimate over... Strong work from England. 15th over: England 37-0 (Winfield 12, Beaumont 24) DROP! In fact, that’s harsh. Beaumont hangs back to Wellington – not advised – and under-edges onto the right knee of Healy. No chance she’s taking that. She’s not Sarah Taylor – and even Taylor would have done well to get near that. Amazing that Beaumont didn’t play on, either. Quality over from AJW. Already looks a great addition to international cricket. 14th over: England 37-0 (Winfield 12, Beaumont 24) Better from Winfield: she doesn’t try to overhit the ball and times nicely through cover point for a couple. McGrath, though, not only adjusts her length but puts a bit of action on the next couple of deliveries which move in and almost cause Winfield to play onto her own stumps. Can’t argue with Sarah, here. 13th over: England 35-0 (Winfield 10, Beaumont 24) A chance! Beth Mooney’s sprawling to her left at silly point as Tammy Beaumont prods hard at a ball that tempts her forward. Well bowled, AJ-Dubz. One not so good – well, one that doesn’t turn – is tickled down leg for runs to Beamont. 12th over: England 33-0 (Winfield 10, Beaumont 22) Beaumont misses out on a couple, middling a drive and cut to the fielders stationed on the off side. In good touch after her 70 in the first innings. We’ve got five overs left in the day and Amanda-Jade Wellington’s leggies are about to get an outing... 11th over: England 32-0 (Winfield 10, Beaumont 21) Classical on-drive from Lauren Winfield, after video review, gets her four after Amanda-Jade Wellington handles the ball while her foot is on the boundary rope. Perry brings her length back and gets the ball moving into Winfield for an LBW appeal that, on first viewing, was slidng down. The umpire agrees. Beth Mooney throws down the stumps during the appeal, but Winfield was planted behind the line. Decent hurl, mind. 10th over: England 28-0 (Winfield 6, Beaumont 21) Single apiece as McGrath strays a touch on length. As frustrating as England will have found the last five sessions, they’d have seen that this pitch is still so good for batting. Time = runs. 9th over: England 26-0 (Winfield 5, Beaumont 20) Perry steams in, the crowd pick up... and Beaumont works the ball away down to fine leg for four. Decent numbers through the gates today. Should be similar for tomorrow. 8th over: England 21-0 (Winfield 5, Beaumont 15) Ooh Aah Tahlia McGrath comes on for Jonassen, as the crowd lose patience with Rachael Haynes and start calling for the woman of the moment. And look who has the ball for the next over... 7th over: England 19-0 (Winfield 4, Beaumont 14) Quality from Beaumont: inside-out drive is threaded through extra cover for four. Really good intent from Beaumont. Those runs aren’t going to knock off themselves. 6th over: England 11-0 (Winfield 4, Beaumont 6) A maiden to Jonassen. Fairly innocuous, truth be told. Give Perry a Mars Bar and get her back on! 5th over: England 11-0 (Winfield 4, Beaumont 6) Schutt, moving the ball into the right-hander, is too full and Beaumont digs one out well, through backward point, for four. 4th over: England 7-0 (Winfield 4, Beaumont 2) There is turn out there for Jonassen but, I’m inclined to agree with Daggers, here: If the reason you’re not bowling Perry is because she’s knackered, then fair enough. But new ball, in the dark – give it to Tahlia McGrath, who showed in the England first innings that she can move the ball both ways. 3rd over: England 4-0 (Winfield 3, Beaumont 1) A CHANCE! Oh, Lauren Winfield, count yourself lucky. Beaumont tips and runs into space – plenty of space – but Winfield is late to respond to the call. Jonassen swoops from point, picks up cleanly and throws on the bounce to Alyssa Healy, who whips the bails off with Winfield touch and go as to whether she’s made her ground. In the end, she’s safe, but not by much. A direct hit and she’s back in the hutch nursing another paltry score... 2nd over: England 3-0 (Winfield 3, Beaumont 0) Hello, curveball. Nice to be seeing you. Jess Jonassen it is to open up instead of Ellyse Perry, who might fancy a bit of a break. Understandable. Silly point, slip and every Aussie and their gran around the bat. Winfield pinches two and ensures every defensive stroke comes out of the middle and straight into the turf. 1st over: England 1-0 (Winfield 1, Beaumont 0) A deficit of 168 to chip away at for England. Hopes of winning the Test were hampered by their collapse on the first evening. Now they’re nonexistent. Winfield gets herself and England off the mark. Ha, of course Ellyse Perry is already out there and warming up to take the new ball! Freak of an athlete. Here’s the moment she thought she got to that double... And here’s when it actually happened... 166th over: Australia 448-9 declared (Perry 213, Schutt 1) The field is up but that doesn’t matter. Ellyse Perry drives Ecclestone down the ground for four to take her past 200! Absolutely outstanding knock a a real privelege to be able to type these words on it. Just remarkable. And to celebrate, she smokes down the ground again, almost taking out the standing umpire and then skips and slaps Ecclestone over midwicket to devestating effect. The blows take her to the highest score in women’s Test cricket! And... Australia have declared! They lead by 168 runs 165th over: Australia 434-9 (Perry 199, Schutt 1) Absolute scenes at the North Sydney Oval! Ellyse Perry gets within six... and smashes Laura Marsh high and over midwicket... the helmet is off, the badge is kissed, the hugs are plentiful... but it’s only four! Can you believe it! A single takes her to 199 and the ground holds its breath to see if Megan Schutt can keep out the final two balls of the over. She can... 164th over: Australia 427-9 (Perry 193, Schutt 0) Big shout against Schutt first up! Perry, seven away at the nonstriker’s end, looked worried. But the ball – yorker length, was angling down the leg side. Schutt can bat, but Perry needs to take matters – personal and team – into her own hands. Eccclestone, around the wicket, draws Wellington into a sweep. The turn away from the right-hander is enough to miss the swing of the bat and hit the ribs of the right-hander. Hitting middle and off. Ecclestone has three-fer. 163rd over: Australia 426-8 (Perry 192, Wellington 8) We’re officially on “Perry 200” watch. A couple of singles, including a bunted full toss that could have been put away for more, takes her to within eight. 162nd over: Australia 423-8 (Perry 190, Wellington 1) An LBW shout for Ecclestone as Wellington is caught playing across the line. Impact was outside of off stump and a leg bye is taken to point. 161st over: Australia 421-8 (Perry 189, Wellington 1) Signs of the time. The new ball is available but England haven’t taken it because, as much as it might swing, it could also go for a few. And, with a new batsman at the crease – Amanda-Jade Wellington (number ten, no less) – there is no slip or any close catcher. Wellington pinches the strike with her first run in Test cricket. Jonassen tries to carve Marsh over the off side. She got into position early, but perhaps too early. Marsh spots her and throws it very wide and, in going after it, skes high to Lauren Winfield at point. 160th over: Australia 419-7 (Perry 188, Jonassen 24) Ecclestone up to the plate now, ball firmly in hand this time, as she sends down her 34th over of this innings. Aside from that slip in the previous over, she’s looked very accomplished on debut. 159th over: Australia 416-7 (Perry 186, Jonassen 23) Oh Ecclestone. An age of grazing on debut and now a misfield as Jonassen looks for only one to the deep but Ecclestone doesn’t get enough of herself behind the ball. Four bits. 158th over: Australia 410-7 (Perry 186, Jonassen 18) Jonassen’s up to allsorts. Sophie Ecclestone, left-arm over to the left- and right-hander, is swept by JJ, as she moves across her stumps and works the spinner expertly beyond the fielder stationed right on the square leg fence. We interrupt this OBO for some mechanical scoreboard porn 157th over: Australia 402-7 (Perry 183, Jonassen 12) A succession of late cuts from Perry takes Australia past 400 and takes Laura Marsh to within nine runs of an unwanted ton of her own. 156th over: Australia 396-7 (Perry 178, Jonassen 11) Perry bags the fifth highest score for an Australian in a women’s Test as she clouts a short ball from Elwiss through midwicket. There’s a whiff of a chance at the over’s conclusion as Jonassen flays through backward point – Fran Wilson with the Superwoman dive in vain – and then in the running as a two is turned down with Jonassen too keen for the return run. 155th over: Australia 388-7 (Perry 172, Jonassen 9) Jonassen using her golf skills to good effect this over. Marsh drifts one into her and she stays deadly still before lofting it down the ground for four. Had a handicap of 10 as a nipper, apparently. 154th over: Australia 382-7 (Perry 171, Jonassen 4) Jonassen playing herself in. Perry oiling the joints as she looks to hit a few more in the air. England desperate for a “SIM TO END OF INNINGS” option. Ausralia lead by 102. 153rd over: Australia 380-7 (Perry 170, Jonassen 3) Ermm... that’s a bit odd. Perry heaves Laura Marsh deep into the leg side, where Sophie Ecclestone runs in to... take it on the bounce? She definitely could have got there to take it on the full, but it looks like she just didn’t pick it up at all. “Didn’t get on the motorbike quick enough,” says Lisa Sthalekar. 152nd over: Australia 377-7 (Perry 168, Jonassen 2) Back in action after dinner and so is Ellyse Perry, who drives down the ground for a single. Jess Jonassen gets off the mark with a couple flicked high-elbow-y through midwicket. What a luxury to have her in this low. I watched her Test debut at Canterbury in 2015 and she looked a million bucks. Drives like a leftie. All in. 151st over: Australia 374-7 (Perry 167, Jonassen 0) Perry leaves the field first after Jonassen negotiates the final five balls of a pretty remarkable session for Australia. Tough graft for England, as Perry and McGrath made hay while the sun shone and while it disappeared, too. Australia lead by 94 runs at the break. I’ll be back soon. In the meantime, messrs Adam Collins and Geoff Lemon are on BBC Test Match Special during this 40-minute break. Always worth a listen: 150th over: Australia 373-7 (Perry 166) A boundary! And it was worth the wait: Elwiss angles one into middle stump and Perry lassoos it through the only part of the boundary unpatrolled – midwicket – for four. It brings up the century partnership between her and McGrath, from 213 balls. Can I say McGrath “deserved a fifty”? Certainly after being dropped on nought. Tahlia, what have you done! Three away from a maiden Test half-century, she gets a full toss and hits it high rather than far. Nat Sciver at midwicket doesn’t have to move to take a smart high catch. Gutting. 149th over: Australia 366-6 (Perry 160, McGrath 46) Like this. McGrath’s taking guard outside leg stump to give herself swinging room to get Knight down the ground. No real damage – though five from the over is an improvement – as Knight changes her line to counter it. 148th over: Australia 361-6 (Perry 157, McGrath 44) Georgia Elwiss into the attack with her mediums. Again, Tahlia McGrath walks across to manufacture length. The big shots are there, lurking, but the pace off the pitch is keeping them at bay. 147th over: Australia 358-6 (Perry 155, McGrath 43) Not pretty, but Knight and her bowlers are just trying to take time out of the game. Given how easy batting is right now, it makes sense. The ball looks like it’s witnessed some unspeakable horrors and is falling to pieces. Much like England’s Ashes hopes... 146th over: Australia 356-6 (Perry 154, McGrath 42) Right, here we go. A message was brought out before this Nat Sciver over started and it seems to be “Get a wiggle on!” McGrath walks across her stumps to bunt Sciver into the leg side. Perry, again, is too keen for a single that’s not there. The scoreboard might not be nice viewing if you’re an England fan, but the setting certainly is... 145th over: Australia 352-6 (Perry 154, McGrath 38) Heather Knight brings herself on, around the wicket, to these right-handers. Cover on the leg side in play as both right-handers opt to work with the angle. 144th over: Australia 348-6 (Perry 151, MCGrath 38) A rare moment of alarm for Ellyse Perry, who’s too enthusiastic for a single and has to double-back when McGrath’s call of “NO!” comes through. A better throw might have troubled her, but a dive did the trick. 143rd over: Australia 347-6 (Perry 150, McGrath 38) Here we go... Tahlia McGrath dances down and swings through the line of a delivery from Marsh to get four over the head of Sophie Ecclestone. Belting shot. Ecclestone drops back and a streetsmart McGrath takes the single on offer. A drive to mid off an a misfield by Lauren Winfield takes Perry to 150 from 382 balls (21 fours). She’s not going to stop, is she? 142nd over: Australia 340-6 (Perry 148, McGrath 33) McGrath’s frustration at hitting fielders and not having much to work with down the ground is compounded by a quick look to the scoreboard. Not so much the rate – though that is dying – but the realisation that, had she joined any other player, she’d have a “kinder” field... 141st over: Australia 338-6 (Perry 147, McGrath 33) Good use of the feet by McGrath and then Perry to pick-up singles through midwicket and cover, respectively. A charge from McGrath is curtailed by a full-bunger, which she hits flat towards Sophie Ecclestone at mid on. A nasty bounce nearly takes it over the tall Lancastrian, but she keeps her cool, pats it down and ensures it’s only a single. Just signs that these two are starting to up the tempo... In case you were wondering what other major milestones Perry has under her belt: here’s a goal in a World Cup... 140th over: Australia 334-6 (Perry 144, McGrath 31) Nat Sciver into the attack, bowling on the inside limit, wide of the off side. handful of plays and misses are more in frusrtation for Australia than an error for England to get excited about. One of the more forgetful overs. Tahlia McGrath’s not bothered. 139th over: Australia 33-16 (Perry 142, McGrath 31 An email from Andrew Benton: “The North Sydney Oval looks like time hasn’t touched it in many decades - is it all that olde-worldey? Looks great.” It really is gorgeous: grass banks, views into the city and a setting sun. Stick that on a postcard. Two from the over. 138th over: Australia 329-6 (Perry 141, McGrath 30) Morning everyone in London, good early-eve to those in Australia. And just a straight-up welcome to those of you joining in from other parts of the globe. Vish here, picking up Act Two of the Ellyse Perry show. Christ, she’s good. Gets off strike with a late cut that, were she not as good, would have gone for four. England don’t have a fielder within spitting distance of her as they look to block all her scoring options. 137th over: Australia 327-6 (Perry 140, McGrath 29) Perry has this down to a very neat formula, at the risk of repetition. One early in the over to the legside, McGrath playing out the rest. Another very good hour for Australia comes to an end. For it is wicketless. Granted, only 34 runs came, but with every slow over we’re edging closer to a drawn result here, I think. So the real action now, in the immediate term at least, becomes what Perry can finish with. For that, I’ll leave you with Vish who takes over from London. Thanks for your company over the last few hours. I’ll catch you tomorrow. 136th over: Australia 326-6 (Perry 139, McGrath 29) Perry one closer to a Test 150, taking Shrubsole down the ground. McGrath, in keeping with the theme of the hour, is keeping enough defending the rest. One over until they take a drink, which will mark the half way mark of this third day. One the hosts have dominated. 135th over: Australia 325-6 (Perry 138, McGrath 29) Marsh on for another trundle. Didn’t do a lot wrong before tea, and won the single breakthrough England have had today. A maiden here to McGrath, right back into that shoebox. Her 11th maiden in 33 overs. Can’t ask a lot more than that as far as building pressure. Just hasn’t been sustained from the other end for long enough periods. 134th over: Australia 325-6 (Perry 138, McGrath 29) Ooooooh yeah, that’s a good old drive on the up from McGrath. She’s certainly shown plenty in this innings, in addition to a couple of wickets with her medium pace, to suggest she is going to be around for a while. Shrubsole’s over leaks six, Australia’s lead is 45. That number has been two other times in this Test. It was what England added yesterday aftenoon for their final three wickets, and the runs Australia’s openers put on yesterday when they were chasing the game. Feels a long time ago now. Not good for the tourists. Not much they can do from here. Maybe both sides are happy enough to split the difference and take the draw from here? This ball is 54 overs old, by the way. Yep, time to start thinking about the worst three words in the cricket language: Third New Ball. 133rd over: Australia 319-6 (Perry 137, McGrath 24) Over the wicket for Ecclestone now. I don’t mind that, changing the angle to Perry who got the day rolling against her earlier on. Keeps her at bay with five well-directed dots, but the century-maker keeps the strike by coming down the track to the final ball, turning against the spin around the corner. A lot harder to do than it looks. 132nd over: Australia 318-6 (Perry 136, McGrath 24) Shrubsole to replace Brunt, after a decent spell over the last 40 minutes or so from the Fig Tree end. Anya struggled earlier today, hit out of the attack by Healy. But has a big brain, so will come to this spell with various thoughts on how she can resurrect England’s day. Not in this over though, three singles taken to midwicket. 131st over: Australia 315-6 (Perry 134, McGrath 23) Ecclestone keeping McGrath put for a second maiden on the trot. Good little contest between the two young guns on Test debut. Australia have only added 23 runs in the last 10 overs, giving a sense of the gear shift since the tea break. 130th over: Australia 315-6 (Perry 134, McGrath 23) Singles to both, Perry digging down the ground with timing then McGrath pulling square. The former takes a couple more out behind point with a minimum of fuss. Brunt looks angry, which could help. They need something. Anything. 129th over: Australia 311-6 (Perry 131, McGrath 22) McGrath Beaten. Is that the first time Ecclestone (or anyone?) has defied the outside edge today? Reckon it might me. Or near enough. Doing a nice job wheeling away from the around the wicket after tea, but yet to find a way through. Beaten again! Look, really nice over. “You just get the feeling we are going to be commentating on Ecclestone and McGrath for really long time,” Mel Jones says on TMS. Couldn’t agree more. Maiden. 128th over: Australia 311-6 (Perry 131, McGrath 22) Short, pulled, four. Brunt drops short to McGrath after Perry gives her the strike again, and she thumps her through midwicket. “It says a lot about the skillset of McGrath,” says Mel Jones on the radio. “She did that with absolute ease. It was almost as if you known she had gone through it in her head before Brunt bowled the ball.” Into the 20s she moves. She then keeps the strike with a prod out to deep point. 127th over: Australia 305-6 (Perry 130, McGrath 17) Down the ground for Perry this time. She is very happy to offer the strike to McGrath, who is in no hurry. Ecclestone has been much better after tea, in fairness. Wonder what Australia are planning here? No hurry. Bat England into a position where the best they can hope for is a draw? Good part of the multiformat series is that there are broader considerations than usual. A reminder that Australia hold the trophy, so England need to claim ten points in order to win the series. They can only lose two more. If they draw this, they need to sweep the T20s. If they lose, it is over. Got it? 126th over: Australia 304-6 (Perry 129, McGrath 17) Perry forces off the back foot to point for a single, again getting off strike early on. Supreme batting. Meanwhile, Charlotte Edwards is talking to England legend Enid Bakewell on the telly, who is getting right into the spirit of things. 125th over: Australia 303-6 (Perry 128, McGrath 17) Perry again gets herself off strike early in the over, through a drive to mid-on. So good at that, she is. McGrath happy enough to learn forward in defence to see the over out. Her cover drive here from the previous Soph Ecc over. 124th over: Australia 302-6 (Perry 127, McGrath 17) Brunt has Taylor up to the stumps within an over of the resumption. And lands the most immaculate Ian Harvey slower ball. She loves it too, big smile on her face. You’ll have to excuse me for getting excited about these back-of-hand beauties. Harvey was my guy as a kid. Indeed, if you have the time to dig through my instagram (don’t, honestly) there is a diary entry I found as a kid detailing the day where The Freak made his maiden First Class ton. Yep, this is why I was so popular in school. Perry gets one to third man later in the over, the only score from it. 123rd over: Australia 301-6 (Perry 126, McGrath 17) McGrath’s fourth boundary, but first through the posh side. She didn’t miss out when Ecclestone gave her a half-volley to launch into. Good batting. Australia’s 300 up with that as well. 122nd over: Australia 297-6 (Perry 126, McGrath 13) Less than ideal start from Brunt, slidingonto Perry’s pads who helps herself to four with a leg glance that races away to the boundary. Oh, they’re leg byes actually. Four runs all the same. She is back on the mark after that, keeping Perry in defensive mode. They will know that Australia bat deep. But also, that picking up the talismanic Australian could be the opening they need. Worth remembering that there are only five sessions left in this game too, so Australia will have to make a strategic decision of having a real dip with a view to getting out of there soon to start collecting the wickets they need to win, or building a lead as big as possible to exert maximum scoreboard pressure on England later today. Either way, England’s chances of winning the Test are diminishing by the over. 121st over: Australia 293-6 (Perry 126, McGrath 13) Yep, that’s a good one to get going. Ecclestone at her best when flipping between flat deliveries pinning players back, and loop that draws them forward. She does both here, conceding a single down the ground to the first ball but nothing more. We’re back. Sophie Ecclestone has the ball from the City End. Huge spell for her. Perry leads McGrath off, receiving a generous round of applause from the Thompson Stand. She put on an even 100 with Healy, who was the only wicket to fall when holing out for a timely and punchy 45. But the story is Perry, who now finally has an international century to her name, coming from a sweep off Marsh. Across 266 balls at the crease by the break, she has been all-but flawless. Her cutting off Ecclestone the tone for the session early, England pulling the wrong lever early by starting with the spin from the City End instead of all-out pace after the success they had the previous evening with the second new ball. As the bowlers were cycled through, nothing worked for the visitors. When Healy wasn’t given leg before off Sciver, it looked like a wicketless session would be recorded. But Marsh did win the error in the next over to end the defining partnership with Australia just short of a first innings lead. It should have been wickets in consecutive overs with Australia still ten runs short of passing England, but Knight put down a straightforward chance to McGrath’s first ball. Instead, she has hit 13 quick runs to put Australia ahead at the break by a dozen runs. With 115 runs and one wicket across the two hours, England will now be quietly thinking that a draw could be the best they can salvage unless something special happens and fast. By contrast, Australia have opened the door to a victory that would secure them the Ashes before a ball has been bowled of the T20s. Back in ten. 120th over: Australia 292-6 (Perry 125, McGrath 13) Elwiss to have the last one. Shrubsole tries to make something from nothing, hitting the non-strikers’ stumps. But nothing in it. There is something for the hom side though, the medium pacer missing her length, McGrath collecting her second boundary through midwicket from full tosses. She’s into double figures, as is Australia’s lead. She knocks the last couple on the head. And that is tea. 119th over: Australia 287-6 (Perry 124, McGrath 9) They have taken their time between overs there, so many they want to make this just the one. McGrath helps if that is the plan, whipping Marsh away behind square for her second boundary. No risks there - very good shot. They have a short leg and slip in play or the final balls. Oh, I was wrong. They will get another in, as McGrath dead bats the rest of the over. 118th over: Australia 283-6 (Perry 124, McGrath 5) Better from McGrath, taking one through midwicket early in the new Elwiss over. Perry happy enough to see out the rest. Five minutes to the shorter tea break (if new to pink-ball cricket, the breaks are reversed) she has done more than enough to go in unbeaten. But what will England try with probably two overs until the interval? “Make big plays,” as Josh said to Donna in the West Wing episode I watched last night after work (livin’ la vida loca, me). That’s what Knight needs to do as captain now. 117th over: Australia 282-6 (Perry 124, McGrath 4) Perry realises that there is little point hanging around to slowly start another stand, using her feet to meet Marsh around wicket, completing yet another beautiful cover drive to the rope. And that is the lead for Australia! They have hit the front before lunch after trailing by 103 when play resumed. Cop that. “At close of play yesterday I high hopes,” writes Phil Withall. “No that’s not right. I had hope, nope still not right. I almost believed England would be capable of making a good game of this test. This session has extinguished my dreams. And now that wicket will make it almost start again.” Dare to dream, Phil. It is what this is all about, no? 116th over: Australia 278-6 (Perry 120, McGrath 4) Dropped! Oh that’s a shocking drop by the captain Heather Knight at short cover. First ball of McGrath’s innings. A wicket there would have done wonders for the visitors, but it isn’t to be. Elwiss’ first ball of the day as well. Instead, a full toss follows to allow McGrath to get off the mark with the easiest of clips through midwicket. The last ball of the over is left very close to the off-stump. Eventful moments. Ten minutes to lunch. 115th over: Australia 274-6 (Perry 120, McGrath 0) The loss of Perry’s partner doesn’t cause her to lose stride, sweeping expertly to keep Australia moving towards a first innings lead. Quite the highlight reel she is pulling together here, some glorious shot this afternoon. Tahlia McGrath is the new batsman, the South Australian all-rounder on her Test debut. It doesn’t matter! England get Healy a couple of balls later, trying to smash Marsh over the top but failing to clear Shrubsole who tooks a good catch at mid-off running back and to her right. It has taken the better part of two hours, but they have finally got the breakthrough. The end of a wonderful 100 run stand. 114th over: Australia 269-5 (Perry 115, Healy 45) Oh that is wonnnnnderful timing from Perry. Rocking back to Sciver, she carves behind point just as she did in the first over of the day. Depth of the crease, using the pace. Superb batting. That’s the 100 partnership from 195 balls. Another out to the cover sweeper gives Healy one to see out. Big shout for LBW but it is turned down! Oh, it’s out too! No DRS, so no review available to Sciver and Knight. “He must have thought it was angling down the legside,” Charles Dagnall assumes on the radio. “How dearly England would have liked to have seen Umpire Joshua raise his finger there.” Not wrong. 113rd over: Australia 264-5 (Perry 110, Healy 45) Marsh goes around the wicket this time. May as well. No choice but to mix it up. To that end, can’t be far away from Knight giving herself another go here. Took a 5-for in her first match as captain in 2016. Healy, nearing her half-century, is seeing them beautifully. No risks here though, no runs either to Marsh’s credit. 112nd over: Australia 264-5 (Perry 110, Healy 45) One to Perry to midwicket, then another for Healy to mid-on. The latter is nearly stopped by the diving Wilson, but they rotate the strike in time. A couple more to Perry in that square leg region to end the over. Batting is getting easier by the minute for the Australians. They’re cashing in. 111th over: Australia 260-5 (Perry 108, Healy 43) Marsh has another go at breaking up this stand. Perry defends until the penultimate ball, where she rocks back and pushes past the stumps for one. Full toss to end the over and Healy doesn’t miss out, clobbering all the way onto the hill for six! Her second big one of the session. That’s a dreadful way to end the over, and more or less sums up England’s morning. She hasn’t done a lot wrong herself, but doesn’t excuse the free hit she’s given Healy there. 110th over: Australia 253-5 (Perry 107, Healy 37) Sciver to the century-maker Perry. That has a nice ring to it. To think she was a number nine four years ago. She gets off strike early in the over past square leg. Healy blocks out the rest. “These two have played every bowler well,” says Isa Guha on TMS. “No one has had too much of an influence.” 109th over: Australia 252-5 (Perry 106, Healy 37) Healy carves Marsh through the covers off the back foot and it crawls and crawls... all the way to the rope. The TV ump consulted to make sure that is the case. Australia’s 250 up all of a sudden, the hosts only trailing by 28 runs. They’ve added 75 since the resumption 84 minues ago today. 108th over: Australia 248-5 (Perry 106, Healy 33) For World Cup and Ashes winner Isa Guha offers a timely reminder on the radio: if England lose this Test, the Ashes are over. If it turns out that way, they will be able to pinpoint this session. It has been a shocker for them. But the beauty of their 280 runs on the board is that they are only a couple of wickets from being quickly back in it. But where does it come from? Not from Nat Sciver in this over, who concedes a single to each of the set players through the legside. 107th over: Australia 246-5 (Perry 105, Healy 32) Perry grabs a single to begin the over, but Marsh is on the mark to Healy for the rest. David Warner talks about positive defence, and that is what Healy is all about here, striding forward each time with purpose. Has a habit of giving it away once she is well set. That’s her next challenge: making this great start really count. 106th over: Australia 245-5 (Perry 104, Healy 32) A lot has been made of this England team’s bouncebackability, but they have to show it here. Nat Sciver has a chance with the ball for the first time today after Shrubsole was hit out of the attack. But Healy welcomes her by lashing a half-volley to the rope at cover! She moves into the 30s. Then a couple more around the corner to keep that board motoring. Six from it, which makes 47 from the last ten overs. Here is her big one from before the drinks break. 105th over: Australia 239-5 (Perry 104, Healy 26) To hammer home the point, Perry takes a second boundary down to the fine leg region to narrow the scoreboard gap yet further. At this rate, Australia will have a handy lead by the the tea break. All the pressure back on England. Secured from the first ball after drinks with a deft glance off Laura Marsh. What a magnificent moment for the superstar allrounder. She meets it with a huge leap in the air. So many times beyond 50, but at last she has done it. An innings of 225 balls, including 17 boundaries. Vital in the context of the game as well, navigating her side into a very handy position from a spot of vulnerability last night. 104th over: Australia 231-5 (Perry 96, Healy 26) Shrubsole gets another, the last before drinks. But much for the convention of defending it out for a glass of cordial, Healy instead going large! That’s a wonderfully timed clip over midwicket, clearing the rope. The first six of the game! She goes again, but with a glorious stroke to the same part of the ground, this time along the carpet. Outstanding batting. It punctuates a brilliant hour for Australia, who resumed at 177-5 and have added 56 runs without loss. England need to regroup, and fast. 103rd over: Australia 221-5 (Perry 96, Healy 16) Laura Marsh replaces Ecclestone from the City End. Good call. Marsh has a five-wicket bag on this field, was a vital cog in England’s World Cup win here in 2009 and outstanding yesterday. Has the experience to ensure Perry won’t be getting these four runs for free. A short midwicket in play now as well, but Perry is defending a fraction squarer than that throughout the set, forced to go forward then back. A maiden it is. Exhale. 102nd over: Australia 221-5 (Perry 96, Healy 16) Shrubsole to Healy. Five-four field, no real catchers besides Knight at shortish extra cover. But Healy finds a gap in the ring for a couple, albeit through for a brief moment causing the bowler to let out a sigh. Perry back on strike for the next over, one boundary away from three figures. 101st over: Australia 219-5 (Perry 96, Healy 14) Thanks for those who picked up that I called it the England 200 rather than Australia before. Chalk it up to me carrying both passports. Right. Ecclestone again. Healy hoicks! Doesn’t get all of this, but doesn’t go to hand. First false stroke of the day. Perry’s turn, and she is on the advance and picking the gap through midwicket for four! Lovely timing. That brings her to 96. Also brings up the 50 stand between these two. Vital runs to say the least. England in a bit of strife now. 100th over: Australia 214-5 (Perry 92, Healy 13) Back to back boundaries! Shrubsole is back into the attack and Perry immediately gets her away twice behind point. The first is from the outside of the bat and not in complete control, but the second is top shelf, using the pace of the pace. Into the 90s she goes. In response, Knight shuffles Winfield from first slip to, oh, fly slip I guess you’d call that? Shrubsole knows how to bounce back in this situation. Speaking to her recently (for another publication, so I won’t be rude and link) she explained to me how she calmed down after being whacked for two boundaries on the spin in the 43rd over of the World Cup final. Half an hour later, she had taken 5-for-13 in the spell and won England the trophy. What she’d give for something like that right now. 99th over: Australia 206-5 (Perry 84, Healy 13) Ecclestone again begins with a fully, her third of this spell. The pressure is piling up on the 18 year old after really impressing yesterday. Her Dad also told me yesterday that she hasn’t any concern bowling long spells, conditioned to it from playing men’s grade cricket. Knight makes a move, pushing herself into catching cover. It heads in her general direction, but no runs beyond the single to start. 98th over: Australia 205-5 (Perry 83, Healy 13) Short, pulled, four! Healy smacks Brunt to the rope with venom. That brings up Australia 200 as well. The deficit has narrowed from 103 to 77 so far this morning, this pair doing precisely what the home side required: seeing off the second new ball. Healy sweets another single in front of point. Then Perry gets one herself off the hip the midwicket to keep the strike. Six from the over. That’ll do. That deficit now 75. 97th over: Australia 199-5 (Perry 82, Healy 9) Our first single of the day! Healy taking one from Ecclestone. The only run from the over, behind square off the pads. 96th over: Australia 198-5 (Perry 82, Healy 7) Up to the stumps comes Sarah Taylor to Brunt’s fourth over of the spell. This is always exciting. She isn’t required though, Perry kept honest with six deliveries that need the bat to be used. A couple of slower balls in the mix there too, suggesting that England have officially reverted to Plan B. “Good morning from Ireland,” emails Dave Kinsella. Morning to you. “I’ve got to say, I was very impressed by the Aussie coach’s honest summary of the last session yesterday. In which he admitted his team were counting down the bal;s to stumps and admiring the English bowling efforts. This is simply Cricket.” He also said he was pretty disappointed at the scoring rates of both teams. My sense is that both he and Mark Robinson are going to really load on the pitch after this match, regardless of the result. Oh by the way, England have finished it off in Adelaide. Jimmy took the last couple, finishing with 3-for-12. Always a good night out on the gallop in Adelaide. Wonder if they’ll sneak out for a little look? Hope so. 95th over: Australia 198-5 (Perry 82, Healy 7) Right. Ecclestone is back in her happy place over the last couple of overs, mixing up her speeds to Alyssa Healy, but on lengths that require defence. Really good. But there’s still plenty of chat about why she was opening the bowling today in the first place. “Unbelievable” says Mel Jones on TMS of the decision. 94th over: Australia 198-5 (Perry 82, Healy 7) 11th of November, so both sides are also wearing poppies to mark 99 years since the end of the First World War. But don’t think for a moment that you’re going to get a war analogy from me in the next sentence about the game in front of us. No. On the field, it’s Brunt versus Perry. She’s keeping it full, seeking swing, but not a lot is coming. One jags one back at the well-set batsman, but she has enough time to get down on it. Good cricket. Maiden. Meanwhile in Adelaide, the CAXI are in strife. I find pronouncing it “Kacksi” makes them feel more like a cricket team. Anyway, England’s seamers are running amok. Those that are still fit, that is. Sidebar on this: what has Liam Plunkett gotta do to win a flight to Australia? Blimey. 93rd over: Australia 198-5 (Perry 82, Healy 7) Couple to Healy off the first ball of Ecclestone’s new over, turned around the corner and beating Laura Marsh. It’s a misfield, on reflection. Oh, there it is! Ecclestone has a superb arm ball and it neeearly gets through Healy, just as it did in her first ODI of the series in Coffs Harbour the week before last. Very close to off stump. This is a good over, bringing Healy forward with some flight, then again pushing her back with that quicker one that doesn’t turn as much. Nice contest. Pats on the back all round. 92nd over: Australia 196-5 (Perry 82, Healy 5) Charles Dagnall is flummoxed by the tactics of starting with spin today from the City End when the ball is still so new. “If it is going to swing (the pink ball) it does in the first ten to 12 overs of the innings. Then you consider that Katherine Brunt got a late wicket last night, and would be bowling into a slight breeze assisting that little bit of away swing. I don’t know.” Really odd. One for Heather Knight at stumps. It is Brunt now for her second over after replacing Shrubsole, appealing ambitiously as a leg bye is taken. They rotate, so it’s Perry to face up from this end for the first time today. She’s forced to defend with Brunt right on the money. 91st over: Australia 195-5 (Perry 82, Healy 5) Ecclestone gets another go. And she finds her length at last, keeping Perry forward throughout the over. She nearly beats Knight when using her feet and making wonderful contact, but at cover the England skipper makes the save with one hand. Watching the replay, she’s saved four there. Back to back maidens. 90th over: Australia 195-5 (Perry 82, Healy 5) Brunt is back, belatedly for mine, replacing Shrubsole from our end of the North Sydney Oval. Australian coach Matthew Mott freely admitted that they were counting down the balls to stumps last night, Brunt beating the bat time and again. But it hasn’t moved much so far this afternoon. We’ll see. Keeps Healy down the business end throughout with a useful maiden. The last ball kept a low a bit, which could be a bit of a bother later on. On the radio, Jim Maxwell is critical of the track, believing more grass should have been left on to generate more bounce. Hard to dispute that. He has also been passed a note by master statistician Ric Finlay pitching up a Women’s Sheffield Shield, with games played over three days. Yes, please. On pitch chat, Lottie continues: “The pitch we had in Perth for the 2014 was the best we ever played on. It was quick and bounced.” 89th over: Australia 195-5 (Perry 82, Healy 5) Ecclestone better. Pushes one through to Perry who misses on the back foot, then drawing her forward. Oh, spoke to soon, Perry latching onto the final ball of the over, carving behind point for the fourth boundary in four overs this morning! That’s a fantastic shot, placement perfect and footwork to match. She’s into the 80s. 88th over: Australia 191-5 (Perry 78, Healy 5) Shrubsole let’s the Australians get a couple off the pad when spraying. “Pad is good as the bat in that respect,” says Jim Maxwell on the wireless. But she’s right back on the mark for the rest of the set. Perry moved to her highest score in Test cricket with those boundaries in the previous over, by the way. Australia now 89 behind. 87th over: Australia 189-5 (Perry 78, Healy 5) Sophie Ecclestone to get first use from the city end. Quite surprised by that, Brunt was absolutely all over these two before stumps last night. New rock only six overs old. Odd. Perry doesn’t mind the call at all, cashing in after getting a full toss first ball, smacking it down the ground for four. Perfect start to the day. 26 away from a maiden international ton. The left-armer is up appealing next ball for a catch down the legside, but it’s not much a shout from behind the wicket. Another full toss from Ecclestone later in the over - that’s a shocker. Waist high and Perry carves it through point. Real help yourself stuff there. Make that 22 away. Perfect start from Australia. More to the point, awful start for England. 86th over: Australia 181-5 (Perry 70, Healy 5) Shoooooooooot. Healy away for the day second ball of it with a delicious straight drive, whizzing by the stumps and to the rope. “You won’t see much better than that,” says Charlotte Edwards (Lottie from now on) on the TMS call. Very solid in defence thereafter, elbow up nice and high. England and Australia on the way out in their baggy pinks. Returning them back to the McGrath Foundation for charity auction at a later date. Fantastic from CA putting on the day three Sydney ritual in the women’s Test as well. The HQ staffer who looks after community engagement, Adam Cassidy, is a class act. I get stuck into CA a fair bit (when they deserve it), but they do this stuff extremely well. Righto. Perry and Healy ready to roll. Shrubsole has the ball from the Fig Tree End. PLAY! Geoffers has been down having a look. Sophie Ecclestone. The big winner from day two was England’s 18-year-old debutant tweaker, who earned plenty of fans. Comparisons to Daniel Vettori in the TMS radio commentary box were spot on, the left-arm ortho using her height and accuracy to great effect with two top order breakthroughts. (Should have been three, had Haynes plum, but let’s not dwell). I had the great pleasure of spending the time watching the proud Lancastrian bowl with her parents Paul and Elaine. They weren’t sure if they could get time off work of the cash together to make it over, but as her mum told me, they wouldn’t have forgiven themselves had they decided to stay home. Lottie Edwards presented Sophie her Test cap before the opening day but it looked like they would miss the formalities, stuck outside the gates as it was before the public were allowed in. But the ECB’s gun media boss Henry Cowen fixed that, smuggling them through just in time. Fair to say they have barely taken a breath since, soaking in the action from the Bob Stand. Here’s a nice shot I took of them with the Alvaney Cricket Club flag they packed away for the occasion. It comes with another nice story of their day, willing her a wicket the old fashioned way: by taking a lap. When a punter asked why they were going wild when she trapped Alex Blackwell, Elaine said simply: “That’s my daughter!” Lovely stuff, lovely people and they’ve produced one hell of a bowler. Another corker of a day here in Sydney, the hottest of the three so far, as we ready ourselves for the second half of this four-day Test. Sure, the game hasn’t flown so far, but don’t let confuse the fact that this is a very good contest between two quality teams. Not least the last 20 minutes last night, where Katherine Brunt had them hooping around with the second new pink ball. Indeed, she beat the bat six times in 18 deliveries according to CricViz, picking up local skipper Rachael Haynes along the way. It makes the new partnership vital. Ellyse Perry is on 70 and batting like a dream, surely a lock to finally record her maiden international ton. She has Alyssa Healy with her, the in-form Australian across the ODIs. But still 107 behind on the first innings, and scheduled to bat fourth on a deck that will turn a fair bit come tomorrow afternoon, they can’t afford an early stumble. By contrast, England will know that if they can’t strike again while the ball is relatively new, they will be the side taking a deficit into the second innings of this match. It makes the first half hour crucial to the trajectory of the day ahead of us. That’s the state of play with half an hour until we resume. The players in front of me are well into their warm ups, the ground drenched in pink for Jane McGrath Day. It’s a lovely sight, and hopefully the Sydney crowd will again turn out in strong numbers. As always, this will be a lot more fun if we talk to each other throughout the afternoon, and then Vish when they wake up in England who will take the OBO baton from me. Hit me up in the usual ways, on the email or the tweet. Adam will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s a quick look at the state of play in this series:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/10/ashes-james-anderson-succeeds-ben-stokes-as-england-vice-captain","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T02:11:39Z","webTitle":"Ashes: James Anderson succeeds Ben Stokes as England vice captain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/10/ashes-james-anderson-succeeds-ben-stokes-as-england-vice-captain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/10/ashes-james-anderson-succeeds-ben-stokes-as-england-vice-captain","fields":{"headline":"Ashes: James Anderson succeeds Ben Stokes as England vice captain","bodyText":"England’s leading Test wicket-taker, James Anderson, has been named as Ben Stokes’ replacement as vice-captain for the upcoming Ashes series. Anderson, who has 506 wickets in 129 Tests, expressed an interest in the role earlier this week, and has seen off competition from Alastair Cook, the former captain, and Stuart Broad as Joe Root’s second-in-command. This is Anderson’s fourth Test tour of Australia, so he brings vast experience to the job. Meanwhile, the seam bowler Jake Ball will undergo a scan on his right ankle, which buckled in his delivery stride on the second day of England’s tour match against a Cricket Australia XI at Adelaide Oval. The ankle is sprained and Ball, who left the ground on crutches on Thursday evening, is unlikely to play a further part in the game. With the first Test 13 days away and just 14 fully fit players (Tom Curran has arrived in Adelaide to replace Steven Finn, another injured bowler), England can ill-afford for Ball’s problem to be serious. They are already missing Finn, Stokes, Mark Wood (heel) and Toby Roland-Jones (back), and their fast-bowling stocks are being stretched. Moeen Ali is making good progress as he returns from a side injury. He is batting comfortably in the nets and is on course to play the final tour match before the first Test, a four-day match in Townsville from Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/nov/10/chinese-media-hails-success-of-trumps-pilgrimage-to-beijing","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T03:04:20Z","webTitle":"Chinese media hails success of Trump's 'pilgrimage ' to Beijing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/10/chinese-media-hails-success-of-trumps-pilgrimage-to-beijing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/nov/10/chinese-media-hails-success-of-trumps-pilgrimage-to-beijing","fields":{"headline":"Chinese media hails success of Trump's 'pilgrimage ' to Beijing","bodyText":"Terrific. Tremendous. An extraordinary few days. Such was Donald Trump’s characterisation of his pomp-filled sojourn in Beijing. Chinese newspapers and academics seconded those emotions on Friday morning, as the US president jetted off on the next leg of his Asian tour. “China should be happy,” said Chen Daoyin, a Shanghai-based political scientist, calling the trip a diplomatic triumph for President Xi Jinping. “The leader of the world’s number one power has just made a pilgrimage to him - this is naturally how all Chinese people will see it.” “Trump has pleasantly surprised many who a year ago were deeply worried about a trade war given his harsh campaign rhetoric,” Chen Weihua, the deputy editor of the China Daily’s US edition, wrote in his appraisal of the billionaire’s “state visit-plus”. “Trump has also surprised many for his relatively good handling of US-China relations, including forging a close working and personal relationship with President Xi Jinping.” Only last year, Fudan University scholar Shen Dingli had suggested closing the Chinese embassy in Washington in protest at Trump’s engagement with Taiwan. After this week’s visit Shen was in a forgiving mood. “More than a success,” the international relations expert said of Trump’s tour. “Trump behaved moderately [and] respectfully ... He showed respect to China’s leader and China’s culture ... Xi has made Trump a better president.” The front-pages of China’s Communist party controlled press were plastered with large and identical photographs of the leaders of the world’s top two economies with headlines commemorating how “comrade Xi” and his capitalist caller had agreed “to give full play to the idea of head-of-state diplomacy”. An article in the party’s official mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, recounted scenes from a Thursday night farewell banquet at the opulent Mao-era theatre used to dazzle foreign heads of state. “The Great Hall of People’s Golden Hall looked resplendent and magnificent for this great gathering of distinguished guests,” the newspaper raved. “Xi Jinping pointed out that while there is a vast ocean between China and the United States, geographical distance has never prevented these two great nations from coming together ... As an old Chinese adage goes: ‘No distance, not even remote mountains and vast oceans can ever prevent people with perseverance from reaching their destination.’ The party’s internationally-focused media outlets were equally ebullient. “Trump has softened his tone toward China on the trade issue,” an editorial in the state-run Global Times newspaper enthused, pointing to the president’s controversial claim that China was not to blame for the trade deficit. The China Daily claimed the trip had seen “precious progress” that would “go a long way to anchoring the all-important, yet sometimes volatile, Sino-US relationship”. As Trump flew onto Vietnam, he trumpeted a “very productive” visit to China but faced criticism for failing to stand up for human rights, press freedom or even American workers during his time in Beijing. One critic claimed Beijing had played the US president “like a fiddle”. Another tweeted: “Trump can spin all he wants. His fealty to Xi Jinping over the last 48 hours will rank among his biggest foreign policy mistakes to date.” Nonsense, said Shen, arguing that it was Trump’s job “to generate jobs, not enemies” by challenging Beijing over issues such as human rights or the South China Sea. “He is doing great.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/10/new-zealands-winter-shorter-by-a-month-over-100-years","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T01:49:34Z","webTitle":"New Zealand's winter shorter by a month over 100 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/10/new-zealands-winter-shorter-by-a-month-over-100-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/10/new-zealands-winter-shorter-by-a-month-over-100-years","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand's winter shorter by a month over 100 years","bodyText":"New Zealand’s winter has gotten shorter by a month over the last 100 years, meaning “true winter” weather with very low temperatures, frosts and snow starts significantly later in the year and ends earlier. Brett Mullan, from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa), crunched the temperature records from two 30-year-periods over the last century to see if New Zealand was experiencing the same contraction of winter weather noted in other parts of the world. New Zealand’s winter starts at the beginning of June and runs to 31 August, a total of 92 days. In the South Island and some parts of the North Island winter weather usually means snow, frosts, “black ice” on the roads and temperatures as low as -7C overnight. Mullan defined a winter’s day as one in which the daily average temperature was less than 9C. He examined temperatures between 1909 to 1938, and 1987 to 2016 from seven geographically representative regions around New Zealand. Mullan discovered there was an average of 100 days per year between 1909 and 1938 when the temperature was less than 9C, compared with only 70 days per year between 1987 and 2016. Winter has contracted about equally from both ends of the season, he said. “I was quite surprised to get essentially the same results as the US – a decline of a month,” Mullan told the Guardian. “The temperatures are rising, they are milder, they are also starting half a month later and ending half a month earlier, so they are becoming more concentrated in the centre of the June, July, August period.” Mullan’s study showed that winter as defined by temperature also varied from year to year and did not fall neatly within the three month southern hemisphere parameters. Last year winter was “essentially” confined to July and August and June was unusually warm, while this year the reverse was true, and August was unusually warm. The number of frosts throughout the winter months has also declined, Mullan found. “I expected the general pattern because we know New Zealand is warming, but it interested me that it was a full month and was so close to the US experience,” he said. “It will certainly affect things like kiwi fruit production because the north of the country is becoming too warm, they are gradually moving kiwi production south. ” “Wintertime is also very important for famers when it kills pests. If it stays too warm pests can reproduce right through the year. There are benefits too. If temperatures are higher you increase the growing-degree days and crops can mature more quickly, but the natural system has evolved to live with the winter conditions and it is quite important.” New Zealand temperatures would continue to increase and winters would continue to get shorter and shorter, he said. The new Labour government in New Zealand has said climate change is this generation’s nuclear moment and has committed to several new policies to tackle the warming climate. They include setting a target of net zero for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, establishing an independent climate commission and appointing a minister for climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/10/mexico-drug-cartels-grip-on-politicians-and-police-revealed-in-texas-court-files","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T11:00:17Z","webTitle":"Mexico drug cartel's grip on politicians and police revealed in Texas court files","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/10/mexico-drug-cartels-grip-on-politicians-and-police-revealed-in-texas-court-files","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/10/mexico-drug-cartels-grip-on-politicians-and-police-revealed-in-texas-court-files","fields":{"headline":"Mexico drug cartel's grip on politicians and police revealed in Texas court files","bodyText":"The accusations made in three Texas courtrooms were staggering. Witness after witness described how a notorious drug cartel pumped money into Mexican electoral campaigns and paid off individual politicians and policemen in the border state of Coahuila to look the other way as hundreds of people were massacred or forcibly disappeared. The Texas court testimonies – gathered in a report released this week by the Human Rights Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law and Fray Juan de Larios Diocesan Human Rights Centre in Coahuila – give one of the most complete accounts so far of how organized crime has attempted to capture the institutions of democracy in Mexico’s regions. The report prompted outrage among activists who have worked with victims of violence. But the accusations were met with sharp denials from Mexican politicians and a pointed lack of interest from judicial officials. The Mexican public, meanwhile, mostly shrugged, even as the country endures its most violent year on record and the crackdown on organised crime seems unlikely to end anytime soon. “The lack of action from government is to be expected,” said Jorge Kawas, a security analyst in the city of Monterrey. “But the lack of outrage by Mexicans is just disheartening. “We’ve become numb to excessive violence. There’s no leadership in government or in the streets and Mexican media is practically useless for holding power accountable.” Allegations that Mexican politicians have acted in cahoots with drugs cartels have been common for decades, though such accusations have seldom resulted in thorough investigations, let alone criminal convictions. Even after sworn testimony in US courts has described corruption, Mexican officials appear unwilling to act. “For Mexicans, it’s always sad to hear that the real investigations against crime and corruption in Mexico have to be done elsewhere in order for them to actually mean something or obtain a result,” said Esteban Illades, editor of the magazine Nexos. Mexico’s militarized crackdown on drug cartels over the past decade has cost more than 200,000 lives and left more than 30,000 missing. But by its own terms, it has been a failure: 2017 is shaping up to be the country’s the most violent year on record. Los Zetas, a band of elite soldiers who became cartel enforcers and then established their own criminal empire, have been weakened in recent years after their senior leaders were kidnapped or killed and the group split into rival factions. But from 2006 to 2014 the group terrorised swaths of north-eastern Mexico. In Coahuila, an arid state butting up against Texas, Los Zetas killed hundreds of people and burned their bodies before scattering the ashes in the desert. The cartel carried out a string of massacres, including a 2011 rampage through the town of Allende which left about 300 dead. They also spent millions on bribery, according to testimony gathered in this week’s report and given in separate criminal trials between 2013 and 2016. “The Zetas paid bribes and integrated police officers into their hierarchy to ensure the cartel would be able to continue their illicit operations without resistance,” it said. “Witnesses described a level of Zeta control which extended to city police chiefs, state and federal prosecutors, state prisons, sectors of the federal police and the Mexican army, and state politicians.” The report also quoted explosive accusations made in US courts that Los Zetas paid off a pair of Coahuila state governors and pumped millions into state elections elsewhere in the country. Some observers urged caution, saying witness statements alone – especially from those cooperating the authorities – were not enough to establish guilt. “These guys clearly have a motive to blame others, to incriminate others. Whatever they’re saying should be read within this context,” said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst. “It’s hard to believe that in the Zetas’ peak years [in Coahuila state], 2010, 2011, 2012, they had no connections with the state apparatus in Coahuila,” he added. “Did it go to the top? I’m not sure.” Javier Garza, former editor of the Coahuila newspaper El Siglo de Torreón said that such questions would probably go unanswered by Mexican authorities. “These statements were told under oath so supposedly what they’re saying is true, but it’s never been corroborated because nobody in Mexico investigated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/19/la-belle-sauvage-book-of-dust-philip-pullman-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-19T07:00:54Z","webTitle":"La Belle Sauvage by Philip Pullman review – a tidal wave of imagination","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/19/la-belle-sauvage-book-of-dust-philip-pullman-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/19/la-belle-sauvage-book-of-dust-philip-pullman-review","fields":{"headline":"La Belle Sauvage by Philip Pullman review – a tidal wave of imagination","bodyText":"La Belle Sauvage – the name of the boat in which Philip Pullman’s hero Malcolm navigates a flooded Thames valley – was also the name of the pub in Ludgate Hill where Pocahontas and her brother Tomocomo stayed when they first arrived in London. The landlord cashed in on the Algonquian princess’s presence by using her portrait as a pub sign. Tomocomo had decided he would count the number of people he met in England by making a notch in his tally stick for each new face. By the time he left Plymouth dockyard the stick was a handful of splinters. The world turned out to be bigger than Tomocomo could imagine. The mark of a great fictional universe is that it is bigger than the story, that there is something beyond the map in the endpapers. I remember getting that Tomocomo feeling when I first opened CS Lewis’s The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and saw that there were islands and unknown lands beyond Narnia. La Belle Sauvage opens with an even greater surprise. There are nice nuns in Pullman’s Oxford! The book, the first in a three-part prequel to His Dark Materials, tells the story of the infant Lyra, who is placed in the care of some competent, kindly sisters at Godstow and who has to be rescued from her enemies and from a catastrophic flood by their resourceful odd-job boy, Malcolm. The babyhood of your most beloved character is a worryingly obvious place to start a prequel, but one of the marks of Pullman’s genius is that he can take the obvious and make it blaze. What could be more obvious than an animal companion – every Disney film has one. But is there a richer, more complex conceit in modern fiction than Pullman’s daemons – animal companions that are both a projection of yourself and a guide, both soul and guardian angel? The other mark of a great fictional universe is that you are persuaded by its rules. When Bonneville, the delicious villain of this book, abuses his own daemon, it’s a truly horrifying moment. The force of Pullman’s fantasy comes partly from the precision with which he describes the mundane. La Belle Sauvage may be floating on a supernatural flood but she’s definitely a boat of wood and canvas. There’s a delight in the details of making and fixing things – anti-clockwise screws form a major plot element. One of the unexpected pleasures of the book is the tenderness with which Pullman describes Malcolm’s growing fascination with how babies work. I’m not a bit surprised that he can write a thrilling chase but I really wasn’t expecting it to get its urgency from the need to change a nappy and the pain of a raw bottom. Of course in a sense La Belle Sauvage is a realist novel. As Alan Garner did in The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, Pullman has given his fantasy an address in the real world. You could follow the action of this story from Oxford’s Port Meadow and Folly Bridge on to London. It’s not the geography that’s changed, it’s the physics. It takes some nerve to set a fantasy book in the same locations as Alice. A lot is made of Pullman’s engagement with the literary canon – his inverting of Milton, his debt to Blake. The Odyssey is in there too, as well as Exodus – Lyra is the prophesied infant rescued from the water and sent to live in a kind of palace. But this book is also channelling the pure thrill of children’s literature. Philippa Pearce’s Minnow is surely just ahead of Malcolm’s boat, as are Arthur Ransome’s Swallow and Amazon. There’s a moment when a river god unexpectedly appears that brought to mind Lucy M Boston’s Green Knowe. There’s an encounter that is straight from the ancient Welsh tales of The Mabinogion. He’s even taken a hagiography and twisted it – the story of a boy who instead of being persecuted for standing up to persecution is canonised for helping persecute his own parents (there’s still plenty of anti-Catholicism in here). And of course Lyra’s Oxford is haunted by Pullman’s nemesis, CS Lewis. There’s an Italian saying much beloved by Italo Calvino – the tale is not told until you add to it. Pullman wrestles with all these influences like Jacob with the angel, trying to get some sort of blessing. It’s all the more amazing that after the complexities and complications of The Amber Spyglass, he has moulded them into something as simple as a chase. One other way in which La Belle Sauvage recalls those children’s classics is the sheer beauty of the book itself. David Fickling Books should be praised for the faith it’s shown in producing something both lavish and readable. It takes its place alongside the other gorgeous volumes that have appeared in the run-up to Christmas – Hamish Hamilton’s The Lost Words and Macmillan’s beautiful Moomin encyclopaedia. As a book lover you can’t but admire this attempt to assert the primacy of the physical book over the digital. At the same time, there’s a price for beauty and these books all cost more than most children would ever be able to persuade an adult to spend on a book. When I was a child that was not a problem. I could walk into a library and borrow one. Walking into the tiny library in my home town – that was my Tomocomo moment. We are allowing more and more of our children to be deprived of the possibility of such moments. We do so at our peril. • La Belle Sauvage by Philip Pullman is published by David Fickling Books (£20). To order a copy for £14.60 go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Speaking directly about the allegations seemed like it could be a career-ending risk. “I was told to delete a tweet I wrote about Louis CK abusing women before I applied to a high-profile comedy job because the people conducting the hiring process might not like it,” Nicole Silverberg, an editor and TV writer, said Thursday. “There’s a lockdown on talking about him,” the comic Jen Kirkman said in 2015 on her podcast, I Seem Fun, without naming the man in question, who was widely believed to be Louis CK. “His guy friends are standing by him, and you cannot say a bad thing about him,” Kirkman said. “And I’ve been told by people, ‘Well, then, say it then. Say it if it’s true.’ If I say it, my career is over.” That veil of protection around Louis CK was shattered on Thursday, when the New York Times laid five women’s allegations of CK’s sexual misconduct bare. Through his publicist, Lewis Kay, Louis CK declined to answer the Times’ questions. Kay did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. On Friday night, Kay said on Twitter: “As of today, I no longer represent Louis CK.” Stories of the comedian masturbating without consent in front of female comics roiled comedy circles and the internet for years, but the Times report had accusers on the record for the first time. The reaction of many Louis CK collaborators to the news was swift. On Friday, the distributor of his forthcoming film canceled the movie’s release and Netflix abandoned plans for a stand-up special. FX Networks, which aired his show Louie before it went on hiatus in 2015, said Friday night it was ending its association with CK. The network said he would no longer be executive producer or receive compensation for four other shows he was involved with on FX. But in the weeks since Harvey Weinstein was first accused of sexual harassment, Louis CK’s behavior has prompted comparisons to the allegations against the producer – as comedy’s version of the “open secret”. Megan Koester, working as a journalist for Gawker, confronted male comedians about the allegations on the red carpet of the 2015 Just For Laughs festival. It was a time when most of Hollywood was turning its back on another comedian, Bill Cosby. Cosby was facing accusations that he had drugged and raped multiple women. (A mistrial in the case was declared in June.) “One by one, I would ask a conveyor belt of comedians, all men: ‘How do you feel about the Cosby allegations?’” Koester wrote in Vice. “They would all, invariably, claim to be disgusted by the man’s misdeeds. I would then follow up with ‘How do you feel about the Louis CK allegations?’ They would all, invariably, claim ignorance.” A woman working at the event told Koester her questions about CK had been getting complaints. Then a “livid” executive intervened. “Red faced, he informed me that JFL [Just For Laughs] is a ‘family’, that Louie is a member of said ‘family’, and that I could ask my question on ‘my turf’, but that this was ‘our turf’,” Koester wrote. “This wasn’t ‘that kind’ of red carpet, he informed me, it was a ‘friendly one’, and Louie was a ‘friend of the festival.’ Were I to ask the offending question again, he said, I would be ejected from the carpet.” Bruce Hills, the Just For Laughs COO, acknowledged that he approached Koester and said her account was accurate. “This was the nature of my conversation with Ms Koester that day,” he told the Guardian through a spokesperson, after the Louis CK report was published. “My intent was to keep our awards ceremony as a celebratory event. In doing so, I was in no way defending nor aware of any allegations towards talent.” He continued, “If Ms Koester wanted talent to comment on the record, we would hope she go through the proper journalistic protocols, be forthcoming with her intentions and request a full interview.” One year later, Jon Stewart echoed several of the celebrities Koester attempted to interview. “All I can tell you is I’ve worked with Louis for 30 years and he’s a wonderful man and person and I’ve never heard anything about this,” Stewart said in 2016, when asked about the stories dogging CK. “We’ve all known Bill Cosby was a prick for a long time, so I don’t know what to tell you.” The comedians who did speak up tended to be women and tended to be well-established in their careers, such as Roseanne Barr and Tig Notaro. Notaro’s show One Mississippi featured a character who masturbated in front of a woman without her consent. “It’s Louis CK, locking the door and masturbating in front of women comics and writers,” Barr told the Daily Beast. “I can’t tell you – I’ve heard so many stories.” Thursday’s New York Times story suggests Louis CK enforced women’s silence through his powerful manager. Julia Wolov and Dana Min Goodman claimed in the story that Louis CK masturbated in front of them, without their consent, in a Chicago hotel room in 2002. In the intervening years, as the two shared their story with a wider circle of comedians, they claimed, they learned that Louis CK’s manager, Dave Becky, was unhappy that they were talking. Becky and a spokesperson for Wolov and Goodman did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. In an apology Louis CK issued Friday, he said: “I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused.” Becky strongly denied to the New York Times that he ever threatened Wolov and Goodmans’ careers – but threats weren’t necessary for there to be silence. Without naming Louis CK, Kirkman said she had struggled with the decision to join a comedian on tour because of the rumors surrounding him. In September, she strongly signaled she was talking about CK, but did not have proof the rumors about him were true, in a Village Voice interview. “What I said was, when you hear rumors about someone, and they ask you to go on the road with them, this is what being a woman in comedy is like – imagine if there’s always a chance of rain over your head, but [with] men, there isn’t. So you go, ‘Should I leave the house with an umbrella, or not?’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/10/brisbane-airport-owner-sues-firefighting-agency-over-toxic-foam","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T01:22:37Z","webTitle":"Brisbane airport owner sues firefighting agency over toxic foam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/10/brisbane-airport-owner-sues-firefighting-agency-over-toxic-foam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/10/brisbane-airport-owner-sues-firefighting-agency-over-toxic-foam","fields":{"headline":"Brisbane airport owner sues firefighting agency over toxic foam","bodyText":"The owners of Brisbane airport are suing the nation’s air services agency over the toxic firefighting foam scandal, opening up a new front of legal action against the federal government. The airport site has been contaminated with chemicals from a group of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (Pfas), which have been found to share a probable link with cancer. Overnight, authorities in California added two Pfas chemicals to a list of substances “known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity”. That finding sits in stark contrast with the Australian government’s view that there is no consistent or proven link with health impacts. The Brisbane Airport Corporation is now suing Airservices Australia – an agency responsible for firefighting services at the country’s airports – for the contamination of its site. The case was filed late last month in the Queensland supreme court. The airport issued a short statement on the case, confirming it related to the use of toxic firefighting foam. “Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) can confirm it has filed legal action in the supreme court of Queensland against Airservices Australia (ASA) in relation to historical aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) contamination caused by ASA at the airport,” the statement said. “As the matter is now before the court, BAC is unable to make further comment.” Airservices Australia is now the second federal entity to be sued over the firefighting foam contamination scandal. A spokeswoman for the agency said it was “disappointed” with Brisbane airport’s decision to launch legal action. But Airservices remained “willing to engage with relevant parties” to resolve the issue. The agency had taken a proactive approach to dealing with contamination, she said. “Airservices is one of several tenants at Brisbane airport who use fire-fighting foams for the protection of the travelling public, aircraft and facilities, and to our knowledge are the only organisation to have fully phased out the use of any products containing Pfas, having done so in 2010,” she said. “Since that time we have proactively worked to better understand the potential impact of this legacy issue, working closely with Brisbane Airport Corporation on this matter, along with the relevant commonwealth and state health and environmental authorities.” Toxic firefighting foam was used across rural and urban fire stations, defence bases, and at airports, largely between the 1980s and the mid-2000s. Firefighting services have been provided at 56 airport sites in recent decades, about half of which used the most toxic foam, 3M Light Water. About 20 Airservices operational sites are either under investigation for contamination or have been investigated. In 2003, Australia’s federal chemical regulator issued a warning about the possible environmental and health dangers of Pfas, following advice from the United States. Following that alert, Airservices began to phase out 3M Light Water, switching to another foam it wrongly believed did not contain Pfas. It now uses a Pfas-free foam. Airservices did not begin checking whether airports were contaminated until 2008. Earlier this year, Qantas advised the Queensland government that firefighting foam had spilled near Brisbane airport. More than 20,000 litres were spilt, some leaching into the Brisbane river. The spill killed fish and prompting warnings to recreational anglers. An investigation into that spill is ongoing. The contamination has also caused anxiety and stress among firefighters, many of whom were exposed to the chemicals during training. The United Firefighters Union demanded last month that airport firefighters have their blood tested. The Queensland government has already offered blood tests to firefighters working with state fire services. But the UFU believes airport firefighters, employed by Airservices, may be at a higher risk of contamination."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/nov/10/australia-should-bring-manus-and-nauru-refugees-to-immediate-safety-un-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T23:13:28Z","webTitle":"Australia should bring Manus and Nauru refugees to immediate safety, UN says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/10/australia-should-bring-manus-and-nauru-refugees-to-immediate-safety-un-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/nov/10/australia-should-bring-manus-and-nauru-refugees-to-immediate-safety-un-says","fields":{"headline":"Australia should bring Manus and Nauru refugees to immediate safety, UN says","bodyText":"Australia remains responsible for the people held in its offshore detention regimes on Manus Island and Nauru, and should immediately close the centres and bring refugees and asylum seekers to Australia or another safe country, the United Nations human rights committee has told the government. In an excoriating report, the expert committee said it was concerned about the conditions in the offshore immigration processing facilities in Manus Island and Nauru, which also holds children, “including inadequate mental health services, serious safety concerns and instances of assault, sexual abuse, self-harm and suspicious deaths; and about reports that harsh conditions compelled some asylum seekers to return to their country of origin despite the risks that they face there”. Instances of refugees and asylum seekers being encouraged to return to places where they might face danger – a breach of Australia’s non-refoulement obligations under international law - have previously been reported by the Guardian. At the height of the Myanmarese military’s “ethnic cleansing” operation against the minority Muslim Rohingya population, Rohingya held in Australia’s offshore regime were being encouraged to return to Myanmar with offers of up to $25,000 in cash if they abandoned their claim for protection. The human rights committee – an 18-member expert panel – said Australia exercised “effective control” over the offshore regime and should close it immediately. Australia should end the practice of “offshore processing”, immediately close Nauru and Manus Island, and “take all measures necessary to protect the rights of refugees and asylum seekers affected ... ensure their transfer to Australia or their relocation to other appropriate safe countries”. The committee said Australia’s policy of mandatory – and in some cases indefinite – detention of asylum seekers was unlawful. Mandatory detention, including of children, was instituted by the Keating Labor government in 1992 as a temporary measure. A 273-day time limit on detention was abandoned in 1994. During hearings last month, Australia was castigated for its routine refusals to implement the findings of the committee. Prof Yuval Shany, the committee’s vice-chair, said it was “unacceptable” for Australia to “routinely reject” the committee’s views or “self-judge” international human rights treaties, telling Australia it could not “pick and choose” which laws it followed and which rights it wanted to uphold. The committee also condemned Australia’s “marginalising and stigmatising” postal survey on marriage equality, saying it was “not an acceptable decision-making method”; the low age (as young as 10) of criminal responsibility in some states; and the persistently high rates of Indigenous incarceration, in particular mandatory sentencing laws, and allowing imprisonment for fine defaults. Australia’s confronting appraisal comes as its asylum policies reach new domestic and international attention. Australia was last month elected – in an uncontested “clean slate” poll – to the powerful UN human rights council, but the ascension brought criticism of its sustained breaches of international human rights laws. And refugees and asylum seekers in the Manus Island detention centre are currently embroiled in a standoff with Australian and Papua New Guinea authorities who are attempting to force them to move to new accommodation in the Manus community. Men have been living more than a week without food, running water, electricity or medicine. The UN high commissioner for refugees has described the situation as a “humanitarian emergency”. Several attacks and incidents have marred recent months and the 600 men refusing to leave say they are not safe in the local community. Independent observers say the proposed new housing is inadequate and unfinished. PNG immigration has given the men until Saturday to accede to moving, or face being forcibly removed. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, blamed refugee advocates for the impasse, saying they were “encouraging these people not to move”. “I think that the responsible course of action is to encourage them to comply with the lawful requests and requirements of the PNG authorities,” he said. GetUp’s human rights co-director Shen Narayanasamy, who spent time inside the now-closed detention centre, said death or serious illness was inevitable in coming days. “The conditions are appalling and it’s obvious you wouldn’t choose to stay here if you thought you could be safer elsewhere. “There is a great threat of violence from the PNG army, and the Manus island community has made it very clear it doesn’t want the men to move into accommodation closer to town.” The executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Hugh de Kretser, said Manus remained on a knife edge, and Australia was responsible for protecting those held there. “Instead, the Australian government has cut food, power and water. These innocent men are in great danger but they have nowhere safe to go. They’re terrified of violence if they stay. They’re terrified of violence if they leave. These men deserve a future, but instead of bringing them to safety, our government is trying to bludgeon them into returning to persecution or moving from one dead-end camp to another.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/09/alex-salmond-to-host-talkshow-for-russian-broadcaster","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T23:29:41Z","webTitle":"Alex Salmond to host talkshow for Russian broadcaster RT","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/09/alex-salmond-to-host-talkshow-for-russian-broadcaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/09/alex-salmond-to-host-talkshow-for-russian-broadcaster","fields":{"headline":"Alex Salmond to host talkshow for Russian broadcaster RT","bodyText":"Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, is to present a political talkshow on Russian-state owned broadcaster RT. The announcement was condemned by Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who described it as an “unedifying spectacle” and said Salmond was “a former first minister who fancies himself as the Michael Parkinson of [Vladimir] Putin’s propaganda channel”. RT has been criticised as a propaganda tool for Putin’s government, a claim that has been mocked by the channel through a series of adverts. The Alex Salmond Show will involve current affairs discussions and interviews with guests, covering politics, showbiz and sport. It will start next Thursday and will air weekly. The programme was inspired by Salmond’s sell-out performances at the Edinburgh festival during the summer. “I am delighted to be bringing the Alex Salmond Show to an international platform,” Salmond said. “After 30 years in elected politics and at the sharp end of interviews, I’m really looking forward to turning the tables and having the opportunity to see things from a new perspective. “Of course, the show will have a sharp focus on politics, but I am not interested in catching people out but in finding out much more about the personalities which lie behind their public positions. My view is that the viewer will gain far more information and entertainment from a relaxed, informal style which allows them to express their point of view.” Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of RT, said: “For the last 30 years Alex Salmond has been seen in halls of power the world over.

His message of forgiveness was described by his undertaker, who translated his words, as “the way a proper Muslim acts in a time of calamity and tribulation”. The father appeared in a Facebook video alongside Ahmad Hraichie, who describes himself as an undertaker. The pair were on the way to the boy’s funeral. The procession was given a police escort, and the child’s coffin is visible in the background. The father delivered a message of forgiveness to the woman whose car drove in to Banksia Road Public School in south-west Sydney on Tuesday. He urged the community to stop retaliating against the driver, Maha Al-Shennag, 52, and the school. There was no blame to be placed on either, and nothing could have changed what happened that day, Hraiche said. “We have a special message here for the lady that was involved in the accident,” Hraiche said, speaking on behalf of the father. “The father said that all this stuff happening about the threats to the lady and the abuse is not from them,” he said. “No retaliation is coming from the family of the boy. They have forgiven.” The father was described as a simple man with a fruit shop in Punchbowl. He was left humbled by the number of people who came to the funeral. Hraichie later exclaims: “What a father, what a champion; what a champion this man is. “No one could have expected this to happen to him that day.” More than 300 people attended the funeral at the Lakemba mosque on Thursday, the ABC reported. The family wanted to eventually sit down and talk to the driver. “If anything they want to sit with this lady and talk to her and tell her we forgive you,” Hraiche said. “Once it’s over she is welcome to come and sit with the family, to have a meal, and talk about how they can move forward, with this problem, what’s happened.” His son was described as a “beautiful boy”, who was loved by all. Two eight-year-old boys were killed in the crash on Tuesday. Three girls were also injured. The driver, Al-Shennag, has been charged with two counts of dangerous driving occasioning death, dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and causing actual bodily harm by misconduct. She was bailed to appear in court later in November. Police say they do not believe it was intentional."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/09/canadas-naked-car-crash-three-face-kidnapping-charges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T21:12:54Z","webTitle":"Canada's naked car crash takes new twist as three face kidnapping charges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/09/canadas-naked-car-crash-three-face-kidnapping-charges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/09/canadas-naked-car-crash-three-face-kidnapping-charges","fields":{"headline":"Canada's naked car crash takes new twist as three face kidnapping charges","bodyText":"Three people are due to appear in a Canadian court on charges of kidnapping in a bizarre case that burst into public view after a car full of naked people deliberately rammed another vehicle on a road in Alberta. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were called to the scene of a collision earlier this week in an industrial park in Nisku, south of Edmonton. They arrived to find a white BMW that had crashed into a truck. In the BMW sat five people, all of them naked, despite the centimetres of snow on the ground and temperatures that hovered around 10C below zero. Police described the crash as a “purposeful collision” and said drugs or alcohol may have been a factor. The five people were arrested at the scene. The RCMP later said the strange saga had actually begun about 20 minutes before the collision when two adults and a six-week-old baby were taken from a residence and forced into a vehicle. The male victim – who had been stuffed into the trunk of the car – managed to escape from the moving car. Minutes later, so did the woman, holding the baby. A passerby noticed the man on the side of the road and stopped to pick him up. The woman and baby followed shortly after. The good Samaritan was later identified as an employee of Leduc Plumbing and Heating by the company co-owner Derek Scott. “Apparently they came out of the ditch with no shoes on, so he stopped to see, obviously, if they needed help,” Scott told CTV News. “It’s the middle of the winter and people running around with no shoes on – you stop to help them.” After the three people climbed in, the truck was targeted by the suspects’ car. “They rammed him from behind … the unclothed people in the BMW,” said Scott. The force of the collision pushed the truck into a ditch. Shortly after they arrived on the scene, police and firefighters removed the five suspects from the car, cuffing their hands behind their backs. “There was no covering,” Scott told the Canadian Press. “The guy had to do the walk of shame in front of everybody, then two more women did the walk of shame in front of everybody … then the one lady was the last to be removed – she put up the biggest fight … It was a pretty wild fight. It took five people to get her out.” The victims – an older man, a woman and her baby – sat in the truck quietly as the arrests were taking place, he said. “I think they were just happy to be OK, happy to not be in a car full of naked people any more.” Police said the victims were not injured. The RCMP said on Tuesday that they had arrested five suspects: a man, two women and two female minors. The three adults remain in police custody while the minors have been released without charges. Police declined to name the accused in order to protect the youth involved. A 27-year-old man and two women, 35 and 30, are to appear on Thursday in an Alberta court on charges of kidnapping and resisting arrest. Amid questions regarding why the suspects were naked at the time of their arrest and whether they were naked at the time of the alleged abduction, police have said an “extensive investigation” was under way. In a statement they added: “The RCMP believe this was a targeted incident and that all parties were known to each other.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/09/gareth-southgate-bold-decisions-england-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T22:52:00Z","webTitle":"Gareth Southgate shows he is not too nice to make bold calls for England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/09/gareth-southgate-bold-decisions-england-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/09/gareth-southgate-bold-decisions-england-germany","fields":{"headline":"Gareth Southgate shows he is not too nice to make bold calls for England","bodyText":"In a moment of reflection this week, Gareth Southgate took it on himself to ask a member of staff at the Football Association to contact Manchester United and explain that the England manager did not intend to come across in such a bruising manner when he left Chris Smalling out of the last squad because, as he put it at the time, he needed players at the back who were better on the ball. Southgate did not think he had been misquoted but his verdict on Smalling’s ability was always going to generate headlines and, a week on, it was clear he wished it had turned out differently. Smalling, he said, was entitled to be “upset and disappointed” by the publicity it created. “If I had been Chris, I would have gone: ‘That’s a bit unfair.’” Unfortunately for Smalling, the basic point remains the same. Southgate wants his team to build from the back and Smalling, however it is dressed up, is not exactly Beckenbauer-esque in his distribution. Yes, it could have been explained with a little more tact but if there is one thing we should know about Southgate from his 14 months in charge it is how ridiculous it was for anyone to assume he might be afraid – too nice, according to the popular theory – to make difficult decisions. Smalling certainly cannot be the only one who feels slightly wounded this week now Southgate is planning to call up Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Demarai Gray and Dominic Solanke for the Brazil game on Tuesday, once they have played for the under-21s in Ukraine on Friday, and has kept out Daniel Sturridge, Jermain Defoe and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain even after the withdrawal of six players. It is easy to see what is in Southgate’s thoughts given the way Germany, England’s opponents at Wembley on Friday, have successfully integrated younger players. Southgate is a huge admirer of that system, especially when his last job was as manager of England’s under-21s, and that helps to explain why Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Tammy Abraham and Jordan Pickford go straight into his team to face the world champions. “If we don’t try things now, when will we?” he asked. “And it’s not just about Russia [next summer’s World Cup], it’s beyond that. Germany took a young team to the Confederations Cup. They are brave enough to take decisions which might get them results or might not. They are constantly evolving and that’s what we have to do.” At the same time, England will have only four friendlies beyond the current international break before they play their first game of the World Cup and the time is surely approaching when Southgate ought to have a set team, with players who know each other’s games and are accustomed to working in the same system. Perhaps that will be easier when the six Spurs players – now down to three because of the injury problems for Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Harry Winks – are all available whereas the only real theme for now is that Southgate is planning to operate with a three-man defence, using quick, attack-minded wing-backs, and hoping one or two of his younger players seize the initiative in the way Marcus Rashford did before Euro 2016. That is not going to be easy for Loftus-Cheek bearing in mind he is playing for a Crystal Palace side rooted at the bottom of the Premier League. Yet the England midfield is clearly an issue and Danny Drinkwater’s reluctance to join up, after a personal call from the manager, has left a place available beside Jake Livermore of West Bromwich Albion. Officially, Drinkwater does not feel fit enough to represent England after starting one game for Chelsea, with a further three substitute appearances, since returning from injury in late October. Yet it has also been rumoured for some time that he has not embraced international football and, though he has not put it in those terms to Southgate, it never looks good when a player who is fit, even if it not fully so, says no. Southgate was asked whether he would have done the same in his own playing career and expertly swerved the question. The truth, as everyone in his company knew, was that he would never have dreamt of turning down England. Instead, that opportunity falls to Loftus-Cheek, a creative 20-year-old with a deceptive touch bearing in mind he has the physique of a rugby player. “He’s always been the biggest kid in the playground but he’s not a player who has survived on physical strength,” Southgate said. “He’s a different sort of player, at his best in behind the opposition midfield, driving at defences – great technical quality, dribbling ability, power. He’s a really exciting player. He’s quite a quiet lad so I’m hoping he gets a lift in confidence from how we see him.” What that does for Jack Wilshere’s confidence is another matter at a time when Southgate says he intends to speak to the Arsenal player in the coming weeks but does not appear to have anything particularly positive to say. Southgate said last week that he could not trust Wilshere because of the player’s recurring injury issues but in his latest press conference he also brought in the team’s tactics and, specifically, that Wilshere has been operating as a No10 in his sporadic appearances for Arsenal and previously on loan at Bournemouth. “I think he is a deeper player,” Southgate said, “but he is not playing deeper.” Everything put together, it sounded very much like Wilshere was a long way from being called back. Slowly but surely, the Roy Hodgson team is being replaced by a new-look version, now with Abraham at the spearhead of the team’s attack, but Southgate insisted that Joe Hart was still his undisputed No1. Jack Butland has been in the thoughts of England’s management and his latest injury, breaking a finger, is another serious misfortune for the Stoke City goalkeeper, leaving the way open for Pickford to stake his own claims. The tricky bit for Southgate would usually be making these changes while taking into account that England are facing the two sides at the top of Fifa’s world rankings but the dangers are reduced by Joachim Löw’s comments that he will be doing roughly the same with Germany. Southgate has been undermined on that front by the absence of so many key players but there was no sense of him being suspicious about any of the cry-offs and, in keeping with a long line of England managers, he used the moment to call for new discussions about the possibility of a winter break. “The reality is that it is not something that is going to happen in the next couple of years,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/nov/15/deshone-kizer-kevin-durant-and-the-myth-of-the-wayward-black-athlete","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-15T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"DeShone Kizer, Kevin Durant and the myth of the wayward black athlete","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/15/deshone-kizer-kevin-durant-and-the-myth-of-the-wayward-black-athlete","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/15/deshone-kizer-kevin-durant-and-the-myth-of-the-wayward-black-athlete","fields":{"headline":"DeShone Kizer, Kevin Durant and the myth of the wayward black athlete","bodyText":"What’s a brother gotta do to catch a break in sports? Asking not for myself, a black sportswriter, but for a friend. OK, not for a friend. For DeShone Kizer, the beleaguered rookie quarterback of the terrible Cleveland Browns. Early one Saturday morning last month Kizer ducked into a downtown bar for a break, a bit of release. The pressure on him at the time surely pinched, what with the Browns being 0-6 and his passer rating at a league-worst 27.3. He is of legal drinking age, didn’t break any laws and didn’t violate any sacrosanct policies held by the team. But a Zapruder-grade Snapchat video emerged of Kizer at the bar – although he looks less like a starting NFL quarterback than a rebel prep-schoolboy as he attempts conversation on the fringe of a loud and crowded dance floor. A local TV station went on to cover the story like it was the Paradise Papers. Naturally, these findings quickly found their way into a news conference with the Browns coach, Hue Jackson, who was sympathetic to Kizer at first. “A guy’s personal time is his personal time,” he said. “I’d be surprised if that happened. I don’t think DeShone has that kind of character or personality that way.” But when a reporter from the station that scored the video insisted to Jackson that, yes, not only did this night out happen, but “to a guy trying to learn the playbook”, the coach shifted support. “You’re right,” he told the reporter. “I appreciate you guys sharing that with me.” You’d think that Jackson, a man who makes a living breaking down tape, could see the Kizer video for the gotcha moment that it is. You’d think that Jackson, a black coach, could appreciate how often black athletes feature in such gotcha moments. But, no. Confirmation bias against black athletes is so pervasive that it’s practically conventional wisdom. Even when they don’t do anything wrong, they must be guilty of something. It’s a pretzeled logic that springs from decades of media conditioning – or so reasons Dr Cynthia Frisby, the University of Missouri’s School of Journalism professor behind a 2016 study that examines how black male athletes are portrayed in the media. After analyzing a decade’s worth of clippings, she found that black athletes received “significantly more negative coverage” – hard news stories about domestic and sexual violence, in other words. Meanwhile, their white counterparts – the minority group in the landscape of big-time sports, ironically – get the opposite: softball features about drive and commitment. What’s more, the sisters can’t catch a break either. In the last four months alone we’ve seen Serena Williams caricatured in antiquated style, as a big ol’ brute – this time in a recent memoir by Maria Sharapova, an oft-vanquished peer who happens to be five inches taller than the American. And we’ve seen Simone Biles shamed for having the audacity to go on holiday after dominating the gymnastics at the Rio Olympics. We’ve been reminded that black athletes can be everything: grand slam champions, Olympic gold medalists, explosive, magic. Everything, that is, except benign. Kevin Durant knows. Last month the Golden State Warriors forward was ejected from a road game against the Memphis Grizzlies, and heckled by fans on his way out. To silence them, he raised his ring finger, a nod to the championship he led the Warriors to last season, and was immediately accused of flipping off the crowd. The confirmation bias was obvious, so much that Durant had to laugh about it afterward: “I’m sure everyone thinks I’m the angry black athlete,” he said. How could he not be when we’ve been conditioned to believe that the angry black athlete can literally be every one. They can be Curt Flood or Muhammad Ali or Colin Kaepernick, entitled to their anger. They can be Latrell Sprewell or Terrell Owens or Floyd Mayweather, hot-blooded. They can be Durant, the mama’s boy who delivered one of the all-time Hallmark moments in sports with his league MVP acceptance speech three years ago. Ultimately it won’t matter because they all look the same – like “inmates running the prison”. Those, of course, were the immortal words Houston Texans owner Bob McNair used in reference to NFL players using the national anthem as a platform to protest a justice system that’s equally demonizing of black men. Frisby’s study underscored this point in her survey, which cites research that arrived at three dominant media images of black men: entertainers, athletes and criminals. Donald Trump also underscored this point when he dismissed genuflecting players as sons of bitches. Kizer, among those protesters, was quick to respond. “I’m no son of a bitch,” he said. Both McNair and Trump clearly spoke for the legion of white Americans that have tuned out NFL football in reaction – an ESPN survey found most whites disagree with the protests and TV ratings are down. The entire pretext of that closed-door NFL owners meeting where McNair spoke those words was about the desire for control, the urgent and evergreen agenda item yoked to seemingly every conversation about black athletes. One can hardly imagine white athletes being so infantilized. Rob Gronkowski thrives on his party animal reputation (although much of that may be artful self-promotion: he does not drink alcohol during the season) while his fellow NFL tight end Travis Kelce is known for his hot temper and brash persona. Joe Namath owned a piece of a New York nightclub while on the Jets roster. When they talk about burning the candle at both ends, no one calls them immature. They don’t have to keep winning to justify their night-owling the way Michael Jordan and Lawrence Taylor, the New York Giants’ Hall of Fame linebacker, had to. They get grace. Richie Incognito can leave a voicemail for his Miami Dolphins team-mate calling him “a half-nigger piece of shit”, and get another job with the Buffalo Bills after the scandal dies down. Tony Stewart’s career as a Nascar star and team co-owner can cruise along, with minimal interruption, even after he runs over and kills someone during an amateur event (the death was later ruled an accident). Johnny Manziel, the Heisman trophy winner turned NFL flameout, gets grace – gets called a good kid who just needs to grow up. Kizer? He’s the irresponsible quarterback. Never mind if his excursion, late as it was, was likely the first night off he’d earnestly taken for himself since being drafted by the Browns last April. (Kizer is a triple threat: he can run, he can pass and he’s harder on himself than any coach.) Never mind that he can’t go looking for trouble, not with a bailiff for a mother and a police officer for a father. Never mind that Kizer “was at the facility the next day, preparing for the [Titans] game”. His sweat equity is starting to pay off. On the road against the Detroit Lions last Sunday, Kizer posted a career day (232 yards passing, 57 more rushing and a pair of touchdowns through the air and on the ground) and had the Browns trending toward a win before he was briefly knocked out of the game late in the third quarter with a rib injury. Cleveland eventually fell 38-24 but the game showed that the Browns can be competitive if their receivers don’t drop Kizer’s passes, a chemistry problem that has plagued the team all season. Kizer’s prime target is Kenny Britt, a dazzling if mischievous talent who for whatever reason (maybe a knee injury) hasn’t been able to connect with his quarterback all season. Britt and another misfit receiver, an injured second-year man named Corey Coleman, were out with Kizer on the night the Snapchat video was filmed. Rounding out their party were linebacker Christian Kirksey and two native Ohioans who play for the Kansas City Chiefs: running back Kareem Hunt and Kelce, the aforementioned party animal. So this wasn’t a true night out for Kizer. This was maybe a team-building exercise, or a chance to talk shop outside of shop walls. Kizer, and black athletes like him, deserve the benefit of the doubt. I can’t wait to see the day that they finally get it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T20:11:17Z","webTitle":"Ex-Facebook president Sean Parker: site made to exploit human 'vulnerability'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Facebook president Sean Parker: site made to exploit human 'vulnerability'","bodyText":"Facebook’s founders knew they were creating something addictive that exploited “a vulnerability in human psychology” from the outset, according to the company’s founding president Sean Parker. Parker, whose stake in Facebook made him a billionaire, criticized the social networking giant at an Axios event in Philadelphia this week. Now the founder and chair of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Parker was there to speak about advances in cancer therapies. However, he took the time to provide some insight into the early thinking at Facebook at a time when social media companies face intense scrutiny from lawmakers over their power and influence. Parker described how in the early days of Facebook people would tell him they weren’t on social media because they valued their real-life interactions. “And I would say, ‘OK. You know, you will be,’” he said. “I don’t know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying,” he added, pointing to “unintended consequences” that arise when a network grows to have more than 2 billion users. “It literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains,” he said. He explained that when Facebook was being developed the objective was: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” It was this mindset that led to the creation of features such as the “like” button that would give users “a little dopamine hit” to encourage them to upload more content. “It’s a social-validation feedback loop … exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.” Parker, who previously founded the file-sharing site Napster, joined the Facebook team in 2004 five months after the site had launched as a student directory at Harvard. Parker saw the site’s potential and was, according to Zuckerberg, “pivotal in helping Facebook transform from a college project into a real company”. In 2005, police found cocaine in a vacation home Parker was renting and he was arrested on suspicion of possession of a schedule 1 substance. He wasn’t charged, but the arrest rattled investors and he resigned shortly after. Thanks mostly to his brief stint at Facebook, Parker’s net worth is estimated to be more than $2.6bn. He set up the Parker Foundation in June 2015 to use some of his wealth to support “large-scale systemic change” in life sciences, global public health and civic engagement. Parker is not the only Silicon Valley entrepreneur to express regret over the technologies he helped to develop. The former Googler Tristan Harris is one of several techies interviewed by the Guardian in October to criticize the industry. “All of us are jacked into this system,” he said. “All of our minds can be hijacked. Our choices are not as free as we think they are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/nov/09/uk-and-eu-business-leaders-to-press-may-on-brexit-urgency","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T00:37:31Z","webTitle":"Get Brexit deal fast, business leaders to tell Theresa May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/09/uk-and-eu-business-leaders-to-press-may-on-brexit-urgency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/nov/09/uk-and-eu-business-leaders-to-press-may-on-brexit-urgency","fields":{"headline":"Get Brexit deal fast, business leaders to tell Theresa May","bodyText":"British and European business leaders are to demand an urgent breakthrough on Brexit from Theresa May in order to salvage a transition deal from the stalled negotiations in Brussels. The CBI and counterparts from France, Germany and Italy will meet the prime minister at Downing Street on Monday to warn that taking much longer to negotiate a transition agreement could render it useless because companies will soon be forced to assume the worst about the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU. The employers alliance behind the initiative, BusinessEurope, has expressed concern at the slow place of the Brexit talks. “BusinessEurope urges both sides to make additional efforts and commit to reach a withdrawal agreement as early as possible in order to address the transition and future relations,” the director general, Markus Beyrer, said. One business leader briefed on Monday’s talks said: “If we don’t get a transition deal agreed fairly soon, it’s not going to be very useful.” Talks in Brussels remain deadlocked, with EU leaders demanding that Britain agree to the principle of a large financial settlement before it discusses future arrangements, and the UK insisting both be dealt with together. Despite the commercial concerns, British ministers have intensified their brinkmanship by underlining the government’s intention to leave with or without a deal. The government announced on Thursday night that it would table an amendment to its own EU withdrawal bill to include a reference to a fixed departure point of 11pm GMT (midnight in Brussels) on 29 March 2019. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, said the amendment made it “crystal clear” that the UK intended to leave the EU on a specific date. “We’ve listened to members of the public and parliament and have made this change to remove any confusion or concern about what ‘exit day’ means,” he said. It appears to be a move by May to reassert her authority and deter Conservative rebels from opposing the bill as it passes through parliament over the next month. Writing in the Telegraph, the prime minister said: “We will not tolerate attempts from any quarter to use the process of amendments to this bill as a mechanism to try to block the democratic wishes of the British people by attempting to slow down or stop our departure from the European Union ... We are leaving the European Union on 29 March 2019.” The government faces a slew of hostile amendments to the bill from MPs across the House of Commons but has so far only agreed to the symbolic change of writing the date of departure on a front page that had previously left the date open. “This important step demonstrates our pragmatic approach to this vital piece of legislation,” Davis said. “Where MPs can improve the bill, whatever their party, we will work with them. We look forward to further debate in the House of Commons when committee stage begins next week.” Talks resumed in Brussels on Thursday without Davis or the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, though the pair are expected to host a joint press conference on Friday. Instead, Barnier gave a speech in Italy warning Britain against following a US-led race to the bottom. “When I hear the US secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, call in London for the British to diverge with Europe to better converge towards others; towards less regulation – environmental, sanitary, food, probably also financial, fiscal and social – I’m wondering,” Barnier said. “The United Kingdom has chosen to leave the European Union. Will it also want to move away from the European model? That’s another question.” EU sources said Britain had less than a month to make a concession on the financial settlement in order to guarantee the launch of trade talks in December. Senior officials in Brussels say talks have stalled since Theresa May’s Florence speech, and that the EU will find it difficult to agree to trade talks at a December summit unless May quickly offers more on the settlement. An internal EU document seen by the Guardian suggests the talks over the border on Ireland remain in limbo with the bloc’s negotiators insisting a hard border can only be avoided by Northern Ireland effectively staying in the single market and customs union. The document says it is “essential for the UK to commit to ensuring that a hard border on the island of Ireland is avoided, including by ensuring no emergence of regulatory divergence from those rules of the same internal market and the customs union ... necessary for meaningful north-south cooperation, the all-island economy, and the protection of the Good Friday agreement”. The Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, ruled out such a move last week insisting that the integrity of the UK’s internal market would not be put in jeopardy. On Friday, the British architect of the Brexit process will argue that ministers are wrong to view it as irreversible. Lord Kerr, who was secretary general of the article 50 drafting committee, will claim there are ways to resist the timetable brinksmanship by suspending the process. “We still have all the rights of a member state, including the right to change our minds,” the former Foreign Office permanent undersecretary will say in a speech. “We are not required to withdraw just because Mrs May sent her letter.” Kerr will tell an event hosted by the Open Britain campaign: “Mrs May’s letter was only a notification of the UK’s ‘intention’ to withdraw. Intentions can change.” He points to statements from European legal experts and leaders, including Emmanuel Macron, Donald Tusk and Antonio Tajani, to prove that the door is open for the UK to change its mind on Brexit, despite the fact that the Russian and US presidents would be disappointed if that happened. There are signs that the Trump administration is growing increasingly concerned by the slow progress on Brexit. Earlier this week, Ross is understood to have sympathised with concerns from US multinationals based in London about the lack of clarity over the process. “We are concerned about the potential impact of Brexit on US interests,” a senior administration source confirmed on Thursday. “Expressing concerns is something you will hear more of in the coming days because the hour is late.” The source, however, laid the blame more at the door of European negotiators: “We are not concerned about a lack of urgency on the UK’s part, but in the EU there is a view that both in using time as a negotiating tactic and in creating a demonstration effect … a non-urgent approach is not all bad. The US role is to say, ‘no this is urgent’.” Commenting on Monday’s meeting with BusinessEurope, Downing Street said: “Mrs May will reiterate the UK’s commitment to securing an implementation period of around two years once Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. She will ask the business experts from organisations including the CBI and BusinessEurope to share their input on how the UK and EU can continue to thrive side by side in industry and economic development.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/louis-ck-accused-by-five-women-of-sexual-misconduct-in-new-report","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T20:18:39Z","webTitle":"Louis CK accused by five women of sexual misconduct in new report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/louis-ck-accused-by-five-women-of-sexual-misconduct-in-new-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/louis-ck-accused-by-five-women-of-sexual-misconduct-in-new-report","fields":{"headline":"Louis CK accused by five women of sexual misconduct in new report","bodyText":"Five women have accused Louis CK of sexually inappropriate behavior that includes masturbating in front of two female comics, according to a report by the New York Times. Coming in the wake of years of rumors that have dogged the influential comedian, Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov told the Times that in 2002, CK invited them to his hotel room for a nightcap and shocked them by asking if he could take out his penis. As the two women laughed, thinking it was a joke, he proceeded to take off all his clothes and masturbate. Three other women told the Times that CK masturbated in their presence, over the phone, or that he asked if he could. Louis CK’s publicist, Lewis Kay, told the New York Times the comedian would not respond to the allegations. “Louis is not going to answer any questions,” Kay wrote in an email. CK is one of the most revered figures in contemporary comedy. The Emmy-winning creator of the FX series Louie consistently sells out huge concerts and has cultivated a reputation as an auteur. The network HBO dropped the comedian’s shows from its on demand service on Thursday night. The report came as CK prepared to premiere a new movie, I Love You, Daddy, about a television writer whose 17-year-old daughter is seduced by an older movie producer who is rumored to be a pedophile. On Thursday, his new film’s production company cancelled its New York premiere, which was scheduled for that evening, and CK cancelled an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The comedy world has convulsed with rumors about CK’s sexual misconduct for years. In 2015, Gawker linked CK to rumors about a comedian who exposed himself to fellow performers at the Aspen and Just For Laughs comedy festivals. Jen Kirkman seemed to refer to CK on a comedy podcast when she described “a known perv” who is “lauded as a genius”. (Last month, Kirkman clarified that CK had never harassed her.) As the rumors broke into public view, comedians like Roseanne Barr and Tig Notaro called on CK to respond. “I think it’s important to take care of that, to handle that, because it’s serious to be assaulted,” Notaro told the Daily Beast. “It’s serious to be harassed. It’s serious, it’s serious, it’s serious.” An episode of Notaro’s show, One Mississippi, featured a powerful man who masturbated in front of another character. “He [should] answer,” Barr tweeted, saying she was aware of “MULTIPLE accusations in Hollywood’s working woman circles”. But CK has broadly refused to answer the allegations, which were anonymous, in public. “I don’t care about that. That’s nothing to me. That’s not real,” CK told Vulture in 2016. “You can’t touch stuff like that.” Following a Toronto screening of I Love You, Daddy, CK told a New York Times reporter, “I’m not going to answer to that stuff, because they’re rumors … If you actually participate in a rumor, you make it bigger and you make it real … They’re rumors, that’s all that is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/09/mo-farah-uk-athletics-lottery-funding-marathon","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T21:30:00Z","webTitle":"Mo Farah set to keep lottery funding after switching to marathon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/09/mo-farah-uk-athletics-lottery-funding-marathon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/09/mo-farah-uk-athletics-lottery-funding-marathon","fields":{"headline":"Mo Farah set to keep lottery funding after switching to marathon","bodyText":"Mo Farah is set to continue as a lottery-funded athlete when UK Athletics announces the names on its World Class Performance Programme on Friday morning, dramatically increasing the chances he will run again in a British vest at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. It was widely assumed Farah’s name would be the most prominent in a lengthy cull of athletes, given he retired from the track in the summer to switch to the marathon, where he is yet to demonstrate world-class ability. The 34-year-old had also indicated a run in Birmingham during August was likely to have been his last in a national vest and even handed his top to a team-mate, Andrew Butchart, at the finish. However, selectors now look likely to give Britain’s most successful athlete the time – as well as the training and medical support – needed to prove he can be an Olympic medal prospect over 26.2 miles in three years’ time, when his 38th birthday will be on the horizon. A number of senior athletes will be under threat when funding decisions are announced on Friday morning. They include the former 100m hurdles world championship medallist Tiffany Porter and her sister Cindy Ofili, as well as the national long jump record holder Shara Proctor, who has struggled to capture the form that won her a world championship medal in 2015. Britain’s relay squads are also likely to be hit as selectors stop financially supporting athletes without serious chances of contributing a medal in Tokyo in favour of promoting developing those with the potential to hit their peaks in 2020 or 2024. The former Olympic and world 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu, who quietly retired after a disappointing performance at the national trials in July, will certainly be taken off funding – and she is likely to be one of many. Some of the names of the recent world championships are also expected to join the Olympic Podium programme for athletes with the potential to win medals Tokyo 2020, including the 25-year-old Callum Hawkins, who finished fourth in the men’s marathon – the joint-best performance by a British athlete ever in the event. It is understood UK Athletics is also set to tighten its rules to ensure more elite athletes attend the national trials. This year’s event was marred by a large number of withdrawals, many at short notice, and the British sport’s governing body will insist funded athletes consult a doctor 48 hours before the event if they intend to miss it through injury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/09/trump-ridiculed-losers-beijing-defeat-democrats","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T19:29:19Z","webTitle":"Trump ridiculed the losers.

Now, at home and abroad, he is one of them","bodyText":"It is one of Donald Trump’s favourite and most sneering insults. He has used it publicly about such people as Cher, John McCain, Rosie O’Donnell and Jeb Bush. In Trumpworld, all these people have been dismissed in tweets as “losers”. Right now, though, there is only one big loser in Trumpworld, and that loser is President Trump himself. Trump was a loser in whichever direction you looked this week, both at home and abroad. As a candidate, Trump bragged about all the lessons he would teach China once he was president. He would stop China from “raping” the US economy and “toying” with the US over North Korea. He would bring trade cases against China in the US courts, slap heavy tariffs on Chinese goods and stop China manipulating its currency. He would ramp up the US military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. He might even renege on the holy of holies in Sino-American relations for the past 40 years – the One China doctrine that says Taiwan is a part of China, not a separate country. Contrast that assertive Trump with the deflated one who made a joint appearance with Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday, as part of his five-nation Asian tour. In every respect, Trump’s script was so anodyne, and his conduct so docile, that they could have been drafted and prescribed by Xi himself. There were no threats on trade, no military posturing, and no mention of Taiwan or challenge to the One China policy. There were no questions at the end of the joint statement either – another win for Xi – and a reminder of which of the two men now holds all the cards in the relationship. Talking about the trade imbalance that once fired so much campaign rhetoric, Trump even said, and on the radio it sounded as if there were a few titters off-stage as he said it: “I don’t blame China.” Trump is unpredictable. This sudden kowtowing to China and its ascendant leader this week could be abandoned as quickly as it has arrived, perhaps as soon as Trump’s visit to Vietnam or the Philippines in the coming days. There is a recent precedent, after all. In the summer, Trump abruptly abandoned his scripted statesmanship over the racist violence in Charlottesville in favour of an attack on anti-racists, and an indulgent defence of the 19th-century pro-slavery Confederacy. Even so, it is hard to disagree with the Obama-era official Tony Blinken in his assessment that the Trump visit to Beijing showed two leaders heading in very different directions. While Trump builds walls, Blinken wrote this week, Xi builds bridges. While Trump shuns multilateralism and global governance, Xi embraces them. While Trump makes quixotic and backward-looking attempts to reinvent the coal industry, even promoting the role of fossil fuels in this week’s climate-change conference in Bonn, Xi has a 30-year programme designed to ensure China dominates the global economy, including in information technology, robotics and AI. Trump’s defenders will say there is nevertheless consistency here. Trump was an “America first” candidate, and he is an “America first” president. America’s role as the guarantor of the peace and the liberal order in the Asia-Pacific region and in Europe remains of secondary importance to him. His stage is America, not the world. The jobs and livelihoods that matter to him are at home, not elsewhere. His voters are in the United States and nowhere else. He is retreating from world leadership to win at home. This brings us to this week’s remarkable US elections. Although the bigger test of the Trump presidency will come in 12 months’ time, in the midterm elections that involve every one of the 50 states, this week’s “off year” contests have a message, too. A simple and clear one. They were a stunning defeat for Trump, and for the belief that he has remade the dynamics of US politics. Many have argued that Trump has upended modern politics, not just in the US but more broadly, along with Brexit and the populist upsurges in many parts of Europe. Trump didn’t merely win the White House, this argument says. He represents a broader sea change, in which the public has revolted against the centre left and the centre right, in favour of more radical demands. This week’s results cast serious doubt on that simplistic analysis and the intellectual panic that it has generated. For the unmistakable message of these elections is that Trump has lost, not won, and that the traditional alternative party, the Democrats, have scooped the pool without distinction between their moderates and their radicals. Yes, this week’s contests took place in only a minority of states, and predominantly in states in which the Democrats could expect to do well in a good year. But voters in Virginia, New Jersey, Maine, Washington state and many cities sent a consistent signal. The suburbs, full of the aspirational, low-tax, middle-class families, voted Democrat again. Women, college-educated and minority voters led the way. As EJ Dionne puts it in his Washington Post column this week: “It’s now clear that the backlash against Trump is the most consequential fact of American politics.” Trump’s strategy of reaching out to a left-behind industrial base with a racial message is not sustaining itself. Those historically low approval ratings, on which some have refused to rely because polling is supposedly now discredited, have turned out to be a better indicator than many believed. None of this is to say that US politics is now set immovably in Tuesday’s pro-Democratic template, even though the anti-Trump majority was unmistakable. Nor is it to pretend that Trump has terminally abandoned the world to Xi’s China, even though it is beginning to look that way. But one year in, Trump has been rumbled and a lot of the air has gone out of his balloon. His enemies are not, as he would have it in his tweets, “haters and losers”. On the contrary. They are optimists and winners. Right now, Trump is the loser. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2017/nov/10/uk-prosecutors-admit-destroying-key-emails-from-julian-assange-case","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"UK prosecutors admit destroying key emails in Julian Assange case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/10/uk-prosecutors-admit-destroying-key-emails-from-julian-assange-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/nov/10/uk-prosecutors-admit-destroying-key-emails-from-julian-assange-case","fields":{"headline":"UK prosecutors admit destroying key emails in Julian Assange case","bodyText":"The Crown Prosecution Service is facing embarrassment after admitting it destroyed key emails relating to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy fighting extradition. Email exchanges between the CPS and its Swedish counterparts over the high-profile case were deleted after the lawyer at the UK end retired in 2014. The destruction of potentially sensitive and revealing information comes ahead of a tribunal hearing in London next week. Adding to the intrigue, it emerged the CPS lawyer involved had, unaccountably, advised the Swedes in 2010 or 2011 not to visit London to interview Assange. An interview at that time could have prevented the long-running embassy standoff. The CPS, responding to questions from the Guardian, denied there were any legal implications of the data loss for an Assange case if it were to come to court in the future. Asked if the CPS had any idea what was destroyed, a spokesperson said: “We have no way of knowing the content of email accounts once they have been deleted.” Assange, whose WikiLeaks has been involved in a series of controversial leaks that include the Iraq war logs, US state department cables and Democratic party emails, was wanted by Sweden as part of a preliminary investigation into rape allegations. Sweden dropped the investigation in May. Detractors of Assange, who sought refuge in Ecuador’s embassy in 2012, accuse him of collaborating with Russian propagandists in undermining Hillary Clinton’s bid for the presidency and helping Donald Trump secure it. Supporters of Assange fear he could have been extradited to the US from Sweden and might yet from the UK. The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said this year Assange was a priority for the justice department and US federal prosecutors are believed to be considering charges against him over the leaks. The CPS data destruction was disclosed in a freedom of information (FOI) case being pursued by the Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi. Maurizi, a reporter on La Repubblica who has covered WikiLeaks since 2009, has been pressing both the CPS and its Swedish counterpart for information relating to Assange and extradition. Unhappy over the limited material released so far, she is taking her case against the CPS to an information tribunal on Monday and Tuesday. “It is incredible to me these records about an ongoing and high-profile case have been destroyed. I think they have something to hide,” Maurizi said. She is keen to establish how much influence the UK had in the decision of the Swedish authorities at the time not to travel to London to interview Assange. She is also looking for evidence of US involvement in extradition moves. She unearthed two years ago, through an FOI request to the Swedish prosecutors, an email from a lawyer in the CPS extradition unit on 25 January 2011 saying: “My earlier advice remains, that in my view it would not be prudent for the Swedish authorities to try to interview the defendant in the UK.” The sentence was redacted in the email obtained by Maurizi from the CPS under an FOI request but not when it was released under an FOI request from the Swedish prosecutors. Assange declined to travel to Sweden at the time, expressing fear it was a ruse that could pave the way for his extradition to the US. His lawyers offered a compromise in which Swedish investigators could interview him in person in London or by a video link, but the Swedish authorities did not take up the offer at the time. A legal manager at the CPS, Mohammed Cheema, who has been dealing with the FOI requests, said, in a lengthy witness statement in August this year, that the Assange case file comprises mainly 55 lever-arch files, one A4 file and a selection of other paper files. He added it was very unlikely the CPS held further significant email correspondence. But just 11 days before the hearing, Cheema sent a further statement saying a search of electronic records found data associated with the lawyer who had been in touch with the Swedish prosecutors “was deleted when he retired and cannot be recovered”. He retired in March 2014. Jennifer Robinson, a Doughty Street chambers barrister, and Estelle Dehon, who specialises in freedom of information, will be representing Maurizi at the tribunal. Robinson, who has also represented Assange, said: “The missing information raises concerns about the Crown Prosecution Service’s data retention policy and what internal mechanisms are in place to review their conduct of this case in light of the fact the UK has been found to have breached its international obligations.” A United Nations panel last year found Assange had been arbitrarily detained by the UK and Sweden. Robinson said: “The CPS has disclosed some material which is very limited. We know there is more.” She added: “Serious questions must be asked about the role of the CPS. Had the Swedes interviewed Assange back in 2010 one wonders whether this case would have continued for such a long time.” The Swedes had interviewed many other people in the UK in relation to other cases, Robinson said. “We had been offering the Swedish prosecutors Assange’s testimony since October 2010. We didn’t know at the time that the CPS was advising them not to take up the offer.” The CPS spokesperson, in response to a question from the Guardian why such important documents were destroyed, said the email account was deleted following retirement in accordance with standard procedure. Asked if it was CPS policy that documents relating to live court cases should be destroyed, the spokesperson said: “The individual to whom you refer was a lawyer in the CPS extradition unit discussing matters relating to extradition proceedings which concluded in 2012. The case was, therefore, not live when the email account was deleted.” He added: “Most casework papers and related material are stored for three years following the conclusion of proceedings, or for the duration of the convicted defendant’s sentence plus three months. In some cases material may be held for longer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/12/karst-plateau-bora-wind-slovenia-italy-nick-hunt","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T12:28:18Z","webTitle":"‘The wind makes Karst people stay in, and gives them character’: walker and author Nick Hunt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/12/karst-plateau-bora-wind-slovenia-italy-nick-hunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/12/karst-plateau-bora-wind-slovenia-italy-nick-hunt","fields":{"headline":"‘The wind makes Karst people stay in, and gives them character’: walker and author Nick Hunt","bodyText":"Trieste is the least Italian part of Italy – on a map it looks like it should belong to the Balkans. It was once one of the biggest sea ports in the world and has an amazing history. Climb onto the Karst, though, and it’s immediately different: the sea and city below, the smell of ice in the air, and the vast stretch of limestone, going up into Slovenia and beyond, swathes of flaky grey stone, riddled with caves and sinkholes. I remember once seeing a map of wind routes of Europe with names like Tramontana, Mistral, Sirocco, Bora and Helm. They were instantly evocative of a sense of romance and mystery. The arrows put me in mind of roads connecting regions and cultures and made me want to walk some of the paths to see if they made sense as a journey – which is what I did. The Bora is a northerly wind that’s formed along the Adriatic coastline, where the mountains run parallel to the sea, and the Karst is the most northerly region it touches. The name comes from Boreas, the Greek god of the north wind. You can see him depicted in the Tower of the Winds in Athens – a furious old man with a beard full of ice, holding a conch shell to signify the sound he makes when he sweeps down from the north. He’s associated with the wild, uncivilised region that lay beyond the frontiers of ancient Greece. Winter to spring and autumn to winter are the main seasons, but the Bora can blow at any time. Despite the disruption it causes, the people have a strong affection for it, as it sweeps away the pollution and mugginess and brings clear, bright blue skies. The Karst is a segue between western Europe and the Balkans, a much more rustic, peasant culture. And it was almost completely deserted, I hardly saw anyone in three days of walking. The wind makes people stay in and lends them character – the locals have a reputation for being tough, hardy and intensely parochial. There are lots of dialects that are mutually unintelligible, so people are very much in their own territories. The Karst was the frontier zone between the rival Hapsburg and Ottoman empires and has a sense of being bandit country. There are lots of reports of 19th-century highway robbery and fires in forests where thieves were hiding out. You can see it in the architecture; the villages are built like fortresses to defend against bandits as much as the wind, you get church steeples sticking up, like islands coming up from the sea. There are forested areas with medieval villages every few miles. You’ll see “little doves” on the roofs – rocks used to weigh down the tiles. You can tell the most wind-affected areas by the frequency of the rocks. The most famous food is pršut, a type of prosciutto, which is cured by the Bora. They hang hams in windows and it’s cured by the cold, dry air. Štanjel is a fortified medieval village surrounded by huge walls that were damaged in the second world war and it hasn’t really been rebuilt. Only about 26 people live in the old part of town and it’s very atmospheric. I stayed here in a family-run guesthouse and ate at a gostilna, a type of tavern, which served hearty soup, stew and thick homemade bread, and beer, wine and rakia (local brandy). I met a woman who said she could predict when the Bora was coming by the dryness of her hands. When they were dry, it was a sign the wind was coming. She was young and a judge and looked embarrassed by her own superstition but I think there’s something in it. The real beauty of the Karst lies in the rusticity and simplicity – the crumbling houses and taverns you might not notice because they don’t have signs up and everything is family-run and on a small scale. The area is famous for its subterranean landscape too, the amazing caves – but I didn’t go there because the wind doesn’t blow underground! • Where the Wild Winds Are by Nick Hunt (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, £16.99).

Theresa May was having a lie-in following the worst day of her time in office. A worst day that had followed the previous worst day the day before. That had followed the worst day the day before that. There was a pattern emerging. “Tell her she’s got to get up,” Pot Plant One ordered. Pot Plant Two shuffled its way out of the office and banged its leaves on her bedroom door. The Maybot let out a low groan that may or may not have included human speech. Until she was fully powered up, it was often hard to tell. “She says she’s not coming,” Pot Plant Two said. Pot Plant Three kicked open the door, dragged the Maybot into the office and sat her down at her desk. “You’ve got a reshuffle to organise,” it said. Theresa started crying. Everything was all too much. She hated feeling this vulnerable. She’d done her best not to sack Priti Patel but, even by her cabinet’s newly lowered standards the former international development secretary’s conduct had been spectacularly misjudged. And now Priti Vacant was making not-so-veiled threats about all the damage she could inflict on the government from the backbenches. “Are you sure we actually need a new minister?” she asked. With her team already falling apart it was probably better to leave the position unfilled rather than risk the embarrassment of another hasty exit. And besides, as far as she could remember, Priti Vacant’s main qualification for getting the international development job was that she had been the only person who had actively campaigned to get rid of the department she was going to run. It was just one of life’s little ironies that the only thing she had managed to get rid of was herself. Pot Plant Three put a list of suitable replacements in front of her. There was just one name on it. Penny Mordaunt. By the time the Pot Plant government-in-waiting had completed the necessary checklist – woman, hardline Brexiter, not involved in any sex scandal, not too catastrophically hopeless – Mordaunt had been the last candidate standing. “Remind me who Penny Mordaunt is again?” the Maybot asked. Pot Plant Two shrugged. Other than helping out at the Department for Work and Pensions making universal credit the resounding disaster it was, Mordaunt had last made an impression on anyone by standing in front of a Vote Leave £350m bus wearing a swimsuit and claiming Turkey was about to join the EU. It wasn’t the greatest of track records but she would have to do. Having ticked the relevant boxes, Theresa went off to watch TV. Why bother to announce the reshuffle in the morning, when it was so much more easier to wait until the afternoon? The longer she put it off, the less time there was for people to criticise her appointment. Much later than planned Mordaunt arrived at No 10. “I’m sorry I couldn’t get here sooner,” she explained. “But my train was delayed.” The wrong kind of transport minister on the line, she supposed. “So what’s the job?” Theresa talked her through the brief. It was quite easy really. Even though it had been way beyond Vacant’s ability. All she had to do was go round the world finding suitable countries to give money to.

The six have been selected by booksellers for the annual event, which celebrates physical books and real-life bookshops. And in an era of ebooks and online piracy, beautiful books are more important and popular than ever. Last year’s winner, The Essex Serpent by Sarah Perry – which was released by Waterstones in an extra shiny edition – sold 287,566 copies and helped its publisher, Profile, increase its turnover by nearly 7%. Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi (Viking) A bold rejection of the baobab-tree-and-setting-sun cliche book cover that plagued Africa-set novels for too long, this design is already being imitated. As Kingfishers Catch Fire by Alex Preston (Little, Brown) The book is beautifully illustrated by the graphic artist Neil Gower, whose work has been adapted for the cover. The Bedlam Stacks by Natasha Pulley (Bloomsbury) This cover will look beautifully familiar to fans of her international bestseller The Watchmaker of Filigree Street. Tangleweed and Brine by Deirdre Sullivan (Little Island) The cover of this “collection of 13 dark, feminist retellings of traditional fairytales” recalls early Angela Carters and The Blue Fairy Book – only in deep, feminist red. The Lost Words by Robert Macfarlane (Hamish Hamilton) According to the author, “the idea was that readers would feel a sense of walking into the book, like a landscape”. The result is a publication that is beautifully illustrated by Jackie Morris and suitably massive. Ravilious &amp; Co by Andy Friend (Thames &amp; Hudson) As a biography of the 20th-century watercolour artist, Ravilious &amp; Co had to be good-looking. It was described as “magnificent” by … none other than Robert Macfarlane. The winners of the Books Are My Bag awards will be announced on 21 November at Foyles, Charing Cross Road, London.

After 10 years of controversy and delays – including allegations of the exploitation and abuse of migrant workers in the Gulf state – the vast museum project, created in collaboration with France and designed by Paris’s star architect Jean Nouvel, opened under a giant silver dome that gently filters the blazing sunlight of a desert island intended to be dedicated to culture and art. The museum is one of the biggest cultural image-building exercises undertaken by Abu Dhabi and marks the region’s move to diversify into culture and tourism and use art for political leverage as it overhauls its military and flexes its muscles on foreign policy. But the rooms of priceless art and artefacts are also an example of France’s eagerness to use its own “soft power” of art, culture and education to cement its own foreign policy. The emotional inauguration by Macron and Abu Dhabi’s crown prince Mohammed bin Zayad Al Nahyan showed how art – from ancient sculpture to Van Gogh paintings – could be called upon by pressured leaders to attempt to smooth over difficult diplomacy. Macron’s first visit to Abu Dhabi this week comes at a time of major challenges in the region – from the crisis between Qatar and other Gulf states, to the escalating brinkmanship between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the war in Yemen. With tensions mounting in Lebanon after the resignation of the prime minister Saad Hariri and an attempted ballistic missile strike on Riyadh by Houthi rebels in Yemen, Macron warned – before even setting foot in the Louvre – about an escalation. Once inside the corridors of the museum, Macron referenced the Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky, urging that “beauty can save the world”. He promised that this unprecedented museum’s links between Europe and the Arab world would help fight against “idiocy” and the “lies” of “obscurantism”. The Louvre Abu Dhabi – which will show hundreds of works from every culture and era, half on loan from France’s most prestigious museum collections – had long been billed as the first “universal museum” in the Arab world. If it had sometimes been dismissed by Paris commentators as Abu Dhabi brashly buying social and cultural legitimacy by spending a fortune to use the Louvre brand, it is clear that France has always equally sought to gain from it. The project has been dubbed “the first museum to be born out of a diplomatic agreement”. Ten years ago France and the UAE agreed to a 30-year partnership worth $1.27bn, including $520m just for Abu Dhabi to use the Louvre name. Under the former president Jacques Chirac, France sought to stamp its influence on the Emirates city’s quest to reinvent itself as the cultural capital of the Gulf. The deal, funded by Abu Dhabi’s oil wealth, was of great financial interest to France at a time when museum funding in Paris has been increasingly under pressure. In the French art world, the deal at first sparked controversy with some senior figures in the museum world warning France risked “selling its soul”, and others questioning Abu Dhabi’s record on labour rights, human rights and open government. From the outset the deal was political. France has other important outposts in the area, namely the first international offshoot of the prestigious Sorbonne university. And when the former president Nicolas Sarkozy laid the first stone for the Louvre building works in 2009, he also opened France’s first permanent military base in the Gulf – France’s Abu Dhabi military base was the first foreign military installation built by France for 50 years and its first ever base outside French or African soil. Chirac once described the Louvre Abu Dhabi project as a desire for greater understanding between east and west – a reverse of the tide of cultural treasures that have for the last four centuries travelled from east to west. Macron called the museum the “Louvre of the desert and light” and said it represented a struggle to “defend beauty, universality, creativity, reason and fraternity”. This set the bar high for his own diplomatic challenges in the region as he begins a two-day visit to Abu Dhabi, which he called a “trusted partner” in his much-vaunted fight against terrorism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/09/climate-change-ravage-rich-poor-alike-hurricane-irma-maria","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Don’t be complacent: climate change will ravage rich and poor alike | Patricia Scotland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/climate-change-ravage-rich-poor-alike-hurricane-irma-maria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/climate-change-ravage-rich-poor-alike-hurricane-irma-maria","fields":{"headline":"Don’t be complacent: climate change will ravage rich and poor alike","bodyText":"In Pointe Michel, on the Caribbean island of Dominica, I met a woman sitting in the middle of a pile of rubble. On her right there was a fridge and on her left a ruined mattress – the only recognisable possessions among the jumble of concrete, wood, metal, glass, galvanised iron and everything else that just a few weeks ago used to be her home. She and her family had been spared but they had lost everything when the wrath of Hurricane Maria exploded there, another terrifying manifestation of climate change. Just down the road, MP Denise Charles, who was taking me round the island to assess the damage, pointed to a spot marked with debris, trees and boulders. At first I thought she was showing me a damaged road. Then she told me there used to be three houses on that spot. Fourteen people are thought to have perished when Maria smashed these homes into nonexistence. Everywhere I went these stories were repeated. Every corner of this precious island, decimated. Flying in, I did not recognise Dominica, the land of my birth. The once flourishing, green vegetation that rolled over every mountain and carpeted the valleys is gone. It has been replaced by sickly brown, bald patches of land and naked trees, stripped of their bark and lying on the ground like discarded matchsticks or sticking up in the air in stark defiance. Travelling around the country was difficult, with recently constructed roads caved in and barely accessible. I was shell-shocked when I visited Scotts Head, a beloved fishing village that holds many fond memories for me. It was virtually unrecognisable. Every house on the water’s edge is gone. In their place is now a beach, some rubble and a solitary boat, the only reminder of the once flourishing fishing trade. In Barbuda, another Caribbean island, there is a similar tale of utter devastation. Driving through the ghostly empty streets on the evacuated island it was hard to imagine that just two months ago this was a vibrant community. Our guides spoke about landmarks in the past tense. “This used to be a church, this was the police station,” pointing to a roofless blue building. I walked around a primary school that looked like it had been bombed, and a hospital that would have to be rebuilt almost from scratch. These pictures are seared into my memory. The stories of utter terror in the dead of night, of not knowing if you will survive, of people emerging the next morning like zombies, of funerals and memorials, will be in my mind every time I go into a meeting about my 52 member states. But now, the glare of the media spotlight is dimming and my fear is that this story will slide off the international agenda. We absolutely cannot allow that to happen, because what I witnessed in the last week are two countries in the Caribbean in deep humanitarian crisis. And what makes it even more worrying are the rules that the international community has set to help make aid distribution fair. There is a huge question mark over whether some of the countries affected by Irma and Maria will be able to get the help they need. Dominica is currently classed as upper middle income, which still makes it eligible for Overseas Development Assistance. But Antigua and Barbuda is a high-income country, which excludes it from receiving that assistance. Under criteria set by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, those islands will probably cease to be recipients of assistance this year. The fact is, it is not fair to exclude higher income but climate-vulnerable countries from that vital assistance when they are stuck by a cataclysmic disaster. Certainly not in this new epoch in which category 5 hurricanes, which used to come once in a lifetime, are coming within weeks of each other and with a new kind of ferocity. What Hurricanes Irma and Maria demonstrated, with vicious clarity, is that a high-income country could be made destitute in a matter of hours. It’s heartening that, after tireless advocacy from the Commonwealth and other organisations, and leadership by the UK, these rules are going to be reviewed. My worry is that change will not happen quickly enough to meet the mammoth challenges facing the Caribbean and other regions that have been so grievously damaged by a season of climatic upheaval. All those involved in making these rules, such as the World Bank and the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee, have to consider seriously our present reality and to create eligibility criteria that adequately respond to what countries, particularly those more prone to natural disasters, are actually experiencing. This is a concern for all of us; because just before the Caribbean hurricanes, hundreds died in mudslides in Sierra Leone and in floods in Asia, and thousands were displaced. This is not just about a woman, thousands of miles away, sitting amid the wreckage of her home. This is about a rapid, drastic change in climate that is wreaking havoc on our planet. Even in Ireland, Storm Ophelia claimed three lives last month. We need to accept the new reality of fast and furious natural disasters and have a plan to deal with it. We need a targeted global response that enables us to implement the Paris agreement on climate change and better coordinate a rapid reaction, with everything taken into account: search and rescue, regional coordination and legal impediments, such as the revision of aid rules. But it also needs to recognise that the human spirit demonstrated by the Commonwealth during this traumatic period is something upon which we can build. We need all hands on deck.

The revelation was made by Jacques Nasser, an independent director of Fox, during a hearing with the Competition and Markets Authority about its investigation into 21st Century Fox’s £11.7bn takeover of Sky. O’Reilly’s employment agreement will increase concerns about 21st Century Fox’s handling of a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News. The scandal eventually led to the sacking of O’Reilly, who denies the allegations, and the departure of Roger Ailes, the former boss of Fox News, who has since died. The sexual harassment scandal at Fox News has dogged Fox’s attempt to buy Sky and created more opposition to the deal. The CMA is investigating the deal on the grounds of media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards. The CMA’s notes about the meeting with Nasser, the former head of the car maker Ford, were published on Wednesday. According to the notes, Nasser said that when the board of Fox was informed of several harassment allegations against Ailes it had not been made aware of them before and reacted “quickly”, with Ailes leaving within days and several other senior figures leaving in the following months. However the situation was “different” when the board of Fox was informed of the allegations against O’Reilly. “This was in part related to there being an employment agreement with Bill O’Reilly which stated he could not be dismissed on the basis of an allegation unless that allegation was proved in court,” the CMA said of the meeting with Nasser. “Further, at the time of the allegations being raised, the evidence was uncertain.” Nasser said the board was aware that O’Reilly had made settlements with accusers but did not know the value of the settlements. Some board members wanted to dismiss O’Reilly immediately, he added, while others wanted to wait for his contract to be renewed. According to Nasser, when Fox then renewed O’Reilly’s contract, “the board ensured that a clause was inserted to state that he could be dismissed on the grounds of an allegation against him without it having to be proved in court”. Fox was criticised last month after the New York Times revealed that O’Reilly agreed a $32m (£24m) settlement with one accuser last January and that the company knew about it when they offered him a contract extension the next month. Fox confirmed at the time that it knew about the settlement, but said the financial terms were not disclosed and that new contract with O’Reilly “added protections for the company specifically aimed at harassment, including that Mr O’Reilly could be dismissed if the company was made aware of other allegations or if additional relevant information was obtained in a company investigation”. O’Reilly left Fox News in April 2017, two months after the contract was agreed. Nasser told the CMA that “with the benefit of hindsight” the Fox board should have known about the allegations against O’Reilly earlier. The CMA notes said: “JN [Nasser]acknowledged that perhaps, with the benefit of hindsight, there could have been better governance structures in place at Fox News to ensure that the board came to know of allegations at an earlier stage. “However, he confirmed that changes had subsequently been made to address this. JN stated that it is never easy to ascertain what the best governance structure for a company is and in his experience different companies have different processes in place as suits the nature of the business operations. “JN stated that as a result of the sexual harassment allegations, the 21CF [Fox] board has now implemented processes and structures to ensure allegations are escalated to the board quicker and to change the culture within the entire company to prevent harassment from occurring in the first place. He added that, in his view, it would not be conceivable that anyone at 21CF or Fox News would now believe that he or she may misbehave with impunity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/speedy/1165","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:00:03Z","webTitle":"Speedy crossword No 1,165","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/speedy/1165","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/speedy/1165","fields":{"headline":"Speedy crossword No 1,165","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/08/uk-has-become-ungovernable-no-one-wants-to-admit-it-suzanne-moore","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T18:01:02Z","webTitle":"The UK has become ungovernable – and no one wants to admit it | Suzanne Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/uk-has-become-ungovernable-no-one-wants-to-admit-it-suzanne-moore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/uk-has-become-ungovernable-no-one-wants-to-admit-it-suzanne-moore","fields":{"headline":"The UK has become ungovernable – and no one wants to admit it","bodyText":"As someone who once got a driving licence when they really shouldn’t have, I am looking forward to driverless cars. It’s a shame a lot of people will lose their livelihoods, but, hey ho, that’s the future. In fact, it feels a lot like the present. We currently have a driverless government. No one is in control – but nor is there a robotic system effective enough to govern us. It is not just that the waxwork of Theresa May unveiled in Madame Tussauds looks more strong and stable – indeed, more human – than she does; it is that her government is full of braggarts, sexual harassers and people who have decided to conduct freelance foreign policies. As ever with May, it is hard to ascertain why she wants to cling on. Her leadership is now little more than a penance to her party for not being good enough to secure a decent majority. She is surrounded by those for whom cooperation is some kind of socialist conspiracy and loyalty is for wimps. Many of her ministers wear their ignorance with pride, feeling that they can make policy in a ridiculously atomised way. They appear to have no clue how the rest of the world sees them – largely irrelevant – nor any clue of how the world is changing. In their myopic pomp, they seem not to have noticed that the US is in decline and still yearn for Reaganite certainties. This is bizarre. Trust in our institutions is collapsing before our eyes. The Paradise Papers reveal the monarchy to be tax-avoiding hypocrites. Really? Who knew? At a certain level of wealth, many simply opt out of the social contract – for that is how taxation functions – and operate according to a model that says there is no such thing as society. Huge corporations do it. Sitcom stars do it. The idea that this government can regulate this seems far away, because it is in such disrepair itself. The promise is that a Labour government can. Certainly it is becoming hard to imagine anything more shambolic and, indeed, venal than the current shower. Yet it seems deeper than this. As a nation, we have become essentially ungovernable, in ways that no one wants to admit. Anarchy in the UK has come about because Brexit has split the country. There is no definite will of the people, just different peoples who refuse to acknowledge each other’s reality. Each side accuses the other side of delusion. The delusions of grandeur of the leavers are taking us over a cliff edge that will impoverish those who voted to leave, even if they voted that way because they felt no part of the future or wealth of this country. The delusion of the remainers is that everyone who voted leave now regrets it (they clearly don’t); is old and will die soon (the politics of culling); and that somehow this can all be stopped with another referendum, ignoring the fact that article 50 has already been triggered. London remains free-floating, its own country with its own financial institutions. Scotland is remain, England is leave. Things are breaking up. The idea that Corbyn – said to be keen on a “socialism in one country” model – will sort everything out is another delusion. That country could be Islington, but it is certainly not the UK as it stands. The centre cannot hold. Everything is pulling in directions that no longer reflect long-held right-versus-left positions, but rather reveal complex emotional and cultural reactions to globalisation and its handmaiden, austerity. The forces of which the referendum made us aware signified a desire for change, a critique of power as it exists today. They also represented a closing-down, an insularity – nasty racism in some cases – and a belief in the legacy of empire. Leavers and remainers appear to inhabit different worlds and seem entirely resistant to compromise. Many remainers I know would happily sign up to border controls around the areas where they live and despise half their fellow citizens, yet they continue to see themselves as open-minded people. It is extraordinary. I seek not to minimise the uselessness of this government. It is monstrous and pitiful. But these problems will continue whoever is in government, for the issue is this: the way we are governed is no longer fit for purpose. The institutions do not work for the people. The instability at the heart of the government reflects the personal inadequacy of Tory ministers, but, politically, it runs deeper. When given a vote on something important, the majority of people voted against Westminster, against London, against the elites. Obviously, they have not taken back control, but what becomes clearer daily is that neither has the government. It is incapable of doing so. Its members are like children who shut their eyes and think no one else can see them. They lie, smear and dissemble as the UK falls apart. This may not be anarchy as we imagined it, but the chaos at the top of our system is the reckoning. We are crashing in the same car."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/08/narcissi-bobbing-in-the-slipstream-of-traffic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T18:33:34Z","webTitle":"Narcissi bobbing in the slipstream of traffic | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/08/narcissi-bobbing-in-the-slipstream-of-traffic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/08/narcissi-bobbing-in-the-slipstream-of-traffic","fields":{"headline":"Narcissi bobbing in the slipstream of traffic","bodyText":"I’ve not seen any wasps either, now that you mention it (Letters, 4 November).

Rarely do they expect to find a dead grasshopper. Curators at the Nelson-Atkins museum of art in Kansas City said they discovered the dead insect in one of its star paintings, Vincent van Gogh’s Olive Trees, when it was being scanned as part of the research for a catalogue of its French painting collection. It was spotted by paintings conservator Mary Schafer. She told a local broadcaster that she found it in the work’s lower foreground. “Looking at the painting with the microscope ... I came across the teeny-tiny body of a grasshopper submerged in the paint, so it occurred in the wet paint back in 1889. “We can connect it to Van Gogh painting outside, so we think of him battling the elements, dealing with the wind, the bugs, and then he’s got this wet canvas that he’s got to traipse back to his studio through the fields. “What’s fun is we can come up with all these scenarios for how the insect landed in the paint.” Schafer said they were curious to know if the grasshopper could be studied further to possibly identify which season Van Gogh painted Olive Trees. The paleo-entomologist Michael Engel, a senior curator and professor at the University of Kansas, was approached to examine the grasshopper further. He discovered that the insect’s thorax and abdomen were missing and there was no sign of movement in the surrounding paint. In other words, it was already dead and desiccated when it somehow landed on the artist’s wet canvas and could not be used for dating purposes. Van Gogh painted Olive Trees in 1889, the year after his falling out with his friend Gauguin which may have led to the most famous act of self-mutilation in the history of art: cutting off his own ear. Soon after, Van Gogh left the Yellow House in Arles and entered an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. It is likely that he painted Olive Trees while he was there. Van Gogh was used to the the problem of insects. In an 1885 letter to his brother Theo he writes of painting outdoors: “I must have picked up a few hundred flies and more off the 4 canvases that you’ll be getting, not to mention dust and sand ... when one carries them across the heath and through hedgerows for a few hours, the odd branch or two scrapes across them.” The grasshopper may not help in any art historical research but it has become a talking point for museum visitors, peering closely in to the painting to see if they can spot the dead insect. The museum said more significant research on the painting was underway with new analysis showing that Van Gogh used a type of red pigment that gradually faded over time. That suggests the painting looks slightly different today than when it was completed. Juliàn Zugazagoitia, director of the Nelson-Atkins, said Olive Trees was a beloved painting at the museum and the scientific study added to its richness. “Van Gogh worked outside in the elements, and we know that he, like other plein air artists, dealt with wind and dust, grass and trees, and flies and grasshoppers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2017/nov/08/a-hundred-years-after-the-russian-revolution-we-are-in-paradise","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T18:34:46Z","webTitle":"A hundred years after the Russian revolution we are in Paradise | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/08/a-hundred-years-after-the-russian-revolution-we-are-in-paradise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/nov/08/a-hundred-years-after-the-russian-revolution-we-are-in-paradise","fields":{"headline":"A hundred years after the Russian revolution we are in Paradise","bodyText":"Aditya Chakrabortty’s excellent article on international tax avoidance (7 November) skewers the many lies that western electorates have been fed.

Satisfying though it may be to bring down the Ashcrofts of this world, it is companies like Apple, shopping around for 0.005 tax rates, that need to be brought to book. This will not be easy, but it truly is a life or death struggle for our democracy; either government is for the people or it is not. We thus need a long overdue reckoning with our government: they have not just permitted this state of affairs to happen, they have actively encouraged it; most of these schemes are legal. In exchange for a few pieces of silver – jobs in the international finance sector, the odd corporate HQ – they have allowed the impoverishment of millions and perhaps worse: the corrosion of trust in government and the idea of a society that works for all. It is a disastrous state of affairs and needs radical action. Simon Diggins Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire • The very stuff of tax evasion is to secrete realities behind a plethora of legal tricks designed to mislead and throw off those supposed to see tax justice done. If those with most money, often disproportionately benefiting from the many advantages of living, working and/or owning property here in UK, go to such grotesque lengths to avoid the dues parliament intends them to pay, and get away with it, what does that do to our culture and democracy? Employees generally pay every penny of tax via the PAYE system, where it is deducted at source. What do they make of all this, with what consequences to their feelings about the country and its rulers? It may well have been an indirect factor in the Brexit shock. As someone who, as a young solicitor in the City in the 1960s, did a lot of tax mitigation for the wealthy, it makes me smile – and weep – to remember the profession’s reaction to the first hyper-artificial tax dodge devised by Messrs Bradman and Rees, called the Rossminster scheme. Many asked little and simply paid up. But arguably the best tax chambers of the day (including the barrister who, as Lord Nolan, later gave us the invaluable principles of public behaviour) decided they wouldn’t touch it. They thought the scheme would be fought and overthrown by the tax authorities. I was happy to fob off clients asking me to use the scheme for them. But the scheme “worked”, and fundamentally that was because the tax sharks were far better resourced than the authorities. So it continues. Until HMRC and other agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting tax evasions and frauds have enough experienced lawyers and accountants to cope with those deployed by the sharks, the UK will remain a soft touch. As an active member of the Lords until I resigned at the last election, I worked hard, with others and with academics and charities, to do something about this. But I fear there isn’t the will. I reluctantly suspect that our hard-pressed parties know that to really get the bit between the teeth would lead to a collapse of big-money party funding. Andrew Phillips Sudbury, Suffolk • The various stories about financial shenanigans involving places like the British Virgin Islands are another reminder of our tax-avoiding friend Richard Branson. As noted recently (Letters, 18 October), a Wirral GP partnership whose address is the Virgin Care HQ in London receives a contract from Wirral clinical commissioning group. I asked the CCG almost two years ago if, when awarding contracts, they took into account the tax arrangements of contractors (for example by using Ethical Consumer’s ratings for likely use of tax avoidance strategies). It told me it “would not take into consideration tax arrangements of contractors. When awarding contracts through the procurement process, the CCG would assess the economic and financial standing of the bidding organisations. To be clear, tax arrangements are not part of this process”. Truly Paradise has come to Birkenhead. But we knew that already. Kevin Donovan Birkenhead • Gabriel Zucman’s admirably clear article (8 November) explains how some EU member states, such as Luxembourg and Ireland, are stealing tax revenue from other member states, such as the UK. He says: “Every country has the right to choose the form of taxation it wants.” Surely within the EU this should not be the case. The EU, while continuously extending its areas of activity, has failed in its most basic task of ensuring fair trade among its members. If the commission can’t devise proper rules for corporation tax and get these accepted, what can it do? It is grotesque that the former prime minister of one of the worst tax-stealers is now commission president. I still believe that Brexit can be cancelled. And when Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister, the British government should pursue the issue of tax-stealing in the EU’s institutions so aggressively that the commission will wish that Britain had left after all. John Wilson London • Owen Jones is right (7 November). The machinations of corporations and individuals to avoid tax which have been exposed in the Paradise Papers may be legal, but are always a conscious decision, involving considerable energy and expertise to thwart the societies of what is due to them. Apple could not have had achieved its staggering net income of over €250bn over the last 10 years without the education, health, transport facilities etc in its markets; yet even the threat of a slight rise in the Irish tax-dumping rates sends it scuttling off to Jersey, to try for a zero-rate. Tax Justice Network has estimated that worldwide the public purse loses $400bn dollars a year through these practices. This is obscene. The Paradise Papers have the wrong title: they should have been named the Parasite Papers. Mark Lawrence Stuttgart, Germany • You are right to suggest “banning giving public sector contracts to big consulting firms that offer tax advisory services” (Editorial, 7 November), but why stop there? Why not ban public sector contracts to those clients who act on such advice and seek to emulate the tax avoidance exposed in the Paradise Papers? Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords • It seems appropriate for the release of the Paradise Papers to coincide with the centenary of the Russian revolution.

The move was announced on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the creation of the corporation’s first local radio station, BBC Radio Leicester. The BBC has reduced its investment in its 39 regional radio stations as more people receive their news from digital providers such as Facebook. A review of BBC local services began last year was due to make about £10m in cuts as the BBC prepares to lose £650m from the abolition of licence fees for the over-75s in 2020, as part of its funding deal agreed with the government. However, on Wednesday evening Hall said BBC local radio was becoming more – not less – important because of the increase in fake news.In a speech at a radio awards event in Coventry, the BBC director general said: “For many years the BBC has been reducing its investment in local radio. The development of new technology and the growth of smartphones has seen many people getting their local news, weather and traffic information digitally. “But the rise of digital technology has also seen the rise of fake news, not just on a global level but on a local one as well. That’s why the role of BBC local radio is actually becoming more important – not less.” Hall said he wanted a “renaissance” in local radio to help better understand the UK. “England’s changing. It’s always been a patchwork of communities, with quite distinct identities. While Newcastle’s population is getting older, Bradford’s is getting younger and Birmingham is becoming one of the most diverse cities in Europe. Decision-making is being devolved too – there are mayors in some of the big metropolitan areas and that’s having an impact. “I want to hear the sound of England as it changes. So while other media are becoming creatively less local, I want us to become even more so and to connect with our audiences in new ways.” He added: “Local radio is in the DNA of our communities. I think that is more important than ever.” The BBC will decide next year exactly how the increase in investment will be funded but said the £10m cut planned for local radio would instead be absorbed by other parts of the BBC. In a signal of intent, the shared evening programme which usually broadcasts on all of the BBC’s local English radio stations will be replaced by local content. Cuts to local radio are unpopular politically. About 6 million listeners tune in each week to the BBC’s regional stations and the last time the corporation made cuts it was criticised by its then governing body, the BBC Trust, and by MPs. BBC local radio has given the first break to a number of well-known faces. A list of 50 of the top names who cut their teeth in BBC local radio , compiled by the BBC, includes Richard Hammond (Radio York), Jeremy Paxman (Radio Brighton), Dermot O’Leary (BBC Radio Essex), Vanessa Feltz (Radio Greater London), Sophie Raworth (BBC Greater Manchester), Julie Etchingham (Radio Leicester) and Richard Madeley (Radio Cumbria)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/nov/08/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T20:59:02Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/08/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/nov/08/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A graphic which showed shipwreck locations included a caption headlined “HMS Prince of Wales, HMAS Perth and HMS Repulse”.

He had his first collection, Fighting Terms (1954), accepted for publication while still an undergraduate at Cambridge, and brought out his second, The Sense of Movement, in 1957 – the same year as Ted Hughes’s The Hawk in the Rain. Gunn and Hughes were prolific and famous enough, in 1962, to share a joint Selected Poems from Faber. Gunn met his life partner, Mike Kitay, an American visiting student, at Cambridge, and moved with him to California in 1954. By the time Gunn died at his home in Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, he had lived in the US for nearly 60 years, and had become – as he put it – an “Anglo-American poet”. In “To Thom Gunn in Los Altos, California”, his friend Donald Davie wrote: “Conquistador! Live dangerously, my Byron, / In this metropolis / Of Finistere. Drop off / The edge repeatedly, and come / Back to tell us!” This homage captures something of Gunn’s aura in the 1960s: explorer, risk-taker, connoisseur of edges. Davie nicely turns the cliche around by evoking a poet who “drops off ... repeatedly” and returns to tell the tale. Ted Hughes stayed in England, dug in and dug deep; Gunn flew to America and spread himself out. But in some ways Gunn has dropped off the edge. Davie later claimed that Gunn’s “public” had dwindled to a “following” – partly because he left Britain and partly because he kept changing styles. Becoming a poet of gay life, drugs and promiscuity also counted against him in a period when the culture preferred gay men to be camp, closeted or repressed. Fame didn’t bother Gunn, but it should bother us, because he is as good as Hughes and Heaney, though more restless and experimental. Clive Wilmer’s choices in a new Selected are judicious, while his introduction and notes are full of new material culled from Gunn’s letters, notebooks and archives. Gunn’s life deserves to be written – not just because the mind behind the poems is so absorbingly interesting and so subtly compartmentalised, but because his life spans so many of the major changes in Britain and the US since the war. A keen attendee of FR Leavis’s lectures (he still spoke of Leavis decades later), a disciplined, rigorous, unsentimental poet, a master of rhyme and metre, Gunn was also a poet of free verse and open forms. The man himself was a lover of risk and extremes, of drugs, bath houses, bars, loud music, open relationships and sex clubs. He was also private, modest, legendarily polite, orderly and with old-fashioned manners; fond of cats, Henry James and domestic stability. Though he listed his hobbies in Who’s Who as “cheap thrills”, he was a poet of great seriousness of purpose and concentration of effect, and he was always an explorer. He had the English tradition to hand, but was alive to the new poetry happening around him in the US. He could appreciate Allen Ginsberg as well as Ben Jonson, and when he called himself an “Anglo-American” poet he didn’t just mean that he lived and published transatlantically, but that he had absorbed and learned from both kinds of poetry in order to find a unique voice. He may in that respect be the only Anglo-American poet there has been. Gunn did national service but just missed war, and many of his poems are about the man in uniform – soldier, biker, the clubber in leathers or the man in the uniform of his own nakedness. “On the Move” is probably his best-known poem, and describes a motorcycle gang powering past: On motorcycles, up the road, they come: Small, black as flies hanging in heat, the Boys Until the distance throws them forth, their hum Bulges to thunder held by calf and thigh. Its original epigraph was “Man you gotta go”, a line from the 1953 film The Wild One. The poem ends: At worst, one is in motion; and at best, Reaching no absolute in which to rest, One is always nearer by not keeping still. The poem hasn’t aged, and it reads today, as it must have in 1957, as a thrilling mix of French existentialism, American counterculture, classical discipline and Elizabethan sensuousness. Reading it as a teenager in the classroom it seemed all about youth, rebellion, instinct and freedom. Reading it 30 years later it’s something else that hits us: the emptiness and the futility beneath the strapping leathers, the helmets and the revving engines. Under its dynamism and shine, the poem has something of the Elizabethan memento mori to it, a sense of what Eliot called “the skull beneath the skin”. Gunn moved to Haight-Ashbury as San Francisco was becoming the capital of the counterculture. He later joked, not really joking, that he had tried most of the “New Jerusalems” on offer, but that the “sexual New Jerusalem was by far the greatest fun”. The poems of the 1970s and 80s chronicle the hedonism of the period, but always with Gunn’s characteristic mix of rigour and freedom. We see it in his favourite of his own poems, the hippie metaphysical “Sunlight”, which reads like the Grateful Dead channelled through Marvell: Some things, by their affinity light’s token, Are more than shown: steel glitters from a track; Small glinting scoops, after a wave has broken, Dimple the water in its draining back; Water, glass, metal, match light in their raptures, Flashing their many answers to the one. What captures light belongs to what it captures. The early Gunn was loosely allied to “the Movement”, a group of formal, urbane and very English writers that included Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis and Davie. But Gunn’s America was the country of Ginsberg, Gary Snyder and Robert Duncan, with an emerging gay culture, radical politics and mind-expanding drugs. Gunn absorbed it all. He experimented with syllabics and then free verse, though remained committed to form. He felt that in poetry excess prospers in constraint. It is a very classical idea, and one he stayed true to it even with his most extreme subjects. In “The Feel of Hands”, familiar hands move from being “timid as kittens” to feral cats in the throes of desire: There is a sudden transition: they plunge together in a full- formed single fury; they are grown to cats, hunting without scruple; they are expert and desperate. I am in the dark. I wonder when they grew up. It strikes me that I do not know whose hands they are. Though it finds its way into anthologies of love poetry, this poem tracks the moment when desire burns away the individual, when you are so absorbed in the body that the person you are in bed with no longer needs to be the person you went to bed with. Desire takes over; you are consumed and de-individuated by it. The Man with Night Sweats (1992), Gunn’s penultimate collection, elegises – again in formal verse and classical metres – those who died of Aids in the gay community he called “an involved increasing family”. In “The Missing” he describes, as a survivor, how that family defined him: “But death – Their deaths have left me less defined: / It was their pulsing presence made me clear. / I borrowed from it, I was unconfined, / Who tonight balance unsupported here.” The collection won the Forward prize for poetry, and the title poem reprises Gunn’s familiar idiom of the strong body, the heroic posture, the indestructible youth. Now the body is a liability, the shield has cracked: “I wake up cold, I who / Prospered through dreams of heat / Wake to their residue, / Sweat, and a clinging sheet.” Gunn was suspicious of confessional poetry, which he found prurient and self-dramatising, but he eventually wrote about his mother’s suicide by gassing in his last book, Boss Cupid (2000). Gunn, then aged 15, and his younger brother, found the body. The poem is devastating in its clarity and precision: One image from the flow Sticks in the stubborn mind: A sort of backwards flute. The poker that she held up Breathed from the holes aligned Into her mouth till, filled up By its music, she was mute. The things that Gunn the poet accepted – mortality, ageing, the decay of the flesh – Gunn the man did not. After a life of edges, he finally dropped off and didn’t come back. Wilmer describes how, after retirement, Gunn feared old age, lost his routine, claimed he had no “juice” left for poetry. He spent more and more time taking speed and cruising in dangerous places. He died of a drugs overdose on 25 April 2004 – not a willed suicide but, as Wilmer calls it, “a chosen death ... chosen by a man who had earlier chosen life.” Gunn’s poetry, like his life, is a story of inclusions and enlargements – of excess but also of order. He wrote of his friend Robert Duncan: “You add to, you don’t cancel what you do.” Thom Gunn went on adding to the end. Selected Poems of Thom Gunn, edited by Clive Wilmer, is published by Faber."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/08/lewis-hamilton-tax-allegations-wont-distract-paradise-papers","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T18:40:58Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton says tax allegations will not distract him from racing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/08/lewis-hamilton-tax-allegations-wont-distract-paradise-papers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/08/lewis-hamilton-tax-allegations-wont-distract-paradise-papers","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton says tax allegations will not distract him from racing","bodyText":"Lewis Hamilton has responded to the allegations of tax avoidance revealed in the Paradise Papers by insisting he is comfortable with his “core values” and saying he would not allow the revelations to distract him from attempting to win this weekend’s Brazilian Grand Prix. Hamilton became Formula One world champion for the fourth time at the last round in Mexico, making him Britain’s most successful driver but since then the documents that have been revealed have somewhat overshadowed his success. The Paradise Papers data, obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with partners including the Guardian, the BBC and the New York Times, reveal Hamilton appears to have used shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, the Isle of Man and Guernsey to avoid a £3.3m VAT bill triggered when he imported his £16.5m private jet into England from Canada in 2013. Hamilton, whose wealth is estimated at £130m, accepted that the allegations had created a considerable impact. “Obviously right now there is a bit of a storm surrounding me,” he said. “There are many different stories around, but I don’t have anything to add to the whole scenario that has happened. It doesn’t distract me from my core values, and also what I am here to do which is to try and win the Brazilian Grand Prix for a second time in my life.” On Monday a spokesman for the Mercedes driver insisted that the deal was “above board” adding that it was “now in the hands of his lawyers”. Hamilton has not lived in the UK since 2007, since when he has made his homes in Switzerland and Monaco and now spends much of his time on his ranch in Colorado. He arrives in São Paulo for the penultimate race of the season before the finale in Abu Dhabi but after a close fought battle with his Ferrari rival Sebastian Vettel he can no longer be caught in the championship. He had said after taking the title in Mexico City that his intent was to go on and win the remaining rounds and that remains his goal despite the recent revelations. “I come here with this greatest feeling, amazing energy, and want to absorb that positive energy and try to shine my light as bright as I can here in Brazil,” Hamilton said. “I have had this huge wave of positive energy and nothing can really dent that. I carry that here, and I am solely focused on trying to win the race this weekend.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/08/europes-carmakers-face-30-emission-cuts-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T17:32:29Z","webTitle":"Europe's carmakers face 30% emission cuts target","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/08/europes-carmakers-face-30-emission-cuts-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/08/europes-carmakers-face-30-emission-cuts-target","fields":{"headline":"Europe's carmakers face 30% emission cuts target","bodyText":"The European commission has unveiled new proposals for limits on carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars and vans, which would compel manufacturers to cut emissions from their vehicles by nearly a third from 2030. But the proposals will not require manufacturers to make a fixed quota of their fleet run on electricity, as some campaigners had hoped. The commission said the new standards would help the bloc meet its targets on greenhouse gas reduction under the Paris agreement, and “put the EU back in the race” for global leadership on clean vehicle technology. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU commissioner for climate action, said: “Europe invented the car. And it had a good run: it modernised our economy and changed our society. But the car as we know is reaching its limits. It’s now time for Europe to re-invent it.” He said the global race to develop clean cars was “an irreversible trend” and that the new proposals would help Europe to lead it. “We need the right measures and the right incentives.” The announcement came as world governments met in Bonn, Germany, to discuss the implementation of the Paris agreement on climate change, including ways to raise countries’ emissions-cutting targets, which according to scientific advice are currently too low to protect the world from the likely effects of global warming. The new emissions standards, if accepted, would apply to manufacturers’ entire fleets. This means that carmakers can continue to produce high-end petrol-guzzling machines, as long as they offset this with lower-emission vehicles, such as electric cars, at the other end of the scale. Emissions from fleets of new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles will have to be 30% lower in 2030 compared to 2021. However, critics said these targets were too low, and that the commission had failed to learn the lessons from the diesel scandal. Ansgar Kiene, EU climate policy director at Greenpeace, said and entirely different approach was needed instead of seeking to make current technology somewhat more efficient: “These measures are fundamentally held back by the 20th century obsession with the passenger car and combustion engine. Cities and governments across Europe are way ahead of the game [for instance on restrictions on cars in city centres].” Karima Delli, chairman of the European parliament’s transport committee, which will have a chance to discuss the proposals, said the commission had yielded to the lobbying of German industry, and that the regulations fell short of what is needed to meet the Paris agreement. “This gift to the automotive industry is poisoned, not only because it hinders modernisation – needed to ensure [the industry’s] long-term viability – but also because it delays the implementation of policies accompanying this conversion.” She also condemned the commission for refusing to set tough standards requiring the manufacture of zero-emissions vehicles, such as electric cars. “By setting non-binding targets, the commission collects loopholes. It delays innovation and the development of electric vehicles.” Transport and Environment, the umbrella group for NGOs in this area, also criticised the proposals. Greg Archer, clean vehicles director, said: “The commission has gifted the car industry an ineffective regulation after they came calling. Removing the penalty for failing to meet zero-emission vehicle targets is an own goal. It amounts to handing global leadership on electric cars to China, which will be delighted to export their models to Europe, jeopardising jobs.” The commission has been mired in a controversy over whether it yielded to lobbying. Last month, the chief of staff to the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, denied claims he had instructed commissioners to drop sanctions that would punish carmakers for missing proposed electric vehicles. He was alleged to have done so after a call from the head of the powerful German auto manufacturers lobby. While admitting a call was made, the commission said it had been referred to the climate commissioner, Cañete. On Wednesday in Brussels, Cañete said: “The obligation of the commission is to hear everybody, every stakeholder, and have a conversation with all. And then with full independence establish our own position. There are people who want more ambition – we shall see what happens in the parliament and the council [which also have a say on the proposals].”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/24/reality-tv-binge-news-addicted-change-life-oliver-burkeman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-24T14:59:02Z","webTitle":"Think reality TV is mindless entertainment?

What about the news?","bodyText":"Throughout history, people who like to think of themselves as high-minded have sneered at the masses, frittering their days away on “mindless entertainment”. The definition of “mindless” keeps changing: not so long ago, novels were considered a frivolous indulgence; then broadcasting took their place, and novel-reading became something that high-minded people did. For years, I told myself I wasn’t like the Average Person who watched four hours of TV a day (my average must be more like 15 minutes), because I was doing something much more brainy: surfing the internet. Recently, largely thanks to social media, it’s become impossible to ignore the fact that this is often mindless, too. So now, on my more self-disciplined days, I stay off social media, and feel slightly superior about it. And what do I do instead, since I’m far too smart to waste my life on rubbish. Now, I listen to podcasts. So, naturally, I was intrigued by a recent essay on New York magazine’s website The Cut, by Sirena Bergman: “I listen to 35 hours of podcasts every week. Is that… bad?” Her conclusion: yes, partly. The brain needs silence, and the trouble with audio – like mobile internet, too – is that it doesn’t simply replace other forms of entertainment; rather, it seeps into the gaps (commutes, housework, exercise) that you might previously have used to be alone with your thoughts. Podcasts improve my daily life immensely and I’ve zero intention of abandoning them; but Bergman draws attention to an important truth about the content we incessantly consume: it’s quite possible to get addicted to stuff that seems edifying and intellectual, as well as to brainless nonsense. Indeed, for a certain kind of person, it’s probably easier. You know it’s a distraction to compulsively seek updates on reality shows hosted by Ant and Dec. It’s harder to remember that political news, or fascinating tales from the frontiers of science, might be serving the same function. The point is that what makes something a distraction isn’t necessarily that it’s stupid or silly. It’s the role it’s playing in your life. If it’s helping you numb out, or put off important but scary tasks, or avoid asking tough questions about how you’re spending your time, it’s a problem, whatever the details. Seemingly productive work can easily be a distraction, if it’s not the work that counts. Even deeply meaningful activities can be distractions. That’s the logic behind a suggestion attributed to the investor Warren Buffett: first, write down your top 25 goals for life; then identify the most important five, focus on them, and avoid the other 20 like the plague – because they’re the seductive ones most likely to distract you, precisely because they do matter. They just don’t matter most. From this perspective, “mindless entertainment” really isn’t the main danger. Yes, obviously, it’s a waste of time to watch four hours of (most) television a day. But that very obviousness means it’s hard to do by accident. It’s when you catch yourself feeling smug that you’re immune to that sort of thing that you really need to start worrying. • oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/nov/09/yayoi-kusama-infinity-mirrors-art-the-broad-los-angeles","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T13:00:28Z","webTitle":"Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrors reignites art's selfie debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/09/yayoi-kusama-infinity-mirrors-art-the-broad-los-angeles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/09/yayoi-kusama-infinity-mirrors-art-the-broad-los-angeles","fields":{"headline":"Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrors reignites art's selfie debate","bodyText":"The hottest ticket in Los Angeles is the Broad’s Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors, a survey of the 88-year-old Japanese artist’s five-decade body of work. The museum sold out all 50,000 tickets in the first hour, and each morning, a queue forms outside for the opportunity to pay $30 for a standby ticket at the door. In addition to viewing Kusama’s paintings and personal ephemera, each ticket guarantees a coveted 30-second slot inside each of the six “infinity rooms” – mirrored chambers in which sparkling LED lights, luminous acrylic pumpkins, or floating orbs form an immersive, kaleidoscopic abyss. For Kusama, the infinite fields of light meant the dematerialization of the body becoming one with the universe; for most ticketholders, however, it’s an awesome selfie. On Instagram, the Broad’s geotag summons a seemingly endless stream of photos of museumgoers – individuals, couples, children – holding smartphones up to Kusama’s reflective surfaces. The rise of art selfies like these has become a bone of contention among the art world elite, inciting a backlash in Kusama’s case. The New York Times’ Roberta Smith called her “a bit of a charlatan” who “stoops to conquer with mirrored ‘infinity’ rooms that attract hordes of selfie-seekers”. The LA Times went further: “The most interesting feature of the rooms is that looking at the ubiquitous photos of them is as fulfilling as actually being there”. Apartment Therapy meanwhile, declared her David Zwirner exhibition “the Instagram exhibit to end all Instagram exhibits”. Kusama, who has been making infinity rooms since the 1960s and has lived voluntarily in a Tokyo mental health facility since 1977, saw a resurgence in interest in her work in the late 2000s, right around the time smartphones were rising to ubiquity, that catapulted her into global superstardom. The Kusama effect is a universal phenomenon not only sweeping LA’s population of so-called social media influencers, but concurrent exhibitions in at multiple David Zwirner galleries in New York, the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, and a dedicated Kusama museum that opened in Tokyo in September. Kusama’s current global domination is a symptom of the larger art selfie story. Recent years have seen the development of the so-called “selfie factory,,” a name given to museums of hyper-stylized backdrops that cater specifically to selfie seekers. These include the millennial pink walls of the Museum of Ice Cream, which opened in LA’s Arts District this summer, or the elaborate interiors of Refinery29’s 29 Rooms, slated to open in December. A recent study by the marketing firm LaPlaca Cohen may stoke the cultural elite’s fears of the fall of western civilization as we know it. According to the research, “the definition of culture has democratized”, with participants placing socializing and interactivity as top priorities in cultural activities – putting Caravaggio on the same pedestal as Coachella. But this imagined cultural crisis is only a matter of perspective. The detrimental effects of social media rest solely in the eye of the beholder. Since its opening, the Broad has been criticized for its focus on crowd-pleasing works of art, including an array of glossy Jeff Koons sculptures and Kusama’s Infinity Mirrored Room – The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away. Ordinary museumgoers, however, have praised the institution for its accessibility. “It’s true that the Broad’s visitorship is very different than a traditional museum audience,” says museum director Joanne Heyler. “The average age of our visitor is 33, compared to the national art museum average of 47.” Public accessibility and social media exposure are not metrics that speak to the seriousness of an institution. The Louvre, after all, is the most geotagged museum in the world. In 2016, the Broad came in fifth, just behind another local favorite, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma), which was fourth. “For Lacma, Urban Light is huge on Instagram,” says museum social media manager Eva Recinos, referring to installation of lamp-posts by the late Chris Burden in front of the museum. “People celebrate milestones there – engagements, weddings, quinceañeras. You can come for free to take photos, and maybe that’s your entry point to Lacma at large. We do see influencers, but we do see people who don’t post about museums that often.” Back in February, just a few days into the traveling Kusama exhibition’s debut at Washington DC’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, a visitor tripped and damaged one of Kusama’s luminous pumpkins, allegedly while taking a selfie. As a result, all photos have been banned inside, which is perhaps the best thing to happen to it. At the Broad, two women accompanying a pair of young girls placed their phones in a cubby before entering an infinite field of glowing, misshapen vegetables. “Now we just enjoy it,” one of the women said, implying that the museum experience is about balance. Sometimes it’s nice to just put your phone down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/09/dulwich-hamlet-appeal-fans-keep-club-alive-development-dispute","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T14:28:57Z","webTitle":"Dulwich Hamlet appeal to fans to keep club alive after development dispute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/09/dulwich-hamlet-appeal-fans-keep-club-alive-development-dispute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/09/dulwich-hamlet-appeal-fans-keep-club-alive-development-dispute","fields":{"headline":"Dulwich Hamlet appeal to fans to keep club alive after development dispute","bodyText":"Dulwich Hamlet, one of the country’s best-known non-league football teams, are urging fans to raise money and help secure the club’s future. The club, formed in 1893, is five points clear at the top of the seventh-tier Bostik Premier but finds itself caught in the middle of a dispute between Southwark council and the property developers Meadow Residential. Meadow owns the club’s Champion Hill ground and since 2014 has contributed financially towards the running of the football club. The firm’s plan is to build houses on the site and some of the adjoining land. As part of that development Meadow has agreed to build the club a new 4,000-capacity ground nearby and help Dulwich transition to fan-ownership, free of any debt. But Southwark council believes Meadow’s plans do not provide enough affordable housing and has taken court action to block its progress. The most recent move by the council was to refuse Dulwich Hamlet’s request to renew a lease on the land next to Champion Hill, which is crucial to Meadow’s plan. As a result of the fall-out, Meadow says it is no longer willing to subsidise the costs of the team, leaving the club responsible for all future payments and financial obligations, including the wages of players and staff. Despite regular attendances of more than 1,500 at Champion Hill, the club’s future is increasingly uncertain and Dulwich are encouraging fans to donate money to the “12th Man scheme” to try to cover playing costs. The Stoke City forward Peter Crouch, who spent a short time on-loan at Hamlet, has voiced his support for the club’s appeal. Dulwich have also launched a social media campaign to get people through the turnstiles for their three November games at Champion Hill in an effort to raise as much money as possible. Hamlet’s next home fixture is against Harrow Borough on Tuesday night. In a club statement this week the Dulwich Hamlet football committee said Meadow had agreed the club would have access to all net profit from match days but noted that “we have no say in the management, pricing or efficiency of the match day operations, therefore our profit is dictated to us”. The committee also said they “sent a large list of concerns, and urgent questions to be answered to try and make sense of the situation, that have yet to be fully addressed”. Meadow argues it is funding the club to the tune of more than £170,000 each year and cannot continue to provide financial support without a development solution for the site. A spokesman for the property firm told the Guardian: “Having spent many hundreds of thousands of pounds supporting the club in recent years, Meadow is doing everything possible to work constructively with the club and Southwark council to help find a development solution that would give the club a sustainable future.” The council is still hopeful it can work with Meadow to find a solution and secure the long-term future of Dulwich Hamlet. Cllr Peter John, leader of Southwark council, said: “This week we are reopening talks with Meadow in the hope that we can find a positive way forward for the club. To date their plans haven’t complied with council policies, like delivering a decent amount of affordable housing and protecting metropolitan open land, but if Meadow are keen to work with us then we look forward to finding a solution that works for everyone, and crucially protects the club.” Whether the two parties can reach an agreement remains to be seen. Everyone involved with Dulwich Hamlet will hope that a resolution to the uncertain situation can be found soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/09/michael-bloombergs-war-on-coal-goes-global-with-50m-fund","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T06:45:06Z","webTitle":"Michael Bloomberg’s ‘war on coal’ goes global with $50m fund","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/09/michael-bloombergs-war-on-coal-goes-global-with-50m-fund","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/09/michael-bloombergs-war-on-coal-goes-global-with-50m-fund","fields":{"headline":"Michael Bloomberg’s ‘war on coal’ goes global with $50m fund","bodyText":"The battle to end coal-burning, backed by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, is expanding out of the US and around the world in its bid to reduce the global warming threat posed by the most polluting fossil fuel. Bloomberg, a UN special envoy on climate change and former mayor of New York city, has funded a $164m campaign in the US since 2010, during which time more than half the nation’s coal-fired power plants have been closed. On Thursday, he announced a $50m (£38m) plan to expand the programme into Europe and then the rest of the world. The money will support grassroots campaigns, research on the health impacts of coal and legal action against coal plants that are breaking pollution rules. Bloomberg is attending the global climate change summit in Bonn, Germany, where he is leading a group of states, cities and businesses pledging action in the US despite President Donald Trump’s opposition. Coal burning still accounts for about 20% of all of the European Union’s carbon emissions, with Germany and Poland by far the biggest polluters. Bloomberg’s initiative aims to speed up the phase-out of coal by capitalising on the fast falling costs of renewable energy alternatives and rising concerns about air pollution. Where action is being taken, such as in the UK, coal is declining rapidly. Until recently, the UK was Europe’s third biggest coal polluter, with the fuel providing 40% of the nation’s electricity, but this has fallen to 2% in just five years. In Germany, coal emissions have only been falling slowly, though on Tuesday the city of Munich voted to close its coal-powered plant 13 years early. “Coal is the single biggest polluter,” Bloomberg told the Guardian. “If you could just replace coal with any other fuel, you would make an enormous difference in the outlook for climate change.” He said rising concerns over air pollution, which causes millions of premature deaths every year around the world, is an even more immediate driver for phasing out coal: “If you live downstream of a coal-fired power plant your life expectancy is significantly shorter. This initiative will help to speed progress and save many lives.” Bloomberg argues that the mass closure of coal plants in the US did not result from government action, but from civil society advocacy building on the falling costs of renewable energy: “Sometimes a little push will get you over, perhaps from a neighbour saying ‘I don’t want to breathe that stuff any more’.” In October, Bloomberg said: “The war on coal … was started and continues to be led by communities who are tired of having their air and water poisoned when there are cleaner and cheaper alternatives available.” In Europe, some of the new funding will be administered by the European Climate Foundation, which is led by Laurence Tubiana, who was France’s climate change ambassador when the landmark Paris deal was signed in 2015. “Europe still relies significantly on coal for power generation, but the rapid pace of development in cheap renewables offers a great opportunity,” she said. “Together with Bloomberg Philanthropies, we can help change the course of history and drive Europe’s shift to a cleaner, healthier and more prosperous future.” The UK’s climate change minister Claire Perry welcomed the new initiative: “The UK was one of the first countries in the world to commit to phasing out unabated coal-fired power generation by 2025 and we encourage other nations to follow our lead. Reducing global coal consumption is a vital part of reaching our climate goals.” Jonathan Marshall, at the UK’s Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: “Tackling coal across Europe is essential if we are going to keep global warming below dangerous levels. But there are some clear laggards: Germany, Poland and Turkey.” “Public opinion is only moving in one direction, and coupled with market conditions that see coal pushed to the margins, the lifetime of the black stuff is surely limited,” he said. Bloomberg is now looking for partners to push the coal campaign into Asia, where most coal is burned and the coal industry hopes it might see growth: “I hope to expand it in the near future.” But he rejected arguments that coal plants are the fastest and most cost-effective way to bring electricity to the many millions of people around the world who do not have it: “Number one, it is not the cheapest or quickest, and number two, how many people are you going to kill [with air pollution]?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/08/migrants-only-cross-borders-as-last-resort","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T18:33:48Z","webTitle":"Migrants only cross borders as last resort | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/08/migrants-only-cross-borders-as-last-resort","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/08/migrants-only-cross-borders-as-last-resort","fields":{"headline":"Migrants only cross borders as last resort","bodyText":"You are right that migrants attempt the journey to Europe even though they know the risks (They know the risks and still they come: why young Africans chase the European dream, theguardian.com, 6 November). This is because they have no choice, and there are not enough safe and legal routes available. They are fleeing persecution, abuse and poverty and migrating is a last resort for the majority. Our new report released this week based on interviews with 67 Eritreans shows that the joint EU-Africa policy intended to help migrants and refugees, known as the Khartoum Process, is in fact part of the problem. It pushes the problem offshore and creates risks for vulnerable people. Our findings show that people decide to cross borders irregularly and take extreme risks when alternative options are perceived to be equally bad, or worse. What policy makers view as an ill-informed decision is often calculated risk-taking. Most of those fleeing persecution, human rights abuses, conflict and poverty are not even attempting to get to Europe and remain in the region. We argue that a new approach is needed – one in which there is a shift in focus on to the political context in which migration takes place, rather than the criminality that it attracts. Tackling the symptoms rather than the causes of migration will do little to change the current equation in which people take considerable risks for want of alternatives.

And Paddington, with his ingrained decency, generosity of spirit and unshakable faith in the value of good manners, cements himself as a slightly sticky beacon of hope for these dark and unsettled times. If the first film was a pro-immigration rallying call for multiculturalism, the second explores themes only a bear’s-hair-breadth less political. Paddington wants to buy a handmade pop-up book for his Aunt Lucy’s birthday and sets out to graft honestly, if chaotically, to earn the money, only to have the book snatched away by the chicanery of a showboating actor who believes himself immune from suspicion by virtue of the nonstick coating provided by his celebrity. Errant luvvie Phoenix Buchanan (Hugh Grant on deliriously hammy form) is just one of the moreish treats in this gelato-hued comedic feast. The film retains the Keatonesque physical comedy – like all the finest silent clowns, Paddington is endearingly earnest, even as he dangles from the ceiling fan of a barber shop. But visually, it’s more arresting than the first film – there’s a precision to the framing and to the meticulous palette, which evokes the work of Wes Anderson. Meanwhile, an appealing animated sequence nods towards the homespun naivety of Michel Gondry’s Be Kind, Rewind. And although the bear himself may be sugar-coated, or at least marmalade-coated, the peril here is every bit as acute as in the first film. Rather than a renegade taxidermist with a scalpel and a penchant for fetish wear, the climax this time is a breathlessly tense underwater escape sequence. And it’s this – the fact that writer/director Paul King is willing to take children out of their comfort zone, to tap into fears of disappointment, desertion and possible death – which makes Paddington 2 something to treasure rather than just to entertain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/08/zara-workers-protest-fast-fashion-worry-all-of-us","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T16:50:43Z","webTitle":"The Zara workers’ protest shows why fast fashion should worry all of us | Daisy Buchanan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/zara-workers-protest-fast-fashion-worry-all-of-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/zara-workers-protest-fast-fashion-worry-all-of-us","fields":{"headline":"The Zara workers’ protest shows why fast fashion should worry all of us","bodyText":"If I search for #Zara on Instagram, I can see well over 22m posts of people wearing clothing that was bought from the retailer, everywhere from Dublin to Dubrovnik, New York to Newport. If you’re reading this in an office, I’d bet you a tenner that someone, somewhere in the building is wearing a Zara shirt or jacket. In the UK, Zara has been a high-street fixture since 1998, and has a growing number of stores. Millions of us have brought the brand into our homes – and so millions of us should be shocked and infuriated by reports that factory workers in Istanbul have been hiding notes in the clothes that they have been producing for one of Zara’s suppliers, pleading for help. One note apparently read: “I made this item you are going to buy, but I didn’t get paid for it.” The workers were reportedly left unpaid after their factory shut down overnight. Inditex, Zara’s parent company, has since promised to reimburse its sub-contractor’s workers as soon as possible. But the rise in rampant consumerism remains a worry. The value of the UK fashion industry has jumped to £26bn (up from £21bn in 2009) and fashion bucks broader growth trends – to put it simply, our appetite for new shoes and accessories is growing more quickly than our appetite for food. We know that our love of fast fashion is terrible for the environment. It was estimated that this spring Britons would send 235m pieces of clothing to landfill. Consumer debt levels are reaching an all-time high, and as retailers such as Asos are starting to offer credit options to their young customers, it’s scarily easy to spend money we don’t have on clothes we don’t need. I wonder whether our failure to address the fast fashion problem is because it affects more women than men, at every level. Even though research conducted earlier this year found that British men typically spend more on their clothes than women, fashion and clothes are routinely dismissed as trivial, feminine interests. Women are exploited and mocked, disproportionately targeted by advertisers and then accused of being frivolous and fluffy for spending their hard-earned money on a shopping trip. That’s just at the consumer end. More seriously, it’s estimated that, of the estimated 60-75 million garment workers who are employed to make our clothes, 80% are women, working in dangerous conditions and not being paid a living wage, if they’re being paid at all. Globally, poverty affects women first. More than 70% of the world’s poorest people are women. In 2013, Rana Plaza, a building in Bangladesh that housed five garment factories, collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people and injuring thousands more. At the time, the tragedy was believed to be a wake-up call, one that would permanently change the way that the goods we consume are produced. Yet just 17 brands have signed the Apparel and Footwear Supply Chain Transparency Pledge, and there has been a spate of fires in garment factories. It’s too easy to dismiss the complaints of underpaid workers as a women’s problem. When we do this, we don’t acknowledge that every one of us is part of the solution, regardless of gender. I know many men and women who are horrified by the way so many of our clothes are produced, and are doing their best to consume more carefully, by introducing no-spend months or ensuring that they only ever buy second-hand clothes. However, we need a much more effective solution, and something that can be implemented at a higher level. A globally agreed, industry-wide minimum wage and safety standards for all workers is imperative. It’s important that manufacturers would face serious, punitive consequences for failing to meet these standards. Ultimately the brands must take responsibility for making these changes – but even if consumers can’t lead this revolution, we can agitate for it. The 2015 ethical consumer report shows that the ethical market in the UK has grown to £38bn, meaning the it is now worth twice as much as the tobacco market. The evidence suggests that we care about where our clothes come from, and we don’t necessarily want them to be produced as cheaply as possible – not when lives are at stake. I’m not sure that the best way to support these workers is to stop shopping altogether. This action does not address the fact that the fashion industry could potentially be a positive space for women, and provide opportunities for them as skilled workers and consumers. It’s vital that we recognise the industry’s wider value. Paying the predominantly female workers properly might cut into profit margins, or force us to pay more for our jeans – but it gives workers the chance to lead happier, safer lives, to live in better conditions and to educate their children, which is ultimately going to provide an enormous boost to the global economy. Analysts at Euromonitor predict that global demand for menswear will outstrip womenswear by 2020, a clear indicator that this isn’t simply a concern of just one half of the population. It’s time for every one of us to start taking fashion and its provenance seriously. • Daisy Buchanan is a columnist and features writer covering arts, entertainment and women’s issues. • This article was amended on 12 November 2017 to amend the number of garment workers who are employed to make clothes globally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"travel/2017/nov/11/billund-denmark-lego-house-legoland-lalandia-family-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T11:00:23Z","webTitle":"Legoland and beyond: a laid-back family break in Denmark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/nov/11/billund-denmark-lego-house-legoland-lalandia-family-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/nov/11/billund-denmark-lego-house-legoland-lalandia-family-holiday","fields":{"headline":"Legoland and beyond: a laid-back family break in Denmark","bodyText":"If you asked your child to devise the perfect holiday, what would it look like? Lots of pool time? A chance to play all day? Animal attractions? There are plenty of places that might spring to mind, but a small inland Danish town is probably not among them. Billund in Jutland, however, has not one but three major draws for families: the world’s first Legoland, opened in 1968; Scandinavia’s biggest water park, Lalandia; and, since September, the Lego House. On top of that, in a stroke of genius, the town has renamed itself Capital of Children. Much more than a clever slogan, Capital of Children is an organisation set up by the Lego company and the local council, tasked with making Billund the most child-friendly place to live and work, not just in Denmark, but in the world. In practice, this means local children are invited to planning meetings to give their input on new outdoor spaces, facilities, such as the children’s library where kids can clamber over the book shelves, and safer routes through the town. “It’s about including kids in deciding what kind of society we would like to live in,” Charlotte Sahl-Madsen, a former government minister and now CEO of Capital of Children, told me. For the visitor, the most obvious manifestation of this ambitious project is the Lego House (adult/3-12 years £24, under-3s free). It’s a gleaming white architectural wonder that looks as if a giant has been playing with oversized Lego bricks, and which Sahl-Madsen describes as the Lego family’s “gift to the Capital of Children”. The Guardian’s architecture critic, Oliver Wainwright, had already praised its brilliant design – the interlocking blocks, brick-like wall tiles and brightly coloured terraces – so when I took my seven-year-old son over October half-term, I knew that we were in for a visual treat. What I hadn’t expected was that there would be so much to do inside the building we’d end up spending eight hours there. There is a genuine wow factor in the colossal Lego tree (6½ million bricks) that dominates the centre of the indoor ‘square’, and in the creations dreamed up by Lego super fans – known as “Afols” (adult fans of Lego). But the real thrill for children is having access to 25 million Lego bricks. Friendly staff sporting Lego figure name badges wander the “experience zones”, gently steering children towards activities – and keeping an eye on the adults, too; there’s no skulking in the corner scrolling your mobile here. We made flowers for Lego gardens, frogs on lily pads and cars that we raced on a track. We competed in robot games, and even played through lunch: diners build their order in bricks, then watch their meal being ‘made’ in an on screen animation before it’s delivered in a Lego-style box by robots. Even the exhibition on the history of the Lego company had us engrossed. Did you know that the original Lego bricks couldn’t lock together? Visitor numbers are expected to soar in July and August, when a timed entry system will operate, but in October half-term I could count on one hand the number of people in each room. As family trips go, Billund was turning out to be a breeze, with queue-free attractions, and easy driving. At Legoland (one-day pass adult £43, child £40), we walked straight on to every ride, returning to some for a second go just because we could. And then there’s Lalandia. This vast entertainment centre – right next door – has somehow slipped under the radar of British tourists. Of the 723,000 visitors to its Aquadome (adult £32, child 3-12 years £26, under 3s free) in 2016, less than 2% were from the UK. To enter the revolving door of Lalandia is to swap the real world for a windowless, Vegas-style mega zone, with painted blue skies, a “street” of cafes and shops, a mini-amphitheatre and a head-spinning number of activities: ice-skating to bowling, crazy golf to climbing and games arcades. Without a doubt the highlight is the Aquadome. We spent an afternoon splashing around in the four pools and six waterslides, and riding fat tubes on giant inflatables. When we were spewed out of the Tornado slide, my son had a manic grin on his face. “My body hates it but my brain loves it!” he squealed. Lalandia is totally naff, so naturally kids love it. But the on-site cottages exhibit the Danish flair for cool, calming spaces. In better weather, we would have made use of our terrace and the playgrounds dotted about the site. When we’d had our fill of Lego and waterslides, we moved on, first to Givskud zoo (adult £24, 3-11 years £12, under-3s free) – a safari park with the bonus of 40 life-size dinosaurs – and then to the nearby town of Vejle. Sitting at the top of a fjord on Jutland’s east coast and flanked by woods, and a rare (for Denmark) hill, Vejle is popular for outdoor activities. In summer families descend on the beaches dotted along either side of the fjord. This being Scandinavia the brave continue to swim through the winter and last month a sauna opened on Tirsbaek beach. Recently, the town has gained a reputation for striking architecture: the award-winning Bølgen (Wave), a row of five undulating apartment buildings, overlooks the harbour, and another architectural marvel: the floating Vejle Kayak Club. We admired both from Remouladen, a stylish restaurant named Lunch Restaurant of the Year by a Danish publication in 2012, with views of the waterfront, chairs with sheepskin throws and a menu featuring open sandwiches, a Danish speciality. I humiliated myself by asking for a kids’ meal – to keep the cost down – but was politely refused and opted instead for Faroese smoked salmon on rye bread topped with tiny pieces of chopped apple. Pricey at £10 but delicious. With 10 museums, Vejle punches well above its weight culturally. The Museum of Cultural History shares space in a former cotton mill with arts studios and start-ups and is the resting place of Haraldskær Woman, a bog body dating from 490BC and discovered in 1835. She may be a hard sell for kids after Lego and Lalandia, but parents will appreciate a bargain lunch in the cafe. Between noon and 1pm, there’s a small buffet of freshly made dishes for around £8 a head, or half of that for just the soup. Kolding, half an hour to the south, is another small town with a thriving cultural scene. Its Trapholt design museum is its best-known arts venue but families shouldn’t miss Nicolai for Børn, a children’s centre offering creative activities and a laid-back restaurant decorated with film posters also with a buffet (the Danes seem to love the all-you-can-eat concept) lunch. We stayed at Kolding Hotel Apartments, with stylish interiors and views of the floodlit 16th-century castle. With non-stop entertainment, this trip was always going to be a winner with my son.

The new season of Sesame Street seems to be the perfect counter to Trump’s rhetoric, as it specifically focuses on “helping kids recognize similarities and celebrate differences – particularly around race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class”. The first episode of Sesame Street’s 48th season sees Elmo, Big Bird and co travel to different, diverse neighborhoods around New York City. The gang travel to Chinatown, to a west African neighborhood, and to a predominantly Mexican area. Mexico, and its citizens, were a particular target of Trump’s ire during his campaign. Sesame Street head writer Ken Scarborough said the show was aiming to expose children to different cultures, through simple ideas like food and dance. “Obviously in this day and age it seems to be a time when differences aren’t celebrated,” Scarborough said. “I think there’s a lot of distress in the world, there’s a lot of things that you look for simple solutions and simple answers to things and a lot of that has to do with ‘the other’. “People aren’t really ‘the other’. So it’s sort of seeing past that blaming other people for something that is not a problem of people per se, but is just a problem of understanding, of education.” The Sesame Street cast travels around New York City in a balloon in the first episode, looking for a magic wand and discovering those new areas. Some of the episode was filmed in Brooklyn, in May, causing quite a stir among regular parkgoers as the puppeteers maneuvered their characters in the hot sun. Scarborough and his team began writing the show in October last year, in the midst of one of the most divisive presidential campaigns in recent history. Trump was particularly critical of Mexicans during his campaign – describing immigrants from Mexico as rapists and drug dealers – and his pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border was one of his signature promises. His attempt to ban people from predominantly Muslim countries added to criticisms that he was heightening racial tensions. Sesame Street has proved progressive in other areas over the years by helping children deal with different people and issues they might face. Earlier this year the show welcomed a new character called Julia, who has autism, to the cast. The way the other characters interacted with Julia served to help viewers understand why children with autism might behave in certain ways. Sesame Workshop – the not-for-profit, educational arm of Sesame Street – has also run programs aimed at helping children who have a parent in jail or family members serving in the military. Rosemarie Truglio, vice-president of education and research of Sesame Workshop, stressed that the show was “apolitical” and that the focus was not a direct response to Trump, but said the season would serve as “wonderful opportunity for different children to learn about different races and cultures”. “We don’t want to be myopic,” Truglio said. “We want to be able to open our world to learn more about our world and the people in it.” In a phone interview, Sesame Street character Elmo said he had found the focus on race and ethnicity beneficial. “We meet people from Mexico and Africa and all different places,” Elmo said. “Elmo thinks that you can find friends anywhere. And any time you find a new friend, you learn new things too.” The puppet said he was excited for the new season to begin and to share his experiences with viewers. “Elmo learned that what makes us different is what makes us special,” he said. “Elmo thinks it’s important to celebrate the differences we all have. It’s important to recognize the things we have in common. And not our differences.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/09/house-commons-less-toxic-workplace-mps-hr-procedures","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T12:59:01Z","webTitle":"How to help tackle sexual harassment in the House of Commons | André Spicer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/house-commons-less-toxic-workplace-mps-hr-procedures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/house-commons-less-toxic-workplace-mps-hr-procedures","fields":{"headline":"How to help tackle sexual harassment in the House of Commons","bodyText":"“Thanks,” I said to my friend before taking a first sip of the cheapest pint in central London. I was slouching in a dark corner of one of the dozen bars in parliament. It was past 10 at night, but the place was packed. “There are the Labour party people,” my friend said. “Over there are the Tories,” he added. “And there are the journalists.” Taking a second sip, I looked around, trying to avoid seeming conspicuous. “Everyone here looks the age of my students,” I told my friend. “Yeah. They’re mainly researchers working in MPs’ offices. Sometimes an MP comes down here,” he said. “Most just want a drink. But you have to watch out for a few of them.” I had not thought about my friend’s offhand comment until stories began to emerge of sexual harassment by male politicians in Westminster. Looking at the growing list of allegations, I was shocked but not surprised. I spent two summers in Westminster with my colleague, Jo Silvester, interviewing dozens of MPs and parliament officials. We were frequently told that MPs’ offices are like “650 small businesses”. And, as in most small businesses, basic personnel processes are accidental at best. A potential staffer can discover an “informal chat” is actually a job interview. Newly recruited staff members can feel bewildered because of lack of guidance. More established staff can find they are asked to do things that go far beyond their job description. When things go wrong, staff members have no clear processes they can use to register their complaints. These problems are compounded by large power differentials between MPs and their staff. Some MPs think that being an elected official elevates them above the rules that apply to others serving the public. It is little wonder that some parliamentary staff spoke about their job as “member handling”. Lurking just below this sense of invincibility is an equally troubling insecurity. MPs know they live in a world where power and loyalty is everything. Reshuffles and scandals can come from nowhere. They can end up shouldering others’ mistakes. And if they find themselves ousted by their constituents, building another career can be tough. An absence of formal systems, big power differentials and endemic insecurity has made the House of Commons into the ideal hothouse for uncivil behaviour. No wonder the Labour MP Jess Phillips described parliament as “toxic”. Westminster is not unusual. The structures in place in parliament mirror investment banks, elite law firms, top management consultancies and scientific labs. In each of these workplaces, you will find many ambitious young people relying on a few older, powerful, yet securely insecure individuals. They run their teams like private fiefdoms. Yes, there are HR departments, but they are usually an afterthought. Uncivil workplaces are costly. They manufacture stress, anger, anxiety, ill-health, poor productivity, and low job satisfaction. They push people out and this increases recruitment and training costs. High turnover blows huge holes in an organisation’s collective memory. In parliament, this means we get lacklustre public scrutiny, worse laws, and poorer political representation. The toxic culture of parliament is one reason why successive UK governments are so successful at creating grand screw-ups which cost the taxpayer billions. Theresa May has made a start at cleaning up parliament by introducing a code of conduct. But a new document is not enough to detoxify the Westminster bubble. We need to make MPs offices less like a collection of small businesses. This means politicians might swallow a bit of their own medicine and adopt the same kind of formal HR processes they have foisted on public service. One idea is to make MPs’ staff into civil servants rather than personal underlings. We also need to ensure that people can speak up, and their voices will be heard. Introducing an anonymous reporting line or calling for people to come forward is not enough. Parliament needs to make people who speak out feel like they will be taken seriously and won’t face reprisals. To do this, parliament should encourage regular feedback from junior people, and ensure transparency about the feedback process. It should soften the symbols of power around Westminster, and shout about cases of when people created positive change. Finally, we need to ensure parliament is a more diverse workplace. In her Good Parliament report, Sarah Childs, professor of politics and gender at Birkbeck, University of London, makes many suggestions about how this could be achieved. Three recommendations that need urgent consideration are: providing proper maternity leave; ensuring parliamentary hours are more regular and predictable; and providing transparency about who was and wasn’t selected as a political candidate. Doing these things would help to make parliament look a little more like a normal workplace. Making parliament into a more diverse and civil workplace will take effort. MPs must all realise they are responsible. In the words of Childs, this means “MPs should acknowledge parliament does not just serve the preferences of individual politicians. They also have a collective responsibility as a parliament.” • André Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City University London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/11/baywatch-bjork-mimicking-madonna-30-years-of-french-and-saunders","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"Baywatch, Björk and mimicking Madonna: 30 years of French and Saunders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/11/baywatch-bjork-mimicking-madonna-30-years-of-french-and-saunders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/11/baywatch-bjork-mimicking-madonna-30-years-of-french-and-saunders","fields":{"headline":"Baywatch, Björk and mimicking Madonna: 30 years of French and Saunders","bodyText":"At the TV Baftas in 2009, French and Saunders were given a joint fellowship in celebration of their comedy career. They walked on stage to the sound of Here Come the Girls, as was the legal requirement for every woman achieving something from the period between 2008 and 2012. They got a standing ovation from the crowd of TV insiders. The applause went on, and on, so much so that Jennifer Saunders had to shout at the audience to quieten them down: “Shut up, shut up! That’s very embarrassing. Far too long.” They had officially retired as a double act the year before, with a final live show together at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London’s West End. It was, as Saunders put it, “the icing on the cherry on the cake”. But this Christmas, they’re back. They’ve unsplit the split for a one-off festive special, their first full TV appearance together, aside from Comic Relief skits, since 2007. “We have almost deliberately stayed alive this long just to force the British Broadcorping Castration to put us on television one last time,” Saunders said, when the news was announced. There will be a spoof of The Handmaid’s Tale – who couldn’t see the comic potential in a series about the subjugation of women under an ultra-conservative authoritarian regime? – and Dawn French has promised their take on “drunken reality shows”, presumably the likes of Love Island and Geordie Shore. The later series of French and Saunders were not their best, and many fans will be cautiously excited about the news that the pair are back on screen. But I am over the moon that they’ll be there in the schedules this year. The impact of their sketch comedy, so surreal, silly and pioneering, can be criminally understated. As Miranda Hart, herself a big French and Saunders fan, tweeted when they picked up that honorary Bafta: “Their influence [has] been extraordinary and often unrecognised [by] industry elite.” If their influence has been understated, it is not difficult to trace the specific lines of their impact, both from their double act and the shows they did outside of it. Absolutely Fabulous was such a global hit that Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham have cited Saunders as an inspiration, and of course, the series emerged from a French and Saunders sketch, in which French played the long-suffering daughter. Smack the Pony’s musical skits were a direct descendant of what their forebears did. In an early French and Saunders sketch, Saunders plays a harried dinner party host who insists on guiding her guests around the nibbles and ends up smashing her head against the sink; it’s similar territory to that tackled – though with a blacker heart – by Julia Davis and Jessica Hynes in the much-admired pilot Lizzie and Sarah. It is unlikely that any of the big comedy phenomena of recent times – from Little Britain to Miranda to Catherine Tate; the ones your parents and even grandparents can quote at you – would be the same had French and Saunders not paved the way. To me, they were pop stars. Although the show officially ran for 20 years, from 1987 to 2007, there were just seven series. I recorded their mid-90s episodes on to VHS and watched them over and over until the tapes wore thin, memorising whole sketches word for word, wondering how they managed to make falling over so funny. It was their spoofs of pop culture that first hooked me, specifically the one in which Saunders dressed as Axl Rose, deflating the pompous Guns N’ Roses video for November Rain. These parodies remain among their most popular sketches, though the best ones are often far weirder. Everything, from high art to low, was fair game. They did their own black-and-white take on an Ingmar Bergman film that mostly revolved around tea, biscuits and death. (“Look, the best thing is if we just get through it,” says Saunders. “We can pretend to understand it then read a book about it later.” “Make us a symbolic cup of tea, would you?” replies French.) They reimagined the Crawford-Davis dynamic for themselves in Whatever Happened to Baby Dawn, and used Misery to mock their critics, with Saunders attempting to branch out on her own. (“You’ll just have to go back to what you do best – writing comedy with both of us in that just isn’t that funny,” snaps French.) And I’m not saying Aziz Ansari is a British sketch-show aficionado, but Master of None’s Bicycle Thieves homage was not the first time classic Italian cinema has been played for laughs; French and Saunders did Fellini in 1996. They took on Baywatch; wafty period drama The House of Eliot (reimagined as The House of Idiot); and Joan and Jackie Collins in the outrageously flamboyant Lucky Bitches, which, with its unsparing use of leopard print, managed to make them even camper than the real thing. French and Saunders were always at their best when they were fundamentally silly, and their delight in ridiculousness found a perfect match on the art scene. Muriel and Maddie, their version of Gilbert and George, has only grown funnier with age (“We. Don’t. Eat. Meat!”), while their music spoofs relied on the same kind of absurdity that led to the unforgettable spectacle of Dawn French dressed up as Björk riding on the back of a truck attempting to swallow an egg whole. The duo had a knack for tangling surrealism with observational humour, something that hit the mark most often when they played at being teenagers. They were schoolgirls taking pills together for the first time, though they turned out to be Tic Tacs and only made them mintily sway to the Home and Away theme. One of their most famous sketches saw the duo on a school trip, storming to the back of the bus and eating their lunch before they had even set off. Their bravado was popped at the end when, after shoplifting from the gift shop, they were crestfallen at being left behind. There’s a similar pathos to be found in their fond-ish evisceration of ballet training: “We just don’t think eating is very clever, or aesthetic.” French and Saunders’s legacy has a kind of cosy sheen now that’s only partially deserved. It’s due to their softer later series, and the fact that the pair have simply been doing it for so long. But there were always sharp teeth in their welcoming smiles. They sent up the New York standup comedy scene with French as a Sandra Bernhard-esque comic screaming at the audience: “Get outta the pool!” (perhaps an early precursor to the Twitter insult “Get in the sea”). Their parody of an aggressively rude radio host had Saunders asking French’s foreign correspondent how she handled the shortage of food in Beirut (“Paint a picture of how a person like you would cope in that kind of situation,” she trilled, slyly). They did shiny, happy breakfast TV with a grinning ruthlessness. “This morning after nine, I’m going to be looking at some ‘women’s things’, plumbings and waterworks …” smiles French as the patronising host. “And also some poor people who are naturally ashamed of their condition. We’ll be dressing them up in rich people’s clothes for the day before we send them back to their miserable lives.” But for all their sharp edges, what made French and Saunders so special was their sheer, unbounded silliness – and that’s probably what made them divisive. In her book Me. You. A Diary, French recalls receiving the news that they had been given their first TV show. “Thank you Jimmy Moir the head of entertainment at the BBC in the 80s … who explained that although he didn’t personally get what was funny about French and Saunders, clearly enough other people did, so he was prepared to ‘put my dick on the table’ and give us our own series.” Dick aside, where it belongs, that incident shows that, even then, people didn’t always get them. Plenty of viewers will never find French and Saunders funny but then, plenty of viewers will never find falling over funny, and the two hardly ever remained on their feet for a whole episode. Silly jokes are rarely treated with the same kind of reverence as, say, dark humour or satire, and that’s a shame, because surreal, joyful silliness is what French and Saunders have always done best. 30 Years of French and Saunders is on BBC1 over Christmas Six of the best A half-dozen of French and Saunders’ finest moments Björk Hates Normality Björk is hardly lacking in spoofable qualities, but this combination of Big Time Sensuality, It’s Oh So Quiet and a quick trip around Iceland, the supermarket – “Why can’t I buy anything fresh?” – made for one of the duo’s very best musical skits. Nibbles “Help yourself to nibbles … I’ll show you around the nibbles myself, actually.” The suburban dinner party of nightmares builds on brilliantly precise details only to inevitably fall apart in a frantic and hilarious disintegration. In Bed With French and Saunders The pair have had a career-long fascination with Madonna, and Jennifer Saunders has had a career-long fascination with Dawn French’s bosom; this B&amp;W documentary spoof finally brought the two together. The School Trip From the tonic water with “this much brandy in it” to the inappropriate footwear to the furtive fag breaks (“Do you inhale?”), this sketch distilled everything that’s ludicrous about teenage life into six minutes of perfection. The Original Absolutely Fabulous sketch “Come down and share a joint with us later!”: French was Saffy to Saunders’s too-cool-for-school mum in this early sketch, laying the foundations for the Ab Fab phenomenon that would later emerge. The Shopping Channel The F&amp;S Channel saw the pair dressed in boxy pastels attempting to hawk emerald-ique, antique-ique, and chunky earrings with a semi-solid matching quality necklace, and may be responsible for a generation’s casual use of the word “diamonique”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/16/joseph-stiglitz-trump-fascist-globalisation-bernie-sanders","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-16T14:29:04Z","webTitle":"Joseph Stiglitz: 'Trump has fascist tendencies'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/16/joseph-stiglitz-trump-fascist-globalisation-bernie-sanders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/16/joseph-stiglitz-trump-fascist-globalisation-bernie-sanders","fields":{"headline":"Joseph Stiglitz: 'Trump has fascist tendencies'","bodyText":"Harry Truman once demanded to be given one-handed economists because he became so frustrated with his advisers meeting every demand for answers with “on the one hand, on the other hand”. Truman would have liked Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist who worked for a later Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and who does not mince words when talking about the current incumbent of the White House, Donald Trump. Stiglitz, in London to publicise his new book, says that for the past six or seven years he has been growing increasingly disturbed by America’s growing inequality and the simmering anger it has caused. “I began to say ‘if we didn’t fix this problem we are going to have a political problem’ and historically a Trump figure, a fascist kind of figure arises.” Asked whether he really thinks Trump is a fascist, Stiglitz says: “I certainly think he has those tendencies. He is restrained by our institutions and every day those institutions work we feel relieved. We don’t know what the bounds are and we don’t know how far he would push those bounds. “A couple of things are most disturbing – the attack on the press and the attack on the foundations of knowledge which goes beyond the press. “We have never had a president who day after day lies and is unaffected by it. Normally everybody you deal with is tethered by a sense of responsibility and truth, but not him. “I think the other thing you have seen with some of these fascist leaders is using ‘us versus them’ as a way of dividing society.” Stiglitz says Trump is using racism and misogyny to divide America. “To me it is deeply, deeply disturbing.” Stiglitz had his differences with Clinton, for whom he worked as chairman of the council of economic advisers, and Barack Obama, criticising both for not doing enough to ensure that the fruits of growth were more evenly shared. But he sees Trump as not just misguided but positively dangerous – a man who has difficulty telling the truth, whose word is not to be trusted and who might even respond to being thwarted in his plans by pushing the nuclear button. He gives as an example the president’s determination to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which created a free trade zone between the US, Canada and Mexico a quarter of a century ago. Trump thinks the agreement has been bad for America but is running into strong opposition from big business, which has outsourced production to exploit cheaper labour costs south of the Rio Grande. “What I worry about is that when Trump is confronted with the reality that he can’t do on Nafta what he wants to do he will strike out like a little kid and do something dangerous - like putting his finger on a button he shouldn’t be putting his finger on.” Would Trump really put his finger on the nuclear button because he was thwarted over Nafta? “We don’t know. There is a discussion in Congress to restrain his ability to put his finger on that button.” Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race has encouraged Stiglitz to update and expand his 2002 book, Globalisation and its Discontents. The original book, written in the wake of the violent protests on the streets of Seattle, Prague, Washington DC and Genoa, assumed that globalisation’s discontents were in poor countries. The new book charts how the unhappiness has spread from the developing to developed world and led to Trump, Brexit and growing support for extreme parties in continental Europe. Stiglitz attributes Trump’s election to globalisation, rising inequality and the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis. “This is a global phenomenon. Part of it is growing inequality and the way people have come to understand that inequality. They see the world doing better and they see that they are not getting better off. They don’t want to say it’s because of what I’ve done, it’s because of what’s happened to me. Something that Trump said captured what a lot of people think: the system is rigged. “Part of this is a legitimate anger relating to the crisis of 2008 and how we handled it. We saved the banks, we saved the bankers and we saved the shareholders; we didn’t do much for homeowners and the workers who were losing their jobs.” Stiglitz says he told Obama before he became president that the focus should be on helping ordinary Americans. “But the dominant influence were the bankers in Wall Street.” The rules of the American economy were rewritten in the 1980s in ways that weakened labour and watered down anti-trust and other competition laws, Stiglitz says. He believes discontent would have surfaced even without the 2008 crisis. “But I think it worsened it, crystalised it.” He added: “The crisis of 2008 made things much much worse. Millions of Americans lost their homes and the way things were managed was grossly unfair.” The reason neither developed nor developing countries are happy with globalisation, Stiglitz says, is that trade agreements were written by and for corporations and against ordinary workers in both places. Stiglitz was born in Gary, Indiana, in 1943. Then a booming steel town, Gary has become one of the places in the midwest that has come to symbolise America’s rust belt decay. Stiglitz says he understands the anger that turned Indiana into Trumpland because for the poorest Americans wages adjusted for inflation had not increased for six decades. The US economy has been growing at a reasonable pace in the year since the presidential election, with unemployment falling, consumer confidence strong and the stock market rising. So does Stiglitz thinks Trump’s economic strategy will work? “There is no way ... that it will raise living standards. The reality is that the standard of living will go down if he succeeds in doing any significant part of what he is proposing. “He is proposing deglobalisation, breaking up the efficient supply chains that have been created and raising costs. If manufacturing jobs do come back to the US they will be done by robots in hi-tech parts of the country rather than the rust belt states.” The updated Globalisation and its Discontents sketches out three possible ways forward: doubling down on the current model of globalisation, the new protectionism, or a fairer globalisation. More of the status quo is not politically feasible, he says, and wouldn’t work anyway, while Trump is the manifestation of the new protectionism. “It means going back into yourself, ignoring all the advantages of trade such as specialisation. It’s dishonest populism. We have to make globalisation work, stop more than 100% of the gains going to the people at the top.” But is fairer globalisation any more politically feasible given the likely push back from the 1%. “There is going to be resistance. But we are democracies. “I don’t think we can have democracies that work where most of the people are not benefiting economically, where most of the people are worried about their job security. Society can’t function without shared prosperity.” Stiglitz says Bernie Sanders would have beaten Trump. “I see the election of 2016 as an election of protest. Bernie represented a return to the old values: a middle-class lifestyle, a home, a secure retirement, education for your children, healthcare. Jeremy Corbyn is saying the same thing in the UK.” Instead America is led by a man Stiglitz says should not be in the White House. “He is not fit to be president. He does not have an understanding of the issues, the political process. He is used to making one-time deals. You can cheat your contractors when you buy a real estate property and fix it up. Reputation doesn’t matter. For the president of the United States reputation does matter. The reputation of the United States does matter. We are dealing with countries all over the world. They want to know if your word is good. Trump’s word is not good.” •Globalisation and Its Discontents Revisited: Anti-Globalisation in the Era of Trump and The Euro: And its Threat to the Future of Europe by Joseph E Stiglitz are both published by Penguin on 28 November •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/nov/24/best-hair-oils-for-men","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-24T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"Tried and tested: the best hair oils for men","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/24/best-hair-oils-for-men","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/nov/24/best-hair-oils-for-men","fields":{"headline":"Tried and tested: the best hair oils for men","bodyText":"My hair has a natural curl that can be a pain to control. When I started modelling, my hair was dried and changed several times a week, which made it worse. A few years ago, I was introduced to hair oils, and they changed my life; no more wearing a cap post-shower to keep the volume under control. However, I have yet to find an oil that strikes the right balance between nourishment and greasiness. When I first read the instructions on Kiehl’s Magic Elixir (£29 for 125ml) I was dubious: you’re supposed to leave it in for 10 minutes before rinsing out. After day four, I really noticed a reduction in frizz and my hair was softer. Even after days of not shampooing, I still use the elixir, and my hair and scalp feels cleaner. Schwarzkopf Got2b Oil-licious Tame &amp; Shine Styling Oil (£4.19 for 50ml) was pretty heavy and gave my hair a glossy sheen. It did calm the frizz, but whenever I touched my hair I could feel it on my fingers. It was good value, however, and its size makes it great for travelling. Macadamia Healing Oil Treatment (28.99 for 125ml,) went through my hair evenly and made it feel light. I could style the curls, and my hands didn’t get that weird oily feeling. The Ordinary Marula Oil (£8.10 for 30ml) is incredibly light, and absorbed into my skin and hair immediately. My hair looked shinier, but it didn’t tame my wild frizz. I thought it would be a vitamin smörgåsbord for my hair: it didn’t quite deliver. • Next week: All Ages model Leah Alexxanderr-Caine tests toners. This article contains affiliate links to products.

But director Alain Gomis softens the streetwise grit of this portrait of a self-sufficient single mother, bar singer Félicité (Véro Tshanda Beya Mputu), who must raise money for her gravely injured teenage son. The life force of the city, as Gomis tells it, is music: the bumpy, trancelike drive of Congotronic dance; the plaintive refrain of an orchestra that rehearses in a strip-lit shed. Music is ubiquitous, accompanying Félicité’s desperate cross-town dash. It also provides the film’s most powerful moment – a woozy, boozed-up opening sequence in which Félicité gradually weaves her magic over a rowdy crowd. It’s overlong, certainly, and the story loses power when it shifts from the quest for cash to a cautious relationship between Félicité and her singularly unimpressive suitor, Tabu.

He apologized a few days later. He later drew more criticism for wearing a Confederate flag patch. Carman posted the meme on Facebook on 21 January, the day of the anti-Trump march that drew an estimated 500,000 people to Washington, with the caption: “Just asking?” Challenged by Democrats, he said: “I fully support women’s rights and issues.

The elections a year after Trump’s victory brought a substantial number of firsts and near-firsts for racial and religious minorities, for the LGBT community and for far-left progressives. Democrat Wilmot Collins became the first black mayor in the history of Montana, which has an African American population of less than 1%. He won his race for the mayorship of Helena, the state capital, running on the “progressive ticket” with two other candidates who also won. Democrats Elizabeth Guzman and Hala Ayala became the first two Latina state representatives in the history of Virginia. Both won their races against Republican incumbents. Democrat Vi Lyles became the first black female mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. She ran on a progressive platform aimed at promoting social and economic justice and increasing the city’s minimum wage. Lee Carter, a Democratic Socialist, won his election for the Virginia house of delegates in the northern part of the state. Carter was seen as a long shot even by Democrats in the state who reportedly offered Carter minimal support. Andrea Jenkins, running for city council in Minneapolis, Minnesota, became the first black transgender woman in the nation to be elected to a major city council. In Virginia, Democrat Danica Roem became the first openly transgender person to ever be elected to a US state legislature, and the first who was “out” at the time of their election. Roem defeated Republican Bob Marshall, the architect of several pieces of anti-trans legislation during his time in the statehouse. Democrat Justin Fairfax became the second African American elected to statewide office in Virginia, elected on the same ticket as Ralph Northam who won the Virginia governor’s race. Democrat Ravi Bhalla became the first Sikh mayor in New Jersey, winning the election for that office in the city of Hoboken. Vin Gopal also became the first Indian American state senator in New Jersey. Democrat Jenny Durkan was elected mayor of Seattle, making her the city’s first out lesbian mayor, and its first female mayor in nearly a century. Larry Krasner, a progressive district attorney candidate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, won his race on a platform of abolishing money bail and increased accountability for police violence. He was endorsed by the local Black Lives Matter chapter and is arguably the most striking example of a wave of progressive DAs sweeping into office. What’s your reaction to Tuesday’s elections?

The data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) also shows that the country’s annual rate of property price inflation has increased to almost 13%. The findings will be seen by some as fresh evidence that the Celtic Tiger is roaring again. The figures indicate a dramatic recovery in the country’s housing market following the banking crisis and property price crash of a decade ago. As recently as January 2013, residential prices in Dublin were 56% down on the highs they hit in early 2007. According to the CSO, the residential property price index has climbed to its highest level since April 2009. In the year to September, property prices at a national level increased by 12.8%. This compares with a rise of 11.8% in the year to August and is the highest annual figure since May 2015. The annual rate of price growth in Dublin was 12.4% for houses and 11.4% for flats. The west region saw the biggest annual increase at 16.5%. The CSO said prices nationally had increased by 70% since the post-banking crisis low point of early 2013. “In the same period, Dublin residential property prices have increased 87%, while residential property prices in the rest of Ireland are 61.4% higher,” it added. During the period in question, the median price paid for a home was €219,999 [£194,500], though the figure for Dublin was considerably higher, at €340,000, and in one part of the Dublin region – Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown – the median price paid was €510,000."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/shortcuts/2017/nov/08/dont-know-your-spleen-from-your-adrenals-take-our-vital-organs-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T17:25:31Z","webTitle":"Don't know your spleen from your adrenals?

Test yourself","bodyText":"When it comes to the human body, it’s not merely our posteriors that most of us have trouble distinguishing from our elbows. In a recent survey, fewer than 15% of participants could pinpoint their adrenal glands. The spleen was correctly located by 20% of participants and the gallbladder by 25%. Four in 10 were unable to pinpoint the heart on a blank template of the human body. Of the 20 anatomical structures shown to them by researchers at the Lancaster Medical School (LMS), only the brain was correctly identified by all those who took part. Nine out of 10 were able to locate the cornea and biceps. Older people scored higher on average than the young, with those in the 40-49 age range doing best. Graduates fared no better than non-graduates (hopefully, this does not apply to those with medical degrees). Assuming our doctors can navigate their ways around our bodies better than we can, does this widespread lack of anatomical self-knowledge matter? Emphatically yes, says Dr Adam Taylor, of the LMS, lead author of the research published this week in the journal Anatomical Sciences Education. For one thing, knowing where our bits and pieces are helps us to monitor and understand our own health, and make better decisions about when to access healthcare services. In extreme cases, it can save our lives. “We found that only 50% of people knew where the appendix was,” says Taylor. “If you have pain in your abdomen, it could be appendicitis, and if it is, you need to have that looked at as soon as possible because if it ruptures that could be a life-or-death event.” Doctors may use anatomical terms during consultations, and a failure by patients to understand these can undermine both diagnosis and effective treatment. A lack of anatomical knowledge can also reduce the effectiveness of public health campaigns. A survey carried out by Prostate Cancer UK found that half of men did not know where the prostate was. Some 17% did not know they had a prostate, and only 8% knew what it did. With more than 46,000 cases of prostate cancer and almost 11,300 deaths in 2014 in the UK, it’s important for men to know the basics. Taylor says that teaching schoolchildren a little more basic anatomical knowledge would pay significant dividends. This is especially relevant as the weather turns cold. NHS hospital managers are bracing themselves for increased patient numbers and lengthening queues. If people were better informed about where symptoms are in their bodies, they might be better able to decide whether to visit A&amp;E or a GP. “Improved knowledge would have a societal benefit in relieving the burden on stretched NHS services, freeing them up for those who really do need immediate care,” adds Dr Taylor.

Heralded as the Oscars of the fashion industry thanks to its starry guest list, the event takes place on the first Monday of May and acts as the opening party of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s annual exhibition of the same title. The theme is already expected to ignite controversy when attendees arrive on the steps of the institution dressed in their – or their chosen designer’s – interpretation of a major world religion. Works by Cristóbal Balenciaga, Elsa Schiaparelli, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, John Galliano, Valentino and Versace are confirmed to be included in the 150-piece exhibition, which will be open from 10 May to 8 October 2018. The curator, Andrew Bolton, has been working for the past two years to ensure the subject is approached with authenticity and is said to have worked closely with the Vatican, although has had no contact with the pope regarding the show. “The focus is on a shared hypothesis about what we call the Catholic imagination and the way it has engaged artists and designers and shaped their approach to creativity, as opposed to any kind of theology or sociology,” Bolton told the New York Times. “Beauty has often been a bridge between believers and unbelievers.” Attendees to the opening red-carpet event, who are likely to include regulars such as supermodel Gisele Bündchen, Madonna and the British Vogue editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, will have myriad options to choose from recent collections including ensembles from fashion enfant terrible Jean-Paul Gaultier, who favoured church iconography in his couture collections, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, a brand famous for including biblical references in its catwalk extravaganzas. The exhibition will be split over three venues: the Anna Wintour Costume Center and the medieval galleries at the Met in Fifth Avenue, and at the Met Cloisters in upper Manhattan. American Vogue editor and museum trustee Anna Wintour will be joined by Rihanna, designer Donatella Versace and human-rights lawyer Amal Clooney, as co-chairs of the event. “We have confidence that the exhibition will inspire understanding, creativity and, along the way, constructive dialogue, which is precisely a museum’s role in our civil society,” said the Met’s president and chief executive Daniel H Weiss. Previous themes have included AngloMania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion; Punk: Chaos to Couture; Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology; and China: Through the Looking Glass, which proved controversial when claims of cultural appropriation dominated the critique. “It’s important to have ideas that are a reflection of contemporary interests,” Bolton said today, “that strike a chord or are synergistic with the collective consciousness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/09/defiant-hong-kong-football-fans-boo-china-national-anthem","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T14:55:49Z","webTitle":"Defiant Hong Kong football fans boo China's national anthem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/09/defiant-hong-kong-football-fans-boo-china-national-anthem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/09/defiant-hong-kong-football-fans-boo-china-national-anthem","fields":{"headline":"Defiant Hong Kong football fans boo China's national anthem","bodyText":"Hong Kong football fans loudly booed and jeered China’s national anthem at a match on Thursday, defying Beijing days after Communist leaders tightened penalties for disrespecting the song. Ahead of the start of an international friendly against Bahrain, which the home team lost 2-0, a wall of screams overtook the instrumental music broadcast over loudspeakers and the fans ended with a cry of “We are Hong Kong”. Hong Kong football supporters have been protesting the anthem for more than two years since the 2014 Umbrella Movement, a series of pro-democracy street protests that failed to secure concessions on electoral reform from the Beijing government. But the latest act of defiance comes less than a week after China forced Hong Kong to criminalise disrespecting the national song, March of the Volunteers. Local legislation still needs to be adopted, but fans aredetermined to protest what they see as the creeping influence of China in the semi-autonomous city. “They want to criminalise having an opinion; this is not correct for a free society,” said a spectator who would only give his surname, Chan. “Of course I am scared, the government is very powerful and I’m just an ordinary citizen,” he added. The planned legislation already appears to be creating an atmosphere of fear. Some fans screamed at the media not to film the incident, claiming the footage could lead to arrests, with one supporter throwing a bowl of rice at a Guardian journalist who was recording the protest on his phone. The debate over respect for the national anthem is the latest sign of frustration in Hong Kong at an increasingly assertive China and shrinking freedoms in the former British colony. Although Britain handed over control to China in 1997, Hong Kong continues to compete separately from China in international sporting events. China’s rubber-stamp parliament formally extended a law banning disrespect for the national anthem to Hong Kong on Saturday. The law came into effect in China in October and carries a maximum penalty of three years in jail. “It contradicts Hong Kong’s conventional sense of freedom of expression,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy MP who will ultimately vote on a local version of the law. “It’s designed to scare Hong Kongers into obedience. The government is very good at using judicial means to intimidate activists these days.” Penalties for disrespecting the anthem should start with a warning and carry a maximum sentence of no more than three months in jail, Mo said. The wording of the law has drawn scrutiny from legal experts in the city, which maintains its own common law system and courts. The song is commonly played nightly on television and radio stations before news broadcasts, leading commentators to say it is unrealistic to require everyone to stand each time the song is heard. Although Hong Kong is largely administered separately from the rest of China, Beijing does have the power to compel the territory to pass certain laws by amending the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. After 1997, God Save the Queen was replaced by March of the Volunteers as Hong Kong’s national anthem. The song, written in the early 1930s, was originally used in a leftist film and became an anti-Japanese rallying cry in China during the second world war. Fifa has previously fined the Hong Kong Football Association for fans’ protests against the anthem, but the financial penalties have had little effect, while the regional governing body has also issued repeated warnings. The head of the local association, Wilson Wong, suggested fans may have to register their names when buying tickets in the future, and repeat offenders would be banned from games. He also said stadium officials may confiscate any protest banners. Name registration would also aid police once Hong Kong passes a law criminalising the behaviour. But supporters of the move to criminalise ridicule of the anthem contend most people in Hong Kong should have little to fear. “The purpose of the law is to remind people to respect our country and our national anthem. It’s very simple, it’s not directed at limiting freedom of speech,” said Holden Chow, a pro-establishment politician who is part of the coalition that will likely decide on the final version of the law. “There must be behaviour and an intention to commit a crime, so people will not be arrested for accidentally doing something that disrespects the anthem.” He described the football protests as “very rude”. Chow pointed to an existing law that criminalises the desecration of the Chinese flag as a template for potential punishments. That law carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/09/team-kgf-amateur-track-cyclists-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T13:09:57Z","webTitle":"Meet Team KGF – the amateur cyclists out to make it big by taking on the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/09/team-kgf-amateur-track-cyclists-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/09/team-kgf-amateur-track-cyclists-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"Meet Team KGF – the amateur cyclists out to make it big by taking on the world","bodyText":"To outsiders, the Great Britain team resembles a closed shop: riders are either in or out, and most come through the performance path, starting at 16. Those who miss out have limited chances to demonstrate their potential, which is why this autumn’s experiment by Team KGF has raised eyebrows. Charlie Tanfield, Jacob Tipper, Dan Bigham and Jonathan Wale, who are the national team pursuit champions, will start in Manchester on Friday after finishing seventh in the opening World Cup round in Poland. The World Cup is not limited to national teams – all KGF had to do was register with the UCI – but the system is most often used by national teams who want to up their presence, as GB will this weekend by fielding academy riders under the Team Breeze and 100% Me marques. “We are a group of lads who all work full time apart from Charlie and he’s a student who’s in trouble for missing lectures,” Tipper said. “The idea is to mix it with the big boys and see how far we can get.” The quartet share a house in Derby, where they train on the velodrome. “They’ve given us a lot of track time but at the start we had two sessions a week, in between the regular sessions.” Those full-time jobs do relate to team pursuiting: Tipper is a coach, Bigham – also the national individual pursuit and kilometre champion – runs an aerodynamics business that also employs Wale. The quartet had little time to find sponsors within the deadline, having decided to race together internationally after the national championships in February. Consequently, their main backer is “the credit card”; KGF is a charitable foundation. That seventh place in Poland was a performance that belied their budget and lack of marquee names, while demonstrating the limitations presented by a lineup who, they are happy to admit, are far from balanced. It was enough to get them past Belgium, Belarus, Spain and Ukraine in qualifying, where their three kilometre time promised a sub-four minute ride that would have put them in the medal ride-off. “We are inexperienced, so we don’t have a call for ‘I’ve been dropped, you have to wait for me’,” Tipper said. “I’ve never been world class but we are doing world-class times; I mistimed a change late on in the second round and those guys are going so fast there was no way back.” Wale, a kilometre specialist, had already done his stint, meaning that while Bigham and Tanfield finished together in a world-class time, the result depended on the third rider. While Tipper admits he is mainly trying to hang on to his three team-mates, the quartet have their ambitions: “Manchester will be hard but I don’t see why we shouldn’t find what we need by the [final World Cup] round in Belarus. Those three are fast enough, we just need one guy to find 20 or 30 watts improvement.” Bigham and Tanfield want to break into the national team and to help Great Britain qualify a second slot in the individual pursuit for next year’s world championships. Wale has ambitions to ride for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games. “GB were really helpful in Poland, they’ve been very supportive, but we are still gluing on our own tyres and booking our own flights. It’s the only way to step on to the system.” As for Great Britain, they remain in transition following the departure of the technical director Shane Sutton in April 2016. The Australian – who is interviewed in a BBC documentary on recent events at British Cycling to be shown next weekend – has been in the velodrome this week in his new guise as an adviser to the Chinese. Meanwhile, the performance director, Stephen Park, has yet to make an impression, having started work only in April, the month GB put in a low-key performance at the world championships in Hong Kong, with only two gold medals – Katie Archibald in the women’s omnium and Elinor Barker in the points race. Since Rio, the track team have been largely marked by departures, culminating in recent weeks in the removal of the endurance head coach Heiko Salzwedel, which was unexpected – at least on Salzwedel’s side – but has yet to be confirmed by British Cycling, who have said he remains on the payroll. The retirements of Joanna Rowsell-Shand, Becky James and Sir Bradley Wiggins, plus the absence of Laura and Jason Kenny, whose son Albert was born in August, means the team have looked short of senior figures and so the return of the triple team pursuit gold medallist Ed Clancy from his post-Rio break acquires greater weight. Those absences, plus changes to the omnium format and the arrival of men and women’s Madison on the Olympic schedule, imply that almost every place on the GB squad could be up for grabs between here and Tokyo in 2020, which in turn is reflected by the presence of more than 30 British entrants here, including GB academy squads from Team Breeze and 100% Me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/09/police-officers-sacked-at-risk-teenager-avon-somerset-vulnerable-boy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T14:03:13Z","webTitle":"Police officers sacked for saying at-risk teenager 'should be raped'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/09/police-officers-sacked-at-risk-teenager-avon-somerset-vulnerable-boy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/09/police-officers-sacked-at-risk-teenager-avon-somerset-vulnerable-boy","fields":{"headline":"Police officers sacked for saying at-risk teenager 'should be raped'","bodyText":"Two police officers have been dismissed from the Avon and Somerset force after they said they hoped that a vulnerable teenager “got raped”. PCs Samuel Dexter, 36, and Hannah Mayo, 32, made the comments in a conversation that they did not realise was being recorded on the 14-year-old’s mother’s answering machine. Both admitted to gross misconduct in relation to the incident, which took place in September. After a misconduct hearing at the force headquarters, in Portishead, near Bristol, on Tuesday, Andy Marsh, the chief constable, sacked them without notice, saying that the public would be “outraged” by their comments. The officers had driven over to the family’s house after receiving a phone call from the 14-year-old’s mother. It was Dexter’s second time at the house that evening after the boy’s mother had earlier reported him missing. On that occasion, Dexter had driven round looking for the boy, who had ADHD and was a cannabis user, and eventually returned him home safely. When he was called back to the house later, accompanied by Mayo, Dexter tried to phone the boy’s mother on the way over but obtained no answer. He then vented his frustration to his fellow officer. “I have no interest whatsoever,” he said. “He [the boy] seemed to be relishing in the fact that I had been driving around aimlessly looking for him. “I felt like saying to him, ‘Whatever, you little shit, I don’t give a fuck. I hope you get raped.’” Mayo responded: “Yes, and butt raped.” The officers were heard laughing on the two-minute recording, which ended as they pulled up outside the boy’s house. Unbeknown to the officers, the conversation had been recorded on the mother’s answering machine. Dexter told the hearing he heard a beep in his ear as he pulled up and told his colleague he thought their conversation may have been recorded but neither officer mentioned this when they entered the house. Mark Loker and Peter Land of the Police Federation, representing Dexter and Mayo respectively, said the constables were both exemplary officers and that the comments were highly out of character. Dexter, who has five children and is a private foster carer for overseas year-abroad students, said: “I still to this day can’t believe it was me who said those things. “I am absolutely mortified. It’s not who I am. I am deeply sorry for the comments I made – I never intended the upset caused to the family. “I can only put it down to the stress and frustration of the incident – although that is not a validation, and I should never have expressed them in that way.” Mayo said: “I have thought about this incident every day since. I’m so disappointed in myself. “It makes you question yourself – you’re supposed to be in a position of trust, and to do something so stupid that’s had such an impact on the family is a horrible thing.” Loker described their comments as “dark humour” in the face of stress and “a coping mechanism in very poor taste”. He added: “There was no intent, no malice. These officers are good cops, but they are good cops who have made a very grave error in judgment.” However, Marsh gave the verdict that the comments of the officers went “way beyond the boundaries” of dark humour. “These comments were about a vulnerable child who was displaying acute risk factors,” he said. “The public will be outraged that such comments were made by police officers. My conclusion is that PC Dexter and PC Mayo should be dismissed without notice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/nov/09/taylor-swift-reputation-can-new-album-save-her-name","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T17:56:20Z","webTitle":"Taylor Swift’s reputation: will her new album silence her critics?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/09/taylor-swift-reputation-can-new-album-save-her-name","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/nov/09/taylor-swift-reputation-can-new-album-save-her-name","fields":{"headline":"Taylor Swift’s reputation: will her new album silence her critics?","bodyText":"In August, Taylor Swift released Look What You Made Me Do, the first single from her new album, Reputation, which finally emerges from its shroud of secrecy tomorrow. The track and its subsequent video broke three records within a week, including first-day streaming figures on Spotify and YouTube respectively. Swift’s sixth album has already thrashed pre-sale records, selling more than 400,000 copies – partially due to an industry standard reward system that gives early purchasers exclusive priority access to concert tickets. These achievements are fairly typical business for Swift, who often finds herself breaking records that were set with her previous release. She has sold more than 33m albums worldwide, thanks to her reluctance to join Spotify until this summer, keeping her sales robust while most artists have experienced a decline. She and Adele are the only two female artists to win the Grammy for album of the year twice. And her music isn’t the sole draw. Her every heartbeat – her records, relationships and social media activity – is chronicled, inflated, and attributed with a significance far greater than Swift herself. Given her status and power as one of the world’s biggest pop stars, the vengeful tone of Look What You Made Me Do seemed a little surprising. Swift had stripped away her supernatural gift for melody, replacing it with a sound as hostile as the song’s message. The opulent video referred to her feuds with Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Katy Perry, the media and, basically, anyone who has ever criticised her. And she wasn’t just going after her peers. Not long after the single’s release, the blog PopFront – which then had 76 Twitter followers and 1,000 Facebook likes – claimed that the song’s antagonistic lyrics “reinforced white anger and white supremacy”. The author suggested Swift should distance herself from her fervent alt-right fanbase, who have interpreted her blond athleticism as an affirmation of Aryan values. PopFront’s claims were ridiculous – the latest example of the bad faith that dogs Swift – but the chances of anyone reading them were minimal. That is, until Swift’s lawyers threatened to sue PopFront if it didn’t remove them, and the American Civil Liberties Union stepped in to remind Swift about the First Amendment. “Criticism is never pleasant, but a celebrity has to shake it off, even if the critique may damage her reputation,” it wrote in a letter made public on Tuesday. That Swift would use her muscle to intimidate a blogger, rather than denounce the alt-right, was just the latest example of the famously controlling musician losing grip of the narrative she has worked to maintain throughout her 11-year career. “I’m intimidated by the fear of being average,” she once told the Recording Academy. Swift’s chosen narrative is, understandably, that she became the world’s biggest pop star because she is talented and hardworking. This is true. She was writing her own songs when she was 11. At 14, she convinced her parents to move from Pennsylvania to Nashville for her career. She knew record execs were wrong when they told her that teenage girls didn’t like country, because she was a teenage girl who was obsessed with country. Her self-titled 2006 debut, released when she was 16, showcased her knack for melody and peaked at No 5 in the US. Her pure yet prematurely wise depictions of teenage love impressed critics, as did the potent vindictive streak (“I’m just sitting here planning my revenge,” went one early lyric) that distinguished her from Disney’s juvenile cohort. Her 2008 follow-up, Fearless, became the most garlanded country album in history. The 2009 MTV Video Music award for best female video wasn’t the glitziest trophy it won, but by far the most career-defining. As Swift accepted her award, Kanye West arrived suddenly on stage to tell the world that Beyoncé’s Single Ladies was the worthy victor. He later explained he had nothing against Swift, but wanted to take a stand against industry racism. Suddenly, Swift’s narrative splintered. What if talent, hard work and her emphasis on moral goodness weren’t the sole reasons for her success? What if her white privilege – which she had unwittingly exploited in her music’s dynamic of innocence and victimhood – gave her an advantage? Every pop icon represents a shift in the cultural paradigm. Michael Jackson’s commercial peak marked the moment MTV allowed a black star to transcend segregated US radio formats. Britney Spears’s PG transgressions reflected the relaxing of moral codes in the Clinton era. Swift emerged a decade after the internet first reached a mass audience, and tapped into the solipsism of the medium, turning the teenage trivia of MySpace bulletins into timeless love songs. Born in 1989, she is a first-generation digital native. By 2009, social media was getting serious, the newly popular Twitter a crucible of debate on privilege – racial, social, financial – and the “right” way to be a feminist. West and Swift’s moment at the VMAs was kindling for the furnace. “From that moment, she has been a vector, and they together have been a vector, for this very incendiary ongoing conversation about racism in America, but also sexism,” says NPR’s chief music critic Ann Powers. “It’s one of those pop-cultural incidents that contains everything. A man harassing a woman. A white woman responding to an African American man as if he had victimised her. One celebrity shouting at another. And in the background is Beyoncé, an African American woman who is universally embraced as the standard-bearer for both popular music, and doing politics and pop. We start there, and it never really changes after that.” The VMAs moment turned Swift into a lightning rod for debates around feminism, race and politics. It also taught her how to turn controversy to her favour, playing aggressor, victim and leader as it suited her best. She learned how to play the gossip cycle with 2010’s album Speak Now, dropping hints about the ex-boyfriends and nemeses it concerned. On 2012’s Red, she stepped into pop, which allowed her to express her sexuality, flex her songwriting craft and, naturally, sell bucketloads: more than 6m copies worldwide. It was hard to remember an imperial period like it. Swift hadn’t just moved from country to the mainstream, but had credibility, too. Critics made sincere comparisons to Randy Newman and Joni Mitchell for her ability to capture the exhilaration and disappointments of a relationship within a couple of lines: “So you call me up again, just to break me like a promise,” she sang on Red’s All Too Well, “so casually cruel in the name of being honest,” a lyric as perceptive and nuanced as it is satisfying to yell in a packed arena. She realised early on that writing specifically about her life was more likely to make her relatable to fans than writing in platitudes. Her catalogue includes repeated motifs and references, as she established herself as a songwriter whose records played like perfectly turned screenplays, building distinctive worlds. As far back as Fearless, on which the 18-year-old Swift wrote seven songs without co-writers, Rolling Stone picked up on her “intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture that … calls to mind Swedish pop gods Dr Luke and Max Martin”, four years before she would actually collaborate with the latter on Red. Although their collaboration pulled away from country, adding dubstep and bratty cheerleader chants to the mix, it demonstrated the robustness of her songwriting, still recognisably Swiftian – perky, layered, irresistible – among the womps and shout-alongs. If the success of Red came with any downsides, it’s that Swift’s references to exes Jake Gyllenhaal and Conor Kennedy (signposted via clues in the liner notes) gave her a reputation for being boy-crazy. Whether this perception was her doing or that of the press, she capitalised on it with 2014’s 1989, which marked another reinvention. The first, most effective element was Swift’s embrace of synth pop, though a kind that less resembled the hip-hop-influenced Billboard charts than “the late 80s MTV pop-rock exemplified by Jane Wiedlin’s Rush Hour,” as Alexis Petridis wrote in this paper. At serious culture site Grantland, writer Molly Lambert compared the record to Bruce Springsteen’s 1987 album Tunnel of Love, in which he shifted from guitars to synthesisers as he processed his divorce. The second aspect of Swift’s transformation was her feminist awakening. In 2012, she had rejected the label, telling the Daily Beast: “I don’t really think about things as guys versus girls.” But now, she understood that the movement was a push for equality. It helped her realise that when her music was seen through the lens of her love life this was sexist, and limiting. Her friendship with Lena Dunham made her recognise, as she told the Guardian, “I’ve been taking a feminist stance without actually saying so.” But Swift’s actual remarks about feminism remained limited. Her “squad” – a group of models and singers who joined her for sleepovers and on stage – became a byword for showy exclusivity. When Swift martialled her troops in the video for Bad Blood, a diss track about Katy Perry supposedly “stealing” her dancers, it highlighted the darker side of this allegiance. Swift’s burning need for personal justice started to become clear. She blundered when she interpreted Nicki Minaj’s comments on the certainty of thin, white women triumphing at the 2015 MTV VMAs as an attack. Minaj set Swift straight, but implored her to “speak on this” – the racial dynamics Kanye West had attempted to highlight. She didn’t. Swift’s predominantly white squad, and employment of black dancers’ bodies in the video for Shake It Off, had been noted, as had her silence on Black Lives Matter. The picture didn’t improve in 2016. Kanye West released the song Famous, including the lyric, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous,” and an argument ensued, between Swift and West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, about whether Swift had consented to the use of the lyric. Then there was a relationship with Tom Hiddleston, which played out in absurd scenes in public: smoochy beach photo ops, plus Hiddleston wearing an “I [HEART] TS” vest at her 4th July party. She ignored calls to endorse Hillary Clinton for president, and to denounce Donald Trump, her silence making her unwittingly synonymous, in many minds, with the 53% of white women voters who cast their ballot for Trump. Swift’s personal righteousness – and her bottom line – appeared to outweigh her concerns about social justice. “She’s not someone who likes to be spoken for and she’s built a career off having the last word,” says Tess Purchase, who has edited two scholarly Swift zines. “There are some instances where she has very strong principles and a lot of conviction, but they’re rarely principles that go beyond her specific experience as an insanely wealthy white woman.” Powers links Swift’s circumspection regarding politics to a part of her past that she will never escape: country music’s conflict-aversion. But Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield finds it misogynist that Swift is criticised for her silence when male artists are seldom asked to give their political views, and Kanye West’s Trump photo-op has been forgotten. “So, when people claim to feel offended by Taylor Swift’s personal or moral failings, it just seems they’re projecting their own neuroses on to her in ways that mostly have to do with gender,” he says. “She’s always sung about young women looking for ways to define themselves without internalising the hatred all around them.” In August, Swift returned to the spotlight when she won a sexual assault case against a DJ who had groped her at a meet-and-greet. Her testimony was razor-sharp. She acknowledged the privilege that enabled her to pursue the case, and promised to support other organisations providing such resources to less fortunate victims. For a moment, she was a feminist hero. But then she released the vindictive Look What You Made Me Do, finally unleashing her long-simmering rage. The imagery surrounding Reputation suggests the record will predominantly concern Swift’s relationship with the media. In its three other advance singles, she has been experimenting with hip-hop cadences, and forcefully expressing her desires. Swift appears to be shredding the image of relatability she worked so hard to establish. Gone are the unified feminine archetypes that underpinned her previous records; in their place, a fractured aesthetic (cyborg, succubus, self-mocking sovereign) that rejects the idea of an authentic persona, and allows Swift to relinquish control over how she is perceived. She has always been perfectly attuned to the cultural moment: mirroring the mainstreaming of feminism, then the fallout from urgent discussions about identity and privilege. There are also convincing arguments that her partial fall from grace reflects the way whiteness is being decentred in pop culture. Swift spent a decade trying to show that she is just like us, desperately concealing her darker impulses. Now she has stopped bothering. Reputation may be ugly and myopic in places – making Swift no less in tune with the times than usual. Reputation is released on Friday on Big Machine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/nov/09/ruben-loftus-cheek-start-england-friendly-germany-wembley","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T22:30:42Z","webTitle":"Loftus-Cheek, Abraham and Pickford given England debuts for Germany game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/09/ruben-loftus-cheek-start-england-friendly-germany-wembley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/nov/09/ruben-loftus-cheek-start-england-friendly-germany-wembley","fields":{"headline":"Loftus-Cheek, Abraham and Pickford given England debuts against Germany","bodyText":"Gareth Southgate’s bold determination to promote youth will mean Tammy Abraham, Jordan Pickford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek making their senior debuts against Germany, and three under-21 forwards are likely to be drafted into the set-up for next week’s friendly with Brazil as the England manager resists the temptation to recall the old guard. Demarai Gray, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Dominic Solanke are set to join a senior squad already denied six of the manager’s original selections by injury after Friday’s European Under-21 Championship qualifier in Ukraine. Southgate prefers to blood them rather than turn to players such as Daniel Sturridge, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jermain Defoe. Danny Drinkwater, with whom the manager spoke this week after England’s midfield options were reduced, declined a call-up, citing a lack of match fitness. The Chelsea midfielder has played only 22 minutes as a substitute in the Premier League since his £35m summer move from Leicester City; he arrived hampered by a calf injury, which he aggravated in a late appearance off the bench in Sunday’s victory over Manchester United. Drinkwater was unable to complete the post-match warm-down on the pitch at Stamford Bridge and has been limited to light training in the period since, meaning he has been injured for, or withdrawn from, all of Southgate’s squads. “He felt he wasn’t ready yet to play at this level,” said the manager. “You’ve got to be able to cover the ground, you’ve got to feel you are in peak physical condition. If Danny didn’t feel he was ready for that, I can understand. He’s not been fit for the last three camps. You can’t do anything about that. “I’d say there are quite a few places in the squad [for the World Cup] still up for grabs. There are players who have played pretty consistently for us and made big contributions, but then there are a group who have supported that. Over the next couple of games some of those guys will get opportunities. Then there are the younger ones coming through who are also going to push that.” Abraham, like Loftus-Cheek a product of Chelsea’s academy, has scored four top-flight goals in 10 Premier League starts on loan at Swansea having impressed last year in the Championship at Bristol City. The 20-year-old has resisted overtures to represent Nigeria and will partner Jamie Vardy after more experienced players were overlooked for Southgate’s squad despite the withdrawals. “For Defoe and Sturridge to come in and impress us in these games, that really is a big jump given the minimal amount of playing time they have had,” said the manager. “It doesn’t mean either of them are ruled out going forward. “They are both top goalscorers. But we’ve got some exciting young strikers playing with the under-21s – Solanke, Calvert-Lewin and Gray – and if we think we need cover we might look to call those players up [for the Brazil match].” Gary Cahill is still struggling with a back injury and will be considered only for Tuesday. So, in the absence of Harry Kane and with Joe Hart on the bench, Eric Dier will captain the side against Germany, with Southgate praising his “maturity and intelligence”. The manager still considers Hart his first-choice goalkeeper but will give Pickford, Everton’s £30m signing from Sunderland, a first cap after Jack Butland broke a finger in training and returned to Stoke. Loftus-Cheek, who boasts 12 Premier League starts of which six have come on loan at Crystal Palace from Chelsea this season, will partner Dier in central midfield. Southgate has been in contact with Manchester United, after suggesting last week that Chris Smalling might not be up to the required standard on the ball, and intends to speak with Jack Wilshere after the international window to outline what the Arsenal midfielder, a fringe player at the Emirates, needs to do to break back into the squad. Wilshere’s game-time has largely been spent as a No10 over recent times, while Southgate’s 3-4-3 and its variants means the midfielder has to feature more often in a deeper role if he is to earn a recall. “I have a lot of respect for him as a player, and when he was with the squad last year I really liked his mentality and personality,” said Southgate. “I don’t think Jack is a No10. I think he is a deeper player but he is not playing deeper. But I want to be clear: I really like Jack Wilshere as a player, I think he is a talent and I really respect him as an individual.” Germany, too, intend to experiment in the game at Wembley, which should attract a near-capacity crowd, as Joachim Löw prepares to defend the World Cup in Russia. The RB Leipzig defender Marcel Halstenberg will gain a first cap but Toni Kroos could be omitted because of a stomach bug. “We want to play well but I want to experiment a bit,” said Löw. “We still have a few games to prepare for the World Cup. It’s a bit of a test phase still, this year. With the tournament in mind, I want to see not only those players who play regularly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/11/remembrance-sunday-brings-taste-of-kingship-for-prince-charles","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"Remembrance Sunday brings taste of kingship for Prince Charles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/11/remembrance-sunday-brings-taste-of-kingship-for-prince-charles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/11/remembrance-sunday-brings-taste-of-kingship-for-prince-charles","fields":{"headline":"Remembrance Sunday brings taste of kingship for Prince Charles","bodyText":"Prince Charles flew back from a tour of Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and India this week to prepare for a significant symbolic moment in his progress towards becoming king. In a rare move, he will take the Queen’s place to lay the head of state’s wreath at the Cenotaph on Sunday in remembrance of Britain’s war dead. Charles, who turns 69 next week, once stood in for the Queen in 1983 when she was in Kenya, but the ceremony will be the first time he has taken the role while the Queen is available. The 91-year-old will look on from the balcony of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office while her heir parades in her place. Palace aides are highly sensitive to any suggestion transition is under way and said the Queen’s withdrawal stemmed from her wish to accompany Prince Philip, who has officially retired but wanted to attend the event as a spectator. However, the watching public will see it as another step in the inevitable transfer of duties to the next generation, amid continued chatter among royal observers about ongoing tensions between Buckingham Palace and Clarence House over the handover of duties. In an unusual move, both palaces responded jointly to deny claims in September that the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt, had left his role because of such tensions. Charles’s wait has been the longest in the history of the British monarchy but finally visible change is under way, and not only in terms of national ceremony. This week he shored up his claims to the leadership of the Commonwealth, the 53-nation postcolonial bloc with a population of 2.3 billion, which the Queen always made a top priority and which is now seen as increasingly important in the UK’s post-Brexit trading future. Charles held talks over dinner with the prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, on Tuesday in Delhi which were expected to include plans for the future of the Commonwealth. The British government is said to be keen on an expanded role for India. In a speech on Tuesday night at thehigh commissioner’s residence, Charles set out his vision for the Commonwealth as defined by “diversity”, arguing the bloc “offers us an unparalleled means to build bridges between our countries, and fairer societies within them”. “India’s role in all of this could not be more crucial, nor her contribution to the Commonwealth more essential,” he said, describing it as “at the heart of the Commonwealth – a country which can teach us how to blend the material with the spiritual dimension in order to create the integrated values of the future”. The monarchy has been quietly campaigning for Charles to succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth when she dies, which is not a given. Observers think this could be cemented within months when Charles is expected to play a prominent role, alongside the Queen, at next April’s Commonwealth heads of government summit, with meetings at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle as well as St James’s Palace. The Queen has chaired every summit since 1973 and only missed the 2013 event in Sri Lanka because she was trying to cut down on long-haul travel, something which is not relevant in London. Charles and the Queen jointly chaired the last summit in Malta, which is only a three-hour flight from London. “There may be some kind of formal agreement in April,” said Philip Murphy, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies. “But the Queen is so fondly regarded in the Commonwealth she probably realises it would be dangerous to hand it over to him at this point.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/17/the-alarming-palsy-of-james-orr-by-tom-lee-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-17T07:30:06Z","webTitle":"The Alarming Palsy of James Orr review – the collapse of normality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/17/the-alarming-palsy-of-james-orr-by-tom-lee-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/17/the-alarming-palsy-of-james-orr-by-tom-lee-review","fields":{"headline":"The Alarming Palsy of James Orr review – the collapse of normality","bodyText":"Reading Eley Williams’s brilliant story collection Attrib., published earlier this year, I encountered a phrase – “unheimlich manoeuvres” – that captures perfectly the most notable element of Tom Lee’s writing. He has a pronounced ability to take normal, even mundane situations and nudge them out of true, propelling his characters into positions of strangeness and danger that they are often fatally slow to identify. He did it in the best stories in his first book, Greenfly, and now he does it at novel length in The Alarming Palsy of James Orr. Lee wastes no time in setting things askew. “When James Orr woke up,” the book begins, “he had the sense that there was something not quite right, some indefinable shift in the normal order of things.” That shift turns out to be physical: James has been struck by Bell’s palsy, the mysterious condition that manifests as a sudden and inexplicable facial paralysis. But this ailment rapidly takes on a psychological dimension, and its level of seriousness swells from inconvenience to existential threat. Signed off for several weeks from his job at a consulting firm, James falls into listlessness. He is unable to complete the household tasks his wife Sarah suggests he get on with, and wanders instead around the woods that surround the New Glades estate, a 1960s development of 48 “identical houses” owned by a private trust. The nearby city (presumably London, although Lee enhances our sense of defamiliarisation by leaving it unnamed) is visible, but feels as though it is “a world away”. New Glades is somewhat Ballardian. James is chair of the residents’ committee, and Lee has darkly comic fun with the authoritarianism such bodies can exhibit; the way the more local a group’s concerns, the more intolerant it tends to become. Outraged by local youths using the peaceful estate as a lovers’ lane, several residents want to install CCTV. James advocates moderation, but there are hints scattered through the book that he hasn’t, perhaps, always been as reasonable as he seems. The committee’s concerns are later recalled when James, to his horror, finds his young daughter playing with a used condom discovered in the undergrowth. James’s palsy affects the way he is treated by his fellow committee members and neighbours. Or does it? The compelling mystery of the novel is the way Lee sustains our uncertainty about whether James’s reality genuinely is getting weirder, or if his own perception is at fault. There is something of Kafka’s The Trial in the way each scene provides a new opportunity for James to misjudge a situation, or have his hopes disappointed, leading to his further alienation. Like Josef K, or Neddy Merrill in John Cheever’s “The Swimmer” – another story about the disintegration of suburban security, and of the self – James’s trajectory is less an arc than a descent. As with those other works, the tight focus Lee brings to bear on his subject increases the tension, and makes it impossible for us as readers to accurately gauge each situation we encounter, or, increasingly, endure alongside James. Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde emerges as another antecedent, particularly as the sense develops that something might be seething beneath James’s proper, buttoned-down exterior. His palsy can be seen as an outward manifestation of this internal schism, giving “the impression of two different faces, two different people, welded savagely together”. At one point his “very large, almost engorged” eye is described as staring “unblinkingly back at him, as if from some slightly other place”. (That “slightly” is an example of the only off note I find in Lee’s writing, a tendency to use moderating words – “so to speak”, “rather”, “quite” – that dilute impact.) But is James some kind of monster? Or is it his monstrous appearance and strangled speech that make people treat him as such? Lee’s novel can be read in a number of ways, including as a metaphor for society’s rejection of otherness, its pushing to the margins of anything it finds unpleasant or difficult to understand. And without ever abandoning realism, it leaves room for the “ancient woodland” surrounding New Glades to take on a symbolic aspect, as a zone of unknowable wildness surrounding the modern, ordered life of the estate. Alternatively, James can be seen as a kind of everyman experiencing how strange and distant life can become to those afflicted with illness. Lee has written two excellent essays about his own periods of being unwell: a bout of pneumonia that saw him in hospital for months, and briefly comatose, and prior to that a serious episode of anxiety. Describing that experience, he writes that his life “seemed, suddenly and profoundly, to have split into two parts”, and it is precisely this stark and terrible divide between wellness and illness that James embodies, both physically – his face torn between normality and deformity – and psychologically. “It was remarkable,” he thinks in a moment of respite, “how normal life could be.” Unfortunately for him, the worst is yet to come. • The Alarming Palsy of James Orr is published by Granta.

I recommend it; I don’t just mean the film, I mean the whole experience of telling someone who loves you how much you enjoyed something years ago, then having it turn up unexpectedly from Amazon. It’s the adult equivalent of Santa coming good. Apart from anything else, it saves you having to remember your Amazon password. And the film? As I told the people I invited round to watch it, not one of whom had even heard of it, the film has not aged anything like as badly as we had. I suspect I ruined the film for them by interspersing the screening with personal recollections, telling them when the best scenes were coming – now, in a minute, no, soon, here, now, shush! – laughing in an offensively proprietorial manner, imparting snippets of information about Forman (his first film in America, One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, came next) and pointing out an unrecognisable Kathy Bates in her first movie role, singing a wistful song about horses having wings. I won’t apologise for behaving as though I’d made the film myself. It’s natural to feel that a work of art you particularly love is yours, especially when enthusing about it to novices. I once showed the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to a person who had never seen it and came close to describing what a back-breaking job it had been. And Taking Off affects me more closely than Michelangelo’s Creation, because it brings me back to where I was in 1972, who I saw it with and how new the world felt then. Talk about Adam waking up at the end of God’s finger! 1972 was when the 1960s went into orbit. That’s its subject. The cultural explosion that was perplexing the young even as it energised them, intriguing the old even as it scared them half to death. Taking Off because that was how it seemed: lift off. The young running away from home, going missing, losing their footing, even the old, with sad irony, clumsily casting off their inhibitions. I was entirely sympathetic to the older generation’s anger and confusion when I first saw the film. This time, I was touched by the sweet cruelty of being young. It’s a good film that waits for you to grow up emotionally. Get someone you love to buy it for you. I recommend the most excruciating striptease ever, oh, and the scene in which New York’s wealthy middle-aged are taught the joys of smoking dope. I’m only sorry I can’t be there to explain its subtleties to you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2017/nov/11/online-mortgage-brokers-home-loans-quicker","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"The online brokers taking the misery out of mortgages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/11/online-mortgage-brokers-home-loans-quicker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/nov/11/online-mortgage-brokers-home-loans-quicker","fields":{"headline":"The online brokers taking the misery out of mortgages","bodyText":"They market themselves as a hassle-free way to get a home loan, where you don’t pay anything to use their services and computers do much of the legwork. So is it time to give a digital mortgage broker a spin? These online firms tend to have quirky one-word names – Trussle and Habito are two of the best known – and typically claim they are able to search through thousands of mortgage deals to recommend the right one for you. Some of them, such as Habito, involve you having a conversation with a chatbot. A report out this week gave this new breed of mortgage broker the thumbs-up, and a quick test by Guardian Money found these sites well worth a try, even if it’s just to get an idea of how much you would be able to borrow and the most competitive deals for people in your position. Until a couple of years ago, if you were thinking of taking out a mortgage but didn’t know which one to go for, you could try to fathom the best deal from a set of generic results on a price comparison website, or you could go to a traditional mortgage broker – one that either offered fee-free advice or that charged you – to do the searching on your behalf. However, the new breed of online brokers claim their cutting-edge technology makes finding and applying for a mortgage a quicker and slicker experience – and as a customer you pay nothing for the service. Just like a traditional broker, the websites receive a fee from the lender when the borrower completes their home loan. Launched in December 2015, Trussle was the first online broker to set up in the UK. It was quickly followed by others, including Habito, Dwell (which recently changed its name to Burrow) and MortgageGym. Andrew Hagger of website Moneycomms.co.uk has authored a report on the sites, commissioned by one of the new players, Burrow, which has recently launched a television advert featuring a kangaroo. He says that while they all have the same intention – to save consumers time, hassle and money by quickly pointing them in the direction of the most suitable mortgage product – they work in different ways. He says Burrow, Trussle and MortgageGym search the full market for broker products across 90-plus lenders, though with Trussle there are no help-to-buy deals available yet, and MortgageGym only offers a service for remortgage customers (it aims to include first-time buyers and home movers by the end of this year). Habito, meanwhile, has access to more than 70 lenders but doesn’t offer products from a handful of big names including HSBC, First Direct, TSB, the Post Office and Tesco Bank. “All four of these players are pretty good in their own way,” says Hagger. He adds that they offer a decent alternative for consumers, in particular those who want to be pointed in the right direction in a matter of minutes rather than having a lengthy face-to-face meeting. However, Ray Boulger at traditional broker firm John Charcol, says of the digital upstarts: “They admit the advice is given by humans. No one has yet developed an artificial intelligence system that can do that [the advice process] properly.” He adds that while there are some administrative aspects of getting a mortgage that can be improved upon, when it comes to the actual advice process, “people value talking to a human” and the skill of a flesh-and-blood broker is in “being able to ask the right questions”. Money gave the four sites a quick go. We used a made-up case study: a couple, both 49, with two teenage children, living in a £500,000 three-bedroom home in east London, who are looking to remortgage and have an existing home loan of £200,000. They have recently come to the end of their deal and are looking to fix their monthly payments. He earns £40,000 and she £20,000. Their monthly payment is currently £1,000, which is probably unrealistically low, but we wanted to throw down the gauntlet. Burrow This site asked our couple a lot of questions, including how much each paid into a pension, which not everyone would know off-hand. The site was easy to use and at the end of the process – which took around 10 minutes – our couple were awarded a mortgage score of 1,000 out of 1,000. This sounds a little unlikely. The site told us that if the couple remortgaged to a Barclays two-year fixed-rate mortgage with an initial interest rate of 1.29%, they would pay £910.95 a month – a monthly saving of £89.05. However, this deal has fees of £1,114. Alternatively, the couple could switch to a Halifax three-year fix priced at 1.44%, where the monthly payments would be £924.76 and the fees £999. One useful feature of the site is that it tells you how much you can borrow from particular lenders, which gives you an insight into which ones are likely to be looser with the purse strings. According to Burrow, Halifax would lend our couple £285,000, while Santander would lend £243,786. Habito This website was also user-friendly. We keyed in various bits of information, including how much our couple earned and the state of their finances, and it told us they could take out a two-year fixed-rate mortgage with Barclays priced at 1.49%, paying £924 a month. The fees were estimated at just £35. Habito also told us that the maximum borrowing amount was £330,000. If you want more than this quick overview, it’s then over to the company’s (human) mortgage experts for an online live chat. Trussle The site says you can “complete your profile to receive a personalised mortgage recommendation”. This involves answering a few non-intrusive questions – it only took us a minute. Trussle subsequently told us we could move to a two-year fixed-rate deal at 1.39%, where our monthly payment would be £916 – a saving of £84. But it did not say which lender was offering this. To get more details around the mortgage we would have had to answer a lot more questions. We started the process but bailed out when it asked for a real address and other details for our made-up couple. MortgageGym MortgageGym has partnered with credit reference agency Experian on a 60-second mortgage matcher service, which promises to find up to four deals you are likely to be accepted for. But some people may be put off by the fact that it wants a lot of personal information: name, date of birth, address, income, etc. The service then does a “soft search” of your credit file. This type of credit check is not visible to lenders and can only be seen by you, it says. There are then lots of human experts on hand online to help with the application."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/09/laura-plummer-family-egypt-drug-chares-tramadol-hull","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T15:09:15Z","webTitle":"Family fear for plight of British woman detained in Egypt on drug charges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/09/laura-plummer-family-egypt-drug-chares-tramadol-hull","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/09/laura-plummer-family-egypt-drug-chares-tramadol-hull","fields":{"headline":"Family fear for plight of British woman detained in Egypt on drug charges","bodyText":"The family of a British woman detained in Egypt on suspicion of trafficking drugs have spoken of their fear and confusion over her legal representation. Rachel Plummer, whose sister Laura, 33, has been held in Egypt since 9 October for allegedly carrying 29 strips of the painkillers Tramadol and Naproxen, said the family had been charged large sums of money by lawyers claiming they could free her sister, who remains in detention. Tramadol, an opioid, is a controlled substance in Egypt, where it is often used as a heroin substitute. Laura Plummer was detained at Hurghada airport in Egypt after a scan of her bag revealed she was carrying nearly 300 pills. She was taken to a holding area and questioned for five hours. Her sister said Laura was appointed a lawyer in the holding room who told her: “If you don’t give me £10,000, you will go to prison for 15 years”. Rachel said the lawyer instructed Laura’s Egyptian partner, Omar, who had been waiting for her outside the airport, to flee. Laura was pressed into signing a 38-page document in Arabic, with no understanding of what she was signing, Rachel said. Her lawyer was present when the document was signed. Laura has spent the last month in a detention centre in Hurghada, in a cramped cell with up to 25 other people. Her third trial hearing is expected on Saturday. After Laura’s detention, her family hired a new lawyer. “He didn’t last long,” said Rachel. “He demanded £20,000, but wanted Laura to lie and say [the drugs] were planted on her.” The family declined. “As a family we refuse to let Laura lie. He told us it’s the only way she’ll come home, but we took the risk,” she said. “It was only with our mum’s second visit to Hurghada that we got this third lawyer,” she explained, referring to Laura’s new legal counsel obtained through the British consulate. She added that a British consulate representative had visited Laura in jail and told her: “Laura, we’re not a get-out-of-jail-free card.” Laura says she took the Tramadol to Hurghada for Omar, whom she met four years ago while on holiday in the Sinai resort town of Sharm El Sheikh. The pair later obtained a marriage document to allow them to stay together during Laura’s visits, as unmarried foreigners and Egyptians are forbidden to rent accommodation together under Egyptian law. It is not clear if their marriage is official. Rachel said Omar did not press Laura to bring the drugs to Egypt, but that she had been offered the prescription medication by a work colleague after discussing Omar’s back pain, which stems from a car accident three years ago. “[Laura and Omar would] speak on the phone for hours every night without fail,” said Rachel. “My mum hears Laura laughing all night in her bedroom – he makes her very happy. “If he’d set her up like people say, then he would have run,” she added. “At the airport he was pushed out by Laura’s lawyer and told to flee. He refused and stood outside waiting all night for her to come out.” The Plummers, from Hull, are desperately hoping that better legal representation will bring Laura home. “I just want to say how sorry we are to the Egyptian government for this stupid mistake,” said Rachel. “We know there’s a law, we understand that. But she’s been punished enough now.” A British embassy representative has made regular visits to Laura and has been communicating with her family. Laura’s local MP, Karl Turner, has said that the Foreign Office are involved and that the British embassy in Cairo has provided her with a lawyer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/nov/21/haves-have-nots-cities-crisis-david-levene-san-francisco-ulaanbaatar-jungle-jerusalem","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-21T07:30:52Z","webTitle":"The haves and have-nots: four cities in crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/21/haves-have-nots-cities-crisis-david-levene-san-francisco-ulaanbaatar-jungle-jerusalem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/nov/21/haves-have-nots-cities-crisis-david-levene-san-francisco-ulaanbaatar-jungle-jerusalem","fields":{"headline":"The haves and have-nots: four cities in crisis","bodyText":"More than half of the world’s population now lives in cities, but many people are residing in a state of limbo, leading a precarious existence on the margins, excluded from the promises of urban life. The world’s population is on the move more than ever before, driven by conflict and persecution, by the threat of environmental catastrophe and the lure of a better life, but cities simply aren’t prepared to receive their new arrivals. Over the last two decades, Guardian photographer David Levene has documented the ways that people are living and working in cities around the world, how they make do with the bare minimum of resources to carve out space for themselves and their families in the most precarious of circumstances, and how cities are being polarised into places of haves and have-nots, with the right to the city relentlessly eroded. On the publication of his new book of urban photographs, City, and an exhibition of his work at Foyles bookshop in London, we look at four very different cities that nonetheless share a common urban 21st experience of dislocation and resilience. From the yurt encampments on the peripheries of Ulaanbaatar built by herders following the disastrous loss of livestock during extreme winters, to the self-built city of the Calais Jungle refugee camp, the growing homeless population of San Francisco forced on to the streets by the tech boom, and the dislocated town of Abu Dis, now cut off from Jerusalem by a huge concrete wall, Levene’s photographs reveal a shared experience: of human ingenuity against the odds. Ulaanbaatar Sitting pensively on the edges of their beds, surrounded by the colourful trappings of a nomadic herder’s life, Altansukh Purev and his family contemplate the reality of their new home. The other side of the yak-skin walls of their traditional Mongolian yurt, or ger, are not the vast, empty plains of the rolling steppe that you might expect, but a sprawling scene of shacks and yurts, packed tightly together on the hilly outskirts of Ulaanbaatar. These are the homes of around 600,000 former herders who, like Altansukh, have moved to the Mongolian capital over the past three decades. It is an unprecedented wave of migration that has seen 20% of the country’s people move to Ulaanbaatar, doubling its population and surrounding the city with new unplanned ger districts, ad-hoc shantytowns spreading ever further outwards into the hills. These densely packed slums have no running water, mains electricity or sewage infrastructure. Without central heating, residents burn cheap coal to heat their homes throughout the freezing winters. And if they can’t afford coal, they are forced to burn rubbish and old tyres instead, leading to pollution levels five times worse than Beijing. Altansukh Purev, 38, with his wife, Narmandakh Sainjargal, and two of their four sons inside their ger From Altansukh’s small plot of land, demarcated with a rickety wooden fence – itself a concept alien to a nomadic people used to pitching up on the plains wherever they please – the centre of Ulaanbaatar fades into the smoggy distance. It is a landscape of crumbling Soviet blocks and shiny new skyscrapers, giving way to a jumbled foreground of yurts, pylons and the wreckage of smashed-up cars where Altansukh’s children play. Other kids use a makeshift basketball hoop, precariously fixed beneath a pylon, or clamber on the nearby rubbish heap. Like many of his neighbours, Altansukh, his wife and their four children moved here when their livestock perished one disastrously cold winter. They awoke one morning to find their 300 sheep had frozen to death, while their 40 cows had wandered far off into the snow and never came back. It was the result of the dzud, Mongolia’s extreme weather phenomenon, where a summer drought is followed by a harsh winter, with temperatures ranging from 50C to -50C, causing many livestock to starve or freeze to death. From 2009 to 2010, 8.5 million animals perished. Climate change is only exacerbating the trend, pushing evermore people towards the city to find work. A boy plays basketball in the Bayanzürkh district of Ulaanbaatar Extreme weather isn’t the only challenge. Until the fall of the communist regime in the 1990s, herding was managed by Mongolia’s central government: livestock was collectively owned and there was a limit on the number of animals allowed in each herd. Crucially, there was also a central supply of fodder, distributed to herders during the harsh winters, meaning that the worst effects of the dzud could be avoided. Since state support has vanished, the private herders have been under increased pressure to turn a profit, while a rise in the number of livestock has meant more animals grazing on less land. The result is more and more herders flocking to the capital to try and make a new life on its jumbled periphery, but with little chance of ever integrating into the city. Mitsuaki Toyoda, who arrived here in 1998, and is now head of mission for Save the Children, which runs aid programmes in the city’s deprived suburbs, is frank about their prospects. “If you’re from the countryside with just secondary education and no relevant work experience, then what proper job can you get?” he says. “If you don’t have a proper job then it’s very difficult to get a bank loan. So you can’t purchase an apartment. Our conclusion is that the first generation of migrants will live in the ger districts for the rest of their lives.” Jerusalem The ruin of a newly built McMansion stands in the Palestinian town of Abu Dis in East Jerusalem, its oversized classical portico still presenting a grand face to the street, despite massive holes smashed into every side of the building. Behind the creamy stone wreck runs the 8m-high concrete backdrop of the West Bank barrier, the security wall eventually planned to stretch over 700km, crowned with the barbed-wire summit of an Israeli watchtower. The wall is the reason that this grand house had to be made uninhabitable: the presence of a five-storey structure so close to the barrier presented too much of a threat for the Israeli Defence Force to tolerate. Things could be hurled over the wall, or people might even leap across, so the home had to be destroyed. Members of the Israeli Defense Forces on the Galizia Roofs in Jerusalem’s Old City Such ruins are a common sight in Abu Dis, a town which, since the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, has been classified as part of “Area B”, a place under joint Israeli and Palestinian control. It is where the Palestinians optimistically started to build their new parliament in 1996, in the form of an imposing stone edifice that still stands unfinished, a hollow shell just like the nearby house. It was designed so that Yasser Arafat could have a view of al-Aqsa mosque from his office window, but now all you see from the echoing ruin is the endless grey ribbon of the security wall. A newly built mansion in Abu Dis part-demolished by the IDF; the Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Mekor Baruch; teenagers doing parkour on the Galizia roofs The arrival of the barrier has had a devastating effect on the residents of Abu Dis. The town had always seen itself as part of Jerusalem, as Brooklyn is to Manhattan, but now it feels like part of the West Bank, cut off from the city out of which it grew. Communities have been divided, residents have been separated from their places of work, house prices have plummeted, and the prospect of making the Palestinian capital here seems even more remote than it was two decades ago. It is the same story for numerous towns and villages across East Jerusalem, home to 320,000 Palestinians who now make up 37% of the city’s population. Since the walls, fences and checkpoints went up in the early 2000s, in response to the suicide bombings of the second Palestinian intifada, the residents of East Jerusalem have been forced to live in a form of political limbo, suspended between Israel and the West Bank. Silwan, East Jerusalem Half of East Jerusalem’s Palestinian labour force now works in West Jerusalem, according to the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, an independent Israeli study centre, and many live a divided life, working beyond the barrier by day and protesting by night. Residents complain of high taxes, fines and a lack of municipal services, while more than 80% of the city’s Palestinian children live in poverty, according to government statistics, compared with about 30% of Israeli children. While the line of the concrete barrier is the most visible evidence of Jerusalem’s separation, the sense of division runs right through the historical core of the city. In the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, across the invisible barrier of the 1967 armistice line – where Israel captured the historic centre with its ancient holy sites from Jordanian control – the streets bristle with security and surveillance. CCTV cameras cover every corner, Palestinians are frequently stopped by patrolling Israeli Defense Forces soldiers and asked for their ID cards, while Israeli flags festoon the balconies of apartments now inhabited by nationalist religious Jews. On a nearby rooftop, a troupe of young IDF recruits look across at the golden crown of the Dome of the Rock shrine, while a group of young Palestinian teenagers practice parkour. For a brief moment, the next generation of the two sides of this divided city manages to coexist in peace. Calais Karzan, an Iraqi nurse, sits on the floor of his makeshift shelter with his wife, Sharmin, and their one-and-a-half-year-old son, Hemn, bathed in a cold blue light from the plastic tarpaulin stretched over the wooden frame of their home. By November 2015, they had been living here for a month in the Calais refugee camp known as the Jungle. They had fled from their hometown of Kirkuk, Iraq, when Isis told Karzan that, if he didn’t agree to work as a nurse for their fighters, they would kill him. He had paid a people smuggler $10,000 to get the family by train and car to Calais, but by this point they had no more money left. They were stuck there, in a space half the size of a small garden shed, together with Sharmin’s brother. When they’d first arrived, there were just a couple of families; by now there were 50 or 60. By the camp’s peak a few months later, the population would reach 10,000 people. This sprawling temporary migrant city, which grew and grew until it was brutally bulldozed in November 2016, developed completely on its own. Unlike most refugee camps, there was no UN or Red Cross, no agency in charge to organise accommodation and services. Becoming home to refugees from Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Jungle evolved as a melting pot of specific districts, with the self-built structures reflecting its residents different cultural traditions. A wide shot of the Calais Jungle, France; residents wait by the roadside, and queue inside the compound The Sudanese families arranged their shelters in groups around communal eating spaces, with separate spaces for cooking together. The Afghans, on the other hand, generally lived more separately, but set up restaurants along an emerging commercial “strip” for social gathering. The Eritrean community, meanwhile, established a nightclub in a dome-shaped structure, which doubled as a theatre and gallery during the day. Behind the shantytown fabric of tents, mud and abject squalor, there were the beginnings of a self-organised urban ecosystem. An informal high street emerged, lined with basic restaurants and shops, phone-charging booths and hairdressers, with people offering quick beard-trims while squatting in the street. Volunteers from across Europe built a school and a daycare centre for children, along with a library, a couple of mosques, a church, a refugee advice centre, an art therapy tent, medical clinics and even a radio station. Sharmin Hassan with her 18-month old son and her husband, who was a nurse in Iraq. The family travelled from Kirkuk to Calais Along with gloves, ear-warmers and cigarettes, the shops stocked plenty of high-caffeine drinks. “All night they are running for the trains,” an Afghan shopkeeper said. “When they come back in the morning they need that energy.” He said he was subject to continual harassment by the police, who repeatedly asked him to produce a licence – to which he pointed out that, without these illegal shops, the residents of the Jungle would have to walk a 2km round trip to the nearest supermarket in Calais. That was something the city was particularly keen to avoid. Long a destination for weekending Brits in search of cheap booze, Calais had by now become something of a ghost town, evacuated of the usual tourists, who were fearful of the encampment on its doorstep. Instead, it was suddenly home to hundreds of journalists in search of their own hot take on the Jungle. “No, not you, too!” began the welcome letter at one hotel. “We’re fed up with the glitterati coming to feed off Calais’ misfortunes and treating the people stuck within its walls like lab rats … I wonder: which traps will you fall into? What story are you looking for? One thing I know for sure: your venture will be a failure.” San Francisco By 7am, the pews of St Boniface Catholic church in San Francisco are already full. Beneath the ornately painted ceiling and romanesque arches that spring from huge marble columns, bodies fill every space on the rows of wooden benches. But the congregation isn’t here to pray: they’ve come here to sleep. The ornate nave of St Boniface is one of the few places where some of San Francisco’s 7,000-strong population of homeless people can come to rest, thanks to the Gubbio Project, a local non-governmental organisation. And it is one of the only such safe havens during the daytime. Most homeless shelters in the city close early in the morning and don’t allow people to stay during the day, unless they have a medical condition that requires it, while the city’s recent ban on sitting or lying on sidewalks in daytime means homeless people have to keep on the move. Homeless people sleep on the pews in St Boniface Catholic church, as part of the Gubbio Project Yet the daylight hours provide their best chance for peace. Many of the city’s rough sleepers force themselves to stay awake at night for fear of being attacked or robbed, so save rest for the daytime. The queue outside St Boniface extends around the block by 6am every morning, with over a hundred people on average waiting to get some rest and access church amenities like bathrooms, blankets, clothing vouchers and haircuts. As the rise of the Bay Area tech industry has driven up rents and the rate of evictions, San Francisco is struggling to house its low-income residents more than ever before. While statistics compiled by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development show that homelessness has been declining steadily across the country since 2007, the west coast is a different story. California is one of the five states to see the greatest increase, now accounting for 21% of the entire nation’s homeless population, with both Los Angeles and San Francisco dotted with encampments of tents and shacks across the city. Homeless people camping beneath the flyover opposite Airbnb’s HQ In 2016, San Francisco declared a “shelter emergency”, a piece of legislation usually reserved for natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, following similar moves in 2015 by Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle and King County, Washington. It was announced a week after city officials had cleared out a sprawling homeless encampment under a highway overpass where as many as 300 people had been living in tents and makeshift shelters. A few blocks away from St Boniface church stands the gleaming white headquarters of Airbnb, a former factory building now kitted out with themed meeting rooms modelled on holiday rentals offered through the home-sharing platform – including tents and camper-vans. Across the street stands a line of tents of a different kind, home to community of around 20 people sheltering beneath the flyover. A tent outside Best Buy near 13th Street Now valued at $30bn (£23bn), Airbnb has become the ultimate poster child of the “sharing economy”, yet it has been roundly accused of exacerbating the city’s homelessness problem by taking thousands of units out of the rental market. “We believe in a world where all seven billion of us can belong anywhere,” is the company’s motto – a sentiment that jars with the tents on its doorstep. John Pobuda, a 58-year-old former US army private from Minnesota, is one resident of the undercroft below the deck of Interstate 80, who manages to scratch a living from what Airbnb throws in the trash. “Cans, bottles, extension cords, piping, copper – it’s amazing what people throw away,” he says. “I’ve salvaged about $400 worth from that dumpster. I guess you could say that makes me part of the technology industry, but I don’t feel like it.” Own a limited edition print by Guardian photographer David Levene Live: Guardian photographer David Levene in conversation at Foyles, London on 4 December 2017 Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/nov/12/baby-driver-cars-3-office-christmas-party-philadelphia-story-dvds-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-12T08:00:49Z","webTitle":"DVD reviews: Baby Driver, Cars 3, Office Christmas Party and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/12/baby-driver-cars-3-office-christmas-party-philadelphia-story-dvds-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/nov/12/baby-driver-cars-3-office-christmas-party-philadelphia-story-dvds-review","fields":{"headline":"DVD reviews: Baby Driver, Cars 3, Office Christmas Party and more","bodyText":"Fast cars, glib quips, young blood and a marshmallow in place of a soul – yep, Baby Driver (Sony, 15) is on shelves this week, but so is Cars 3 (Disney, U), and, frankly, I could be talking about either. That won’t please the already large and ardent fan club for Edgar Wright’s bright, boyish, sherbety spin on Drive, which has all the right moves and tunes to secure the bro-classic status it so eagerly seeks. Steered by Ansel Elgort’s cupcake-faced but wickedly fast getaway driver – called, yes, Baby – it’s a neo-retro pile-up of sharp poses, Smartie-shell surfaces and perfect jukebox picks, from Martha Reeves and the Vandellas to T Rex. Indeed, it’s practically more musical than action film, seemingly moulded around its soundtrack rather than the other way round, with car chases as its snazzily choreographed production numbers. (And I do mean snazzy: there’s road ballet here that makes the more recent Fast &amp; Furious films look galumphing by comparison.) The joyride’s fun to a point, but it doesn’t take long to see that Baby Driver’s about nothing more than its own self-impressed genre design: who is Baby when his headphones are off, and why should we care to know? As a thriller, it’s a bust, gradually succumbing to a strangely drab, nasty bullet fetish. As a sheer exercise in swagger, meanwhile, it hasn’t found in Elgort the movie star to carry it through. Still, however recycled its pleasures, Baby Driver has a new car smell fresher than anything in Cars 3. Eleven years into its least endearing franchise, Pixar is barely attempting to mask the primary reason for extending it this far. It’s an elaborate action-figure marketing promo, assembled with vim and expertise in the animation department, and a script that still can’t make us invest emotionally in anthropomorphised engines. You can’t say it doesn’t do its job, but coming from a company that sells itself on its ideas, Cars 3 is dispiriting stuff. The distributors of Office Christmas Party (eOne, 15) understandably waited nearly a year to bring this fratboy-ish festive farce out on DVD, though they might have held out a month longer. Even with the high-street Christmas lights ablaze and Mariah Carey already echoing down the supermarket aisles, November feels a mite early for seasonal silliness on the scale of Josh Gordon and Will Speck’s self-explanatory, hit-and-miss comedy. Jason Bateman, Kate McKinnon and Jennifer Aniston all gamely hit their marks; the film’s retrograde gender politics, not so much. It’ll do in a pinch, but you could just pop in Criterion’s shiny new reissue of The Philadelphia Story (Sony, PG) instead, and remember what it was like when Hollywood studios wrote comedies with equal interest in the sexes. With Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart this lithe and smart, how could they not? Seventy-seven years on, George Cukor’s star-dusted romcom of remarriage bounces and glides and sparks like a dream, light as pavlova but with the requisite slosh of vinegar. There may be nothing seasonal about it, but it feels like a holiday in itself. Now, a pair of low-key arthouse objects of intrigue. Tim Sutton’s humming, quivering mood piece Dark Night (Thunderbird, 12) is an elliptical prelude to real-life horror, stalking the disconnected residents of a summer-dried slab of Florida suburbia with what seems like idle intent. A late jolt brings its hazy perspective into focus, as an armed individual opens fire in a cinema. The title becomes a grim pun on the 2012 massacre in a Colorado screening of The Dark Knight Rises, and Sutton’s film emerges as a silent scream in response to America’s ongoing plague of gun violence. Finally, I’ve lately been neglecting the obscure treasures of Festival Scope, a free streaming website dedicated to the kind of film festival discoveries that don’t have clear commercial paths forward – such as Clément Cogitore’s brain-needling debut The Wakhan Front, a fringe Cannes standout from 2015. Bringing an elegantly uncanny, semi-supernatural twist to its study of military ennui in Afghanistan, it subtly allows for a wealth of metaphorical possibilities in its central crisis as a French captain (Jérémie Renier) finds his soldiers vanishing, one by one, into thin, cold air. Call it the war zone meets The Twilight Zone; it deserves more visibility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/the-sinner-review-the-psychological-whydunnit-thats-been-a-big-us-ratings-success","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T15:33:17Z","webTitle":"The Sinner review – the psychological whydunnit that’s been a big US ratings success","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/the-sinner-review-the-psychological-whydunnit-thats-been-a-big-us-ratings-success","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/09/the-sinner-review-the-psychological-whydunnit-thats-been-a-big-us-ratings-success","fields":{"headline":"The Sinner review – the psychological whydunnit that’s been a big US ratings success","bodyText":"What is it: Let’s call it a whydunnit. Why you’ll love it: A woman – a normal, slightly dissatisfied woman – goes to the beach. She goes for a swim and, out of nowhere, is gripped by a strange sensation. She returns to the shore, hugs her son, eats a pear and then stabs a man to death. Why? Did she know the victim? Did his sexy seaside horseplay bring back memories of some hidden trauma? Was it her medication? Her bedroom wallpaper? Was it because – as I initially suspected – he was playing music on his phone in a crowded area? The woman herself doesn’t seem to know. What’s going on? This is the central question at the heart of The Sinner. A sly ratings success in the US – it has been the most-watched new cable show this year – The Sinner is based on the Petra Hammesfahr novel of the same name, and takes the form of a gussied-up push and pull between the woman (played by Jessica Biel) and the detective tasked with figuring out this mess (Bill Pullman). The problem with programmes that hinge on a gimmick as grabby as this is that the answers are often much less satisfying than the inciting incident. But the joy of The Sinner is getting to watch Biel do everything in her power to just get the ordeal over with. A more traditional show would turn the relationship between her and Pullman into a cat and mouse, but that isn’t really the case here. The mouse is splayed out on the floor begging to be eaten and the cat can’t understand why. She instantly pleads guilty to avoid a trial. But a competency evaluation is ordered, so she explains her motivation in horrific detail. But that’s quickly revealed to be a lie, so the process must begin anew. Biel would rather spend her life rotting in prison than truly examine her actions, but every detail that floats to the surface – drug problems, a cartoonishly awful childhood, sexy flashbacks of undulating bodies – starts to make that impossible. Before you know it, these flashbacks have piled up on top of more flashbacks and the whole thing edges towards the precipice. It gets to the point where the faintest prod could derail the entire series, so the fact that it doesn’t is nothing short of a miracle. Fortunately, there are answers. This is no Lost-style wheel-spinning exercise, and the denouement is just as satisfying and horrible as the conclusion to the first Broadchurch. If you find yourself drifting away during The Sinner’s midpoint, I can promise you it’s worth persevering with. As bracingly vanity-free as Biel’s performance is, all blood and gut and scab, Pullman is the real secret weapon here. His detective is rumpled and kinky, like Columbo if old Columbo episodes were routinely interrupted by scenes of him getting pegged by a dominatrix. He’s horribly, horribly sad, and you sense that he has only seized upon this case because it’s the one part of his life that he can control. Not to give anything away, but the show ends on such a note of finality that the only way forward would be to shove Pullman into a new mystery next year. Based on this run, that would be no bad thing. Where: Netflix. Length: Eight 45-minute episodes, all available now. Stand-out episode: A series like this all feeds from one horrific action. If you like the first episode, you’ll like the rest. If you liked The Sinner, watch: The Killing (Netflix), Broadchurch (Now TV)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/09/israeli-police-question-benjamin-netanyahu-in-corruption-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T23:20:28Z","webTitle":"Israeli anti-corruption police question Netanyahu for fifth time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/09/israeli-police-question-benjamin-netanyahu-in-corruption-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/09/israeli-police-question-benjamin-netanyahu-in-corruption-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Israeli anti-corruption police question Netanyahu for fifth time","bodyText":"Israeli police have questioned Benjamin Netanyahu for a fifth time in relation to a series of sprawling corruption investigations. In a statement late on Thursday, the police said detectives from the national fraud and serious crimes squad questioned the prime minister for “several hours” at his official residence in Jerusalem’s Balfour Street on Thursday afternoon. Officers were reported to be interested in talking to Netanyahu about two ongoing investigations. In the first, known as case 1,000, Netanyahu and his family are suspected of accepting expensive gifts, including cigars, pink champagne and jewellery, allegedly in return for advancing the interests of several wealthy benefactors, including the Hollywood producer and media magnate Arnon Milchan. According to reports in the Israeli media, Israel’s ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, has been questioned recently as part of the same investigation. It is claimed he asked the then US secretary of state John Kerry, at Netanyahu’s request, to help get a US visa for Milchan. Detectives were reportedly also keen to question Netanyahu on a second affair, known as case 2,000, which is examining allegations that he improperly sought a deal to get more favourable coverage from one of Israel’s leading newspapers, Yedioth Ahronoth. The alleged deal, believed to have not been finalised, would have meant Netanyahu getting positive coverage in return for helping curb Yediot’s competitor, the pro-Netanyahu freesheet Israel Hayom. In August, Netanyahu’s former chief of staff Ari Harow struck a star-witness deal, reportedly involving testimony he provided on the two cases. Netanyahu has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to these investigations and says he has been the target of a campaign by political opponents. In a television interview on Thursday evening, Netanyahu’s lawyer, Jacob Weinroth, insisted his client was honest but had a weakness for wealthy people. “Netanyahu is an honest person,” Weinroth told Channel 2. “If you ask him for a list of his successes and his failures, your jaw will drop. That said, he very much admires money. I know his weakness for wealthy people.” Earlier this week, two of Netanyahu’s closest associates – his personal lawyer David Shimron and Isaac Molcho, who has acted as a foreign envoy – were questioned over a third investigation, case 3,000, involving a €2bn (£1.8bn) deal for Israel to purchase German submarines and patrol boats. Netanyahu is not a suspect in this case, although recent reports suggest police may ask him to give testimony. Meanwhile, key figures in the prime minister’s own party continued to advance parliamentary legislation, the sole aim of which is apparently to protect Netanyahu from any future indictment. While Netanyahu has aggressively tried to ride out the damage from the investigations, recent polls have suggested they may be taking a toll, both on his own standing and that of his party. If the polls are right, and elections were to happen soon, Netanyahu would fall short of the number of seats needed to form a coalition. A recent Channel 12 poll found that a majority of Israelis believed he should step down as prime minister at the end of his current term, with only 38% wanting him to remain in power for another term."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/nov/09/manchester-arena-bomb-survivors-could-get-10000-for-mental-trauma","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T12:47:10Z","webTitle":"Manchester Arena bomb survivors could get £10,000 for mental trauma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/09/manchester-arena-bomb-survivors-could-get-10000-for-mental-trauma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/nov/09/manchester-arena-bomb-survivors-could-get-10000-for-mental-trauma","fields":{"headline":"Manchester Arena bomb survivors could get £10,000 for mental trauma","bodyText":"Up to 300 survivors of the Manchester Arena bomb who have suffered related mental health problems could receive £10,000 each from a charity fund established to help victims of the attack. Witnesses who were in the arena foyer on 22 May when Salman Abedi detonated his suicide bomb will receive the money if experts assess that they were “functionally impaired” by the psychological injury they sustained, the We Love Manchester emergency fund trustees said on Thursday. Sue Murphy, a councillor who chairs the fund’s board of trustees, said: “The people in the foyer of the Manchester Arena that night saw and heard things that none of us should ever have to see or hear. “We know people are suffering mentally as well as physically. That’s why the trustees of the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund have worked so hard to get this right. We have consulted extensively with mental health professionals to understand how best to help those with psychological trauma, specifically those who were closest to the attack.” In order to qualify, recipients must have been “directly exposed” to the attack and have not already had a payment from the fund of £60,000 or more to compensate for physical injuries. Functional impairment means that they are unable to do the things that they could do comfortably before the attack, and will need to be validated by an accredited clinician, such as a psychological therapist. Greater Manchester police will verify that applicants were in the foyer or accessed it immediately after the incident. Recipients can spend the money how they wish. “The money is a gift from the people of Greater Manchester and the rest of the world and as such, there are no strings attached to how the money is spent,” the trustees said in a statement. The fund estimates up to 300 people could be eligible for the £10,000 gift. This represents £3m of the £18m emergency fund that was established in response to the attack. It brings the total distributed from the fund to £14m. The trustees of the fund sought advice and guidance from clinical experts at the Greater Manchester Resilience Hub, set up after the attack to ensure that those affected had access to mental health treatment. It is staffed by NHS mental health specialists. Murphy said: “I am proud to be leading a charity which treats psychological injury as seriously as it treats physical injury.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/18/blackpool-beach-year-life-seaside-town","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T05:33:59Z","webTitle":"Blackpool beach: a year in the life of a seaside town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/18/blackpool-beach-year-life-seaside-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/18/blackpool-beach-year-life-seaside-town","fields":{"headline":"Blackpool beach: a year in the life of a seaside town","bodyText":"There is a rhythm set down by the sea – by the steady turn of the tides, the passage of the boats, the pull between land and water. But it is there also in the year’s division of pleasure, the stark demarcation of the in and out of season. To the unaccustomed eye there is little so bleak as a seaside town in winter – the shuttered gaiety, the unpeopled shore, the wind that rattles the amusement arcades, ice-cream parlours and bed and breakfast windows. When the warmer months come, they are heralded not by the hedgerows, snowdrops and songbirds, but by a sense of the town itself unfurling: the reopening of cafes on the front, the softened contours of the sand, by the sea that no longer scowls a hunkered-down grey, but softens, and lifts its face towards the sky. And then comes the arrival of the day trippers, pleasure seekers, holidaymakers, a sudden swelling of numbers for the yearly parade of airshows, funfairs, hen dos, weddings. Every year the autumn hits with new strangeness. The unexpected silence, the lurch. And then we are returned once more to the emptiness, the quiet streets, the roaring sea. The sense of the town returned once more to its own. This past year, the Guardian photographer Christopher Thomond captured this turn of the seasons, depicting life along the short stretch between Blackpool’s North and Central piers. It is a portrait of the land itself – of water, sky, blazing sunsets, but also of its people – the swimmers, cartwheelers and selfie takers who crowd this northern shore. Buy a limited edition archival-quality giclée print of three of Thomond’s photographs from our partner theprintspace Winter’s pier In the wintertime there comes the sense of space – the sky spreads wider, and the sands lie largely empty. Sound folds in and out of itself: the whip of dogs wet-footed and unleashed. The wild grasping call of the gulls that cling to the promenade and wheel the high winds, wings wide, eyes sharp as needles. Above, the light shifts: short days, long shadows, heavy cloud, fierce, cold sun. There is a strange new reverence for air, for the buffering of kites and the billowing of coats and the murmurations of starlings that swell and shape. Beauty finds new form: the gaudy buxomness of summer is set aside, colours drain, grow softer, subtler, until the landscape sings a new and slighter song, of pier rust, tide-glint, rock. Carla Read’s six-year-old son, Warren, flying a kite just after high tide; a gull with Blackpool Tower in the background. Spring blossoms Life returns to the seaside in a flurry of reopenings: the stalls selling postcards, knick-knacks, buckets and spades, the promise of crazy golf, deckchairs, carousels. It is an odd blossoming, in shades of bright plastic and candyfloss pink, and with it the sense that the joviality is rising, determined and potent as sap. A visitor walks under a pier at low tide in May. The first visitors arrive, summoned by half term, Easter break, and they take to the sand in windcheaters and bare feet. The days are not heavy yet, they are bracing and new. And the piers stand as improbable as flamingos, stalk-legged in the tide. A sign on the North Pier; love padlocks attacked to the railings. Dean Brown constructing a replica Blackpool Tower on the beach. Summer lovin’ In summer, the sound of the seaside grows voluptuous, soft air filled with bursts of pleasure – laughter, squeals, full-bellied gulls. The chatter of vacationers, whose days stretch long and warm-limbed before them. The days fill out, their hours taken up with sandcastles, fairground rides, love affairs. There are so many people now – all along the front, on the sand, gathered in the arcades, riding donkeys, walking dogs, playing rugby in the sea. They come for a day, they stay for a week, for a time this town becomes theirs. And the sky too gives itself up to the season, full now of airshows, sunsets, the scent of chip fat and doughnuts. The annual Blackpool airshow; young aviation enthusiasts. Nottingham students play rugby in the sea during a four-day break in Blackpool. On the beach Buy your limited edition print of this image from theprintspace There is no great fanfare. The bodies are revealed suddenly, awkwardly, offered up to the summer as a pale gift. The teenagers trying out this year’s bikini, the fathers who stand on the beach bare-chested, displaying their prowess with sandcastles, giant spades, improbable swimming feats. Donkeys parade on the beach; a tractor skims the sands before breakfast, preparing the beach at low tide for the day’s visitors. Under the steady eye of lifeguards, children explore this new terrain: of sand in the sandwiches, damp costumes, lotion, the dazzling new array of prizes, a crab in a bucket, a long streak of seaweed curled like a dragon skin, a shell, small and impossible as a fingernail. An abandoned Toy Story inflatable ring, Yan Xiao from China. Lifeguards keep watch over the beach at the start of the school holiday season. Ropes and safety messages from the beach patrol. Switched on Since 1879, Blackpool has held its annual light display as a crowning to the summer months. Running for 66 days and along six miles of the Fylde coast, the event requires more than 1m bulbs, costs close to £2m, and throws the town into a state of bright hysteria. The Illuminations still draw the crowds, the run of lanterns and glitz enlivened these days by illuminated trams, 3D projections on the tower, and a multimedia festival of light. For most, though, it is still a slow trip along the front, faces pressed to car windows, a blur of lights beyond. Charlie Wen from Malaysia and Lan Yi Qin from China take pictures of themselves, lit by the glow of the illuminations. Autumn takes hold Buy your limited edition print of this image from theprintspace A seaside town does not fade into autumn. There is no pastoral descent of leaf-turn and woodsmoke. Instead there is the sudden curtain-drop of off-season, an ending too brutal to be wistful. Still some holidaymakers choose to linger – holding to the last warm days, the abandoned detritus of the summer months: rubber ring, skateboard, bucket, enjoying the oddness of this time, the hours turned mute and aimless. The sun sets on Bonfire night, the final day of the resort’s famous illuminations and the last day of the season. Sunlight fades over the Central pier. RNLI volunteers on their weekly practice session after nightfall. But now comes the sea mist and the shuttering, the dwindling of footsteps along the front. And the town feels the pull of its own tide, a soft withdrawal from the shore, ebbing inland, lying low, until the spring returns once more.

The allegations, which were shared by the Arrested Development actor on Twitter, follows similar claims of misconduct made against Seagal by three other women. “My final audition for a Steven Segal [sic] movie took place in his office,” De Rossi wrote. “He told me how important it was to have chemistry off-screen as he sat me down and unzipped his leather pants.” “I ran out and called my agent. Unfazed, she replied, ‘Well, I didn’t know if he was your type,’” she added. The Guardian has contacted Seagal’s representatives for comment on De Rossi’s claims. Following the incident, De Rossi’s wife, talk show host Ellen De Generes tweeted that she was “proud” of her. De Rossi’s allegations come in the wake a claim made against Seagal by former ER and The Good Wife actor Julianna Margulies, who on Saturday told SiriusXM’s Jenny Hutt that he had summoned her to a late-night audition at his hotel when she was 23. Margulies claimed that she had initially been told that a female casting director would be in attendance for the audition, but that when she arrived Seagal was alone. “I saw his gun; I had never seen a gun in real life. I got out of there unscathed … I don’t know how I got out of that hotel room. I sorta screamed my way out,” she claimed. Another actor, Lisa Guerrero, alleges that Seagal once conducted a 1996 audition with her for the film Fire Down Below while wearing only a silk robe. Following the audition, Guerrero’s manager told her that Seagal was willing to offer her the lead role in the film if she attended a “private rehearsal” with him. Guerrero, who is now a broadcaster, says she declined the offer. A similar claim was made by actor Rae Dawn Chong, who told The Wrap that Seagal wore only a bathrobe to a hotel audition in the 1980s and later allegedly exposed himself to her. Chong says that for several years after the incident, Seagal would leave “sex messages” on her answering machine. Seagal has not responded to any of these previous claims made against him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/nov/09/talking-horses-horse-racing-tips-thursday-9-november-jump-racing-newbury","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T11:03:04Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Thursday’s best bets as jump racing returns to Newbury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/09/talking-horses-horse-racing-tips-thursday-9-november-jump-racing-newbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/09/talking-horses-horse-racing-tips-thursday-9-november-jump-racing-newbury","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Thursday’s best bets as jump racing returns to Newbury","bodyText":"Jump racing returns to Newbury this afternoon for the first time since March – and for the only time before the ‘Ladbrokes Winter Carnival’ on 1 and 2 December, a meeting that pretty much everyone will refer to as ‘the one that used to be the Hennessy’ for the next 10 years at least. The Challow Hurdle and Betfair Hurdle are among the other highlights to look forward to over the coming months, but there is plenty to whet the appetite on Thursday afternoon’s card too, starting with the hurdles debut of Claimantakinforgan, third home in last season’s Champion Bumper at Cheltenham, in the opening race. Claimantakinforgan, a winning point-to-pointer earlier in his career, finished just under three lengths behind the ill-fated Fayonagh at Cheltenham on his fourth start in a bumper, before going on to finish fifth of 19 in the Aintree equivalent. It is decent form to bring to a race like today’s, but whether he should be quite as short as 8-13 to make a winning start in this sphere is another matter. He has just one serious rival according to the betting in Colin Tizzard’s Lostintranslation (12.40), but he was a close second on his own hurdling debut at Chepstow behind Dynamite Dollars, who followed up readily in a race at Exeter two days ago. At around 7-4, Lostintranslation could well give the favourite a serious race . The mares’ novice hurdle at 2.10 is a fascinating race, and it will be no great surprise if the winner ends up in the field for the mares’ novice at Cheltenham next March. Dame Rose, Cap Soleil – the winner of two Listed bumpers last season – and Nicky Henderson’s Countister (2.10) all have plenty to recommend them, but narrow preference is for the latter, the winner of two Grade Two bumpers in France last season. Henderson’s Beat That, a dual Grade One winner as a novice hurdler in the spring of 2014, makes his latest attempt to transfer his talent to fencing in the card’s Beginners’ Chase, having fallen on his last two outings in July and October. He would be difficult to beat at anything close to his best form but has not shown it for some time now and faces two very useful recruits from hurdles in Topofthegame (2.45) and Strong Pursuit. The former’s run at Ascot in February ties in well with some of the best novice form last season and he could well do even better over fences. Robinshill (1.50) fell at the final fence with the race at his mercy at Ludlow two weeks ago and should gain some compensation this afternoon, while the lightly raced Middle Kingdom (7.15) is the best bet on the Flat card at Chelmsford City this evening. The winner of both his starts to date, the first last November and the latest back in April, John Gosden’s War Front colt is clearly not an easy horse to get to the track but he has the potential to be better than a handicapper next year and should maintain his unbeaten record today.

I’ll Febreze the Blackpool bus before next Saturday, it smells a bit doggy. Have a great week! Ruth apologises for not taking Anton to Blackpool, and they promise to be friends for life. Anton’s got 15 years of friends for life, Christmas gift buying must be a nightmare. Ruth and Anton take their final spin to Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me. Anton attempts an ungainly lift, then Ruth straddles him Paso-style and everyone piles on. This is why we love Strictly. All the judges save Jonnie and Oti, thank goodness. Sanity prevails, and all is not lost. OK judges, this shouldn’t be a hard decision. Ruth and Anton are like those dinner party guests who ask for another drink even though you’re doing exaggerated yawns and have started loading the dishwasher. It’s time to send them home. If nothing else, think of Eamonn’s bum – he’s been wedged into that tiny studio chair for eight weeks. I still think this Foxtrot is rather lovely, and Jonnie is emoting much better this time round. His bum is still half way to Blackpool, but I’m fine with that. OK, dance-off time! I’d like to say the outcome of this is a given, but I learned my lesson last week. OK, Ruth’s already messed up, Eamonn’s clearly got the engine running. Jonnie, just turn up. You’ll be fine. Bruno doesn’t even bother suggesting any improvements for Ruth and Anton, he just recommends trying to hide the mistakes with ‘smoke and mirrors’. Harsh. Next week Debbie is going to be a Spice Girl, and Giovanni suggests she’s going to be ‘Cheeky Spice’. It’s the Spice Girl we never knew we needed. So who is joining Jonnie and Oti in tonight’s dance-off? Alexandra and Gorka are safe, along with Debbie and Giovanni and Gemma and Aljaz! Second couple in the dance off (NOT SUSAN NOT SUSAN) is RUTH AND ANTON! Oh thank goodness. Susan’s quite emosh about the whole business. Ah – just seen the Fanjo lift in slow-mo and Debbie’s holding Giovanni’s hand behind her back. STAND DOWN SHE’S NOT A PUPPET. Christ on a bike, what on earth is Shirley wearing? It looks like my plastic laundry basket. ANYWAY, Seal has turned into Michael Buble while we weren’t looking, and I am not down with this. Do Kiss From A Rose. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Seal. The 90s pop star, not the ones who were battered to death by Storm Brian in last week’s Countryfile, or the ones who will probably end up being Orca lunch on Blue Planet later. Being a seal is no picnic, let me tell you. My dad, my brother and my sister are all ex-military and marched at the Cenotaph today. I like to think I’m serving my country in other ways. Ooh, Davood is going to be James Bond next week! I love how Nadiya describes Blackpool as “the most amazing place”, like it’s actually the most amazing place. So who is heading north on the Blackpool Funbus, and who is the first couple in tonight’s dance-off? Davood and Nadiya are safe, along with Mollie and AJ (they look SO happy, can’t help but be happy for them), and Joe and Katya First couple in tonight’s dance-off: JONNIE AND OTI. Well, can’t say I’m hugely surprised, but now I’m worried that Ruth and Anton are safe. Did we get to the bottom of Nadiya’s outfit last night? Was it a last minute substitution for something that was actually appropriate for a cor-blimey Charleston? I guess we’ll never know. Last night on Strictly: a mixed bag, dance-wise. Mad scoring, shaky music choices, everything being hard for men and the first Argentine of the season. Highlights: The (brief) return of training footage. Lowlights: Knowing that next week it will all be a distant memory as celebs pretend there’s nothing more fun than eating chips in the rain. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess has skinned a penguin and put her arm in the wrong hole. Standard. And we’re off! Tonight’s pro dance is a Remembrance Day special featuring treadmill contempo-waft to an acoustic version of The Proclaimers ‘500 Miles’. It’s all rather beautiful and touching, nice work Strictly. Tonight’s Casual Countryfile Weatherperson is the dashing Stav Danaos AGAIN, but he’s ditched the school jumper in favour of Brokeback Mountain plaid and jeans. Grrr. Also, we need to talk about this Fanjo Lift from Debbie and Giovanni’s Salsa. I’ve watched it multiple times and I still can’t work out where Giovanni’s hand goes. Either Debbie has thighs of steel, or it’s a trap door magic trick that never made it to Paul’s show. Apologies for not including pictures from last night’s show, I know some people read the blog without watching the show and pics are a nice bonus. But for whatever reason there aren’t any shots from last night’s show in the Guardian picture archive. Will check again later. Evening all, and welcome back for the Strictly results! Last night’s show marked a turning point, I think, where we can start to see a glimmer of how the final on 16th December might shape up. Alexandra and Debbie will be there for sure, with the remaining spaces taken by two of Davood, Gemma and Joe. I can’t see Jonnie, Susan and Mollie going the distance to be honest (although I think Susan will last the longest), and barring utter madness Ruth should be leaving us this evening. We shall see. Kick off is at 7.20pm, so join me to find out who is off to Blackpool, and who is free to do their Christmas shopping in a leisurely fashion. Hopefully tonight’s events won’t be as dramatic as last week, I’m not sure I can cope. See you in a bit! And that’s it for tonight’s show! Thank you all for joining in and being amazing as usual; I’ll be back tomorrow at 7.20pm for the Results Show. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter/Instagram @heidistephens if you’d like to give me a wave. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday! Hx Time for a recap - my pseudo-votes this evening would go to Susan and Kevin (because I want them in Blackpool), Alexandra and Gorka (smoking) and Debbie and Giovanni (because god knows I want to look half that good on a dancefloor at 59). So the dancing is over, and the voting lines are open! Davood and Nadiya and Alexandra and Gorka are at the top of the leaderboard, with Anton and Ruth at the bottom. SURELY it’s time for them to go home? Could be Mollie and AJ in the dance-off again, or even Jonnie and Oti? Quite a few in the danger zone tonight, tonight was very much a game of two halves. Scores: 9,9,8,9 - a total of 35 for Debbie and Giovanni. Shirley thought it was on its way to being a championship Salsa, but there were a few mistakes. Bruno thought it was a first class ticket to Blackpool, Debbie was a saucy scrumpet (not a thing, Bruno). Craig wants whatever Debbie is on, it was ridiculous. Darcey loved the speed and complexity, and it was incredibly impressive. So Debbie is an optician, apropos of nothing. She’s definitely loosened up, and has good figure eight hips going on. Great control, fabulous spinning, her footwork gets a bit shifty in the middle but it’s fifty times better than her Cha Cha. She also looks like she’s having the time of her life, which I can totally get behind. My god, SO many lifts. OK, I’m a sucker for a Salsa and I really loved that. And finally, it’s Debbie and Giovanni! This week they’re dancing the Salsa to ‘I Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You’ by Boys Town Gang. Hopefully since has worked out how to soften her knees and get her hips in gear since their Cha Cha a few weeks back. If so, this Salsa could be rather fabulous. If not, Debbie could be in trouble. They’re going last, so I have high hopes. Scores: 4,5,6,6 - a total of 21 for Jonnie and Oti. Darcey thought Jonnie looked uncomfortable and his right shoulder was drifting, he was better a couple of weeks ago. Shirley thought there were some improvements, but other areas where Jonnie really needs to up his game. Bruno thought it was quite emotional, but Jonnie’s bum was sticking out and his hands were like shovels. Craig thought it was dull. Apparently the Foxtrot is also difficult for the man. DRINK. Oti looks glorious in custard, as per usual. It’s all quite dramatic and lovely to see a whiff of acting from Jonnie, but in hold he goes a bit dead-eyed. He also has issues with his posture, but I think we have to forgive him that since he only has one ankle, and he mentioned in the VT that this creates issues. Rather sweet, quite enjoyed that. It’s time for Jonnie and Oti! This week they’re dancing the Foxtrot to ‘Someone Like You’ by Adele. We’ve had dubious Adele experiences in the past (Danny and Oti’s ‘Set Fire To The Rain’ Showdance, for a start), so you might want to pop your earmuffs on. Scores: 5,6,6,5 - a total of 22 for Mollie and AJ. Craig thought some of Mollie’s shapes were quite awkward, but it had power and presence. Darcey liked the attitude and drama, but Mollie’s core strength is still letting her down. Shirley thought it looked a bit jerky and off-balance, and Bruno thought it was out of control, and the timing was off in places. Not a great night for Mollie and AJ. AJ’s lace-up trews are just wrong, but Mollie gives good cape. It’s all quite thrusty and Mollie’s frame is all over the shop - feels a bit bouncy for a Paso, but good intensity. AJ’s Paso face looks like he’s just stepped on some Lego. Bless. It’s time for Mollie and AJ (AKA NOT ASTON). This week they’re dancing the Paso Doble to ‘Layla’ by Derek and the Dominoes. Thinking about Paso passion from these two makes me feel a bit queasy, but let’s go with it. Scores: 9,9,10,10 - a total of 38 for Alexandra and Gorka. It’s getting busy at the top of the leaderboard. Bruno thought Alexandra was a magnificent creature, and her sequence of ganchos was sensational. Craig thought it was incredible, and Darcey loved the sensuality, but Alexandra needs to finish the line in her feet. Shirley was transported to a nightclub with just the two of them, it was superb. Alexandra has a massive fan, and Gorka looks frankly edible. Quite a lot of faffing on the stairs, but once they get into hold there’s some really nice footwork from Alexandra. I feel like her toes need to be more pointed, but I love the intensity and the clever bits, like walking on Gorka’s feet. Hot stuff, really loved that. Four couples left! Alexandra and Gorka! Tonight they’re dancing the first Argentine Tango of the series (DRINK) to ‘Mi Confession’ by Gotan Project. This is proper Argentine music, and if anyone can pull this off, it’s Alexandra. Her dancing does have a tendency to be a bit wild, can she master the control required for a slick and classy Argentine? Scores: 7,7,7,7 - a total of 28 for Gemma and Aljaz. Gemma is using dizziness (DRINK) to hug Aljaz for about an hour. Wouldn’t we all? Shirley liked the natural turns, but Gemma got into a shoe tangle on the fleckerl and there was too much rise and fall. It also needed more emotion from Gemma. Bruno was impressed with how Gemma kept the drive, but it was a bit like she was holding a laundry basket and it needed more performance. Craig thought Gemma struggled to keep up, but it lacked emotion in the body. Darcey was impressed with Gemma’s eye level despite the excessive spinning (DRINK), but not bad. Gemma’s dress is gorgeous, I want it. Much faffing with a suitcase, then they get into hold and it’s all rather charming. I’m pretty sure this is a perfectly decent Viennese from Gemma, but mostly I’m transfixed by Aljaz’s bum. I’M SORRY OK. Next up it’s Gemma and Aljaz! Tonight they’re dancing the Viennese Waltz to ‘You Don’t Have To Say You Love Me’ by Brenda Lee. Gemma has a bit of a Salsa Shambles last week, and is no doubt very happy to be back in Aljaz’s arms, even if it does involve large amounts of spinning. I’m loving the training VTs. Please keep them, it’s all we ask. Scores: 9,9,10,10 - a total of 38 for Davood and Nadiya. Darcey loved the speed and detail, and Davood held on to the character all the way through. Shirley loved the choreography and thought Davood was flawless. Bruno loved Davood’s versatility, and he’s getting better week by week. Craig thought it was A. MAZE. ING. Tens, anyone? So Nadiya is rather inappropriately dressed for selling veg. Lovely swivel from Davood – he’s a very clean dancer, with lovely transitions between the lifts. The backward lift looked a bit ropey, but bags of personality from Davood. Would have liked a bit more basic swivel, but really enjoyed that. Next up it’s Davood and Nadiya! This week they’re dancing the Charleston to ‘The Lambeth Walk’ by The Pasadena Roof Orchestra. This could be marvellous, or it could be cor-blimey-guvnor-up-the-apples-and-pears dreadful. I’m almost sad there isn’t a VT for this one, because Davood explaining east end culture/pearly kings and queens/cockney rhyming slang to Ukrainian Nadiya might have been rather charmingly bonkers. Scores: 4,5,4,5 - a total of 18 for Ruth and Anton. Craig thought the side-by-side at the beginning lacked style and charisma, and then Anton messed up before it all got a bit trotty. Darcey agrees it lacked glide, and Ruth was out of her depth. Shirley thought it was too quick for a Foxtrot, and it wasn’t her favourite. Bruno thought they lost the trot and it turned into a gallop, and the timing was all over the shop. Oh do be quiet, Anton. There are hats and canes, presumably to distract from Ruth’s lower body. They are out of hold for weeks (TEN SECOND RULE), and then it’s a masterclass in wobbly dressage. Ruth has definitely improved, but I fear her time has come. It’s time for Ruth and Anton! This week they’re dancing the Foxtrot to ‘Mack The Knife’ by Bobby Darin. Still can’t believe we’re in Week EIGHT and Ruth and Anton are still here. I blame Brexit. Scores: 7,8,9,9 - a total of 33 for Joe and Katya. OK then. And there it is. DRINK. Bruno loved the perfect balance of presentation and interaction – great lines and hips, but Joe’s hands were odd. Craig thought it was a bit jolty and the footwork was a bit pigeon-toed, but it was pretty good (for a man). Darcey thought it was earthy and well controlled, and it had fabulous lines. Shirley still thinks Joe is the dark horse of the competition, and he did well on the Rumba basics. Katya is wearing a shredded muppet, and there is much posing. Pretty decent hip action from Joe, despite flappy arms and a slightly odd Rumba gurn. We’ve definitely seen worse. Still, Rumba is hard for the man. Next up it’s Joe and Katya! Tonight they’re dancing the Rumba to ‘One’ by U2 and Mary J. Blige. After years of being on the fence (not really), I’d like to make it very clear that I hate the Rumba and it needs to be quietly retired. It looks weird, nobody is ever any good at it, and we all feel a bit icky afterwards. Eamonn Holmes is in the audience. Nice of him to finally turn up. Scores: 5,6,8, - a total of 27 for Susan and Kevin. Bit mean, Craig. Shirley loved how Susan danced from her heart, and she didn’t miss a step. Susan still needs to work on her frame, but she’s come huge strides. Bruno loved the drama and Susan’s precision timing. Craig is still bothered by Susan’s posture and it lacked a little attack, and Susan’s face looked in pain. Darcey loved the focus and drama, but Susan loses her frame when she gets emotional. Well I rather like this – nice footwork and timing from Susan, and I love that she’s taking it so seriously rather than playing it for laughs. Some nice drama too, and not a stomp in sight. Good work Susan. Is it possible for a rendition of Firework to be simultaneously terrible, and yet still better than actual Katy Perry? Yes, yes it is. First up it’s Susan and Kevin! Tonight they’re dancing the Tango to ‘Firework’ by Katy Perry. I loved their Jive last week (incidentally my mum is Not A Fan, but we glossed over this), and am hoping Susan can deliver a Tango that’s fierce and dramatic without being stompy. AJ has his chest out. Poor lad, he’ll catch his death. Darcey’s dress today appears to feature insulation tape, and she’s going for an earring record again. Her earlobes are heading south for winter. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a torn white coffin lining, Claudia in half a tuxedo. TOTAL SHOULDER COUNT: all shoulders on show. And we’re off! Last week on Strictly, there was dancing. Some of it was good, some of it is still giving me nightmares. Inexplicably, Aston and Janette are no longer in the competition, because who the hell knows I can’t even. This week: the road to Blackpool. DRINK DRINK DRINK. I did not get a Strictly Pointless answer. The SHAME. My answers: Carol Kirkwood, Simon Rimmer, Chris Hollins. STRICTLY COME DANCING AS A POINTLESS CATEGORY! OK Sooty and a random man has turned up on Pointless and things have all got a bit weird. I’m a bit proud that I knew Sacred Trust was by One True Voice on Pointless. Pop Stars The Rivals was amazing. ALSO, apparently it was mentioned on It Takes Two yesterday that all the VTs tonight are going to be training footage only, which makes me very happy. It’s only taken nine years of moaning. NEXT STOP: please stop Tess manhandling the celebs and talking over the judges. THANKS. Has Sarah Greene had a drink? This week’s Strictly Come Bingo – a swig of whatever warms your cockles for any mention of the following: It’s the first Argentine Tango of the season Spinning around makes me feel really sick Rumba is hard for a man At this stage in the competition we’re looking for *insert random thing* I’ve dreamed of going to Blackpool since *insert made up point in history* Meanwhile on Pointless, we’ve learned that Dick and Dom (aka Primark Trevor and Simon) never work apart. Who would want Dick without Dom? Evening all, and welcome to this week’s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! It’s the last week before Blackpool, with the remaining eight Strictly couples battling it out for a seat on the glitterbus up the M6 to the Tower Ballroom. Since we appear to have entered a dystopian hell where Ruth Langsford may well make it to Blackpool and Aston Merrygold definitely won’t, I’m not going to attempt to predict who might not make it, my fortune-telling days are over. Yesterday I had my standard mid-season Strictly catch-up with my mum, who has Strong Opinions on All Matters Strictly. Aston was her favourite and she might not even bother watching any more (yeah OK mum), Alexandra’s limbs are too floppy and she needs to stop shrieking, and Anton Du Beke needs to retire somewhere a really long way away from her TV. Joe is her new favourite, but Debbie might win if Latin isn’t her undoing. She’s also not a huge fan of Shirley, who needs to make her mind up whether she’s scoring technique or entertainment value, because it’s getting right on her wick. Thanks mum. As usual I’ll be here from 6.45pm to cast a beady eye over every wobbly Waltz and ropey Rumba; all you have to do is add your wit and wisdom in the comment box below. I’ve been painting bedrooms all day and am currently camped out in a very dusty kitchen with Dulux Frosted Dawn in my hair, so feel free to sprinkle bonus glitter, because glamour is not my middle name right now. Gather snacks, booze, pets, poppies and children, and I’ll see you in a bit!"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/09/gay-men-attitude-masculinity-sexuality-women","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T10:53:59Z","webTitle":"What gay men’s attitudes to masculinity have taught me about womanhood | Matt Cain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/gay-men-attitude-masculinity-sexuality-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/gay-men-attitude-masculinity-sexuality-women","fields":{"headline":"What gay men’s attitudes to masculinity have taught me about womanhood","bodyText":"Masculinity is in crisis. That message resonates loud and clear from the mainstream media. Hardly a day goes by without straight men debating what it means to be a man now that women are becoming more powerful and male privilege is being eroded. Over the past fortnight, some have even whined about the widespread outrage ignited by women who have been sexually exploited finally taking a stand against their oppressors. Well, first of all, they need to get over themselves. But what about gay men and our relationship with our masculinity? Why are we usually left out of the discussion about what it means to be a man? Because it strikes me that our relationship with our masculinity is much more complicated, intense and potentially troubling. Yes, as a gay man I enjoy the privilege of being male in a patriarchal society that for some reason values my genitals above a woman’s. But I’ve spent much of my life being made to feel like I’m less of a man for being gay. Which is why I commissioned a survey for Attitude magazine about masculinity. Some 5,000 readers responded, and some of the feelings they expressed are surprising. A staggering 69% of them said that, like me, they’ve been made to feel less of a man for being gay, bisexual or queer. Perhaps even more worrying is that 41% of them said that at some point they’ve thought they are less of a man because of their sexuality. If we look at the reasons why this feeling might exist, a shocking 92% of those surveyed said they think effeminate gay men are still made fun of in the mainstream media. And 68% of them said they’ve been on the receiving end of homophobic abuse that has specifically ridiculed their femininity. Like so many gay men, I can remember the limp wrists, mincing walks and camp impressions the straight boys did of me at school – although these can function as insults only if they’re based on an understanding that being female is somehow inferior to being male. Perhaps unsurprisingly, more than half of those surveyed said they’ve tried to adapt their behaviour or appearance to seem more masculine while around straight people. Perhaps even more intriguing, though, is the 24% who have tried to come across as more masculine when communicating with other gay men on a date or a dating app. This shows just how complicated our relationship with masculinity can be, and suggests that our own insecurity about feeling like less of a man can be so extreme that some of us won’t relax even among others who have been subjected to the same experience. It also hints at another layer of complication: that we’ve been made to feel disappointed in our own lack of masculinity while being encouraged to find signs of traditional masculinity attractive in others. An incredible 71% of those surveyed say they’ve been turned off by signs of femininity in a man. Clearly it isn’t just mainstream society that is repulsed by femininity – gay men are too. And I’m intrigued by the idea that still persists, whereby a gay man who is active in the bedroom is considered to be more of a man then his passive sexual partner. “Who’s the man and who’s the woman?” is a question many gay men have been asked about our sexual relationships, although arguably this is much less commonplace than it used to be. Yet 75% of our readers admit to making assumptions about someone’s preferred sexual role based on their perceived masculinity or effeminacy. This suggests why gay men who prefer the passive role sexually are often made to feel ashamed of this: because they see it as being linked to femininity. There it is again, good old-fashioned misogyny. Who’d have thought it would be the one clear message that would emerge from a survey about gay men’s relationship with their masculinity? When I started work on this issue, I expected to be dealing with a subject of intense interest to our gay readers but of little relevance outside our community. What I discovered was the opposite. And the conclusions have left me with an increased respect for women. Because yes, being gay can be tough. But at least we’re men. Just how difficult must it be to actually be a woman, and to go through life every day being made to feel inferior? I feel a new sense of privilege that I’ll never have to find out. • Matt Cain is editor-in-chief of Attitude.

England fell victim to the most obvious of those, losing three wickets to the second new ball in the last hour, sullying what was nearly a commanding start to the inaugural pink-ball Women’s Ashes Test. Shuffling Sarah Taylor to No6 looked a masterstroke when she entered not long into the final session. She carved, flicked and drove her way to 29 stylish runs after walking out the middle with a smile on her face and doing largely as she pleased. Her stay came to an untimely end, caught and bowled in ridiculous circumstances when her chip back to Ellyse Perry was caught despite the fast bowler not seeing it until the ball hit her in the follow through. It was the middle wicket to fall in the collapse of three wickets for 13 runs. The response of Australia was to break out into rapturous laughter, knowing how important it was to get rid of Taylor before she had a chance to cash in against an old ball. That is another day-night Test match maxim: when the going is good, do not miss out. To that end, with excellent conditions and a hard pitch on offer at this stunning location, Heather Knight had no hesitation in electing to bat when winning the toss. There was no hurry. England’s opener Tammy Beaumont said the goal was to nullify the swing early on, and with her partner, Lauren Winfield, they did that successfully. But the first time the latter lost her head she lost her wicket, lashing at a wide delivery from Tahlia McGrath to be well caught by Nicole Bolton in the covers. It brought Knight to join Beaumont, the captain immediately upping the tempo. She gave Amanda Wellington a stern welcome to Test cricket, crunching the leg-spinner to the rope at point twice in her first over. Steering England to the first break – the shorter of the two when pink-ball Tests are played in Australia – the pair got moving in the third hour of the day, pushing England beyond 100 and both players to chanceless half-centuries. For Beaumont’s part, she was as careful as Winfield early on but was driving with fluency now. Meanwhile, Knight raised the bat moments after playing her best shot, clipping Megan Schutt through midwicket with perfect execution, the 100-run stand between the two raised shortly thereafter. It marked the first time that two England players in the top three had made it to 50 in the same Test innings against Australia since 1968. With lower scores typically recorded in women’s Tests, it was developing into a formidable platform – especially with the home side having to bat last on a track that looks likely to favour turn as the match matures. But Wellington bounced back to ensure Beaumont’s afternoon in the middle would not stretch into night, catching her outside edge on 70 with a lovely piece of flight and turn. Knight fell 20 minutes later, trapped in front for 62 when missing a sweep. It was a line-ball call but there is no DRS in place for this series. Georgia Elwiss was brought back to bolster the middle order in favour of Jenny Gunn and she set about digging in, with Nat Sciver for company. The two got through a tough period either side of the final break but, just at the point where Sciver looked set to find some timing, she was the second to fall leg-before to Jess Jonassen. Elwiss never found any such momentum but did have patience. Yet it was her mistake that set the final flurry of wickets in motion, attempting to hoick McGrath but instead only top-edging when she was on 27. Perry said the return catch will stand out in the memory. “My head went down and I lost all sight of it,” she said. “With Sarah Taylor you are happy getting her any way possible. But it had nothing to do with my skill or ability. It was pure luck.” Beaumont noted it had been hard going in the final session but was happy with England’s overall position. “It’s quite evenly poised,” the top-scorer said. “It’s getting slower and lower already, so as it goes on hopefully looking into the fourth innings that’ll be good for us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global/2017/nov/14/guardian-weekly-letters-global-wealth","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-14T11:59:30Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 17 November 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/nov/14/guardian-weekly-letters-global-wealth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2017/nov/14/guardian-weekly-letters-global-wealth","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 17 November 2017","bodyText":"Age of cancerous capitalism The intensifying concentration of the wealth of the world’s super-rich is not so much a return to the US Gilded Age of the turn of the 20th century as it is the emergence of a global Cancerous Age of 21st-century capitalism (World’s super-rich are now worth $6tn, 3 November). The cancerous dynamic is evident in a number of ways: The inherent need for unending economic growth is increasingly outgrowing ecological constraints. The relatively secure jobs in manufacturing associated with the Gilded Age that helped to create the so-called middle-class are being destroyed and either not replaced or replaced by insecure and lower-paid jobs, as well as by an increasing number of the working poor. The now dominant role of financial capital in the global economy ensures that the ever-increasing growth in debt – along with the volatility of movements of capital – is the new, uncontrollable normal. The growth of inequalities between nations shows no sign of slowing down, and is intensifying. Just as a cancer in the body involves the destructive growth of tumours, so capitalism exhibits the same uncontrollable symptoms. It will take more than a rerun of a Roosevelt New Deal or a Beveridge welfare state to change this reality. It will take the economic, social and cultural equivalents of the surgery, radiology and chemotherapy used to deal with bodily cancers. Even then, of course, success is not guaranteed. Stewart Sweeney Adelaide, South Australia • The philanthropic gifts made by the super-rich seem to be directed at things that enrich their own lives. Art galleries, sports teams. No mention of housing for homeless people, donations to women’s refuges or support for school lunch programmes in poor neighbourhoods. It seems that what counts as philanthropy when you’re a billionaire is getting “stars, sheikhs … all in the same room talking about the ball” – spending their vast wealth on their own fun. Susan Grimsdell Auckland, New Zealand Conspiracy theories abound Jonathan Freedland (3 November) rightly points out that conspiracy theories “only distract us from the real threats we face”. How well proven by Carole Cadwalladr on the same page, who attributes Trump’s election victory and Brexit to – what else? – a conspiracy. More or less clandestine interventions to favour one side in these two contests did in all likelihood occur. However, considering them as the main factors in the outcome illustrates perfectly Freedland’s point. The elephant in the room is the rejection by vast segments of the electorate of anyone associated, rightly or wrongly, with the establishment, compared to which foreign interference is a small mouse indeed. But the Weekly keeps addressing in great detail the mouse, while neglecting the elephant. Giorgio Ranalli Ottawa, Ontario, Canada • An article suggesting that Trump, Assange, Farage and Bannon are linked in a clandestine network was placed on the same page as one claiming that conspiracy theories are a dangerous diversion. Was this a comment on the first article? Stephanie Betz Kambah, ACT, Australia Libraries are a precious asset Your back-page essay by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett on the need for libraries (3 November) speaks volumes. Anyone who is deaf to the growing popularity of libraries in an era of advancing technology has obviously not visited one recently. How else can one account for the 34 million users of New York City’s 212 branches in 2016, or the almost 10,000 visitors each day to Montreal’s bilingual Grande Bibliothèque, touted as the most frequented library in North America? Besides offering free, quiet and comfortable havens stocked with hard-copy and digital resources that promote literacy, libraries exist as community hubs where young and old can meet to share the riches that their hard-earned taxes have provided them. It is more than ingenious, then, that in New York there is a move to enlarge local branches and build low-rent housing in the floors above them, thereby tackling two of the biggest problems of urban life: limited access to lifelong learning, and the burden of homelessness and poverty. Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett failed to note that the biggest advantage of the public library is the restriction on the borrowing time for a book to three weeks (my Canadian experience). Far from a negative restriction, this forces me to begin reading soon after withdrawing the book and to finish it in the time available. Many books I have bought remain in my bookshelf for months or years because there is no pressure to read them. Tim Moore Ottawa, Ontario, Canada Briefly • Reading Everyone is distracted all of the time (27 October) I experienced an emotion I had felt before. About a year ago a young friend of mine at university told me that a mutual friend of ours (also at university) had passed her driving test and received 83 Facebook “likes”. On the same day another young person in the same group had finished chemotherapy. She received 11 “likes” and one handwritten postcard. I was overwhelmed with sadness, both then and now.

Then there are those that were always going to cause harm but turn out to be more damning than even the policy’s architects could have imagined. Increasingly, the benefit freeze is the poster child for the latter category. The government is rightly coming under increasing pressure to halt the roll-out of universal credit. But lifting this freeze in benefit levels should be as much of priority. In the 2015 budget, then chancellor George Osborne put in motion a freeze on most working-age benefits for four years, from housing benefit and tax credits, to employment support allowance and child benefit. In other words, on the “top-up wage” for the mum working all hours as a care assistant but still struggling to pay the rent, or the safety net for the cancer patient temporarily too ill to hold down a job. The human impact of a policy like this is obvious: when benefits don’t keep up with inflation, families already on some of the lowest incomes in the country are left struggling even harder to meet basic living costs. And because increases in inflation have been greater than expected, this freeze is biting harder than even the Conservatives imagined. Inflation will have eroded in real terms an estimated £0.9bn more a year from the budget by 2020 than ministers intended – and a staggering £4.9bn in total. The result is huge chunks of the population suddenly finding they can’t afford the weekly food shop, to put the heating on in the winter, or pay the rent. Over the next year, 7.3 million children – that’s half of all families with children – will be hit by this freeze. And we can add to that 2.4 million disabled people. According to the Resolution Foundation, by 2018-19, families could be up to £315 worse off a year due to the policy. It will also mean a widening income gap between rich and poor, with a year-on-year fall in income for the lowest earners – for the first time ever. By the time the freeze is scheduled to end in 2021, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) calculates that almost half a million more people will be living in poverty as a result. To put that in context, that means the benefit freeze will be the single biggest policy driver behind Britain’s expected rise in poverty over the next four years. That the majority of these families are actually in work feels like a particularly hollow joke considering the “shirkers v workers” ideology that underpins the benefit freeze. At the height of the Conservatives’ “hardworking families” rhetoric, the introduction of the benefit freeze spoke to the growing demonisation of social security and the people who rely on it. Osborne claimed at the time that freezing benefits would “make Britain fairer” – the implication being that, in the contest between “deserving” workers and “undeserving” welfare claimants, freezing benefits would somehow push things in the former’s favour. It was a nasty divide-and-rule tactic: perpetuating the false ideas that benefit claimants are skiving off employment - when many of them are actually in low-paid work - and that the best way to ensure work pays isn’t to raise wages, but to cut benefits. A couple of years on, while the language around welfare has changed, the drive to shrink social security is as strong as ever. The Child Poverty Action Group and the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank found this week that families are being left thousands of pounds worse off a year due to continual benefit cuts. After all, the benefit freeze isn’t happening in isolation. The same people having their benefit frozen are likely also facing direct cuts to levels of universal credit work allowances, tax credits, and disability or housing benefits. Things are only set to get harder. The uncertainty of Brexit will likely further impact families living without economic security: the National Institute Economic Review warned this week that households will have to find up to £930 more a year for basics like meat, vegetables, and clothes if Britain walks away from Brexit talks without a trade deal, with poorer families with children and unemployed people the worst hit. Even without taking into account Brexit, the JRF calculate that by 2020, a decade of benefits not keeping up with prices means low-income families will have lost the equivalent of about a third of their annual shopping bill, whilst Shelter warns more than a million households could be forced out of their homes by then if the housing benefit freeze remains in place as planned. The JRF calculates that if the government ended the freeze early it would prevent almost 400,000 fewer people from being in poverty in 2020 – the majority of those being working families or those with children. And just lifting the freeze in universal credit, while increasing child benefit in line with inflation, would result in 300,000 fewer children in poverty. It’s easy to lose sight of the fact that behind each number is a real family – one falling into hardship at the hands of outdated, rotten government policy. If Theresa May’s ever-weakening government has any desire to help her “just managing families”, they’ll use this month’s budget to lift the freeze on benefits. If not, it simply underlines the extent to which the Conservatives – fully aware that inflation has made the effects of the freeze have been made even more pernicious than expected – are simply abandoning people without enough income to live on. • Frances Ryan writes the Guardian’s Hardworking Britain series"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/13/future-history-masha-gessen-lost-kingdom-plokhy-house-government-slezkine-stalin-kotkin","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-13T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"‘Why the response to the centenary is muted’ – the Russian Revolution and its legacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/13/future-history-masha-gessen-lost-kingdom-plokhy-house-government-slezkine-stalin-kotkin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/13/future-history-masha-gessen-lost-kingdom-plokhy-house-government-slezkine-stalin-kotkin","fields":{"headline":"‘Why the response to the centenary is muted’ – the Russian Revolution and its legacy","bodyText":"There was a time, not long after the cold war ended, when it looked as though the vast investments the west had made in Kremlinology were about to be liquidated. Having failed to foresee communism’s collapse, the west’s Soviet experts faced grim prospects in a world that had apparently left them behind. How fast things change: today, Russia is back in the news, reprising for the internet era its familiar role as antihero to the freedom-loving west. Putin’s muscle-flexing has produced an old-fashioned territorial struggle in Ukraine and Crimea; the Kremlin’s newfangled cyberwar has generated a firestorm in the US and the results of the 2016 presidential election, far from calming relations between the two old superpowers, have made them tenser than they have been for years. Yet amid this drama, the response to the centenary of the Bolshevik Revolution has been curiously muted and not only in Russia itself. Fifty years ago, there was an outpouring of high-calibre work that testified to the west’s desire to understand its adversary. This year, there has been relatively little. One reason for this is obvious. Communism itself, as a system of thought counterposed to capitalism and private property, is more or less dead in Russia and moribund outside. And with communism gone, anti-communism has become meaningless. But not only communism. Socialism more broadly suffered a heavy blow after 1989. Most leftist parties tacked sharply to the centre, drawn by the dream of a new third way and only austerity economics has done anything to staunch the trend. There is, I think, another reason for the strangulated response to 1917 and that is that the things that seemed to matter in the Bolshevik Revolution a couple of decades ago are no longer all that important today. Do we really care what the causes of the revolution were, now that we no longer believe in revolution at all? Does it matter how Lenin seized power or whether there was ever the chance of a western-style liberal democracy taking hold in Russia? To some, Russia still remains a way of thinking about liberalism, even if as a counter-example. Masha Gessen’s excellent and readable The Future Is History approaches the Putin years in this way, as a story of totalitarianism and repression returning after yet another brief moment of liberal hope. But given the pessimism that underlies her account, it isn’t really surprising that there seems to be zero interest in all the noble revolutions that didn’t happen in 1917, whether liberal or Menshevik. In Serhii Plokhy’s Lost Kingdom, the Bolshevik years become merely one episode in a longer story of Russian nationalism. Boiling this down chiefly to the question of Russia’s tortured relationship with its western borderlands, Plokhy’s study reads like a background briefing on the current Ukraine crisis. Both books cast Russia as constantly succumbing to the totalitarian temptation and posit a western alternative that is always just out of reach. If we want to try to get a handle on what totalitarianism once meant in Russia, we need to turn to two gargantuan studies focusing on the Stalin years. Yuri Slezkine has written a mammoth book about a mammoth building, the so-called House of Government, which was constructed at the start of the 1930s in central Moscow to house much of the new ruling elite. More than 2,000 people lived in it and the book takes well over a thousand pages to tell their stories. A sprawling “saga of the Russian Revolution”, it has at its core a remarkably interesting subject: the domestic habits and habitat of the men and women who were turning Russia into a socialist society. Architecture often tells the truth where words lie and what was so striking about the House of Government were the assumptions built into its design. Its architect described it as “transitional”, but “traditional” might be a better word. Scores of prison-hardened former underground activists entered middle-age domesticity with their wives and children in rooms lined with handmade bookshelves packed with the treasures of world literature, elegantly furnished dining rooms, linen tablecloths and even space for a bunk bed for the maid. They read [incessantly], played tennis and attended the theatre. In many ways, their lifestyle was not hugely different from their equivalents in the Dakota on Central Park West in New York, except that their maid’s family might be starving in Ukraine rather than living in poverty in Alabama or Oklahoma. This was totalitarianism committed to family life. Yet at the same time the old revolutionary ethics retained their force. Slezkine argues that Bolshevism was a kind of millenarian sect, but makes the point so often and at such length that by the end it no longer seems to explain very much. For a more overarching and comprehensive understanding of what drove one old Bolshevik, the place to turn is Stephen Kotkin’s Stalin: Waiting for Hitler. This is the second volume in his projected biographical trilogy and it is a masterpiece, surely one of the most remarkable books on 20th-century history to have been published in many years. It is not only the depth of research that takes the breath away; it is the scale and range of Kotkin’s framing of his subject and the acuity of his observations. The author made his name with a pioneering study of a Stalinist steel town but said little in it about the terror. In this book, the terror looms over everything and Stalin owns it. Never mind millenarianism – Stalin had been a believer for years before the terror – nor psychopathology, Kotkin is categorical: what led to the death of millions was the impact upon Stalin of a style of government, a conception of his own role in the building of socialism and the country’s geopolitical predicament. Kotkin’s staccato, episodic narrative is enlivened by grim humour. What we get is the USSR as Stalin saw it; the view from his office in the Little Corner, his private offices in the Kremlin, or from the dacha in Sochi, where he liked to spend weeks at a time in the summer reading dozens of reports, or taking the waters. This is history as chronicle, a daringly old-fashioned genre for a very contemporary story, like turning the pages of an agenda as the files cross the despot’s desk. At one point, Stalin falls ill for some days. Nothing happens. The narrative resumes once he is better. Suspicious of his own guards, he nevertheless goes on a spur-of-the-moment jaunt on the Moscow subway, nearly giving his entourage a heart attack. Never seriously under threat of assassination, he comes close to death when a conscientious border guard opens fire on his boat as they are sailing on the Black Sea. This is the story of the things Stalin cared about, which means thick accounts of NKVD infighting, a commitment to Marxist theory and tank technology and, above all, a view of the world that encompasses the threats besetting Soviet socialism from inside and out, east and west. The volume ends on a cliffhanger, a tour de force reconstruction of the last hours before Hitler invades on 22 June 1941. Tyranny on a world scale; a war that would provide its greatest test: the Bolshevik Revolution has things to teach us yet.

That little contretemps at Old Trafford was awkwardly timed bearing in mind Young’s subsequent return to a new-look England squad where Alli is now one of the key players. As it is, the two have not yet crossed paths because of Alli’s withdrawal but Young struck a conciliatory tone and even tried to argue his Instagram post after the game against Spurs – “talk is cheap” – was not, as widely perceived, intended for the benefit of the younger player. “It would be nice to see him,” he said. “Things happen on football pitches. Once the game is finished, you don’t need to talk afterwards. That’s just how it is. He’s a confident player and that gives him that edge.” Young has certainly not come back into the England fold to pick an argument with anyone and there was a smile when it was put to him that Alli still did not own a championship winner’s medal. Young had – according to every lip-reading expert in the business – told Alli to come back when he had won the Premier League. “He hasn’t, yet,” Young volunteered. Now 32, Young is the senior citizen of Gareth Southgate’s squad, among the outfield players anyway, almost 10 years to the week since he made his England debut as a half-time substitute in a 1-0 friendly victory against Austria in Vienna. Young has gone on to win 30 caps but none since a goalless World Cup qualifier in Ukraine in September 2013, after which Roy Hodgson decided he could do without a player who was unable to hold down a regular place in his favoured wing spot for a succession of United managers. Instead, Young is listed as a defender in England’s squad, in line with his new position as a wing-back, and sounds as if he wants to make up for lost time. “I’d prefer it if I was playing further up the pitch [for United] but I’ve been able to adapt and play as a left-back or a right-back and as a wing-back. I’ve been enjoying football, playing well every time I put on the shirt and I feel like I deserve the call-up.” Young’s four-year exile certainly does not appear to have affected his confidence on the back of an impressive run in United’s back four. Southgate operates with a different system but Young has shown how versatility is increasingly regarded as a useful trait in the modern game. “The manager is talking about a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 and I feel like I can step into that role. I’ve shown I deserve to be in the England squad but I don’t just want a place in the squad, I want to be in the team. “I never once shut the door on England or thought the door was shut on myself. When you have the chance to represent your country it’s an honour to pull on an England shirt. That’s why I will never retire until my legs tell me they can’t run any more. I’m delighted to be back.” Young watched the last World Cup on holiday in Dubai – “it was disappointing not to be involved” – but his absence did not generate a huge amount of public sympathy, bearing in mind his reputation at the time as a diver. Young appears to have removed, or at least reduced, that side to his game but there was a time when Sir Alex Ferguson stated publicly he would address his own concerns with the player. “A lot of people talk about diving and whatnot but it’s just one of those things,” Young said, as though wearily accustomed to being asked about it. “If the referee gives a foul then it’s a foul. That’s how I see it. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and anyone can say anything but, no, I don’t dive.” Whether you choose to believe him or not, Young must be doing something right, bearing in mind that if he plays against either Germany on Friday or Brazil on Tuesday, Southgate will have become the fifth manager after Hodgson, Stuart Pearce, Fabio Capello and Steve McClaren to select him. Yet it was strange that Young also repeatedly made reference to having played for only three managers at United when it is, in fact, four – Ferguson, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and now José Mourinho (or five if Ryan Giggs is counted). Young did not elaborate but mentioned it being three so many times it left the suspicion that perhaps he was not too fond of either Moyes or Van Gaal. Should we read anything into it? “You can do if you want,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/18/blind-date-max-thomas","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-18T06:00:24Z","webTitle":"Blind date: ‘There was more chemistry in a GCSE English exam’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/18/blind-date-max-thomas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/18/blind-date-max-thomas","fields":{"headline":"Blind date: ‘There was more chemistry in a GCSE English exam’","bodyText":"Max on Thomas What were you hoping for?

Officials from the Competition and Markets Authority seized information about the companies’ relationship with prominent ticket touts, who harvest tickets for in-demand events and sell them via the two sites. The raids are key to an investigation launched last year into whether ticketing companies are giving fans enough information about their tickets, such as who the seller is and whether buyers could be denied entry due to undisclosed restrictions on resale. Investigators are also looking at whether touts benefit from “connections” at resale websites to gain advantage over genuine fans trying to get hold of tickets. The CMA is understood to have issued an “information notice” to four ticket resale companies, also including GetMeIn and Seatwave, demanding details of any relationships with major touts and turnover from ticket sales. According to sources familiar with the investigation, GetMeIn and Seatwave complied but Swiss-based Viagogo and StubHub, which is owned by online auction website eBay, refused to hand over the information voluntarily. The regulator, whose powers also allow it to obtain search warrants, later raided StubHub’s office on Tottenham Court Road in London and Viagogo’s office on Cannon Street in early August. Officials are understood to have seized data relating to StubHub’s “top seller” programme, which manages its relationships with industrial-scale ticket touts selling tickets at vast mark-ups. According to StubHub’s Top Seller Handbook, touts who make more than $250,000 of sales per year are entitled to benefits including discounts on seller fees, which increase as their sales rise. Top sellers can also get access to a password-protected web platform, where they can access tools to help them manage their listings on multiple sites and upload dozens of tickets at a time for sale. Earlier this year, eBay bought Ticket Utils, a company that produces software to enable “large sellers on StubHub to enjoy a best-in-class solution for inventory management, ticket distribution and internationalisation of their inventory”. StubHub said its Top Seller programme was designed to “incentivise trusted sellers to sell their inventory on our platform, including lower fees and technical support”. It said the programme followed all relevant laws and eliminated “fraudulent or illegal activity on our site.” The site has previously come under fire from a parliamentary committee for allowing touts to sell tickets without complying with UK laws that demand sellers provide information such as the row and seat number. StubHub said 98% of its sellers declared themselves to be genuine consumers rather than touts, but said it did not “police or monitor” the claims and was under no obligation to do so. A spokesperson for the CMA declined to comment on the raids, which came nearly a year after it opened a probe into “suspected breaches of consumer protection law in the online secondary tickets market”. In March this year, it provided an update on its work, saying it was looking into whether tickets sold to fans could deny them entry to venues, as artists and promoters try to prevent large-scale touting. The CMA is also working alongside National Trading Standards, which is understood to be conducting a separate investigation into ticket touting known as Operation Electra. The organisation was given a ringfenced budget to investigate ticket touting last year as part of a package of measures aimed at curbing the secondary ticketing market. A spokesperson declined to comment on investigations but said: “National Trading Standards remains concerned that consumers are being left out of pocket after using secondary ticketing websites to purchase tickets. “With concerts and events increasingly refusing to accept resold tickets we’d strongly advise people take steps to protect themselves by only buying tickets from official sellers, most of which are working with the authorities to help ensure more tickets are made available to genuine fans through official vendors.” StubHub said: “We understand the CMA investigation is ongoing and therefore await the outcome of this.” Viagogo did not return requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/nov/10/sir-richard-branson-hypocrite-support-saudi-arabia-tourism-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"Sir Richard Branson labelled a hypocrite over support for Saudi tourism scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/nov/10/sir-richard-branson-hypocrite-support-saudi-arabia-tourism-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/nov/10/sir-richard-branson-hypocrite-support-saudi-arabia-tourism-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Sir Richard Branson labelled a hypocrite over support for Saudi tourism scheme","bodyText":"Sir Richard Branson has been accused of hypocrisy after investing in a luxury tourism project in Saudi Arabia despite his track record of speaking out against human rights abuses in the country. The Virgin Group founder has backed a project to develop 50 islands over a 34,000 sq km (13,127 sq miles) stretch of the Red Sea, creating an estimated 35,000 jobs. But human rights campaigners are concerned that work on the project is likely to be carried out by migrant labour from Asia working under the kafala system, which has been likened to slavery. Under kafala, workers brought to the Middle East are bound to their employers and cannot leave a job without the permission of their bosses. In some cases, passports and wages are withheld by employers. Branson, who has been vocal about ending modern-day slavery, has criticised Saudi Arabia over its human rights record. The British billionaire said last year: “In countries like Saudi Arabia, enforced disappearances and unlawful prosecution are just two of the most serious ways in which the right to speak out peacefully without discrimination is being violated.” Nicholas McGeehan, an expert on migrant workers in the Gulf region and former researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said Branson was guilty of “gratuitous, self-serving hypocrisy”. “He may take a little bump on his reputation for getting into bed with the Saudis, but clearly a billion dollars is a cost worth paying for it,” said McGeehan. Human Rights Watch spokesman Adam Coogle said: “The question is whether investment with the Saudis is enabling the abuse and I think from migrants you could really see how that could be possible. “If he doesn’t engage meaningfully on this issue he could open himself up to accusations of hypocrisy, namely that he doesn’t get assurances that the work he’s involved with is not free of migrant abuse.” A Virgin spokesman said: “We have debated at length which is the best approach: to confront and boycott or to engage and seek dialogue. We see merit in both but we’ve found we’ve had greater success with the latter.” Branson’s support follows confirmation from Saudi Arabia last month that it plans to invest $1bn (£762m) in the British tycoon’s Virgin space companies. Branson has committed Virgin to meeting the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act. “It is time for us all to do more to tackle modern slavery by bringing together governments, businesses and civil society organisations to protect vulnerable people,” he wrote in a blog to mark Anti-Slavery Day last month. Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is seeking to diversify the country’s economy to lessen its reliance on oil. Plans reportedly include construction of a £380bn city powered by clean energy. Branson is the first international investor to commit to the construction projects, which are financed by Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund. He said: “When I was asked to be involved helping Saudi develop three cities, in particular the Red Sea project, I was obviously delighted to say yes. I have quite a lot of experience in islands in the Caribbean, so we will lend that experience to it.” Branson, however, a member of Amnesty International’s global council, has previously echoed criticism of the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia, where 14 pro-democracy protesters are currently awaiting execution whom Amnesty believes have not had fair trials. An Amnesty spokesman said: “Amnesty International expects all companies to carry out due diligence in every country they operate in to identify any risks that their operations will contribute to human rights abuses, and then take action to mitigate those risks.” In 2014, Branson announced Virgin was boycotting Brunei-owned hotels over the country’s new anti-gay law, which allows the stoning to death of homosexuals. Legal stoning of homosexuals also happens in Saudi Arabia. The Virgin spokesman added: “We believe our evolving relationship [with Saudi Arabia] will create welcome opportunities to start productive conversations about human rights and other challenges the country faces. It is through interactions like these that we believe we can make the greatest contribution to tangible progress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/nov/13/punta-arenas-spotlight-chile-gateway-antarctic-captain-scott-shackleton","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-13T11:52:41Z","webTitle":"Punta Arenas in the spotlight: Chile's oil-rich gateway city to the Antarctic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/13/punta-arenas-spotlight-chile-gateway-antarctic-captain-scott-shackleton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/nov/13/punta-arenas-spotlight-chile-gateway-antarctic-captain-scott-shackleton","fields":{"headline":"Punta Arenas in the spotlight: Chile's oil-rich gateway city to the Antarctic","bodyText":"When Robert Scott’s frozen remains were recovered 105 years ago this week, Antarctic exploration was a European-only affair. Now it’s a bustling global concern, poised to open up even more as the ice caps recede. Chile’s southernmost city, Punta Arenas, a wind-bitten port of nearly 130,000 on the Strait of Magellan, is jostling for position as gateway city to the Antarctic. It welcomed Scott himself in July 1904 when the Englishman sent 400 letters announcing the safe return of his Discovery expedition at the post office on Plaza Muñoz Gamero. One of his officers pronounced the city a “wretched-looking place”. Not so much now, with Punta Arenas hosting the national Antarctic programmes of 20 countries and becoming one of Chile’s fastest-growing cities in the process. South pole position Compared to fellow gateway cities Christchurch, New Zealand, and Hobart, Australia, which focus more on transit to the deep Antarctic, Punta Arenas is the jumping-off point for international biology expeditions to the Antarctic peninsula. It lies on one side of the 660km Drake Passage crossing, the shortest hop to the giant spur of the continent where 80% of its biodiversity is concentrated. Since the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH) moved to Punta Arenas in 2004, the country has shifted from a “geopolitical” stance – trying to assert its sovereignty over the ice to the south – to a “cooperative, globally orientated” one, says Marcelo Leppe, an INACH paleobiologist. Chile still fosters a psychological claim to the territory with cultural drives such as Antarctic school fairs. But its growing commitment to collaboration will soon be visible on the Punta Arenas waterfront in the shape of a showcase $50m International Antarctic Centre. Scheduled to open in 2021, the 15,000 sq metre complex will function as an international research hub, a logistics base for southbound expeditions and a general-purpose museum. Antarctic tourism has traditionally been the prerogative of Punta Arenas’ neighbouring Argentinian city Ushuaia. But the planned expansion of Punta Arenas’ airport, with more civilian flights, could reduce the attractiveness of its sister city’s cruise ships. “Most people don’t enjoy crossing the Drake Passage by sea,” says Leppe. “It’s not an experience I want to repeat again.” Punta Arenas in numbers 1494 Year the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed, which Chile later used to justify its Antarctic claims 8,000 Citizens who lined the docks in September 1916 to greet the return of the Chilean navy mission that rescued the survivors of Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance 18,000 Barrels of Chilean oil produced per day in 2012. A significant proportion of the country’s reserves are processed in Punta Arenas; peak production was in 1982, with 55,000 barrels a day 0.9% Unemployment recorded in Punta Arenas’ Magallanes region in April-June this year, a historic low History in 100 words In 1848, Chile set up a penal colony that grew into Punta Arenas – positioned so that the fledging state could control the Strait of Magellan. Swelled by European immigrants, it rode the 19th-century Patagonian sheep-farming boom to become a wool-production centre – perfectly placed on maritime export routes. That, and local coal reserves, funded the European-style splendour of the city’s mansions. It was renamed Magallanes from 1927 to 1938, but the Panama canal had robbed the strait of its importance. The slump was arrested with the 1945 discovery of oil, and now the Antarctic linkup. Punta Arenas in sound and vision What the city sends to Antarctica, it gets back in southerly winds that can gust up to 80mph. Get a feel for a Punta Arenas freshener here. The 2011 documentary The Human Zoo is a sorrowful exposé of how Patagonia’s indigenous people were kidnapped by early European settlers and exhibited in cities thousands of miles away. Acclaimed film-maker Patricio Guzmán threaded their story into the Pinochet era for his 2015 film The Pearl Button. Biggest urban risk The discovery of the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica in the mid-1980s had serious health implications for Punta Arenas. Cases of skin cancer reportedly rose by 65% between 1987 and 2000, and for one month in 2000 residents were warned not to go outside between 11am and 3pm unless it was absolutely necessary. The hole has shrunk in recent years, but the city’s behaviour has adapted for good. Scanning weather reports for UV ratings is mandatory, and so is judicious use of sunblock. “There’s a culture associated with the ozone hole here,” says Leppe, “Everybody uses protection.” Eco-fitting the city The Chilean authorities and media watch Punta Arenas as a canary in the coalmine of climate change; 2017, for example, was the first time in a decade that the ski resorts in the nearby natural park were shut for the entire year due to a lack of snow. But, for a scientific hub, it lacks the digital infrastructure needed to relay the data that would give us a better understanding of global warming. Leppe cites the record Antarctic temperatures recorded in March 2015 and flooding in northern Chile days later, events he believes were interrelated. “We need to have a capacity of analysis with a speed that permits us to predict some of these very strange climate behaviours,” says Leppe. Hence the new Southern Fibre Optic link recently confirmed by the Chilean government. Punta Arenas will be a node on around 4,000km of fibre-optic infrastructure aiming to bring the southern Chile’s internet up to speed. With talk of further submarine links to New Zealand and China, it’s the next step in using its proximity to Antarctica to give the city global leverage. What’s next for the city? An isolated settlement with close-knit immigrant spirit turned 21st-century global stopping point, Punta Arenas has a third, forgotten identity: its indigenous heritage. In 2006, there were only 15 full-blood members remaining of the region’s Kawésqar ethnic group remaining after heavy suppression under the Pinochet dictatorship. There has been a renewal of interest in their history, customs and trampled rights – highlighted in the documentaries mentioned above, as well as the work of activists, historians and artists. New social housing allocated to several of Patagonia’s indigenous groups is being completed on Manuel Rodriguez Street in the southern part of the city. Leppe sees it as a healthy evolution of Punta Arenas’ Eurocentric self-image: “The original settlers found a small Eden here, away from the wars. But they created their own war here. And after over 100 years, it’s time to reconcile these two parts of our history.” Rewriting the narrative of the city to incorporate the indigenous experience is also a vital part of its push into tourism, as continues to look for a sustainable future beyond oil.

He always had to be writing, it was always his way, right through his life.” With illustrations from RW Alley, who has illustrated Bond’s Paddington Bear books since 1997, the publication of Paddington at St Paul’s will mark the 60th anniversary of the first book about the character, A Bear Called Paddington. In his latest exploit, the irrepressible bear sets off for the cathedral, where he is mistaken for a choirboy. According to Jankel, the picture book was inspired by a ceremony there to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday, at which David Attenborough read Bond’s Reflections on the Passing of the Years [pdf]. “That’s how the idea got started,” said Jankel. “I’d never give away too much, but Paddington goes on an outing with his friend Mr Gruber, as he is wont to do.” Ann-Janine Murtagh, executive publisher at HarperCollins Children’s Books, called the final Paddington book “Michael’s parting gift to all his fans … brimming with curiosity, charm and affectionate exuberance”. Jankel said that she had been “surrounded by Paddington all my life” – she was born on 13 August 1958 and the first Paddington book was published on 13 October that year. “He was like a member of the family. He still is, even though my father isn’t here.” Bond, who began writing in 1945 while in the army, and sold his first short story for seven guineas, will be celebrated with a memorial service at St Paul’s on 14 November. “Our family feel immensely proud that we will be honouring his life [in this way] and the fact that this is the setting for his final story makes it very special indeed,” said Jankel. The service will feature tributes from family and friends, as well as from the actors Hugh Bonneville, Madeleine Harris and Samuel Joslin from the cast of the film Paddington 2, which is out on 10 November. “It’s wonderful,” said Jankel of the film. “Very sadly my father never got to see it. They’ve captured the spirit of Paddington so beautifully. My father was as nervous as me before the first one. We all were. It’s like asking somebody to bring up a child for you. But when he finally saw it, he was delighted.” Bond was first inspired to write about Paddington when he saw a small toy bear on a shelf in a London shop on Christmas Eve, 1956. Feeling sorry for it, he bought it as a present for his wife. Living near Paddington station, he’d often thought that Paddington would be a good name for a character, and one day, it gave him the spark of an idea. “When I wrote those few words, I had no idea quite what a change they would eventually make to my life. It was really a case of putting something down on paper to get my brain working that morning,” Bond said. Jankel added: “He didn’t set out to write for children with the first one. He was writing for his own pleasure, and found he’d written a children’s book,” said Jankel. A host of novels and picture books would follow; today, the Paddington books have sold more than 35m copies and been translated into more than 40 languages. Jankel said that Paddington at St Paul’s would be the final story, although she added that her father had also written another non-Paddington book.

The 57-year-old, who replaced Bob Howden after he was pushed aside in February, had been forced to reapply for the chairperson’s job under new sports governance rules but, having gone through the interview process, decided to withdraw his application on Wednesday. The Guardian understands that a new chair has already been selected but a date for their announcement has not been finalised. Browning, meanwhile, will leave his post on 1 December and return to the role of non-executive director, which he held from 2014 to this year. In a statement Browning vigorously defended his short tenure, saying he had steered British Cycling out of the “depths of a crisis” following allegations of bullying, sexism and abuse of Para-athletes last year – as well as the continuing fallout from the mysterious Jiffy bag that was delivered by an employee to Bradley Wiggins in 2011. However he conceded that the organisation would benefit “from a whole new leadership team” because of the numerous problems it had faced. “When I stepped into the role of chair in February, British Cycling was in the depths of a crisis, facing severe reputational damage and there was an absence of strong, visible leadership,” he added. “It was clear to me that we needed to introduce major changes to our leadership, operations and governance which were in need of immediate reform and repair. Over the past nine months, we have done exactly that.” Browning claimed that under his watch British Cycling had taken “a hard look at its behaviours”. He also pointed to the “energetic” appointments of the chief executive, Julie Harrington, and the performance director, Stephen Park – as well as arrival of a new commercial director, Jonathan Rigby, and a new head of medical services, Nigel Jones, as further evidence that the organisation was changing. The support of many within the sport had encouraged Browning to apply for the job of independent chairman – previously the roles of British Cycling president and chairman had been combined – required by a new code for sports governance. However, Browning’s chances of getting the job were never as high as he believed. Crucially, because he was a non-executive director of British Cycling from 2014, he was on the organisation’s board during a period when it was widely considered not fit for purpose. As far back as March the Guardian was reporting that Browning did not have the full support of UK Sport. And his case was further damaged when British Cycling’s internal review into allegations of sexism by Jess Varnish was described as “inept” and “sanitised” in an independent review led by the British Olympic Association board member Annamarie Phelps. While Browning pointed to several areas where the sins of the past had been addressed, he admitted that it was “frustrating” that an UK Anti-Doping Agency investigation into the Jiffy bag delivered to Wiggins at the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2011 was still ongoing. “There isn’t anything else I can say,” he added. “It is frustrating that there has been no closure. But the working relationship between British Cycling and the Ukad has strengthened over this period and in very good standing.” Meanwhile Howden, who stepped aside as chairman in February, will seek re-election as British Cycling president at next week’s AGM. It is no longer a board position."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/nov/08/mark-stoneman-england-warm-up-cricket-australia-xi-ashes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-08T13:50:59Z","webTitle":"Mark Stoneman in the runs but laments England’s cheap dismissals in warm-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/08/mark-stoneman-england-warm-up-cricket-australia-xi-ashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/nov/08/mark-stoneman-england-warm-up-cricket-australia-xi-ashes","fields":{"headline":"Mark Stoneman in the runs but laments England’s cheap dismissals in warm-up","bodyText":"“There are lessons to be learned from today,” was the assessment of England’s opening batsman Mark Stoneman, with seven days of cricket left before the Gabba, and he was right. Three of the top five, including Stoneman himself, had fallen between 58 and 63, and three were dismissed for seven runs to the new ball, which nipped around under lights, at the end of the day to significantly damage their position against mighty raw opposition. It was a reminder of the perils of that period of any pink-ball game but it will not have gone unnoticed that England lost at least a wicket at the end of each session as they reached 278 for 8 by the end of day one of four. They must tighten up. Daniel Fallins, a 20-year-old leg-spinning first-class debutant, did much of the damage for the Cricket Australia XI, with four for 71. He bowled neatly enough but all four wickets came with balls that would not traditionally be considered wicket-takers. Also among the wickets was Jackson Coleman, another debutant, who had Alastair Cook caught behind (again) early on and was at the heart of the late fightback. He is a big-hearted, heavy-footed left-armer whose debut came late after time out of the game playing Australian rules football. The pair’s inexperience was in keeping with their team’s, who England play again next week in Townsville. Coleman is willing but he is not Mitchell Starc nor bowls his searing yorkers. In the low-80mph, he was the quickest of the attack on a dreadfully slow drop-in surface and an even slower outfield. There was one memorable short ball all day, from Coleman to the then scoreless James Vince, and it was such a surprise that he became tangled and it clobbered him on the shoulder. Stoneman described the attack as a “step up” from the one that England faced in Perth over the weekend but “pretty similar” to the grade attacks he faced across seven summers in Sydney, and he accepted England would have to prepare for the fury, pace and intensity expected in Brisbane in other ways. Furthermore, there is an international rules game here this weekend – a hybrid of Australian rules and Gaelic football. For the Adelaide Oval, that is a far bigger event. “It wasn’t great for free-scoring and putting the bowlers under pressure,” Stoneman said. “We were never able to draw the game back or get away from them, punishing the bad balls.” The upshot was a ground that looked pretty throughout but cricket that did not. The bad balls actually tended to pick up wickets. Coleman’s to dismiss Cook – who got a duck in the opening match in Perth – was decent, “doing just enough” according to Stoneman – who was standing at the other end – to draw the edge. Stoneman was given a reprieve, dropped on 17 by the wicketkeeper Tim Paine (who had earlier put England in) cutting – a strength both England’s opponents so far have seen as a potential weakness. Two gullies were again employed and Steve Smith will surely have taken note. Vince, having battled through a tough early period, fell in Fallins’ first over (with the opening session moments from ending), yorked attempting to heave a full toss to leg. In the opening first-class game of the tour, he made 33, his average in the County Championship this year. That gave us a first look at Fallins’ signature “double-dab” celebration in which he crosses his arms before his face and dips his head. Stoneman and Joe Root, having reached pleasing half-centuries in a stand of 70 in the attritional afternoon period, fell in equally impetuous fashion. Stoneman also received a full toss but his bat turned in his hand and he was taken brilliantly at midwicket – England’s young opponents were excellent in the field – while Root got a hefty leading edge to mid-off when attempting to cart Fallins to cow corner. Jonny Bairstow edged cutting a half-tracker not long after the 40-minute dinner break and Fallins improbably had four. From there, Dawid Malan – who again looked as comfortable as any England batsman – and Chris Woakes cruised towards twilight, milking spin in anticipation of the new ball. Woakes was caught well at first slip off Coleman, then Craig Overton – with an over to survive before stumps – slashed Gurinder Sandhu straight to point. Play ended with Malan caught at gully via the hands of third slip but not before he, like Stoneman, had recorded his second half-century of the tour. It had been a careless end and one that left England “fractionally disappointed”, according to Stoneman. They have hammered away in interviews about the need to start watchfully, and respect the first 30 balls, but make hay when set and “score big hundreds”. They are doing the former but not the latter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/16/gnomon-nick-harkaway-review-science-fiction-artifical-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-16T11:00:26Z","webTitle":"Gnomon by Nick Harkaway review – a future of total surveillance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/16/gnomon-nick-harkaway-review-science-fiction-artifical-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/16/gnomon-nick-harkaway-review-science-fiction-artifical-intelligence","fields":{"headline":"Gnomon by Nick Harkaway review – a future of total surveillance","bodyText":"In post-Brexit Britain of the late 21st century, ambient electronic surveillance is total, for the good of the people. An omniscient AI called the Witness knows and sees all, ensuring the success of the System as a whole: a society of permanent direct democracy, in which everyone votes on everything all the time. Everyone is fitter, happier, more productive. What’s not to like? Regrettably, of course, some sub-optimal citizens will occasionally be obliged to undergo involuntary interrogations by the Witness police, who use mind-reading technology. But this is rare and benign – until one woman, a refusenik called Diana Hunter who somehow lives off-grid, dies during her police interview. That’s not supposed to happen. Enter Witness inspector Mielikki Neith, a true believer in the panopticon utopia. She plays back the recording of the interrogation, to experience Hunter’s own feelings and to try to understand what happened. What Neith finds inside the dead woman’s head, however, is not supposed to be there. She finds the vivid experiences of a host of other people. There is a Greek finance wizard who can somehow foresee the movements of the stock market and is stalked in his head by a shark. There is an old Ethiopian painter living in London, whose daughter produces a bestselling video game. There is a fourth-century alchemist searching for a mythical chamber that exists outside time, to resurrect her dead son, fathered by St Augustine. Meanwhile, it begins to look as though someone doesn’t want Inspector Neith to conclude her investigation successfully. A novel can be awfully long without being long-winded. Gnomon, however, reads like the first draft of what might have been a tighter 400-page book rather than a rambling 700-pager. Progress is routinely halted by sketchy Wikipedia-style exposition-dumps about tidal flow or behavioural economics, or a character asking herself a whole page or two of questions about what just happened, or vague disquisitions on the meaning of identity. Things are repeatedly explained, unnecessarily. There is an Alain de Botton-style philosophical interlude on the meaning of tram stations. There’s a lot of laborious mashing-up of Greek mythology with Christianity, and much verbose reader-prodding about how all the different narrative strands might be connected. Had I not been professionally obliged to finish it, I doubt I would have trudged further than a fifth of the way through the novel, because ars longa vita brevis and all that. It doesn’t help, either, that nearly everything is narrated in the same tone of relentless sweary facetiousness. The Greek finance wizard tells his story in much the same voice as the alchemist of a millennium and a half ago (“Fucking tits of Zeus,” she thinks at one point). There is a plausible narrative reason for this saminess of style, but it doesn’t make it any less monotonous. Not winning any style prizes, either, are descriptions of Neith’s flat as “airy” and in a “period building”, or of Ethiopia as a “vibrant country”. More generally, the novel wants very much to be propelled by dramatic tension and a sense of jeopardy, but there can’t really be any when a plot proceeds as this one does, essentially from one deus ex machina to the next. Pretty much anything can happen, so you can’t make educated guesses about what might occur next. Such defects wouldn’t be so annoying were it not obvious that Nick Harkaway can sometimes be a very good writer indeed. Readers who are prepared to mentally edit the book as they go along, as the author and editor have not, will encounter a host of highly enjoyable fragments and suggestive ideas. Neith’s own narrative has a certain hard-boiled melancholy, and the alchemist’s is enlivened whenever she speaks to a particularly sarcastic demon. Neith knows a wonderfully bluff tech-support chap who is disappointed at how small the electronic files for human souls really are. “A living self should be all huge and shiny. Nope. Small enough to fit in a jamjar, mostly. Couple of fireflies going round and round each other, that’s all.” Of all the characters, though, the most interesting is actually the least human, and the one after whom the novel is named. Gnomon lives in a future where people can spread their minds across many bodies, thus handily averting death. He is what humans have become, a collective consciousness of tens of thousands of souls, so he finds it darkly difficult to understand being a human with only one body: “It seems too irresponsible to put all of oneself in one place, and so macabre to insist on being inside it as it breaks.” More importantly, Gnomon has decided, like a starman Hamlet, that something is rotten in the state of the universe. “I don’t like it and I’m going to kill it,” he decides – and, as it turns out, he has a point. He is angry and funny, and a really interesting effort at portraying a consciousness that at some level is irreducibly alien. As the novel itself rather too insistently hopes, it is Gnomon’s voice you remember most clearly after the end. Playing a minor role by comparison, but existing closer to the novel’s true heart, is a placid old-school bookseller, whose eventual fate provides the truest moment of delight. He would certainly disapprove of the fact that vast sections are printed in a sans serif font: an unforgivable typographic insult to the reader, since it’s physically harder to read, and it also makes the pages resemble those of a self-published book produced with 1990s desktop-publishing software.

An email seen by the Guardian links Nord Stream 2 lobbying to the deputy leader of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), Wolfgang Kubicki, throwing into doubt cross-party claims of a “more critical” attitude towards the contentious energy deal in a potential three-party coalition alongside Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats and the Greens. Kubicki, also deputy president of the Bundestag, has been touted as a frontrunner to succeed Wolfgang Schäuble at the top of the German finance ministry if his party enters government. Coalition talks are ongoing between the three parties following the September election. The email was sent just a week after the election to a group of influential European energy analysts and thinktanks, aggressively promoting the advantages of Nord Stream 2 – the proposed Baltic Sea pipeline between Vyborg in Russia and Greifswald in Germany that many say runs counter to the strategic interests of the European Union. It was signed off “in collaboration with Kubicki &amp; Schöler, Attorneys at Law”, the law firm where Wolfgang Kubicki is a founding partner, and from which he presumably either receives a salary or share of the firm’s profits. Nord Stream 2 is a project of Gazprom, of which the Kremlin is a majority shareholder, and states in eastern Europe and the Baltics fear the pipeline will threaten European energy security and increase Russian influence in Germany. Promising that Nord Stream 2 will make EU wholesale prices of gas 32% lower by 2020 and that there will be “no legal need for an agreement between the EU and Russia” to give the project the go-ahead, the email is authored by a former German ambassador with links to the FDP, Frank Elbe. In response to questions from the Guardian, Elbe has confirmed that he has worked with Kubicki’s law firm, but only on “criminal cases with an international dimension”, while Kubicki’s partner at law, Hendrick Schöler, said his firm still worked with Elbe and referred to him as “our colleague”. Elbe denied that he was engaged in lobbying activity, stating that his mandate was “limited to advisory services”. The unsolicited email, however, talks about Nord Stream 2 in the first person plural (“we expect to receive permit decisions in the five relevant countries by the end of Q1 2018”). Kubicki &amp; Schöler explicitly deny they have a client with a direct link to “the building of Nord Stream 2”. However, Elbe did not rule out that he had such a client, stating that “legal reasons prevent me from giving information regarding existing legal client relations”. The Kiel-based law firm has remained intransparent about its clients as its business and the political career of one of its partners have flourished: for the past five years, Kubicki has been the only one of 69 members of the state parliament of Schleswig-Holstein to refuse to declare his second income. Kubicki is already under fire for representing Hanno Berger, a former tax inspector who stands accused of engineering the biggest tax fraud scandal in German postwar history, using legal loopholes to siphon up to €30bn out of the state’s coffers. Former finance minister Peer Steinbrück has said that promoting Kubicki to the finance ministry would amount to “life imitating satire”. German politicians have advocated the advantages of Nord Stream 2 in the past, but until now support for the project has been largely associated with the centre-left Social Democratic party, whose former leader Gerhard Schröder joined Nord Stream’s shareholder committee shortly after stepping down as chancellor in 2006 and has been Nord Stream 2’s manager since 2016. With the SPD likely to go into opposition, politicians from Merkel’s party have started to promise a more critical approach to the Russian-backed project. “It is clear that the new government will be a lot more critical of the project than the previous one,” CDU politician Norbert Röttgen said recently. Kubicki’s promotion to the finance ministry would throw that claim into doubt. “Former ambassador Elbe seems to be lobbying on Nord Stream 2’s behalf, and he has close ties to Kubicki through his law firm”, said Timo Lange of LobbyControl, a transparency initiative. “This clearly poses serious questions on how deep Nord Stream 2’s lobbying activities are rooted within the liberal party. “We can’t see who is lobbying for Nordstream 2 or competing interests and we don’t know which former politicians use their political network in these debates”, Lange added. “Given the high stakes in the debate about future energy supplies for Europe this is an unbearable situation.” The pro-Russian turn of Germany’s Free Democrats, a traditional coalition partner of Angela Merkel’s CDU, has puzzled political observers in Berlin since the party reentered the Bundestag following a four-year absence in which many of the party’s staff and policy priorities were overhauled. In the run up to the national vote in September, FDP leader Christian Lindner shocked many of his party’s old guard by announcing that Germany should “accept Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine as a ‘permanent provisional arrangement’”, as well as calling for a lifting of sanctions. One of those who defended Lindner’s comments in the German press included Elbe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/nov/12/para-badminton-athlete-wheelchair-trashed-british-airways-flight","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-12T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"Para-badminton athlete’s £5,000 sports wheelchair trashed after BA flight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/12/para-badminton-athlete-wheelchair-trashed-british-airways-flight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/nov/12/para-badminton-athlete-wheelchair-trashed-british-airways-flight","fields":{"headline":"Para-badminton athlete’s £5,000 sports wheelchair trashed after BA flight","bodyText":"Can you help me as I am desperate. I am an international para-badminton wheelchair athlete for England who flew on British Airways to Finland in August to attend a training camp. I was looking forward to training and learning to improve my career with other top players, and travelled with my specially designed sports wheelchair, and my manual one. When we landed I discovered that my sports wheelchair had been trashed by the baggage handlers and was no longer usable. As a result the whole trip was wasted, as I could not take part in the training programme. Ever since, I have been trying to get the airline to compensate me for what happened. I am due to attend the Para-Badminton World Championships in South Korea in November and am scared the same thing will happen. I asked colleagues if they could loan me a chair but they are all bespoke. As a result I have had to borrow money from my sister and friends to purchase another chair at a cost of £5,095. BA is just ignoring me. Sharon Barnes, London Given the huge rise in the number of wheelchair athletes that tour the world with their expensive chairs, one would hope that the airlines would have adapted their policies to find a way to stop this sort of thing happening. We have received a noticeable increase in complaints about BA luggage problems in recent weeks, but that doesn’t excuse the airline from not responding. Fortunately, we were able to push your complaint to the top of the list and the airline has apologised and agreed to pay the replacement £5,000+ cost. “We have also spoken with both airports’ wheelchair service providers to seek assurances that our customers are receiving proper care and attention during their journeys,” it says. You should be aware that this settlement is significantly higher than that set out in the Montreal Convention which limits the liability of airlines following a baggage claim to around £1,200. The EU has looked at whether the convention’s terms discriminate against those with disabilities. In the meantime, you need to make sure that the replacement chair is insured. Allianz says it is a proud sponsor of ParalympicsGB, so maybe it could come up with a policy?

Despite having made multiple attempts to kill herself, Polly Ross, 32, was allowed to leave the Westlands mental health unit in Hull, where she was a voluntary patient, at about 8.30am on 10 July 2015. Ross told nurses that she was going to buy cigarettes. She was hit by a train at 11.10am and died instantly. Speaking at Hull coroner’s court on Wednesday, Jo Hogg said Ross was “an extraordinary person who leaves behind an extraordinary number of legacies”, not least her two young daughters. Hogg, who was previously employed by Humber NHS foundation trust as an occupational therapist, said Ross had met with “a lack of focused care when she needed it most”. She said she wanted to see changes in the way care was provided to women like her daughter and not hear about missed opportunities by the trust. Ross, who ran a translation business in Paris before moving back to east Yorkshire in August 2012, suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, an extreme form of morning sickness, during both her pregnancies in 2012 and 2014. The inquest heard that her condition, which left her hospitalised and on a drip, compounded her mental health issues and that she suffered from postnatal depression after both births. Ross asked to be admitted to a specialist mother and baby unit in Leeds, but was turned down. Giving evidence to the inquest, Ross’s GP, Dr Daniella Maleknasr, said there had been warning signs as to the danger Ross posed to herself, but added that mental ill-health could be unpredictable. In February 2015 Ross was sectioned after a breakdown and was admitted to the Avondale psychiatric intensive care and assessment unit in west Hull, and her children were taken out of her care. She was in hospital again for five days from 2 April after expressing suicidal thoughts. A week later she attended A&amp;E after self-harming, and later that month, on 28 April, she was taken to hospital after an attempted overdose. The following month, on 14 May, Ross was again admitted to a mental health unit after having suicidal thoughts, and on 16 June she returned again to A&amp;E after another overdose. A statement read to the court by Ross’s aunt Emma May, who acted as her carer after she was first sectioned, said her niece had been desperate. “She told me she wanted to feel better and not feel the way she felt … I honestly don’t think there were many days from February 2015 when Polly didn’t feel suicidal,” the statement said. “I feel that Polly was desperately ill and was unable to make decisions for her own safety and wellbeing. I am certain that the few times my niece left her home since February were times she attempted to take her own life. I cannot understand how she was allowed to leave the unit to buy her own cigarettes the morning she died.” Speaking through tears, Hogg told the inquest that her daughter’s intelligence was “staggering at times”. She described Ross as a “thinker, a reflector, a reader, a writer, a dancer, a laugher. She loved her children unconditionally and knew heartbreakingly that when she was ill she couldn’t look after them.” Hogg described how, in the months before her death, Polly attempted to describe her mental state to her mother, saying she could only see in black and white, but that she thought her medication was helping and that “some colour was coming back into her life”. “I did not realise the levels of strength she needed to get through her depression,” she added. The inquest heard that Lorna Jennison, a care coordinator at Bridlington and Driffield mental health team, had been worried about Ross given the “large number of serious life events” that occurred at the same time – she faced eviction by her landlord, her children had been taken away and her relationship with her husband had ended. Jennison was asked whether she thought Ross’s condition had deteriorated in the weeks leading up to her death. She responded that her condition seemed to have “peaks and troughs”, though she agreed that each attempt at self-harm seemed to be more serious than the last. “There would seem to be a period of stability, and then that would deteriorate,” she said. When Jennison met Ross a few weeks before her death, she seemed stable, she said. “She took control of the room. She was very articulate and certain about what she wanted from her future.” In October 2015, Prof Paul Marks – the coroner in Ross’s inquest – ruled that Humber NHS foundation trust was guilty of neglect in the case of Sally Mays, 22, who killed herself after being turned away for inpatient mental health care. The trust issued a statement saying it had “ultimately failed to offer Sally the dignity and care she needed and deserved that afternoon”. The inquest continues. • Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/nov/15/artemis-andy-weir-review-the-martian","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-15T12:00:07Z","webTitle":"Artemis by Andy Weir review – follow-up to The Martian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/15/artemis-andy-weir-review-the-martian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/nov/15/artemis-andy-weir-review-the-martian","fields":{"headline":"Artemis by Andy Weir review – follow-up to The Martian","bodyText":"Andy Weir’s first novel, The Martian, enjoyed a measure of success liable to make other writers slump slack-jawed and drooling, like Homer Simpson before a doughnut. Initially self-published, it became a word-of-mouth hit, got picked up by a regular publisher, sold 5m copies and was made into a blockbuster film by Ridley Scott. Straight out of the gates with a global hit. Indeed, the book was such a blockbuster you probably know its story: an astronaut, stranded on Mars, has to use his scientific expertise to stay alive for two years until rescue can reach him. This simple narrative tug – will he survive or not? – gives Weir a line on which to hang a large number of interesting facts and little lectures. The reader learns a lot about the Martian environment, how to grow potatoes, how to get into orbit and so on. That’s the sweet spot The Martian hit: a likable protagonist in peril, saved by his own resourcefulness in a tale that leaves readers better informed about science than they were before they read it. Weir, clearly, adheres to the principle that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it (and, presumably, if it is broke, patch it up with duct tape). His second novel concerns a likable protagonist in peril, saved by her own resourcefulness, in a tale that leaves readers better informed about science than they were before they read it. The setting is lunar rather than Martian, but otherwise it’s basically the same pitch. “Artemis” itself is a five-dome moonbase, servicing a little heavy industry and rather more tourism. Jazz, our heroine, is a sparky young woman who (while her observant Muslim father tut-tuts) gets drunk, has sex and generally tries to have a good time. It’s a struggle, though: good times are expensive on the moon, and despite supplementing her job – she is a porter – with some judicious smuggling, Jazz is always short of money. She lives in a coffin-sized apartment, shares communal washing facilities and eats the cheapest algae-grown gunk. Poverty persuades her to take on a criminal commission: a little light sabotage on the lunar surface. Naturally, things don’t go smoothly: she botches the sabotage, her employer gets murdered, and an assassin is coming after her. The moon has become a battleground for organised crime over a MacGuffin, in this case a new tech that could revolutionise Earth’s entire communication system. As in The Martian, Weir’s is a prose entirely without aesthetic ambition, flat and cheerful and a bit sweary. Nabokov it ain’t. Take the novel’s opening paragraph: “I bounded over the gray, dusty terrain toward the huge dome of Conrad Bubble. Its airlock ringed with red lights stood distressingly far away.” A creative writing teacher might look at that, count the six adjectives/adverbs in its line-and-a-half and suggest cutting a few of them. But then again, said creative writing teacher certainly won’t have sold 5m copies of their debut novel, or they wouldn’t be supplementing their income teaching creative writing. If Weir wants to describe an explosion by saying: “the harvester exploded like … exploded”, then no one is going to stop him. Discovering a sentence as awkward as “life’s a pain in the ass when you have a cop constantly on your ass” in their first draft, another writer would wince and reach for the revising pencil. Not Weir. He is perfectly happy to wave the line through to the final product. This time, though, authorial inexperience results in a markedly lumpier read than was the case in The Martian. Orchestrating a rather more complicated plot and many more characters tests Weir’s ability both to pace his story and to hold things together. The text is so laden with information and facts, it feels heavy even in one-sixth lunar gravity. Scrupulously, indeed pedantically, everything is explained. Weir can never let a passing detail pass without stopping it and pinning a label to it. Early on, this makes the book merely slow, but as the story picks up speed towards its climax it becomes actively annoying – jamming the narrative momentum with little lectures on why the spaces between the inner and outer hull of Artemis’s domes are pressurised at 20.4 kPa, 10% less than the pressure inside the dome itself, or laboriously listing all the MacGuffin’s technical specifications (“I checked the core’s index of refraction: it’s 1.458, a little higher than fibre optics usually are, but only by a tiny bit … a typical attenuation for a high-end cable is around 0.4 decibels per kilometre … the precision of my OLTS is 0.001 decibels per kilometre …”). The urge to yell GET ON WITH IT swells in the readerly chest. SF fans with long enough memories will find Artemis a curiously old-fashioned sort of book, something like a Heinlein juvenile with added F-words. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, mind. It’s a quick read that will teach you about the moon, a story with enough explosions and chase scenes and fistfights to leaven the mini-lectures. Plus the narrator-protagonist has real charm. There’s no question that, commercially speaking, this novel is going to be a hit. But as a work of fiction it’s a crescent rather than a whole moon. • Artemis is published by Del Rey.

A coherent, rational or beguiling version of Derek Jarman’s punk picture of England, Jubilee, would be not simply a paradox but stage suicide. Sometimes Chris Goode’s new theatrical version – directed by the writer to mark the movie’s 40th anniversary next year – does feel like a sort of death. “We’ve lost a few people,” Travis Alabanza’s Amyl Nitrate pointed out, looking at the audience after the interval on press night. A bit of me went with them. But the leavers missed something. There are throughout jolts and jokes. And the swifter, more urgent second half has moments that can spin you around. Not least in Alabanza’s rasping, expansive, melancholy confrontations with the audience. In powder-pink skirt and jacket, a long string of pearls and high bootees with pom-poms, Alabanza (who prefers to use a gender-neutral pronoun) dynamically wires spectators into what’s going on. Which is the opposite of a plot: a series of detonations constantly exploding the possibility of a developing narrative. Chloe Lamford’s design makes the round Royal Exchange into a giant squat. Behind the audience the walls are scrawled with graffiti, and union jacks dangle. When characters are not cavorting they are often killing. Two elegant boys, one of them singing seraphically, have a lovely time tangled up naked together. A bloke is smothered to death with shiny plastic sheeting. “Love” is carved with a knife into a girl’s back. Cops gun down couples in a club. Jarman’s verbal kicking has been updated to take in Ant and Dec, David Cameron, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn. In a great roll of passionate denunciation, Alabanza roars that what looked like riotous declarations at the time of Elizabeth II’s jubilee – “No future!” – now have the status of fact. There’s plenty of rhetoric and stamping. Those, like me, who think that not all ideologies are equally pointless will struggle with some of it. A lockjaw of rage precludes some of the humour that might find hope. But then come waves of energy – the dancing made me wish the whole thing floated on music – and darts of bitter precision: tower blocks are an “efficient mechanism for killing poor people”. It was clever in this anniversary of a jubilee to cast Toyah Willcox – who played Mad in the film – as a witty ruffed-up Gloriana, getting her handy magician John Dee to summon up visions, and towards the end joyously bursting into I Want to Be Free. A silver-voiced, rapt Lucy Ellinson skims magnetically through the action as Ariel. She doubles as a performance artist, the archetypal figure of the show: she does not make anything; she just is. • Jubilee is at the Royal Exchange, Manchester until 18 November"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/nov/12/the-week-in-tv-motherland-a-word-detectorists-angry-white-american","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-12T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Motherland, The A Word, Detectorists and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/12/the-week-in-tv-motherland-a-word-detectorists-angry-white-american","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/12/the-week-in-tv-motherland-a-word-detectorists-angry-white-american","fields":{"headline":"The week in TV: Motherland, The A Word, Detectorists and more","bodyText":"Motherland (BBC2) | iPlayer The A Word (BBC1) |iPlayer Detectorists (BBC4) | iPlayer Angry, White and American (C4) | All4 Trump: An American Dream (C4) | All 4 The Girlfriend Experience Amazon Duking it out for the title of Good Bad Mother of the Week were Anna Maxwell Martin and Morven Christie, in what turned out to be rather a good week for mothers everywhere. After all, doesn’t every mother think of themselves as a good bad mother, torn between the complex bugger-me impossibilities of life and, simply, the urgency of love? The pilot episode of Motherland last year just oozed what I would like to call commissionability, if that weren’t such a hateful word: the resultant return of a whole series a triumphant vindication (should they need it) for creators Sharon Horgan and Graham Linehan. They might have set out to ridicule the notion of any perfect, “having it all” supermum, but in creating Maxwell Martin’s Julia – beset at every turn by a lazily crap ex, a rubbish boss, the passive aggression of the queen bees and tiger mums – have actually, despite themselves, created a supermum for our times. Helpfully, the kids don’t get a look-in: this is all about mums. The lifelong panic of being a mum. It is, also helpfully, appallingly funny: best comedy of this year. Less openly humorous, but no less honest and human, was the return of The A Word, in which Morven Christie, with autistic son Joe, only errs ever on the right side of mawkish. Christie is phenomenal, as is Max Vento as Joe, and grandad Christopher Eccleston bestrides the programme – the Lake District itself – like a man wearing seven-league boots, his caustic response to every piece of PC pampering like the Daily Mail gone kind. But there’s a frisson to this series: one that has you sweating – glued, but sweating. As he grows older, might Joe’s autism lead not only to social embarrassment, but worse: violence, or inappropriateness, which, in our stupidly febrile times, have become conflated. Wonderful, hypnotically watchable: and you learn much. Among this week’s surfeit of goodies, there was also an oasis. Not to say that Detectorists isn’t great: simply that it feels like not-TV. More like lying on a sand dune in an open shirt, with a warm wind blowing your underarm hairs. Than which there are few finer feelings. I watched this first episode about three times, and couldn’t for the world find anything to jot down. Nothing happens, over and over again. And yet it’s a beautiful little piece of television, England gone right, with its silences, subtleties, desultory chat, lovely folk music, and Mackenzie Crook and Toby Jones, who often earn fortunes in films, choosing instead to do this slice of joy about the world of metal-detecting, and I for one rise from my sofa and applaud. I’m told that the last two significant finds of “troves” in Britain were not by archaeologists but by detectorists, and, worse, virgin detectorists: one guy bought the device at a car-boot sale or something, switched it on and instantly found a tranche of Viking gold about 14 inches under his Clark’s Commandos. It is a measure of the lovely credibility of the characters that I can, as I write, picture the reactions of Lance and Andy: tag-wrestling between outraged and laconic over over-hoppy beer. Angry, White and American, Gary Younge’s passionate, compassionate travail around white America, has garnered internet interest for I think the wrong reasons: his interview/confrontation with white supremacist Spencer Taylor, aka the moron Spencer Taylor. But Gary wears his heart on his sleeve: when told, by white southern privilege, that the KKK were “liberals”, he responded, thinking of those white sheets, “I wouldn’t have thought: oh, here come a bunch of liberals,” which was funny, and their juleps stuck in their craw. Yet the tender wisdom with which he explored the genuine poverty of white rustbelts went a huge way towards explaining America today. I could have wolfed a whole series of this. I had thought that I would have no stomach for any more information about Donald John Trump, every UK news bulletin for the past year having featured him (is this a new law?) like the weather, every panel show stuffed with easy smug gags. But Trump: An American Dream did a bang-up job of managing to fascinate, enthral, appal and dissect in a way which felt wholly fresh. It did this by stepping away from the attitude, the lazy ridicule, the pursed lips of newsreaders, and offering perhaps the one objective account of his rise and rise to be aired in the past year. This four-part Channel 4 series interviews 50 people who know him best – both those who liked or loved him, and those who were bruised by him (in no way mutually exclusive categories), and features much valuable found footage which sets the times in context. In this opener, we witnessed the end of his (arguably) youthful good looks and beginning of the steel; as the 70s ended, every New York property developer faced showdowns against the unions or the mob, usually both, and he got lawyered up – with one Roy Cohn, described here, possibly with a high degree of literal accuracy, as “Satan”, and who was also attorney to each of the Five (mob) Families. We saw how Trump’s drive, bullying and, yes, charm allowed him to manipulate his city into giving him a 40-year tax abatement for his first Manhattan hotel, the Commodore; and the one man in those days who dared stand up to him, mayor Ed Koch. Prophetically, there was a clip – he was talking about a derelict brownfield property, but you might wish to infer more – in which he says, beaming but nonetheless chilling: “When bad times come, I’ll get whatever I want.” Watch this fine series if only to learn that, while you can call Donald Trump many things, to call him a moron is simply cheap and wishful thinking. And there are better words. One of which begins with mother. A thing called The Girlfriend Experience returned for a second series. It’s about high-end prostitution, and high-end politics, which pretty much dissolve into each other, and I can almost understand Anna Friel’s taking of a leading role this time round: it’s gutsy, austerely shot, at some points sharply written. But it’s also horrible. No one – count them: none – is likable. And I defy anyone to call me a prude, but some of the call-girl sex stuff – detached, clinical, violent, hate-filled, way too graphic – would be labelled savagely misogynist if it wasn’t equally savagely misandrist.

It is a famous shot – the figure high among the parapets beneath a thunderous sky – and known to have been staged, like the marines hoisting the flag at Iwo Jima. But in this context, one sees it completely new. The photographer was Jewish. His father and sisters had been murdered by the Nazis. His uncle made the flag by hand, the hammer and sickle glowing an immaculate white almost at the epicentre of this dark image. And what has inspired Yevgeny Khaldei is not just the possibility of raising the figure high among the parapets, a worker on the same level as the imperial statues, but the dynamic geometries of Russian abstract art. His scene is all triangles and heroic diagonals, harking back to El Lissitzky and Malevich. It would be hard to overstate the visual impact of Red Star Over Russia at Tate Modern. Selected from almost a quarter of a million graphic images zealously collected by artist and designer David King until his death in 2016, it is a condensed vision of five decades of Soviet hopes ending in devastation and despair. The range is phenomenal: from glamorous female fighter pilots to peasants studying Lenin in the fields, from a monumental Stalin watching Soviet planes fly past his eyes like gilded insects to athletes hurtling up the picture plane towards a finishing line of communist slogans. Many images are on display for the first time, such as the grainy photographs of secret police emerging from the shadowy interior of unmarked vehicles to the notorious Bolshevik show trials of 1936-8, the victims about to be executed by the dazed young soldiers undergoing execution training in the neighbouring photograph. The show opens in 1905 with the massacre of unarmed protesters by tsarist troops in St Petersburg. Bloody Sunday prompted some brilliantly mordant counterblasts – a gigantic skeleton shrieking its way through the snowbound streets; a square where the crowds turn out to be a throng of red skulls. With the revolution, these one-colour images have their heyday with the posters of the Soviet news agency Rosta, which enlisted some of the great artists of the time, including Aleksandr Rodchenko and the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. Perspective is radicalised; compositions tilt at sheer angles and in scimitar curves; the sans serif typeface and red, colour of the proletariat, predominate. Women are urged to vote and to fight, men to unite, their strong faces vast against the new industrial cityscapes. Hats become political emblems: capitalism’s slick top hat, the worker’s headscarf, the tumbling crown of imperialism. A marvellous image of Trotsky shows him in long red coat and military cap striding across the USSR, his very outline condensing the map of the motherland. Mayakovsky said that a Soviet poster should be able to bring a running man to a halt. These posters were urgent news in graphic form for a largely illiterate country; they also brought modernism directly into the old culture of icons. They appeared in stations and cafes, on city walls and trams. It is staggering even now to witness this overlap between propaganda and the avant garde, the most famous instance of which is surely Lissitzky’s red triangle driving into a white disc against a burning black ground. Suprematism in the service of communism, its title (Beat the Whites With the Red Wedge) and its composition urge the Bolsheviks to beat the White Russians. David King’s edition is torn in one corner. His archive is fragile and hard-won, especially the rare surviving images of Trotsky. What you see at Tate Modern is living history in mass-produced ephemera, some of it stencilled by hand when no printing presses were available. Creased and fading photographs capture the minutiae of everyday life as facts and statistics never can. Here is a Red Square march with an effigy of Lord Curzon paraded like a giant Mr Punch (he had just passed an anti-Soviet edict), and another where Lloyd George is lampooned in lifesize wooden cut-out. Look deep into the crowds and you will see anxiety and exhaustion, too, among the fervour. Even when the workers are lined up alongside a caption claiming that they are the owners, rather than slaves, of the USSR, their uniforms occasionally look as worn as their faces. King’s ambition was to balance truth against fiction. Which is literally the technique of Soviet collage, where past, present and future may be merged together; and also of photomontage, where pictures skimmed from the streets may be spliced with art. Lenin addresses the multitudes, and legible slogans coruscate from his mouth in megaphone rays. Factories fuse with fields that morph into shipyards manned with workers from all over Russia in fantastical montages. Stalin himself appears to be right there among the brave comrades building the metro. But photomontage can make people disappear too. A sequence of images shows three commissars standing alongside Stalin gradually vanishing one by one, until only the despot remains; the murder of his opponents has an exact pictorial equivalent. And the murderers themselves might eventually disappear, scissored out of official group shots from the 1920s onwards, leaving menacingly conspicuous holes. Ordinary citizens also did this in fear. King collected photographs where the faces are inked out or gouged from the print with a penknife. This is the dark obverse of everything that went before, in art as in life. The early hopes nourished by a generation of stunning graphic images end in the real and symbolic destruction of life. Stalin crushed the avant garde and replaced it with socialist realist dross. With the second world war there is a slight revival of revolutionary posters (and even of the few artists who had escaped the purges), but mainly in weak pastiche. Mayakovsky’s dream of “a nation of 150 million being served by hand by a small group of painters” was over. There is a tiny photograph here – taken by whom? – showing Mayakovsky dead by his own hand, blood on his shirt, mouth horribly agape. Red Star Over Russia is filled with such revelations. It is not theatrically installed so much as tightly curated to hold the eye fast to images of extraordinary significance and power. And for every magnificent fiction of workers uniting to overthrow tyranny there is a levelling truth. Stalin’s second wife, Nadezhda, slips furtively past on a Moscow street, brows down, not long before she kills herself. Photographs of the storming of the Winter Palace are shown to be heavily confected and retouched. The poster artists of the early days of the revolution reappear at the end of the show in secret police mugshots, on their way to disappearance or public death. And among them, most devastating of all, is the face of Grigory Zinoviev, once head of the Communist International. His show trial in 1936 ushered in the Great Terror, but he is not afraid. Instead, Zinoviev looks his fate in the eye with disillusioned anger. • Red Star Over Russia: A Revolution in Visual Culture 1905-55 is at Tate Modern, London, until 18 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/nov/09/the-guardian-view-on-pesticides-give-bees-a-chance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T19:25:33Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on pesticides: give bees a chance | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/the-guardian-view-on-pesticides-give-bees-a-chance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/the-guardian-view-on-pesticides-give-bees-a-chance","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on pesticides: give bees a chance","bodyText":"Michael Gove, the leading Brexiter who’s now in charge of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is a natural iconoclast, sometimes a valuable characteristic in government.

Prominent journalists traveling with Trump and back in the US erupted at the gagging of press at a joint appearance by the US and Chinese leaders in Beijing on Thursday. And they quickly won support from former White House media relations staff, two sets of professionals who are traditionally more used to acting as sparring partners in public, not allies. “The Chinese try this every time. It’s a test of will and principle. Letting them dictate press access is an embarrassing capitulation,” Jay Carney, former press secretary to Barack Obama when he was president, posted on Twitter. Brad Dayspring, who arranged media facilities for George W Bush as his deputy director of press advance also criticized the White House’s decision. “Weeks are spent negotiating every aspect of [president’s] foreign travel, including press access. China often attempts to pull back previously agreed-to access on day of events. It’s job of White House staff to push back on matters they prioritize. Acquiescence = bad negotiating or agreement with the Chinese,” he wrote on Twitter. Another former White House press aide, Gregg Pitts, who worked for George W Bush spoke of pushing back during a visit to China when the Chinese authorities had tried to limit access to the internet for journalists traveling with the US president and sought to silence any questions. He added: “I worked at the White House for President Bush. China regularly insisted on ‘no questions’ during our travel there. Our team fought for greater press access, including questions.” The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, defended the decision. “It was at the Chinese insistence there were no questions today,” she said. Meanwhile, several journalists pointed out that despite the outrage, the situation was not unprecedented. During a joint press appearance by Barack Obama and the then president of China, Hu Jintao, in Beijing in 2009, the men would not take questions from the press, instead issuing a short statement following hours of high-level bilateral negotiations on subjects as pivotal as climate change and trade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/11/monocle-magazine-apartment-tyler-brule","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-11T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"Monocle: you've seen the magazine – now buy the apartment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/11/monocle-magazine-apartment-tyler-brule","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/11/monocle-magazine-apartment-tyler-brule","fields":{"headline":"Monocle: you've seen the magazine – now buy the apartment","bodyText":"You might have read the magazine, had a nose around the shops and cafes or listened to its 24-hour radio station. Soon – if you’ve got enough money – you’ll be able to buy your own piece of Monocle real estate as the global luxury lifestyle brand prepares to launch up to a dozen apartment buildings across the world. Tyler Brûlé, Monocle’s founder and chairman, is working on plans to launch a high-end apartment complex in Bangkok in partnership with a luxury Thai property developer. Monocle is the latest upmarket brand to team up with property developers, following ventures launched by Bulgari, Armani and Aston Martin. If the Bangkok project proves successful, Brûlé said the style and travel magazine could launch bespoke residences in a dozen world cities. Brûlé said that after devoting “countless” issues of Monocle to how to create the perfect apartment, the pressure is on to convert those sleek design spreads into reality. “We have had a lot of fantasies about it,” Brûlé, 48, said. “Now we have to come good on those fantasies. “We won’t be creating Monocle Towers,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “We will create a new identity. It will be completely fresh. [But] we will use our readership base and design for them. “We don’t see it [the Bangkok project] as a one-off, we see 10 to 12 cities we could do it in. We know where our readers are and where they travel, and we know what they like.” The Bangkok project is in partnership with Sansiri, a $2bn (£1.5bn) Thai real estate developer which this week bought a 12.5% stake in Monocle for $6m. The investment values the 10-year-old magazine at about $47m. Brûlé, a Financial Times columnist and former war correspondent who was shot in the hand while on assignment in Afghanistan in 1994, and his family retain a 72% stake worth just under $34m. Sansiri’s investment values Monocle – which has already branched out into guide books, a chain of boutiques, coffee shops and a 24-hour digital radio station – at considerably less than the $115m valuation it achieved when Nikkei, the Japanese owner of the FT, bought a 2.4% stake in 2014. Brûlé began the magazine in 2007 with a £3m investment – backed by the windfall from selling Wallpaper*, his previous magazine, to Time Inc for a reported $1.6m in 1997. Brûlé said he was “thrilled” with the Sansiri valuation, even if it is lower than the loftier price achieved by the Nikkei deal when, as Brûlé admits, “everyone was doing a dance on our side”. “We’re not fretting about the [Sansiri] valuation. We still own 70% of the company, and I’m not looking to buy a vineyard. If I were I would be more concerned about the valuation,” he said. “We’re not publicly traded. We can do what we want.” Brûlé said most of the money made from the magazine gets reinvested in the product. “There are no vineyards – I’m never going to have a garage of antique cars. There is the odd painting here and there.” He rents a house in Zurich and an apartment in London. But the Canadian journalist-turned-entrepreneur said he spends most of his time on the road, particularly in south-east Asia where he plans to open a new bureau. Monocle is exploiting a growing trend of luxury names using their recognition among the wealthy to partner with property developers. Aston Martin recently broke ground on a 66-storey tower in Miami with an infinity pool on the roof, an art gallery, two cinemas and an Aston Martin supercar parked in the lobby. The 391 apartments will range in cost from $600,000 for a 700 sq ft space to $50m for a 19,000 sq ft penthouse. Armani already has its own 57-storey luxury tower on Miami beach, and another in Dubai. In London, luxury goods group LVMH opened the Bulgari-branded hotel and residences in Knightsbridge. The complex, which says its “aim is to convey the excitement of the Bulgari brand, its timeless glamour and its heritage of magnificent Roman jeweller”, quickly became London’s most expensive hotel, charging more than the Ritz and the Savoy. There are Bulgari residences in Milan, Bali and Beijing, and more planned in Dubai, Shanghai and Moscow. Henry Pyror, a luxury property buying agent, said high-end brands are “cashing in on their appeal to the super-rich”. “The Candy brothers blazed a trail with One Hyde Park,” Pryor said. “That became the brand that friends liked to boast about over lunch on Cap Ferrat. It has amazing sex appeal and now other brands are trying to ape that. “That’s what Aston Martin and Monocle are looking at doing, and there are undoubtedly a lot of other luxury brands out there thinking about doing the same.” Branding expert Mark Borkowski said Monocle residences could prove very popular as the magazine has developed a devoted audience among the rich. “Tyler is one of the most networked people in the world – a sort of global citizen, and he is always there to take the next opportunity,” he said. “He has successfully expanded the brand into shops, podcasts and cafes and very neat and stylised guides. The magazine’s trend-setting insights have obsessed the rich globally from Helsinki to Hanoi. “This is another expansion of the brand, and it’s in Asia where the brand is very big. It could be something very interesting and of a totally new scale.” Monocle’s 81,500 readers are dream customers for advertisers and property developers. These are rich, high-powered and highly travelled people in their late 30s and early 40s with plenty of disposable income. Brûlé said it was hard to pigeonhole a typical Monocle reader, but the “hard data says core readers are 70% male, with the vast majority working in finance or running their own business”. The average age is 39, but he has got emails from readers as young as 19. Advertising and content, Brûlé said, are fluid concepts at Monocle. “It’s all blurred today, isn’t it?,” he said. “The majority is traditional advertising – buying the opening spread is what drives us. [But] there’s no question that 30%-40% of [revenue] is from special partnerships.” The current issue – a special on Switzerland – has a Rolex advert for its opening spread, followed by spreads for Louis Vuitton, Saint Laurent and Swiss Airlines before readers get to any content. Among interviews with the president of Iceland and the defence minister of Colombia are 62 pages on Switzerland and barely disguised sponsored content for Fairmont Hotels, private Swiss bank Lombard Odier and Conrad Hotels. Patrons sipping lattes and cappuccinos at the Monocle cafe in London’s Marylebone district said they’d be keen to move into a Monocle-designed apartment if they could afford it. “It makes sense for them to do it,” said Ali Monazah, a film producer who frequents the cafe daily. “It’s for niche, it’s for the man who makes £200,000-£300,000 a year and travels 10 times a year. I’d live there if I could afford it, but I’m not quite in that wage bracket yet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/nov/10/barclays-posts-pin-numbers-with-debit-cards","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T11:39:03Z","webTitle":"Barclays in major security breach as it admits posting out pin numbers with new cards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/10/barclays-posts-pin-numbers-with-debit-cards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/nov/10/barclays-posts-pin-numbers-with-debit-cards","fields":{"headline":"Barclays in major security breach as it admits posting out pin numbers with new cards","bodyText":"Barclays has admitted it has a “known” technical problem that is resulting in thousands of letters containing pin numbers being sent out in the post alongside new debit cards. In the wrong hands, the card and pin can be used to empty a Barclays account, with customers facing a massive battle to get their money back. The bank is in the middle of replacing the sort codes of at least 900,000 customers and, as a result, is sending out large numbers of replacement debit cards with the new codes. However, it has emerged that a technical problem has resulted in many customers also being sent letters that contain their four-digit pin number, sometimes in the same post, albeit in a different envelope. The bank claims the problem affects “less than 1%” of customers, but it has grave implications for any Barclays account holders whose card and pin letter get lost in the post. Last week, Money reported how Barclays had refused to refund a customer the £6,000 taken from her account after thieves had stolen her replacement debit card before it reached her north London home. Fran Pitcher was adamant she had not disclosed her pin number to anyone. But Barclays declined to refund her on the basis that the correct pin had been used to access the money – mostly from ATMs – and therefore she must have been negligent. At the time, Pitcher, a Barclays customer for more than 40 years, said she been sent an unsolicited pin with her second card. The bank said it had not sent out a pin letter with the stolen card, but she said it was the only logical explanation. Within hours of publishing her story, Money was contacted by Colin Rose from Bristol who said he was appalled to have read it, not least as he could have found himself in the same position. The previous day, Barclays had sent him a new debit card and a letter containing his pin number. They arrived in the same postal delivery. Fearful he could have become a victim of bank incompetence, he says he spent hours on the phone to Barclays, only to be told it was a “known issue” that was affecting some customers. “I was alarmed, as in the wrong hands it would have allowed immediate and full access to our bank account,” Rose says. “Barclays customer services were unable to tell me where and how the despatch of the pin letter would have been recorded and how that data might be accessed, if needed, by a customer. The only thing the call handler could suggest was the filing of a subject access request, which might or might not reveal that it had been logged. That’s not a good enough explanation.” Rose, a Barclays customer of 50 years, says the episode has left him wondering whether he should continue to bank with it. “It is not clear that it has total command of data and communication systems that customers are entitled to expect these days. Its casual incompetence and the experience of Mrs Pitcher is worrying.” Barclays’ reputation has suffered in recent years, with the bank frequently coming out worst in customer service and complaints tables. In September, Which? said Barclays’ complaints score was the second worst among the big banks, while in October, the Financial Conduct Authority said Barclays had the single highest number of complaints in the first six months of 2017, although the Lloyds group (which includes Halifax) scored the worst. A spokesman for Barclays told Money: “We take the protection of customers’ funds and data extremely seriously. We acknowledge that for less than 1% of customers receiving a replacement debit card, they also received a pin. Our records show that for this small number of customers, the debit cards have been safely received with no known fraud occurring. “We have thoroughly reviewed the complaint from Mrs Pitcher and can confirm that no pin was issued with the replacement debit card.” The Financial Conduct Authority has made it clear that a bank must refund customers any “unauthorised” transactions that appear on their account. The regulator has said that a bank cannot simply say that the use of a pin “conclusively proves” it was authorised. But that is what Barclays appears to have done in Pitcher’s case. The bank is overhauling its sort codes because it, like many others, has been forced to rejig its business ahead of the introduction of rules that require banks to ring-fence high street operations from riskier investment banking activities. The rules, which come into force at the start of 2019, are named after Sir John Vickers, who recommended this course of action in 2011 after the financial crisis. The Bank of England has estimated that about one million customers could be affected, which suggests that Barclays is far more affected than any other major bank. Meanwhile, Pitcher says the fight to get her money back goes on and she has engaged a financial expert to help her. “As far as I am aware, Barclays refuses to send out debit cards by registered post, presumably because it costs more,” she says. “It also won’t let customers collect cards in the branch. Other banks send cards that can only be used once the customer has activated them. If Barclays had any of these I wouldn’t be facing a battle to get my £6,000. The bank has behaved disgracefully.” Barclays and TSB forced to repay fraud victims The two banks at the centre of a payment fraud previously highlighted by Guardian Money have been forced to jointly refund a couple £37,536 by the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). TSB and Barclays had initially blamed each other’s failures, after an elderly couple from Yorkshire were defrauded of their life savings – £134,000 – in 2016. Fraudsters posing as investigators from TSB had claimed they needed help from the couple to catch dodgy staff at the local branch. Over several weeks, the scammers managed to convince the couple to make 16 payments into bank accounts they were told were in their own names, or that of other family members. In fact, the payments went into current accounts at Barclays branches dotted around the country. One of the payments, for £47,000, was made in person by one of the victims in their local TSB branch. According to the FOS report, branch staff were so concerned it was a scam that they phoned Barclays to check that the account the money was due to paid into was in the victim’s name. However, Barclays refused to confirm that, citing the Data Protection Act. The TSB staff member insisted on being put through to Barclays’ fraud department. After explaining he was worried it was a scam, the Barclays adviser still refused to confirm the account name. Despite these doubts, the payment was made. Following Money’s intervention, almost £10,000 was recovered from a Slough-based account. The FOS report says Barclays has accepted it could have done more and has agreed to pay half the losses, (£18,768) plus 8% interest. TSB should have halted the payment, said FOS, and therefore has been told to pay the same. Money understands there is an ongoing police investigation into the matter. The police have said they are exploring whether the bank that received the stolen funds might have been expected to ensure the account was not being operated by criminals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/nov/16/secretary-general-puts-countering-terrorism-at-heart-of-un-agenda","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-16T17:06:52Z","webTitle":"Respect for human rights can prevent 'vicious cycle' of terrorism, says UN chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/16/secretary-general-puts-countering-terrorism-at-heart-of-un-agenda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/nov/16/secretary-general-puts-countering-terrorism-at-heart-of-un-agenda","fields":{"headline":"Respect for human rights can prevent 'vicious cycle' of terrorism, says UN chief","bodyText":"The world faces an unprecedented terrorist threat which finds its best breeding ground in countries that suppress human rights, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said in a major speech designed to put countering terrorism at the heart of the UN’s agenda. Speaking in the UK at Soas University of London, Guterres argued that upholding human rights and the rule of law was the safest way to prevent “a vicious circle of instability and resentment”. “Societies based on respect for human rights and with economic opportunities for all represent the most tangible and meaningful alternative to the recruitment strategies of terrorist groups,” he said. His remarks on Thursday will be seen as an effort to disprove criticism from those such as Donald Trump that the UN is irrelevant to contemporary global challenges. His tone is likely to prove controversial with those authoritarian Middle East states that claim it was the pro-democracy Arab Spring protests that unleashed instability, insecurity and dangerous forces. The speech will also disappoint some by not making any direct reference to the role of extremist Islam in spreading intolerance and violence. But his intervention marks an attempt to argue that an updated UN agenda focused on economic development and individual rights could put the organisation at the forefront in the fight to prevent violence by states and non-state actors, such as terrorist groups. Guterres warned that terrorism had become “an unprecedented threat to international peace, security and development”. “Although the spotlight tends to focus on terrorism in the west, we should never forget that the vast majority of terrorist attacks take place in developing countries,” he said. “In 2016, nearly three-quarters of all deaths caused by terrorism were in just five states: Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria and Somalia, all countries with huge humanitarian needs.” In Africa, he said studies showed “lack of education and poverty were factors behind radicalisation, and violent extremism”. But, he added, “the final tipping point was often state violence and abuse of power”. As a result, he said, “93% of all terrorist attacks between 1989 and 2014 occurred in countries with high levels of extrajudicial deaths, torture and imprisonment without trial”. “Terrorist groups, including Daesh [as Islamic State is known in Arab countries] and al-Qaida thrive in conflict zones – Iraq, Syria and Libya most notably,” he said. “Violations of international humanitarian law are correlated with protracted conflict and radicalisation.” In remarks aimed at authoritarian states in the Middle East, as well as modern western democracies, he warned counter-terrorist policies were “too often being used to suppress peaceful protests and legitimate opposition movements, to shut down debate, to target and detain human rights defenders and to stigmatise minorities. Such measures do not contribute to lasting peace. Instead, they may contribute to lasting instability and resentment, generating chaos.” He said the best way to “combat the terrorists’ claim to be punishing people they accuse of betrayal or exploitation” was to point to robust judicial systems and legal accountability. “Terrorism thrives wherever there is resentment, humiliation, lack of education. Terrorism thrives when disenfranchised people meet nothing but indifference and nihilism. It is deeply rooted in hopelessness and despair. “That is why human rights, all human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, are unquestionably a part of the solution in fighting terrorism. “We must address messages of hate with inclusivity, diversity, the protection of minorities and vulnerable people.” That message, Guterres said, had to be extended to fighting media stereotyping and blaming specific communities. He said: “We all have a responsibility to base our narratives on facts, and to avoid doing the terrorists’ work for them by demonising and stigmatising certain groups. “In some countries, the majority of terrorist plots and attacks are perpetrated by rightwing extremist groups. And yet the media focuses far more on attacks by immigrants or members of ethnic and religious minorities. “Refugees fleeing conflict are frequently targeted. It is a horrible distortion of their plight, to accuse victims of terrorism of the crime they have just fled.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jan/25/david-yarrow-best-photograph-wolf-wild-west-saloon","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T08:29:55Z","webTitle":"David Yarrow's best photograph: a wolf on the prowl in a wild west saloon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/25/david-yarrow-best-photograph-wolf-wild-west-saloon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/25/david-yarrow-best-photograph-wolf-wild-west-saloon","fields":{"headline":"David Yarrow's best photograph: a wolf on the prowl in a wild west saloon","bodyText":"I have always felt a visceral pull towards ghost towns.

On this type of project, the right shot can take all day, and we were just about to wrap, as the light was fading and the temperature dropping. We’d planned to stop by the town bar, so we could warm up with a restorative drink. The bar was straight out of Pale Rider, exactly what you’d expect a wild west saloon to be. The barman, Rosie, had that world-weary look about him. There was a long wooden surface you could imagine glasses of beer sliding along, with a moose’s head and faded black and white photographs of the glory years on the walls. When I saw that late afternoon light catching the long bar, I realised I had to do this shot. So I asked Rosie if he minded us bringing a wolf into his bar. “What’ll he have?” he said in reply. And that’s how this photo happened. We decided everyone should behave as if a wolf in the bar was perfectly normal: Rosie would be pulling beers, a customer would be reading the paper, there’d be a game of pool going on. And the focus would be the wolf’s eyes – they had to be sharp. This meant the wolf had to be at eye level, so we used the bar as his catwalk. Now, he may have been trained but ultimately a wolf is still a wolf. The challenge was how to get him to walk towards my camera. Rosie unearthed some chicken fillets and we tied them around my neck. This proved effective: the wolf moved with some excitement towards me and we nailed the shot in four takes. Much of my wildlife work is done with a remote-control camera, which may be in place for weeks near a pride or a herd as I lurk in the brush nearby waiting for that perfect moment. Other projects are more conceptual: they involve a lot of research and planning, as well as a crew and a budget. A recent shoot I did in Namibia required three models, three roadies, one cheetah and two handlers. That wasn’t cheap, as we were in the desert and everyone had to be flown in. I pay for everything, because one big image can sell for $1m. We need to get it right, though, because a bad image will sell for nothing. Critics often take issue with the staged shots not being authentic. Others argue I put myself in unnecessary danger. I do not. Every risk is a calculated one. And, either way, we are doing some good. We are now able to raise £1m a year for Tusk, the elephant conservation charity. That matters most to me. I used to work in the City, and I like to think I am of more use now than I was sitting at my trading screen all day. A large print of this image now hangs proudly behind the bar. It has become a tourist attraction. I use it to prove a point: the day’s never over until it’s over. David Yarrow’s CV Born: Glasgow, 1966. Studied: Business at Edinburgh University.

The Pumas have lost 17 of their 22 matches since reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 Rugby World Cup but Hourcade expects England to be the more anxious of the sides at Twickenham because everyone has already written off his team. “The pressure is more for England,” he claimed. “They are No2 in the world and we are No10. We are playing here in their stadium in November in the last part of our season. I think England has more pressure. If we lose it will be logical, if they lose …” At that point the coach smiled and shrugged his shoulders, before asking: “Who has the pressure?” Hourcade was quick to describe Jones as a “magnificent” coach before pointedly suggesting his rival’s barbs were not necessarily to be taken seriously. “He has trained a different type of team on different levels – Australia, Japan and now England – and with all of them he has done a magnificent job,” the Argentinian said. “That speaks all about him, he is a great coach and he is bringing England to very good things. But when it comes to mind games we all know how he is. Perhaps some things he says that are not true. We will do our talking on the pitch.” Few are giving the Pumas much hope given they have managed only one win in 2017, at home against Georgia in June. But Argentina’s assistant coach, Pablo Bouza, insists there have been several optimistic signs amid the defeats, pointing out Argentina led in several matches – including at half-time in New Zealand – only to fail to maintain their challenge. “It’s not our fitness, though,” he said. “It’s about making unforced errors, our mentality and our decision-making, and we are working [on] these things.” Hourcade admitted his frustration at losing twice to England at home last summer – the first Test was close at 38-34 and the second finished 35-25 – despite facing a team without many of their best players owing to the concurrent Lions tour. “We took the eye off the ball in the first Test, lost the opportunity to win because we dominated most of the game and we didn’t win,” he said. “The second game was a little bit more equal and we had the opportunity to win that too. But Saturday will be a new opportunity.” Argentina’s record against England is hardly anything to shout about – they have won only four of 22 Tests – and they have not defeated them at Twickenham since 2006. Hourcade hopes Juan Martín Hernández can rediscover top form after giving the 35-year-old fly-half a surprise start. “Time moves on for everyone, but Juan Martín has got a lot of experience,” he said. “Everyone knows what a good player he is, and we want to take advantage of that for this game. “He is a player who has the capacity to adapt to any type of game. The team he used to play with before, they played from the 10 and he was the conductor. Now our gameplan is a little more dynamic, we start playing from the No9 and he adapts very well to that also.” Hernández is restored in an attempt to inspire a backline that scored only 11 tries in six matches of the Rugby Championship and failed to register a point in the standings for the first time since their debut in 2012. He replaces Nicolás Sánchez, who was their leading points scorer at the 2015 World Cup in England but has struggled this year with his goal-kicking. Hourcade insists he has seen enough weak points in Jones’s side to at least raise the possibility of a huge upset. “England are a complete team,” he conceded. “They are really efficient, on top of all, but they have some weak points. Our strategy will be to attack those weak points.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/10/us-switches-focus-of-its-bonn-event-from-clean-energy-to-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-10T16:41:38Z","webTitle":"US switches focus of its Bonn event from clean energy to fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/10/us-switches-focus-of-its-bonn-event-from-clean-energy-to-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/10/us-switches-focus-of-its-bonn-event-from-clean-energy-to-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"US switches focus of its Bonn event from clean energy to fossil fuels","bodyText":"The US has changed the focus of one of its few public events at the Bonn climate talks to emphasise coal and nuclear power, in a sign of the Trump administration’s goals at the talks. An event next Monday, opening the second week of the ongoing UN negotiations, was originally billed as promoting clean energy. However, it has since been changed to emphasise coal and nuclear power. The event was first billed with the title Action on Spurring Innovation and Deploying Advanced Technologies but was subsequently changed. The same event has now been retitled to: The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation. The speakers are listed as the same, but the explanation of the event’s focus has also changed markedly, from talk of “innovative solutions” and “transforming development pathways” to a strong statement in favour of fossil fuels. It now reads: “It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone’s interest that they be efficient and clean. This panel will explore how the US will be a leader in cutting carbon emissions through cleaner, more efficient fossil fuels and other energy sources.” There was no explanation of the change. A US state department official declined to comment before the event but noted it would be open to all at the conference. However, observers said the change was in line with the US government’s stance at the talks, which are focused on how to improve countries’ carbon-cutting targets under the Paris agreement of 2015. Andrew Light of the World Resources Institute said: “Whoever the Trump administration is trying to target with this event, it isn’t people in the negotiating hall – they’re clearly focused on the booming global markets in renewable energy. At best, this event will be a curiosity, given the isolation of the US now in the international process.” Although US president Donald Trump has begun the process of removing the US from the Paris agreement, this will not take effect, under the UN processes, until 2020. This means the US is still a party to the agreement and still present at the talks. However, for the first time in at least a decade, the US has no visible official representation. Under Obama, there was always a large US pavilion at the annual meetings – and even under George W Bush, who vowed to keep the US out of the Kyoto protocol even when other countries had ratified it and brought it into force in 2005. At Bonn, the US occupies a small locked room that often seems unoccupied. There is no pavilion, and Monday’s event on coal and nuclear power is the first public sign of the US government’s engagement, though the UN said US delegates were present at at least some of the many meetings taking place around the event."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/09/number-of-uk-crack-users-seeking-help-to-beat-addiction-is-up-23","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-09T17:23:39Z","webTitle":"Number of UK crack users seeking help to beat addiction is up 23%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/09/number-of-uk-crack-users-seeking-help-to-beat-addiction-is-up-23","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/09/number-of-uk-crack-users-seeking-help-to-beat-addiction-is-up-23","fields":{"headline":"Number of UK crack users seeking help to beat addiction is up 23%","bodyText":"The number of crack users seeking help to beat their addictions has risen 23% in a year, even as the overall number of people accessing drug treatment services has continued to decline, figures show. National Drug Treatment Monitoring System figures show 3,657 people asked for help to stop using the smokable form of cocaine in the year to April 2016, compared with 2,980 in the previous year. There was a 12% increase in people seeking to beat an addiction to both crack and opiates – such as heroin – in the same period, to 21,854. Overall, opiate use remained the most common reason to seek help, with just over half of patients battling addictions to heroin, methadone and similar substances. But the sharp rise in numbers asking for help with crack addiction sparked concerns, after a much smaller rise of 3% the previous year. Separate data, released on Thursday by the Home Office, showed a 16% rise in seizures of crack in the year to April 2017. Overall, 279,793 people accessed drug treatment services in England in the year to April 2017, of whom 69% were male and 90% were white. The overall number of crack users in England has risen 10% between 2010 and 2015, to 182,828, according to an estimate by the Public Health Institute at Liverpool John Moores University in September. The NDTMS report, published on Thursday, agreed that the increase in the numbers seeking treatment for crack addiction probably reflected a rise in the use of the drug. “This increase in the number of new users may be in part caused by changes in the purity and affordability of crack cocaine over the last few years,” the report said. In a blogpost accompanying the release, Rosanna O’Connor, a drugs expert at Public Health England, speculated that changes in drug supply networks, including the “county lines” phenomenon, where metropolitan drug gangs are branching out to establish outposts in provincial towns, may also be playing a role. Ian Hamilton, who researches drug treatment at the University of York, said Thursday’s announcement on the rise in crack seizures backed up PHE’s speculation. “You can bet your bottom dollar that if the Home Office are reporting greater seizures the price is coming down, because that means for every one they seize they’ll be ten that will get by,” Hamilton said. “So that would definitely indicate that price is coming down of crack, and it may just be that, it may just be a price-led thing where it’s cheap and it’s easy to get hold of.” He added: “Health economists have this rule that price and availability drive drug use geographically, so whether you’re in Brixton or Bournemouth or Bolivia, if the price is sufficiently low and the drug sufficiently available then you’ll get that drug used in that area.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
