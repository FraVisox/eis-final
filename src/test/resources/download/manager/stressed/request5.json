The Liberal MP Warren Entsch, a longtime marriage equality advocate, introduced the cross-party bill, which passed the Senate last week, to the lower house on Monday for a week-long debate to legislate the social reform. Entsch said the bill was “about marriage and only about marriage” and “nothing in [it] takes away existing rights and freedoms”. The comments attempt to head off a call for further amendments after the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, indicated on Thursday he supported at least two changes to guarantee that charities would not be affected and to allow civil celebrants to refuse to solemnise weddings. While several Liberal supporters of same-sex marriage, including Trevor Evans and Trent Zimmerman, praised the cross-party bill they have not ruled out supporting amendments, leaving marriage equality advocates nervous that success in defeating them is not assured. In his speech to the house, Turnbull credited the Australian people for the “remarkable” 80% turnout in the postal survey, claiming it proved that “Australians wanted to have their say”. Turnbull said the postal survey – in which 61.6% of respondents approved of same-sex marriage – “had many opponents” but had given the “ultimate democratic seal” to the reform. “In fact, this moment would’ve come far sooner if the opposition had supported our original plebiscite proposal in this parliament,” he said. The prime minister attacked Labor for doing “nothing” about marriage equality in its six years in government and said it was “ a matter of great regret” that Labor was “denying its members a free vote” on the amendments. Labor voted down all substantive amendments in the Senate and is set to do the same in the lower house. The opposition disputes that its members did not have a free vote, saying instead that none of its members had asked to exercise a conscience vote. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said the postal survey had “reawakened old fears” in LGBTI Australians of “being shunned by friends and family”. He said the introduction of marriage equality was “an uplifting moment” in Australia’s history but parliamentarians had to “match our joy with our humility”. That included humility about the fact Australia had “trailed the world” on the social reform, and to seek forgiveness from LGBTI people for “injustices and indignities” and “for subjecting you and your relationships to public judgment”. Shorten said the survey result was not a “reflection in percentage terms” on LGBTI people’s worth, declaring they were “100% equal, 100% loved” 100% had the “right to live your life the way you want”. He said the bill did nothing to “limit the right of any person to lawfully worship, practise or observe or teach according to their religion”. “This bill is about extending a quality, not reducing liberty. Because enhancing the rights of one group of people does not diminish the freedoms of another. Fairness is not a finite resource. It has never been as zero-sum game.” In a speech that concluded with an emotional second proposal to his long-term fiance, Ryan Bolger, the Liberal MP Tim Wilson gave credit to Turnbull for finding a “pathway through the obstruction on both sides of this debate”. But in an extraordinary broadside to Coalition conservatives who had forced a national vote to “stop change at any cost” he said the political compromise had “disregarded parliamentary supremacy, representative democracy [and] fiscal prudence”. The parliamentary process now allowed the Liberal party to “properly return to its traditions and allows a free vote on a matter of conscience”, he said. The former prime minister Tony Abbott warned that the parliament should not replace “anti-gay prejudice of the past” with “a new politically correct bigotry”. Abbott “pledged to respect and facilitate the verdict of the Australian people” but indicated he would support amendments to respect freedom of speech, conscience, religion and parental rights. He also flagged that he would move a motion that people should not “suffer any adverse effects as a result of conscientiously holding a particular view of the nature of marriage”. Amendments to the cross-party bill are opposed by at least 73 MPs in Labor, Green Adam Bandt, the independent Andrew Wilkie and Entsch but at least one more vote is needed to vote them down. Entsch said amendments on free speech, discrimination, education, charity law and tax law were “all worthy causes and important debates but they don’t need to form part of this bill today”. The debate will be a marathon, with a list of more than 100 speakers set to take more than 20 hours to make their remarks. The second reading stage of the debate is expected to take all of Monday and Tuesday, with amendments debated on Wednesday and late sittings to deal with the bill before parliament rises on Thursday. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, has offered the opposition’s support to extend hours and shorten speeches to usher the bill through."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/06/bolzano-italian-town-defuse-controversial-monuments","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"A small Italian town can teach the world how to defuse controversial monuments | Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/bolzano-italian-town-defuse-controversial-monuments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/06/bolzano-italian-town-defuse-controversial-monuments","fields":{"headline":"A small Italian town can teach the world how to defuse controversial monuments","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Coming to terms with national history isn’t always easy. Whether because of civil war, political oppression, or simply a change of values, monuments and other vestiges of the past often remind us that what we held dear in other ages doesn’t necessarily chime with what we cherish today. The bitter controversy – and deadly protests – sparked earlier this year by the proposed removal of a statue of Gen Robert E Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, are a ringing reminder of this. The small northern Italian town of Bolzano may provide the model for a better way of dealing with such thorny issues. For several decades, what are now the town’s financial offices have been housed in a fascist-era building displaying a massive bas-relief of Benito Mussolini on horseback, bearing the slogan “Credere, Obbedire, Combattere” (“Believe, Obey, Combat”) on the side. Although Italy’s fascist past is officially condemned, the monument stood untouched until a 2011 directive from the national government formally required the municipal administration to do something about it. In the face of calls to both “destroy” and “preserve” the monument, the town opted for what appears in retrospect a far smarter strategy. A public bid was launched, soliciting ideas over how to “defuse and contextualize” the politically charged frieze. Open to artists, architects, historians, and “anyone involved in the cultural sphere”, the bid explicitly stated that the intention was to “transform the bas-relief into a place of memory … so that it will no longer be visible directly, but accessible thoughtfully, within an appropriately explanatory context”. Almost 500 proposals were submitted and evaluated by a jury composed of local civil society figures, including a history professor, a museum curator, an architect, an artist and a journalist. This jury recommended five proposals, voted upon by the municipal council. All the proposals and proceedings were documented online and open to public scrutiny. The winning proposal is as powerful as it is simple. Superimposed upon the bas-relief is now an LED-illuminated inscription of a quote by the German Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt that reads “Nobody has the right to obey” in the three local languages: Italian, German and Ladin. As the two artists who originally made the proposal, Arnold Holzknecht and Michele Bernardi, elucidate in their explanatory text, the “minimalism” of the intervention is explicitly meant to contrast the “grandiloquence” of the fascist-era style, whereas the content of the quotation is meant as a “direct answer” to the “invitation to blind obedience” contained in the fascist slogan. What is most important, however, is that the original monument remains visible through the inscription. This is meant to emphasize that memory – and therefore history – is not a “blank slate” on which we can arbitrarily write whatever happens to be congenial to us in the present. Rather, it is a process of sedimentation, by which the past is never completely effaced, but constantly reinterpreted through the lens of the present. The transformed monument therefore invites people to reflect on the town’s complex history in a way that is neither simply celebratory nor in denial, but rather contextualized – and for that reason all the more challenging and profound. A sign of its success is that it almost completely failed to generate controversy, either nationally or locally. Inaugurated with a purposely sober ceremony on 5 November, the installation only managed to stir the predictable recriminations of representatives from the local neo-fascist party, one of whom decried it as a “Taliban act” intended to “efface a portion of the country’s history”. The very fact that these objections so patently failed to grasp the point of the installation has given them little following. This local experiment with the politics of memory nonetheless deserves greater attention. Virtually all existing countries have to face difficult questions over how to relate to past instances of violence, injustice and oppression – often publicly sanctioned. Pretending the past never happened is clearly not a promising way of learning from it. But neither is passively accepting the past’s own way of representing itself to the future. Which is why contextualizing monuments from a troubled era, through a creative procedure that is at once inclusive, transparent and educational, may actually be the best solution. This is, after all, another way of reading the message contained in the quote from Hannah Arendt inscribed over the fascist monument in Bolzano. To say that “nobody has the right to obey” is a reminder that our actions are always the result of a choice – and therefore judgment – in the present. The quote by Hannah Arendt implies that we cannot in good faith disclaim responsibility for things we have the power to act upon – such as the monuments we inherit from our history. Even letting them stand untouched is a way of affirming something in the present. The question is what we want that message to be. Apparently, during the deliberations that preceded the decision to remove the statue of Robert E Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, a proposal was made to add more “historical context” to the monument. That might have been an opportunity for the city to come to terms more openly and inclusively with its troubled past, but the proposal was ultimately rejected. In contrast, the town of Bolzano has resolutely taken a stand in favor of freedom and civic courage. It is only to be hoped that other administrations facing similar problems around the world can live up to this model.

Just another day in DC? Kind of. The president in question is not Donald Trump, it’s Richard Nixon, the press secretary is Ron Ziegler, the editor is Ben Bradlee and the articles concerned Watergate. Nevertheless, “it’s deja vu,” said John Maggio, director of the documentary, The Newspaperman: The Life and Times of Ben Bradlee. “The parallels are astonishing to me.” Maggio had no idea what was around the corner when he started making the film in the summer of 2016, in the heat of the presidential election and two years after Bradlee died in 2014 at 93. “I assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win,” said Maggio. Then Trump became president and his frequent and personalized railing against much of the mainstream media descended into outright feud. Now Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has admitted lying to the FBI and is cooperating with the special investigation into who from the Trump administration and election campaign may have had links with the Russian government. Three days after Flynn appeared in court, Maggio’s documentary will replay scenes of senior Nixon officials facing the music in the political corruption scandal that brought down the president in 1974. “Nixon turned the press into the enemy. Watching Trump it’s like, page for page, the Nixon playbook,” Maggio told the Guardian. The documentary is also a reminder that the Watergate catastrophe took two years to play out. Even after the Washington Post had many scoops exposing ever more of the conspiracy and cover-up jigsaw, Nixon won a re-election landslide in 1972. The Newspaperman describes Nixon’s “vendetta” against the Post and plays a tape of Nixon’s right-hand man, Henry Kissinger, saying: “This Ben Bradlee is a tough, mean cynic.” The president is heard concurring that the editor is “a mean bastard”, and later calls the Post’s reporting “outrageous, distorted” and “hysterical”. But Bradlee’s third wife, Sally Quinn, told the Guardian: “He never went after Nixon personally, it wasn’t personal for Ben.” Bradlee’s voice is heard throughout the documentary reading the audio version of his memoir. “The air was thick with lies and the president was the chief liar,” says Bradlee’s voiceover, of Nixon. Quinn’s favorite adjective for Bradlee is “swashbuckling”. Senior journalists describe him as fearless. His sense of invincibility was forged while battling to recover from polio as a teenager, then serving as a young officer in the South Pacific during the second world war. A documentary about a newspaper editor always risks boring viewers with journalism’s equivalent of inside baseball, no matter his charisma and track record. But not when this is the real life version of Hollywood’s All the President’s Men, which dramatized the Post’s exposure of the Watergate debacle and made Bradlee, as the documentary says, the “first celebrity editor”. And the early part of the film is filled with sumptuous archive footage of Bradlee and his second wife Antoinette, AKA Tony, hanging out socially with John and Jackie Kennedy. Riveting shots show the handsome four larking around on golf carts and sipping summer cocktails on yachts in the blue, blue waters off New England. It’s always undeniably mesmerizing to watch the unwitting JFK, us knowing that his mischievous grin and magnetism are about to be snuffed out with his 1963 assassination. Here, there’s extra fascination, also unsettling, as your attention is drawn away from the electric Kennedys to Ben and Tony, right by their side. Bradlee worked for Newsweek at the time but ended up in JFK’s inner, inner circle, where the line between friend and journalist blurred. Ben and Tony would dine at the White House and Bradlee would sometimes fly with the president. “It was inappropriate and he was driving his Time competitors crazy,” NBC veteran Tom Brokaw comments. Tina Brown, former New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Daily Beast editor, says of JFK and Bradlee, both sons of Boston: “They were brothers in style. If Ben Bradlee had been a politician he would have been a Kennedy.” The film charts Bradlee’s discovery of his wild side as a glamorous foreign correspondent for Newsweek in Paris in the 50s. Over footage of skiing in the Alps and gossipy parties, Bradlee unabashedly describes cheating on his first wife, then leaving her, acting with “recklessness and thoughtlessness” and causing misery for his seven-year-old son. “I don’t think he’s ever had a moment of guilt in his life, honestly,” says Sally Quinn on camera. When publisher Katherine Graham appointed Bradlee executive editor of the Washington Post in 1968, “it was a second-rate provincial newspaper,” veteran Washington Post journalist Robert Kaiser says in the film. Bradlee began turning it into a national contender. But he reveals being sick to his stomach when the pre-eminent New York Times beat him with its Pentagon Papers mega-scoop in 1971 – thousands of leaked classified documents showing the government had lied about how badly the Vietnam war was going in the mid-60s, and covering up bombing campaigns in Cambodia and Laos. After the government won an injunction to block further publication on the grounds of national security, Bradlee and Graham, against legal advice, went to court and triumphed in a landmark supreme court victory for freedom of the press under the first amendment. Stills in the film show the two practically jumping for joy as they can begin publishing new excerpts in their newspaper. “National security wasn’t the issue, national embarrassment was the issue!” PBS journalist Jim Lehrer scoffs at the White House. A Steven Spielberg dramatization of the battle, called The Post, hits the big screen in December. “The first amendment was Ben’s religion,” Quinn said. The documentary cites the Pentagon Papers triumph in the emboldening of the Post team that later doggedly and audaciously pursued their Watergate coverage, while other papers held back and the White House exerted ferocious pressure. Star reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reminisce fondly about the irascible Bradlee’s habitual yelling and profanity as he drove them onward. But the film also alludes to hubris at the paper in the years that followed, which ultimately contributed to the fiasco of the Post publishing a fake story about a child heroin addict. Upon discovering it had been duped by its own reporter, the Post handed back the 1981 Pulitzer Prize. Bradlee then made the unconventional decision to publish a forensic, 18,000-word mea culpa and analysis of the catastrophe. “This became the template for what you do when you screw up,” says New Yorker editor David Remnick. Bradlee retired from the Washington Post in 1991, which seems an awfully long time ago now. Yet his battles are still being fought in principle, and his mantras are evergreen. With Bradlee under siege over Watergate, he says, simply: “We hunker down and go about our business, which is not to be loved but to go after the truth.” Deja vu.

Politicians are the last people who should be managing such a complex and precious estate on their own. Those who oversaw Augustus Pugin and Charles Barry, as they struggled to build the thing in the 19th century, have been described as “probably the worst clients in Britain”, and their successors have ever since strived to live up to that dictum. But the palace is nonetheless valuable, as a work of art, a symbol and a location with a richer, and more enriching, history than any other in the UK. We should encourage parliament to know that making the building safe, accessible and sustainable, while restoring and respecting its architectural heritage, is a project of international significance that, done well, would display courage and vision and earn the nation’s respect. Sadly, proceedings in Westminster Hall are not encouraging. The roof is being fixed, but historians and archaeologists have been excluded from the project, with a baseless argument about cost. Without archaeologists on board, one of the great wonders of the medieval world – and the greatest treasure in this world heritage site – is at risk of compromise. We have asked, but have been given no convincing reasons for this situation. It seems parliament lags far behind the country’s appreciation of our heritage. Mike Pitts Editor, British Archaeology • In addition to the many issues raised by Charlotte Higgins’ excellent article, we must hope that lessons have been learned from the unfortunate experience at Westminster Hall. The finest medieval roof in the world is to be cleaned and repaired, and the erection of scaffolding provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a thorough archaeological investigation. This should include an examination of how the roof was erected and dendrochronological dating. Moreover, the carved angels on the roof and their shields were almost certainly painted, and need to be expertly examined for traces of paint which may be destroyed in the cleaning process. The hall roof fiasco must make everyone worry about what might happen when the far larger restoration and renewal project happens. Tim Tatton-Brown Consultant archaeologist, Salisbury • The Palace of Westminster is not fit for purpose. Here’s the solution. Sell the whole lot off to a developer; after making sufficient repairs for safety it can be opened as a highly profitable tourist attraction. Build the new Houses of Parliament at the centre of Great Britain (round about Skipton, North Yorkshire, I think). A modern complex would provide comfortable accommodation and services for MPs (no more expenses for second homes). The parliament buildings themselves would be circular, encouraging constructive debate. We should take this opportunity to abolish political parties. Constituents could then elect their MPs on the basis of their credentials rather than feeling obliged to support sleazy or corrupt individuals just because they represent the favoured party.

The people who say it think they’re being original. They’re not. Being a vicar is an enormous privilege, but it is also hard work and the clergy can pay a heavy emotional price. So when I read that the Rev Andy Thewlis in Wiltshire had written a strongly worded letter to his congregation for what he perceived as their lack of warmth – a letter for which he has since issued an apology – I wasn’t remotely surprised. He said his enthusiasm had been sapped by “grumbling and disunity”, also complaining about “arrogant gossips” and “criticism and negativity”. It “drains energy”, he said. Every case is different. But all clergy will recognise something of this. The demands are many. A typical day for a member of the clergy begins with morning prayer, reading from the Bible and mentioning to God the needs of the whole community. They can then find themselves going from a lively school assembly to a visit to a bereaved parishioner to plan a funeral service. They may then attend a meeting to discuss repair works to a listed building, take a communion service in an old people’s home, liaise with organists to choose next month’s liturgical music, report a potential safeguarding concern, and in the evening chair a meeting of the parochial church council. No day is quite the same, which is one of the great things about being a vicar. But a schedule requiring such mental, spiritual and emotional agility can take its toll. One of the things that is sometimes forgotten is that vicars are (or should be) theologians. It isn’t good enough for the vicar simply to have his or her opinions about God and the world. Theology is a serious academic discipline. So what the vicar says about God has to be doctrinally defensible. But it also has to be kind and accessible. Sometimes that seems like a tall order, which means tired clergy either retreat into well-worn platitudes or become regarded as ivory-tower intellectuals in a society increasingly suspicious of experts. It is exciting to be a person of study and prayer in a community, pointing to God and the possibility of new creation in an often weary world. It is also incredibly draining, and sometimes the pressure becomes a bit too much. I don’t know the specifics of what made Thewlis write the letter to his congregation. But all the clergy I have spoken to know how it feels to want to write that sort of letter. In particular, he says he perceived a lack of warmth among the people he served. That can be very painful for the clergy, who have often moved significant distances to live in a community they don’t know very well, to do a hard job with a lot of public exposure. It doesn’t take more than a few people who are adept at finding fault, or who resent a new person in their community exercising leadership and making decisions, to feel vulnerable and isolated. A throwaway unkind comment or a hastily written angry email can eat away at a parish priest for days. When I was in parish ministry I was very fortunate in many ways. I was able to work with some very gifted laypeople. But even when things are good, a vicar is aware of all the things that aren’t. Someone just out of hospital still needs visiting. The parish share, the money parishes send to the diocese to pay for ministry costs, has to be raised. A significant person in the congregation is cross because he doesn’t think he was consulted when he should have been. The Sunday school needs a new leader. Numbers at Sunday worship seem to be down. It all adds up. Jesus said his followers should turn the other cheek. Clergy often have to do so. But that doesn’t mean wrongdoing should never be confronted. Sometimes it is absolutely right to name what is wrong, so that something can be done about it. One clergy colleague, who happens to be gay, found she was being accused by local gossips of having an affair with a (married) male member of her congregation. Should she have let it go? I don’t think so. In times of austerity, which affects the Church of England just as much as any other body, we may not have the resources to address every problem as well as we’d like to. But sometimes saying there is a problem is an important first step. Thewlis has said he recognises the letter he sent his parishioners was inappropriate. But spare a thought, and perhaps a prayer, for the clergy who even now find the cursor hovering over the “send” button. There are more of them than you might think. • The Rev Liam Beadle is an Anglican priest.

The president modified designations for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah, potentially opening the land to big corporate developers and the oil and gas industry. The move – a repudiation of past presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton – seems certain to be challenged in court. “Some people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington,” Trump said at the state capitol in Salt Lake City. “And guess what? They’re wrong. “The families and communities of Utah know and love this land the best, and you know the best how to take care of your land. You know how to protect it, and you know best how to conserve this land for many, many generations to come.” Bears Ears will be slashed from nearly 1.5m acres to 228,784 acres, while Staircase will be halved from around 2m acres to 1,006,341 acres. Trump, who has focused intently on undoing Barack Obama’s legacy, described his predecessor’s Antiquities Act designations as a threat to people’s way of life, imposing restrictions on hunting, ranching and economic development. “As many of you know, past administrations have severely abused the purpose, spirit and intent of a century-old law known as the Antiquities Act,” he continued. “This law requires that only the smallest necessary area be set aside for special protection as national monuments. Unfortunately, previous administrations have ignored the standard and used the law to lock up hundreds of millions of acres of land and water under strict government control.” Trump claimed: “With the action I’m taking today, we will not only give back your voice over the use of this land, we will also restore your access and your enjoyment. Public lands will once again be for public use because we know that people who are free to use their land and enjoy their land are the people most determined to conserve their land.” But his move to shrink the national monuments represents a triumph for fossil fuel industries, ranchers and Republicans, particularly those representing Utah, who have pushed the president to undo protections put in place by previous administrations that curb activities such as oil drilling and cattle grazing. In April, promising to “end another egregious use of government power”, Trump ordered a review of national monuments declared since the 1990s. The interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, who has been a vocal proponent of allowing greater development including mining on public lands, recommended shrinking six monuments and altering the management plans of a further four. If Trump follows through with all those recommendations, protected areas in Nevada, Oregon and California would be resized, as well as two vast marine monuments in the Pacific Ocean. The areas could be remodeled to allow activities such as timber production, grazing or commercial fishing. Zinke told reporters on Air Force One that “no one loves public land more than I do” and he is a “steadfast believer in public lands for public use” but added: “When a monument is used to prevent rather than protect, the president is right to take action.” In the case of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah, Zinke said the whole Utah congressional delegation supports Trump’s move, as well as the governor and commissioner that represents the Navajo districts. He insisted that this was not an energy issue, claiming that there was no oil and gas in Bears Ears, though this is not clearcut. There are dozens of abandoned mines in Bears Ears but none has been operational for at least 20 years and national monument designation has placed restrictions on new energy development. However, there is oil and gas production clustered near the northern and eastern borders of the monument and some companies believe there is potential for more. Since 2013, energy firms have unsuccessfully asked the federal Bureau of Land Management to lease more than 100,000 acres for oil and gas drilling either near or within what is now Bears Ears’ boundaries. While the Trump administration has touted an economic boon from an influx of development, opponents point out that the tourism and local business stimulated by monument declarations is often far more valuable. Companies such as Patagonia, the clothing firm, have railed against Trump’s plan. In Utah, the president’s decision prompted protests before his arrival to announce it. On Saturday, thousands of demonstrators converged on the steps of the Utah state capitol. “There’s nothing in our data that’d say, politically, that this is popular,” Lori Weigel, a Republican pollster in Denver, told the Associated Press of efforts to trim monuments. “I can’t say why Utah elected officials have taken this on more than in other states. But we see widespread recognition that designation of protected land is valued.” The monuments provide a bulwark for intrinsic values such as natural beauty, endangered species and, importantly to local tribes, heritage. Bears Ears, named after two towering buttes in the heart of the protected area, has around 100,000 archaeological sites, including Native American ceremonial grounds, graves and rock art. The five Native American tribes that form the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition say legal action is likely against Trump’s decisions on monuments in Utah. Shaun Chapoose, a member of the Ute Indian Tribe business committee, told the Guardian this week Trump’s policy was “another slap in the face in the overall relationship between the federal government and the tribes, and local people”. US presidents are given sweeping power to protect land and waters under the 1906 Antiquities Act, which was signed by Theodore Roosevelt, an avowed hunter and conservationist. Since then, more than 150 sites have been unilaterally designated monuments by presidents, including the Statue of Liberty and the Grand Canyon. Obama frequently wielded this power amid Republican howls about executive overreach, creating or expanding 34 national monuments, including Bears Ears last December. Grand Staircase-Escalante was designated by Clinton in 1996. The Trump administration’s attempt to scale back this legacy will almost certainly encounter a thicket of legal action from enraged environmental groups. “This is a shameful and illegal attack on our nation’s protected lands,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, a former director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and now head of Defenders of Wildlife. “Teddy Roosevelt is rolling in his grave. We’ll be seeing President Trump in court.” Ben Schreiber, senior political strategist at Friends of the Earth, said: “Donald Trump is overseeing the largest elimination of protected areas in US history. Dismantling these monuments is Trump’s latest gift to the corporate interests who backed his campaign. This action is unprecedented and will end up in court. “Public lands are to be managed for the public, not plundered by private interests that want to make billions off public resources. The majority of Americans want to keep fossil fuels in the ground.” The White House noted that presidents have modified the boundaries to remove lands from monuments 18 times in the past. It said the most significant reduction occurred in 1915 when President Woodrow Wilson halved Mount Olympus national monument, which is now a national park. But Democrats were also swift to condemn Trump’s action. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate energy and natural resources committee, said: “Veterans, sportsmen, climbers, hikers and the outdoor economy all depend on open space. “‎Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante have been driving a vibrant outdoor economy for years. Now President Trump is using unlawful authority to pollute these special places. His administration deserves an ‘F’ for stewardship.” Raúl Grijalva, ranking Democrat on the House natural resources committee, added: “This order to destroy our national monuments is as legally sound as the Muslim ban. Mr Trump seems to take a perverse joy in ignoring federal law and dismissing the wishes of Native American tribes, conservation leaders and millions of everyday Americans. “Presidents don’t have the power to wipe existing monuments off the map and Republicans know it. This is an unpopular president making unpopular decisions without proper legal authority on behalf of ideological extremists and the oil and gas industry. This is the damage that results when we leave Republicans in charge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/dec/05/fashion-how-2017-became-the-year-of-donatella-versace","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Fashion, unfiltered: how 2017 became the year of Versace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/dec/05/fashion-how-2017-became-the-year-of-donatella-versace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/dec/05/fashion-how-2017-became-the-year-of-donatella-versace","fields":{"headline":"Fashion, unfiltered: how 2017 became the year of Versace","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1997, Gianni Versace was murdered on the steps of his Miami Beach home. His grief-stricken sister, Donatella, suddenly found herself in charge of the family company. Twenty years later, she has chosen to take this anniversary and make it extraordinary, hijacking the style agenda to the extent that fashion journalists have been calling 2017 the year of Versace. She has designed a tribute collection inspired by Gianni’s archives, announced a scholarship in her brother’s name at Central Saint Martins and, in September, in a fashion coup for the ages, reunited Gianni’s supermodel crew – Helena Christensen, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Carla Bruni and Claudia Schiffer – for a catwalk finale that melted the internet. It’s not over. On Monday night, she received a major accolade at the Fashion awards. On Tuesday, she will open a new Versace store on Sloane Street in London. In the light-filled salon where we meet, she is warm and smiley, talking me through a set of unpublished photographs by Doug Ordway that will be exhibited in the store. A lot of her year has been spent poring over old images and old creations, opening up the archive – a 10,000 sq ft storage facility in Novara, near Milan – and examining Gianni’s most famous creations for the first time since his death. “Not in a sad way,” she says, “but a very positive way. I saw what a genius my brother was. To me, he was my brother, but to the rest of the world – such a genius.” Even the names of the archive collections, produced between 1991 and 1995, speak of another, more glamorous age: Vogue, Warhol, My Friend Elton, Icons, Baroque. The pictures she shows me are from that time, too, and present the supermodel era exactly as you would want. Here is Bruni, a future first lady of France, dancing with abandon in thigh-high patent boots. Here is a babyfaced, never-off-duty Crawford, smouldering for the camera as she queues backstage. Here is Christy Turlington, running down a beach, wearing only shimmering sequins. Compared with the unsmiling models who have walked the catwalk since, and the airbrushed campaign images and omnipresent filtered Instagram photographs we have grown used to, these pictures feel authentic (however liberally doused in hairspray the models are). They bring back great memories, says Donatella. “This was the period that fashion became famous,” she says. “It was the beginning of fashion becoming pop culture, of being associated with music and rock’n’roll. Those two worlds were really in contact with one another. When something starts to happen, that is the most exciting moment. It was a huge change. The 90s was a huge change in fashion. “My brother, of course, was the designer; I was working very closely with him all my life. But I started the relationship with the models that Gianni made ‘super’.” What “super” meant, she says, was showing personality. “Before that, I don’t think many designers let models have personality, nor after. The models should wear the clothes, be very serious, not smile, look in front of you, almost no soul. This was totally opposite: it was about the girls, what the girls were thinking, who they were dating. It wasn’t just about the clothes, but about who was wearing the clothes.” Backstage sounds a hoot. She speaks in her inimitable, strongly Italian accent, one anecdote rolling into another, about models arriving six hours before the show because they all wanted François Nars, rather than his assistant, to make up their faces. She talks about the models swapping clothes after they had been allocated outfits and thinking: “I don’t know how I’ll explain this to Gianni.” She adds: “What I remember was the professionalism of these women, and the competition, which I think was very good and healthy. Everyone wanted to be better than everyone, not in a bad way. “My brother was very concentrated about the clothes. I was, too, but my role was to make the girls feel like themselves in the clothes. Would they like it a bit longer or shorter? They were a soundboard.” Fashion modelling is only just getting exciting again, she says, thanks to technology. “There are two generations of fashion for me: the one before the internet and the one after the internet.” Between the supermodels and now, she says, “was a moment of flatness. Now you could do this picture backstage again – there are people with enough personality there.” She likes the Instamodels, such as Gigi Hadid, who have become powerful thanks to their millions of followers on social media. “I think they are amazing. Very smart girls. Again, finally, we have girls who dare to stand out in the crowd.” Donatella talks about models’ ability to show their humanity as a type of female empowerment. Drawing parallels between models’ power and their treatment in the industry feels pertinent in the wake of the Weinstein revelations. Terry Richardson, who has worked with Versace, has been banned from working with Condé Nast International, while Bruce Weber, another photographer who has collaborated with the brand, has been accused of sexual harassment. The fashion industry is expected to be the next to see many of its titans fall. How does she feel about the wave of allegations against powerful men? She wishes they had come out earlier. “I am very happy they talked,” she says, “but if they came out earlier this thing would stop earlier. But I am very happy they came out.” Has she ever experienced sexual harassment? “No.” There is the first awkward silence of our conversation. The 62-year-old’s Fashion awards gong is icon of the year and the hype around her company is enormous, so it is easy to forget the starting point: the horror of her brother’s murder and her first few years running the company, during which she was so shellshocked that she broke down in tears on the catwalk. Does she feel like an icon? “Yes,” she says abruptly, then laughs. “OK, should I be shy? No. This is not because I’m full of myself, but I think, in fashion history, I did a lot. I mean an icon in fashion, not an icon in general, in the world.” I congratulate her on her self-belief. “Come on,” she says, “after all these years.” For her, an icon is “somebody who can inspire people. I think I can inspire because of my history, which is painful. My brother was killed. He was killed. He didn’t die of anything – he was killed. What I went through as a woman on my own to keep this company alive and overcome all the difficulties, and to be always compared to my brother, who was a genius, when I was not a genius in fashion, I was a different kind of person.” What she did, she says, was to feature rock stars – Prince, Madonna – before anyone else and to get Prince to soundtrack a show. “I’m not saying I cured cancer,” she says. “I am not afraid to go in the middle of the crowd and be one of them. I want to stand out from the crowd, for what I am saying first and also for the way I look. I’m not beautiful, but I have a look: blond hair, high heels, lots of makeup.” If the look has felt cartoonish in the past, “that was really a shield, to hide myself behind this very cold person that nobody can come too close to me, because I was afraid to show my insecurity, my sadness and my despair for what happened. [It was] so that few people could come and see how I really felt.” Over the past five years or so, she says, “I’ve cut my hair shorter, I wear a bit less makeup – not that much less – [but] I never left the heels; that is something I can be proud of. I walked my whole life in high heels and never stumbled once.” Her outlandish look has made her one of the few designers to become part of pop culture in their own right. It is one of the reasons why the Versace brand has inspired songs by Lady Gaga, Migos and Bruno Mars. It is why Etsy sells custom-made Donatella Versace dolls and countless T-shirts, phone cases and ringbinders emblazoned with her face. Clearly, she has a cult, camp appeal. Her fans recognise her as someone who uses glamour – not glamour in the sense of looking pretty for men, but in the sense of looking extraordinary – in the face of adversity. This kind of celebrity brings its own problems. “Fame was not one of the things I was looking for,” she says. “It was more about being taken seriously and being in a good relationship with people I love.” Arguably, as a designer, Donatella never got the respect she deserved until this year. This is partly because the Versace brand is unashamedly form-fitting and glamorous, whereas a great deal of tastemakers expect serious fashion to look serious. The new London store is a case in point, all onyx and Fior di Bosco marble and lustre. The aesthetic of Donatella’s life sparkles, too: Google “Donatella Versace’s bathroom” to see what splendour looks like. Perhaps the biggest challenge is dealing with the fictionalised interpretation of Donatella, which has taken on a life of its own: this version appears as a recurring character on Saturday Night Live, played by Maya Rudolph; it is also embodied by Gina Gershon in the outrageous TV movie House of Versace, in which “Donatella” stashes cocaine in a mascara tube. In January, Ryan Murphy’s American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace will be shown on the BBC. The trailer is violent and flashy and seems to suggest that Gianni knew his murderer – the serial killer Andrew Cunanan – which has never been confirmed. Penélope Cruz, who has often worn Versace, plays Donatella; she has said that she spoke “a little bit” with the designer while preparing. “I needed that conversation,” she said. “I really hope that, when she sees the show, she’s going to be happy.” When I ask Donatella about it today, though, she doesn’t seem happy. “I don’t discuss fiction,” she says. So it is a fiction to you? “It is fiction,” she says, her eyes widening for emphasis. I bring up millennials, the consumer group the industry is targeting most fervently. Millennials are all many designers talk about backstage, particularly in Milan. In Italian fashion, the charge has long been that so many houses have been run for decades by the same designers or dynasties (Armani, Prada, Versace, Missoni; even relative newcomers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are 59 and 55) that the scene has become stale. There have been rumours swirling around Versace for the past year or two that Riccardo Tisci, formerly of Givenchy – or Virgil Abloh of Off-White or Kim Jones of Louis Vuitton – might be in line for Donatella’s seat. That may be the case one day, but this year the conversation has shifted dramatically. In many ways, Donatella’s approach to millennials and social media feels remarkably modern – and not only because she has 2 million followers on Instagram (in typically understated style, when she joined the app in 2015, a press release was issued; ever savvy, in her first post, she posed with Gigi Hadid). This year, she says, has been “a rollercoaster of emotion. Not just that day [of the supermodel reunion show], but preparing for the show, going to the archive and seeing things that I last saw 20 years ago, before Gianni’s death. I never had the courage to go back there, because it was so painful, but I found the strength.” She did it, she says, “for the young generation who didn’t know, who weren’t born when Gianni was alive. I want them to know why Gianni was so important and what Gianni was about.” And to tell her side of the story? “To show them how relevant Gianni is today. No story, no filter.” The new Versace store is at 179 Sloane Street, London; the Doug Ordway exhibition is open now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/dec/13/top-10-photography-exhibitions-of-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-13T18:06:51Z","webTitle":"The top 10 photography exhibitions of 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/13/top-10-photography-exhibitions-of-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/13/top-10-photography-exhibitions-of-2017","fields":{"headline":"The top 10 photography exhibitions of 2017","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"10. Natalia LL Roman Road Gallery at Photo London This small show of the work of Natalia LL, a neglected early-1970s Polish-born pioneer of feminist avant garde image making, was an unexpected surprise. Text and image combine in works like TAK, an assemblage of images of female lips mouthing the Polish word for yes. In the ironically titled series Consumer Art (1972), models fondle and eat certain foods – bananas, hot dogs – in suggestive ways, parodying the commodified female sexuality portrayed in contemporary pornographic magazines. Playful, provocative and still politically resonant, Natalia LL deserves a bigger show. 9. Wolfgang Tillmans: 2017 Tate Modern, London Wolfgang Tillmans mixes and merges the everyday and the abstract, presenting the world as it unfolds for his camera in a wilfully haphazard way. His free-roaming gaze, though now familiar, can still surprise. Likewise, his curatorial audacity: vast prints – a car headlight, a nightscape of sea and sky – shared the wall with postcard-size images. Meanwhile portraits, random still lifes and diaristic snapshots somehow combined in a (just about) unified vision that is perfectly in tune with the thrust of our profligate image culture. 8. The Deutsche Börse photography prize shortlist The Photographers’ Gallery, London Inevitably, the Deutsche Börse shortlist does not always work as an exhibition, but this year’s four finalists – Sophie Calle, Dana Lixenberg, Awoiska van der Molen and the duo Onorato and Krebs – made for an interesting mix of contrasting styles and approaches. Calle, the seasoned conceptualist, seemed the most likely contender, but Lixenberg’s epic series Imperial Courts, a sustained exercise in long-form documentary portraiture based in a beleaguered housing project in Watts, Los Angeles, was the deserving winner. A project for our turbulent times. 7. Swaps: Photographs from the David Hurn Collection National Museum of Wales, Cardiff This year, the veteran Magnum photographer David Hurn donated his collection of 700 prints to the National Museum of Wales. This show, held in the first gallery in the museum dedicated solely to photography, comprises the most striking images by the likes of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Eve Arnold, Sergio Larrain and Bill Brandt. Like the entire collection, they were were acquired by Hurn swapping his own work with other photographers. A potted history of 20th-century documentary photography and a scattering of clues to Hurn’s formative influences. 6. A Handful of Dust Whitechapel Gallery, London From the surrealists to the moon landings and on to the 9/11 attacks, A Handful of Dust traced a kind of shadow history of photography through a substance that evokes all manner of ominous suggestion. Curated by David Campany, it ranged from the vernacular (postcards of American dust storms) to the art historical (Man Ray’s Dust Breeding, a photograph of dust-coated glass in Duchamp’s studio). A show of interesting juxtapositions, with dust as the abiding metaphor for time, history, memory – and photography. 5. Giles Duley: I Can Only Tell You What My Eyes See Old Truman Brewery, London Giles Duley was another photographer who dealt with the refugee crisis in a way that challenged the traditional idea of an exhibition. The powerful prints here were part of a bigger, more ambitious environment in which storytelling, live music, talks, creative collaborations and a nightly “supper gathering” combined to create, as Duley put it, “a space where stories will be shared and action inspired”. With both a writer and artist in residence as well as an ambient soundscape provided by Robert “3D” del Naja from Massive Attack, this was an exhibition as both collective conversation and creative activism. 4. Richard Mosse: Incoming Barbican Curve Gallery, London Perhaps the most widely discussed exhibition of the year, Mosse’s vast three-screen video installation was not strictly photography, but addressed all the issues that the medium is freighted with as it negotiates the post-truth world. Shot on a hi-tech military surveillance camera that registers body heat from as far away as 30km, Incoming reimagined the contemporary refugee crisis as a Ballardian dystopian drama populated by spectral figures moving slowly through an alien landscape. Beautifully observed moments of heightened intimacy – a lone figure praying to Mecca amid the tumult around him – provide breathing space in an almost overwhelming audiovisual installation. 3. Thomas Ruff: Photographs 1979–2017 Whitechapel Gallery, London Though Thomas Ruff’s photography about photography can seem overly cerebral, there was much here to admire, not least Ruff’s quiet sense of mischief. The German appropriates and reworks found photographs from press archives, the internet and even outer space, the results sometimes approaching pure abstraction. For all his experimenting, it is those big, early portraits of his friends that still resonate with their effortless merging of the epic and the intimate. 2. Sohrab Hura: The Lost Head and the Bird The Nines, Peckham 24, London The most viscerally exciting installation this year was Sohrab Hura’s two-part video in which a relentless stream of often disturbing images unfolded at a furious pace in a darkened room in Peckham during PhotoLondon. This was India reimagined as a kind of feverish hallucination, the almost subliminal thrust of the imagery disorienting the viewer and leaving a sense of dread and anxiety. Hura is a Magnum nominee, and this work certainly pushes the boundaries of reportage, the real and the fictional blurring into a fractured narrative that is overwhelming, disorienting and utterly unforgettable. 1. Ed van der Elsken: Camera in Love The Stedelijk, Amsterdam Increasingly, if you want to see a retrospective devoted to the work of a single photographer, you need to travel outside Britain. This year was no exception with this extraordinary Ed van der Elsken show travelling to Paris, but not London, after it debuted in his hometown, Amsterdam. What we missed out on was a chance to track the relentlessly curious eye of a photographer who moved effortlessly – and mischievously – between documentary, street photography and art. Best known for his groundbreaking 1954 photobook, Love on the Left Bank, which used real characters from the Parisian demimonde of the time to tell a fictional story, Van der Elsken also captured the energy of his native city in the 1960s, before travelling widely – to Japan, India and Africa. The curators rightly placed his photobooks at the centre, over 20 publications that range from the vivid global panorama that is Sweet Life to the more intimately observational Amsterdam. Book dummies, contact sheets and drawings punctuated the prints and films. The result was a portrait of Van der Elsken as a brilliantly restless artist, whose energy and optimism underpinned his often intense, illuminating and immersive way of seeing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/dec/04/juncker-and-may-fail-to-reach-brexit-deal-amid-dup-doubts-over-irish-border","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T07:10:21Z","webTitle":"May's weakness exposed as DUP derails Brexit progress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/04/juncker-and-may-fail-to-reach-brexit-deal-amid-dup-doubts-over-irish-border","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/dec/04/juncker-and-may-fail-to-reach-brexit-deal-amid-dup-doubts-over-irish-border","fields":{"headline":"May's weakness exposed as DUP derails Brexit progress","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May’s political weakness was brutally exposed to Brussels on Monday as an agreement struck between Britain and the EU to solve the problem of the Irish border and move to the next phase of Brexit talks was torpedoed by a last-minute telephone call with the leader of the Democratic Unionist party. Confidence early on Monday that an agreement was within reach came to nothing when, during a working lunch with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, May was forced to pause discussions to take a call from Arlene Foster. The unionist leader, whose party currently provides the Tories with a working majority in the Commons, told the British prime minister that she could not support Downing Street’s planned commitment to keep Northern Ireland aligned with EU laws. In London, Tory Brexiters, including Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg, told the Brexit minister Steve Baker, and the prime minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, that they were also rallying behind the DUP’s stance. Lord Trimble, a former first minister of Northern Ireland, said Tory MPs at the meeting had shown “unanimous backing for opposition to the draft proposal he said was “minted in Dublin”. The development raises fresh questions about May’s ability to deliver on any deal she proposes to the 27 member states, and has filled diplomats in Brussels with a deep foreboding for future talks, should they develop in the new year to take in the future relationship. Diplomats were waiting for two hours in a negotiating room at the Council of Ministers headquarters, for a meeting that had been planned to follow the Juncker-May lunch. When it became clear the two sides could not get an agreement, the officials were sent home. Juncker and May attempted to put a brave face on the spectacular collapse of their plans in press statements at the end of the day. The commission president praised May for being a “tough negotiator” who was energetically fighting for Britain’s interests. “On many of the issues there is a common understanding and crucially it is clear we want to move forward together,” May told reporters before hinting further talks were needed. “There are a couple of issues, some differences do remain, which require further negotiation and consultation. And those will continue but we will reconvene before the end of the week and I am also confident we will conclude this positively.” Labour sources said they understood that a major statement due from the prime minister to parliament on Tuesday had been cancelled. Negotiators are now expected to reassemble by the end of the week, with Wednesday evening now sketched into officials’ diaries. The delay also takes the EU into unusual territory, as member states will have less than a week to approve an agreement that many have not yet seen. Some EU diplomats are increasingly concerned about Juncker’s extension of the deadline, billed as “the extension of the very last round”. The text of the agreement has to be discussed in 27 national capitals, if EU leaders are to sign it off at a summit on 14-15 December. “The less time we have before the European council, the more difficult it becomes to run the text through 27 national administrations and get an agreement,” said one. “It is [the UK’s] decision to leave it to the last minute and it is [the UK’s] risk.” Government sources made clear that there were two key sticking points yet to be solved in the negotiations with the EU27 – the role of the European court of justice when it came to citizen rights and the Irish border. On Ireland, one senior government source admitted that progress would be difficult without the support of unionists. “It has to be a deal which is going to carry the support of the EU27 and everybody here. It is a reality that you need DUP support if the deal is to stand the test of time.” In Dublin, where there had been full confidence that an agreement had been reached that could avoid a hard border after Brexit, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, told reporters that he was “disappointed and surprised” by Britain’s U-turn. Varadkar said: “It is evident that things broke down, became problematic during the lunch in Brussels.” The Irish prime minister’s deputy had been on national radio just hours earlier confidently predicting that a deal was close and that “a positive statement for the country” from the taoiseach was planned for the afternoon. The DUP’s fury had been prompted by a leak early on Monday of a draft 15-page joint statement from the European commission and the UK which suggested Britain had bowed to the Republic of Ireland’s demands by accepting that “in the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will ensure that there continues to be continued regulatory alignment” with the internal market and customs union. Foster swiftly put out a statement insisting that she would not accept any special status for Northern Ireland as the UK left the EU in March 2019. Speaking at Stormont, she noted the speculation emerging from negotiations. “We have been very clear,” she said. “Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom. We will not accept any form of regulatory divergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the United Kingdom. The economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom will not be compromised in any way,” she said. The news was then seized upon by Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who suggested that any promise for Northern Ireland could be replicated for Scotland. That call was followed by similar suggestions from the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. The European council president, Donald Tusk, tweeted: The UK wants Brussels to rule that sufficient progress has been made on the opening issues in order for talks on trade and a transition period to open in December, after the summit of leaders next week. May’s tense day in Brussels also left her with further headaches at home after Khan warned that there were would be “huge ramifications” if the government conceded that part of the country could stay in the single market and customs union after Brexit. “Londoners overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and a similar deal here could protect tens of thousands of jobs,” he wrote on Twitter. Sturgeon said there was “no good practical reason” that Scotland could not in effect remain in the single market if the same was true for Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the difficulties in overcoming negotiation points showed that May’s government was ill-equipped to negotiate a successful Brexit deal. The Labour leader: “It is disappointing that there has not been progress in the Brexit negotiations after months of delays and grandstanding. Labour has been clear from the outset that we need a jobs-first Brexit deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom.” However, the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the DUP were right to “scupper” the deal, and the Leave means Leave campaign - which is backed by more than 30 Tory MPs - called on May to “completely rule out” any proposal that would treat Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK.

Beneath the dazzle and glitter is a rotting wasteland of discarded relationships – some splits apparently caused by the sheer bodily proximity to the dancers (see Kristina Rihanoff), and others caused by the celebrity realising the dance competition has injected new meaning into their life (see Louise Redknapp). Strictly is the Love Island for people who think they are above shows like that – they pretend they are here for the skill and the artistry, but what everyone really wants to know is who’s getting off with who. And so this year, Strictly fans are getting invested in the supposed romance between popstar Mollie King and her partner, dancer AJ Pritchard. During Saturday’s show, presenter Claudia Winkleman suggested the pair had spent half of their training time kissing, to the kind of hilarity and glee not seen for most people since the day after the school disco. Could this alleged relationship have been engineered by Strictly producers? “I was single and they put me with the single guy!” said actor Kara Tointon in 2015, after being paired with dancer Artem Chigvintsev (they dated between 2010 and 2014). “I was so angry. I was determined we wouldn’t get together and then of course you’re spending so much time with this person and he was so wonderful … So yes, it was inevitable really.” Dancer Flavia Cacace has said she thinks being on the show “sends the celebrities mad. Some people can’t handle all that physical closeness. They fall in love with this dream, this fantasy. Our job is to make them feel the centre of attention. It’s very addictive and it goes to some people’s heads.” But there have been a few enduring relationships so far. Countdown presenter Rachel Riley and her partner Pasha Kovalev are, to tabloid knowledge, still together. Rugby player Ben Cohen and his partner Rihanoff had a baby last year, and actor Jimi Mistry and his partner Cacace got married in 2013. Will Mollie and AJ last? Are they even together? Who cares? The answer, of course, is everybody – for there is currently no greater pressing issue in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/09/this-will-be-my-third-christmas-without-dad-i-miss-him-and-his-food","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T06:45:00Z","webTitle":"This will be my third Christmas without Dad.

I miss him and his food","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the most gluttonous month of the year arrives, we are reminded that celebrating a British Christmas is less about worshipping Jesus and more about (self) serving at the altar of food. From 1 December, it is pretty much a solid month of eschewing plates of crispy, vamped-up vegetables at office parties and sinking your teeth into indistinguishable party-platter pastries. Christmas is getting tempted by towers of teeth-clampingly sweet treats, displayed everywhere from your own bedside cabinet to the doctor’s surgery. Food is Christmas. Christmas is food. And with every nostalgia-coated mouthful comes a gravy boat full of memories deep enough to drown in. For me, the taste of Christmas has always been very sweet and very crumbly. What can I say? I love pastry. My granny’s apple pie is nothing short of ambrosial and my dad’s shortbread biscuits were simply the best. My granny passed her love of cooking on to my dad, who was also a chef, and he passed it on to me. The first memory I have of baking is me, aged five or so, propped up on a chair, cutting shortbread rounds from a slab of squidgy pastry, tucked underneath Dad’s elbow in our kitchen in December. Now I can’t walk past a tartan-topped gift box without scoffing the lot. Food is a comforting tool of nostalgia, which is why we love to overindulge at Christmas with all the things that we find tastiest. It is part of celebrating, and it also reminds us of good times with people we love. After all, counting Christmases is a way to catalogue time; marking the year’s end by feasting, indulging and drinking to excess, until we are practically sick, is a tried and tested tradition. Come December, we dutifully prepare to waddle into another year; bloated, unrestrained by buckle or belt but, ultimately, at peace. This year will be the third Christmas I have spent without my dad and the third time I have felt disconnected from the Christmas traditions he built with my mum and brother, in the kitchen and beyond. On Christmas morning, it used to be the crispiest roast potato competition, with my brother and I fighting to pick the best one. After the prawn cocktail starter, Dad’s soft, herby stuffing was the highlight of dinner and later, bellies bursting, we would rack up the cheeses. Mum’s portions were always dainty and she would roll her eyes in mock disapproval as Dad created a comical, towering blue cheese-to-cracker ratio, which often looked as if it would break before it reached his mouth. Christmas was split between our family home and Dad’s parents in Shropshire, who also know how to do a proper spread. But last year, for the first time, I took myself to sunny climes when Mum and I weren’t really speaking. The aim, of course, was to go somewhere so un-Christmas-like that I would forget the fact that baby Jesus was ever born. I surrounded myself with sunshine and pina coladas instead of cranberry sauce and crackers, and it kind of worked. I got blind drunk alone in a hostel and ate a most unsatisfactory Christmas dinner of chicken, rice and beans, which really didn’t hit the spot. Christmas is about what you feel in your heart, of course, but also in your stomach. This year, my mum and my brother and I are going to Rome – something Dad would not really have been up for, seeing as he was a traditionalist and a homebird at heart. I am not sure how it is going to play out (I have read that Italians eat eel on the big day), or whether we are all going to feel Dad’s absence more acutely abroad, but something tells me it might be easier. I am saddened but relieved at the prospect of distracting myself from all the things we used to enjoy together when Dad was here; I miss his voice booming “It’s Christmaaas!”, down the hallway on 1 December, as he forced us all to help him drag the old plastic tree down from the attic to the soundtracks of the Pogues and Noddy Holder. But removing ourselves from the Christmas backdrop that we once knew as normal may help us to lay the groundwork for new rituals. @GeorginaLawton"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/dec/09/you-dont-have-to-say-you-love-me-sherman-alexie-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T12:01:06Z","webTitle":"You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me by Sherman Alexie review – a poet and novelist’s memoir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/09/you-dont-have-to-say-you-love-me-sherman-alexie-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/dec/09/you-dont-have-to-say-you-love-me-sherman-alexie-review","fields":{"headline":"You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me by Sherman Alexie review – a poet and novelist’s memoir","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sherman Alexie has emerged as one of the US’s greatest writers. And because he has always written of the terrible beauty of Native American life with an honesty and humour that makes white people uncomfortable, his work has been deemed controversial. Alexie’s young adult novel, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, has appeared near the top of annual US “banned books” lists. Each year, new challenges arise to his thinly veiled autobiography of his years growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation in eastern Washington state. In addition to his fiction, Alexie is also well known for his poetry. All told, he has written 26 books, and he wrote and co-produced the film Smoke Signals. You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me is his long-awaited memoir. In it, he focuses much of the story on one particular year – the year in which his irascible mother, Lillian, died, but also the one in which he underwent brain surgery to remove a large tumour. Those who are familiar with his novels will relish the true-life stories behind some of his fiction; those who aren’t will find that his writing provides a powerful alternative to the stock figures of the mythological wild west – the brave cowboy and the stoic, noble Indian. At the centre of the book, though, is his relationship with his mother, a difficult, abusive woman who could perform acts of enormous maternal sacrifice on behalf of her children at the same time as treating them shockingly badly. Alexie’s recounting of his mother’s death differs from standard grief memoirs, most of which are accounts of love or at least move towards reconciliation. He is angry at his mother, even after her death and despite his efforts to forgive. However, although he comes to realise that the reasons for her rages were understandable and even though he is now a parent himself, Alexie still resents the impact her rage had on him and his siblings. The book is infused with laugh-out-loud humour. Some of the funniest moments are his writings about basketball, the game he made the centre of the drama of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. He also writes about the variation of the game of exchanging insults, “the dozens”, that Indians play among themselves, especially when wrestling over whose suffering has been worse. Other moments are more typical: that first phone call from the deceased’s phone, for example: On the morning of her funeral, my phone rang. The Caller ID announced it was “MOM”. For a moment, I believed it was her calling from the afterlife so I pondered what I would say. And I decided I would go with, “Hey, Lillian, gotta say I’m impressed with your resurrection, but is it a Jesus thing or a zombie fling?” It turns out, of course, that it’s his sister caling him from his mother’s house. Alexie’s mother was Spokane while his father was a member of the Coeur d’Alene tribe. Both his parents were born into a world where the creature on which their tribes were reliant, and about which their holy stories were told, was the salmon – the magnificent fish whose five-year life cycle is the stuff of legend. Alexie writes about the salmon’s journey with characteristic wit. I pointed out to an audience of 800 that salmon go on their epic journey from ocean into the insane mouths of rivers and up those rivers against the currents, over dams, dodging bears and fisherman – and a lot of those fishermen are Indians by the way – and then through and over and around trees and rocks and pollution and garbage – swimming hundreds, even thousands of miles – in order to fuck. Alexie’s audience doesn’t find his crudeness all that funny, but he is correct: the salmon’s mythic journey is driven by the need to reproduce. “‘Salmon,’ I said, ‘are the most epic fuckers in the animal kingdom.’” I have never forgotten sitting on rocks next to the shore of the Stillaguamish River, where the water was only a few inches deep at the edges. The water roared and tumbled over boulders in the centre of the river, but in the shallows I watched dozens of Coho salmon in their death throes after they had fulfilled their journeys. But on the Columbia River the series of dams created barriers that even the most motivated salmon were unable to pass. The Grand Coulee Dam was constructed in the 1930s. “The Interior Salish, my people, had worshipped the wild salmon since our beginnings,” Alexie writes. “That sacred fish had been our primary source of physical and spiritual sustenance for thousands of years.” But over the course of five years following the dam’s construction, the salmon vanished. “My mother and father were members of the first generation of Interior Salish people who lived entirely without wild salmon. My mother and father, without wild salmon, were spiritual orphans.” The loss of the salmon was just one of the great injustices in his parents’ lives. Alexie’s father drank himself to death, but his mother stopped drinking when Alexie was a boy. She made her living by making and selling quilts. Alexie recounts a time when, after the lights had been turned off because she couldn’t pay the electricity bill, his mother sewed in the dark non-stop until she had made a quilt that would earn enough to get the power turned back on. And while she did such things, he also recounts the night when, responding to his 10-year-old anger, she threw a full can of soda at him, hit him on the forehead and knocked him unconscious. And then left him there to sleep it off without seeking medical attention. And yet, even as he writes about incidents such as this, he reflects on his mother’s life, and begins a new poem for her: I want to reverse this earth And give birth to my mother Because I do not believe That she was ever adored. I want to mother the mother Who often did not mother me. I was mothered and adored By mothers not my own, And learned how to be adoring By being adored. Mothers and sons. Sons and mothers. Alexie’s memoir of his relationship with Lillian reflects the complicated love that many of us have for our parents. It is his gift to us, through his willingness to be honest without being vengeful, that those of us who have felt shut out of the grief memoirs in which parents and children had perfect relationships can read these pages and weep. • You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me by Sherman Alexie is published by Little, Brown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/04/the-guardian-view-on-green-toryism-it-must-go-beyond-gimmicks","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T19:07:03Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Green Toryism: it must go beyond gimmicks | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/the-guardian-view-on-green-toryism-it-must-go-beyond-gimmicks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/the-guardian-view-on-green-toryism-it-must-go-beyond-gimmicks","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Green Toryism: it must go beyond gimmicks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tories should be capable of looking like reliable stewards of the environment. Conservation and conservatism are obviously related. Yet a passion for green issues is a fairly reliable indicator of a voter’s aversion to backing Theresa May at the last election. MPs have been taken aback by the ferocity of reaction to reports that Conservatives had voted against recognising sentience in animals last month. Impassioned rebuttals could not hold back the tide of anger. It expressed a suspicion that animal cruelty was just the sort of thing one might expect from a Conservative – even if the facts were garbled. Downing Street has been spooked by that episode, which reinforces polling evidence that Tories are seen as uncaring. Mrs May had, after all, pleged a free vote on foxhunting in the manifesto. Contempt for the natural world is an emblem of their supposed callousness. So MPs have been briefed by Gavin Barwell, Mrs May’s chief of staff, that care for the environment is to be the unifying principle across a range of policies designed to rehabilitate the party’s reputation. This is hardly a new problem. David Cameron memorably invited the public to “vote blue, go green”. The limits of that message were clear even then. An episode commonly recalled from that era was the story of Mr Cameron cycling to the Commons, followed by a car bearing a change of clothes. The eco-conversion was superficial and seen as such. Once the Tories had captured No 10, the greenery was abandoned. Attempts to revive it now are led by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, who was once a cheerleader for “modernisation” under Mr Cameron. Mr Gove has backed a ban on pesticides that harm bees , mooted a new domestic authority to compensate for the loss of European environmental regulation after Brexit and pledged to tackle plastic waste. It is easy to dismiss these as symbolic gestures by an ambitious politician raising his profile. But Mr Gove is a tenacious minister, so whatever his motives, it is good for the environmental cause that he has decided to make it his personal hobbyhorse. Yet when it comes to rehabilitating the Tory image, the obstacles will not be cleared by one minister wielding a handful of initiatives. Mrs May has shown little interest in green matters. Much more problematic is the Tories’ financial dependence on big corporate donors, who expect regulator favours for their munificence. Supporting business and keeping the planet safe do not have to be mutually exclusive goals, but there are trade-offs that many Conservatives find uncomfortable. It does not help that the right wing of the party wears an ideological streak of climate-change denial. Mr Gove’s eco-friendly interventions cannot obscure a controversial record of voting against measures to halt global warming. There is an honourable Tory tradition of environmentalism. Margaret Thatcher was instrumental in international action to ban the CFCs that damaged the ozone layer. A strain of conservative philosophy is appalled by the vandalism of the natural world caused by human recklessness and arrogance. Yet those tendencies have, in recent decades, been subordinate to a more rapacious, ultra-free-market variant of Conservative ideology. If the Tories want their caring credentials to be taken seriously they should go beyond presentational gimmicks and forage a little deeper in their party’s intellectual roots."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"travel/2017/dec/09/la-paz-bolivia-guide-best-things-to-do-bars-hotels-restaurants","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-09T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"La Paz, Bolivia guide: what to see plus the best bars, restaurants and hotels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/09/la-paz-bolivia-guide-best-things-to-do-bars-hotels-restaurants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/dec/09/la-paz-bolivia-guide-best-things-to-do-bars-hotels-restaurants","fields":{"headline":"La Paz, Bolivia guide: what to see plus the best bars, restaurants and hotels","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are few cities with such an extraordinary setting as lofty La Paz. At 3,640 metres above sea level, Bolivia’s de facto capital has serious altitude. Fly in and you’ll see the pancake-flat Altiplano (high plain) fall into a steep-sided bowl lined with a maze of adobe and red-brick buildings, which mix with modern skyscrapers at the base. And towering above it all is the jagged, glacier-topped Cordillera Real. That it lacks a long checklist of sights is part of its charm. It’s worth spending time in La Paz, not only acclimatising to the altitude but simply wandering. An amalgam of architectural styles, cultures and beliefs, it has everything from offerings to the goddess Pachamama to incense-filled colonial churches, food stalls to trendy cafes, bowler-hatted cholitas to hipsters among its theatrical street life. It’s frenetic, chaotic, often frustrating but never dull. More than ever, it’s championing its culture, from local artists to age-old crafts. There’s a gastronomic revolution under way, with restaurants that use only Bolivian produce and bars that mix homegrown spirits. And Mi Teleférico, the world’s longest and highest urban cable car network, is making it easier to get around the city. WHAT TO SEE Wrestling cholitas In petticoats and pigtails, wrestling cholitas bounce off the ropes in a blur of somersaults, high kicks – and hair-pulling. Join the locals as these feisty females fight it out in El Alto, complete with ear-splitting music and a melodramatic compère. The cholitas, indigenous Aymara women, have created their own niche in this once male-dominated sport, to portray women as powerful and proud of their heritage. • Sunday afternoons at the Multifuncional de la Ceja de El Alto, tickets around £6, no website Feria 16 de Julio El Alto’s colossal open-air market is said to be Latin America’s largest.

Head to the Museo de Instrumentos Musicales for ancient nose flutes and the Museo de Metales Preciosos for pre-Colombian gold. Museo del Litoral Boliviano holds historical maps, the Museo Casa Murillo presents colonial life and the Museo Costumbrista Juan de Vargas – where you can buy the ticket – displays the city’s traditions. Mercado de las Brujas Burrow beyond the tourist tat of the centuries-old Witches’ Market and you’ll find all manner of mysterious powders, potions and amulets linked to Andean beliefs and shamanic practices. Earth-honouring Bolivians bury preserved llama foetuses in the foundations of new homes and businesses as an offering to Pachamama. Stevia is a natural sweetener from tropical Yungas that’s been used for more than 400 years, and hercampuri, thought to cleanse the body, was popular in the pre-Inca period. • Up from San Francisco Church, between Calle Jimenez and Linares National Museum of Ethnography and Folklore (Musef) In an 18th-century palace, Musef is a colourful and contemporary overview of Bolivia’s diverse cultures. Highlights include the collections of festival masks, Andean ceramics and intricate weavings, including chullos, the iconic knitted hats with earflaps.

The seasonal, surprise three-course lunch, and five- and seven-course dinner menus burst with local flavour: perhaps a ceviche of Andean tubers or a leafy green take on tamales. Upstairs, Quiroga’s new bar promotes the best Bolivian spirits, craft beer and wine. The five-course dinner is around £17. • Calle Colón 1306, +591 2 220 2366, alipacha.com Suma Phayata street food tour They say 90% of Paceños eat at street stalls every day.

The brownies here are good, too. • Calle Enrique Peñaranda Bloque L-35 San Miguel, on Facebook Gustu Bar Gustu’s groundbreaking bar – at the same address as the restaurant above – was the first dedicated to singani, the national spirit distilled from grapes. Now it’s all-Bolivian ethos extends to other homegrown spirits. La República gin, which uses a bespoke blend of Andean and Amazonian botanicals, and 1825 vodka, triple-distilled using Andean snowmelt and high-grown Amazonian wheat, will soon be joined by Bolivia’s first whisky, Killa Andean Moonshine from Andean Culture Distillery. It also serves craft beers from around the country and high-altitude wine, which has been produced in Tarija for more than 400 years. • Avenida Costanera 10, +591 2 211 7491, gustubo.restaurantgustu.com Diesel Nacional This isn’t your typical Bolivian watering hole.

His death marks a dramatic shift three years into a war in a state of stalemate. It risks the conflict becoming even more intractable. Saleh was an important player in Yemen’s descent into civil war. His reluctant departure from power in 2012 – forced upon him by the Arab spring after 33 years of rule – brought his Saudi-backed deputy, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, into office. But in 2014 Saleh forged an uneasy, unlikely alliance with his former enemies, the Houthis, to facilitate their takeover of Sana’a and ultimately to force Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia. It was an alliance doomed to fail, but few predicted the man who sided with the rebels he fought six wars against between 2004 and 2011 would eventually be killed by them. While it lasted, the alliance benefited both sides. Saleh used Houthi firepower and manpower, while the rebels gained from Saleh’s governing and intelligence networks. In the past week, that equation changed as Saleh moved to increase his power in Sana’a and signalled that he was swapping sides, seeking a dialogue with the Saudis and their allies, including the United Arab Emirates. There were reports that Saudi bombing of Sana’a in recent days was targeting Houthi areas in a move to help Saleh - but that did little to prevent the rebels killing him. Without Saleh, the Houthis are strengthened – at least in the short term. “There’s a possibility that [Saleh’s] apparatus will be radically weakened, if not marginalised in the coming period; this leaves the Houthis as the key power in northern Yemen,” said Adam Baron, visiting fellow at European Council on Foreign Relations. Houthi calls for celebrations to be held in public squares on Tuesday in the wake of Saleh’s killing leaves little doubt that rather than reconciliation, Baron said, the rebels are “in the mood for consolidation”. Saleh, a former military officer, became the president of North Yemen in 1978 after a coup but, when north and south reunited in 1990, was elected as the first president of the new country. He once likened his time in power to “dancing on the heads of snakes”. The war in Yemen has hit a stalemate, and it is hard to say which side is winning. “For Houthis, the definition of winning is just survival, and they’re doing a pretty good job at that; for the Saudis the definition of winning is restoring the internationally recognised government,” Baron said. “Houthis spent a decade fighting an insurgency isolated in the mountains of northern Yemen. Just being able to hold on to Sana’a, let alone to vanquish Saleh, their historical enemy, that’s a big deal.” The stakes are already high. Last month, the launch of a missile fired from Yemen towards Riyadh led Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, to accuse Iran of “direct military aggression” by supplying missiles to Houthis – a charge Iran vehemently denied. The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, replied that Saudi Arabia “bombs Yemen to smithereens, killing [thousands] of innocents including babies, spreads cholera and famine, but of course blames Iran”. Since then Houthis have launched at least one other missile towards Saudi Arabia and last week claimed to have hit a nuclear plant under construction in the UAE, a claim denied by the Emirates. The New York Times reported on Monday that missile experts had cast doubt on claims that American defence systems were able to intercept a Yemeni missile fired towards Riyadh airport. One thing that is clear is Yemen without Saleh will be a different, yet still unpredictable, country. “Even when people want to play on the ground in Yemen from outside,” Baron said, “internal dynamics have a way of shifting in a way that nobody really expected.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/dec/15/the-50-top-films-of-2017-in-the-uk-no-6-the-handmaiden","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"The 50 top films of 2017 in the UK: No 6 The Handmaiden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/15/the-50-top-films-of-2017-in-the-uk-no-6-the-handmaiden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/dec/15/the-50-top-films-of-2017-in-the-uk-no-6-the-handmaiden","fields":{"headline":"The 50 top films of 2017 in the UK: No 6 The Handmaiden","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sarah Waters’s novel Fingersmith has had a lavish, almost operatically spectacular adaptation by the Korean auteur Park Chan-wook, which isolates and intensifies the keynote of eroticism. The sexuality drenches the superbly designed fixtures, fittings and fabrics of this film and perfumes the intoxicating air that all the characters breathe. This is, arguably, disproportionate to the more nuanced effect intended and achieved by Waters, but it makes for a luxurious movie, and Park handles with aplomb the story’s whiplash narrative twist and resulting POV shift. The original novel’s setting of Victorian London is now transplanted to Korea in the 1930s. A confidence trickster and predatory seducer who styles himself as “Count” Fujiwara takes over the life of a young thief named Sook-hee, and gets her to inveigle herself into the house of a lonely young heiress named Lady Hideko, becoming her handmaiden. The point of this is, of course, so the pampered young woman will fall for the spurious count, but as the two women become close, it seems to be they who are falling in love instead. The tension between them is all but unbearable, especially as Hideko is being abused by her uncle and guardian: a grotesque satyr of perverse indulgence and porn connoisseurship. The twists and turns of the story are dazzling, and the film sometimes feels like an intricately jewelled and mirrored prop that might be used by a stage magician of a distant age. It is a glitteringly strange and sexy film. (buy here) This article contains affiliate links to products.

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: a charming English posho wants to find love, but British girls just don’t come up to snuff. Then along comes a glamorous American actress: she teaches him to share his feelings, he teaches her the value of real things, like roast chicken dinners with one’s friends from Eton. Ignoring the stuffy naysayers, he declares that he loves her, the country cheers and end credits roll. I speak, of course, of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. And while I don’t have proof that Harry proposed in the rain, if he did I’m betting that Meghan didn’t notice. Ever since the latest royal engagement was announced, historians have been dusting off the Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII references, even though (a) Prince Harry is not the King and (b) he probably never will be. But Harry and Meghan have nothing to do with British history – they are a British romcom from the late 90s/early 00s. Back then, almost every movie made in this country was predicated on the idea that posh British men can’t resist American women (and hats off to Guy Ritchie for going the extra mile with his real-life alliance with Madonna). Hugh Grant rejected Kristin Scott Thomas for Andie “call the acting coach” MacDowell in Four Weddings and a Funeral, and then rejected Emily Mortimer for Julia Roberts in Notting Hill (Cressida Bonas is clearly the Mortimer character in the Prince Harry movie: perfect, but insufficiently American). Jeanne Tripplehorn made a career playing the role of the American temptress (most notably in Sliding Doors) while Samantha Mathis cracked through Richard E Grant’s stiff upper lip in Jack &amp; Sarah. But it was Curtis who jumped the shark with this trope in Love Actually. We will return to this unseemliness shortly. As an American woman, I’m fascinated by the popularity of this cliche – in Britain, anyway. Because while British movies seem to think American women find the posh English accent irresistible, American movies invariably associate it with absolute evil. Moreover, despite living in this country for most of my life, I never dated an Englishman who owned even a dishwasher, let alone several castles, so if there is a magnetic pull between me and the British upper classes it is one I have avoided. But yes, some British toffs have been lucky enough to marry an American. Last year, for example, someone called James Rothschild decided to do America a favour when he took one of the Hilton sisters off its hands (no, not that one. I don’t think people called Paris are allowed in Brexit Britain). Tatler magazine has been extremely exercised of late about the idea of American women carting off their precious poshos. Trying to fathom why this keeps happening, one heiress suggested: “American girls will give blowjobs way earlier than British girls because they don’t consider it sex.” Well, there’s a marital tip I don’t remember hearing from Cinderella’s fairy godmother. Stick that in your next movie, Disney. The idea that Americans are sluts lies at the heart of this cliche about American women and British toffs, from the rumours about Wallis Simpson’s sexual prowess to Richard Curtis movies. In Four Weddings, MacDowell wows Grant by revealing that she’s slept with more than 30 men. In Notting Hill, Roberts sleeps with Grant even though she’s in a relationship with Alec Baldwin. In Love Actually, this idea reaches its climax when January Jones and her friends eagerly shack up with Kris Marshall, such is their love of the English accent and insatiable American sluttiness. For me, the Special Relationship officially ended when Marshall tells Jones he’s from Basildon and she makes an orgasmic yelp. As flattered as I am by the suggestion that my sexual skills are so great I could literally seduce a country, the truth is a lot less sticky-palmed: to a British toff, an American seems excitingly untraditional, while for an American, a British toff seems thrillingly traditional; the two meet, hopefully, in the middle, somewhere around the roast chicken dinners. Also, the American accent is reassuringly classless, so Harry’s family won’t be able to tell which school she went to from the way she pronounces “off”. Thus, the most class-obsessed people in the most class-obsessed country in the world, the English upper classes, can date a far broader range of women than the blond Sloanes allowed to them here. After all, it’s only in a Richard Curtis movie that a posh British man ends up with an English tea lady. In reality, they can slum it with the Americans. • This article was corrected on 9 December 2017; Jeanne Tripplehorn was not in Bridget Jones’s Diary as previously stated. It was further amended on 13 May 2022; in Four Weddings and a Funeral, Andie MacDowell’s character reveals that she’s slept with more than 30 men, not more than 50 as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/04/jimmy-anderson-frustrated-england-ashes-batting-collapse","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T15:13:14Z","webTitle":"England left ‘pretty frustrated’ by batting collapse, says Jimmy Anderson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/04/jimmy-anderson-frustrated-england-ashes-batting-collapse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/04/jimmy-anderson-frustrated-england-ashes-batting-collapse","fields":{"headline":"England left ‘pretty frustrated’ by batting collapse, says Jimmy Anderson","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jimmy Anderson admitted to there being “some pretty frustrated players” in the England dressing room after a collapse with the bat on the third day in Adelaide, followed by a late surge of wickets with the ball, left a lingering sense of what could have been for the tourists. Bowled out for a meek 227 in response to Australia’s first innings 442 for eight declared, Joe Root’s side were not asked to follow on by Steve Smith. They responded by reducing the hosts to 53 for four under lights, with two wickets apiece for Anderson and Chris Woakes. But with Australia leading by 268 runs going into day four, England were still staring at the prospect of going 2-0 down in their Ashes defence before the third Test in Perth, where they have not won since 1978. For their record-wicket-taker, the last man out as Craig Overton top-scored from No9 with an unbeaten 41, it was galling. “We should have got more runs,” said Anderson, who went on to pick up two for 16 with the ball. “We’ve got some very frustrated players in the dressing room. All we can do as bowlers is try our best, and that’s what we did. We gave it absolutely everything.” Smith’s decision not to enforce the follow-on, and offer England’s attack a chance to redeem their performance from the first innings after dark, was controversial despite their holding the whip hand. Mitchell Starc, who earlier claimed three for 49, distanced himself from the call. “We didn’t tonight, he’s the captain and he makes the decisions” replied Starc, when asked if Smith had consulted his seemingly still fresh attack. “We had a tough session with the bat but there’s a lot of cricket to go. But in terms of the follow-on, it’s all up to Smithy.” Starc revealed Australia’s bowlers had learned how best to use the pitch when watching England’s attack bowl too short in their first innings. Though remedied in their late burst, which saw Woakes claim the key wicket of Smith lbw for six, Root’s side must be kicking themselves. On Overton, with whom he shared a stand of 66 that likely altered Smith’s plans to bowl again, Woakes said: “I thought he batted beautifully on debut. He was getting plenty of verbals, as you would expect, and plenty of short stuff. I was pretty annoyed with the way I got out [caught and bowled by Starc on 33], I feel I probably left a few runs out there. “We’re behind in the game, but we’ve fought back and shown some good character and put some pressure back on Australia. I think that’s really important.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/05/climate-change-is-radically-reshuffling-uk-bird-species-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-05T07:01:09Z","webTitle":"Climate change is radically reshuffling UK bird species, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/05/climate-change-is-radically-reshuffling-uk-bird-species-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/05/climate-change-is-radically-reshuffling-uk-bird-species-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"Climate change is radically reshuffling UK bird species, report finds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Climate change is radically reshuffling Britain’s birds, with some species disappearing while new migrants are settling. Timings are being reset too, with egg laying getting earlier in the year, while autumn departures for warmer climes are delayed by up to a month. The State of the UK’s Birds report for 2017, published on Tuesday, reveals the profound impact of global warming on Britain’s bird life, which is set to become even greater in the future. Average temperatures in the UK have increased by almost 1C in recent decades and familiar birds like swallows, which migrate to Africa every autumn, have responded by leaving up to four weeks later. Others, such as garden warblers and whitethroats, are also enjoying warmer British weather for longer. The migratory birds are also arriving and breeding earlier in the spring than in the 1960s. The great tit is a fulltime resident but it is also laying its eggs 11 days earlier than 40 years ago. The UK’s increasingly warmer and wetter winters have induced some short-distance migratory birds to give up their journeys entirely and remain in the UK. The breeding numbers of blackcaps and chiffchaffs have both more than doubled since 1970. However, the warmer conditions are posing a serious risk of extinction in the UK for many of the nation’s rarer birds, particularly those found in the north. Among these the dotterel, whimbrel and common scoter have already seen significant population declines. But while cold-adapted birds suffer, those preferring warmth are taking advantage. Those currently limited to southernmost regions, such as the quail, little egret and hobby, have increased their numbers. Ornithologists expect other species, including the little bittern and zitting cisticola, may colonise the south in coming years as they escape the rising heat in continental Europe. The State of the UK’s Birds report is produced by the RSPB, British Trust for Ornithology and the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust, together with the UK’s statutory nature conservation bodies including Natural England. Michael Morecroft, at Natural England, said: “Climate change is undoubtedly going to be one of the greatest influences, both positive and negative, on the future status of birds and other biodiversity in England and the UK.” Morecroft said it was therefore vital that wildlife habitats are both expanded and better protected to help species better survive extreme weather and help them spread to newly suitable areas. The RSPB’s Daniel Hayhow, the lead author of the report, said: “For some species climate change will provide opportunities to increase and expand provided the right habitat is there, while others will be vulnerable, increasing their risk of extinction as breeding species in the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/03/viagra-25-years-sex-virility-drug-male-impotence","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T01:24:11Z","webTitle":"Viagra: the little blue pill that revolutionised our sex lives | Observer profile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/03/viagra-25-years-sex-virility-drug-male-impotence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/03/viagra-25-years-sex-virility-drug-male-impotence","fields":{"headline":"Viagra: the little blue pill that revolutionised our sex lives","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It all began 25 years ago in Britain. The UK division of the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer was running trials on a new drug for the treatment of angina. It was called UK-92480 and it wasn’t pulling up any trees. But if UK-92480 failed with the heart, the symbolic home of love, it made a big impact on another organ, one with a rather more prosaic association with romance. Male participants in the trials reported a pronounced side-effect: erections. A lot of trees, and other things, were about to be pulled up. Six years later, on 27 March 1998, the American Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of Viagra and the rest is hysteria. Or at least it was at first. The drug was a phenomenon. It registered sales of $1bn in its first year. And it seemed to drive some people just a little mad. A chef was arrested in France after serving his customers a dish entitled “beef piccata in Viagra sauce with fig vinegar and fine herbs”. In Taiwan, a prostitute was arrested for killing a 74-year-old client who forced himself on her having already had sex once. And in Israel it was said that four Viagra pills had gone missing during a meeting of a five-member science committee in the Knesset. Until the arrival of Viagra, the treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) involved penile pumps or injections, neither of which, perhaps unsurprisingly, ever captured the male imagination. And probably did little for the female imagination either. Now, suddenly, here was a drug for the problem-solving era, a drug that fitted the impatient acceleration of time in the personal computer age, a drug that, as the joke went, turned your floppy disc into a hard drive. The research that underpinned the creation of Viagra itself stemmed from the work by three American scientists who would go on to win the Nobel prize for medicine in, coincidentally enough, 1998, the year of Viagra’s birth. The scientists discovered that the body uses nitric oxide to make blood vessels widen. Sildenafil citrate, the compound of which Viagra is the trademark, helps bind nitric oxide to receptors that enable relaxation of the helicine arteries, which, in turn, increases blood flow into the soft tissue of the penis, and results – as long as no one spoils the mood – in an erection. Last week, it was announced that Britain would become the first country to make Viagra available over the counter. The move was initiated by the Medicines &amp; Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the hope that it would prevent men using unregulated websites, where drugs for ED form a large and lucrative black market. The legitimate market is already, as it were, huge and growing. Prescriptions have trebled over the past decade to almost 3m. But the sales of unlicensed ED drugs remain a profitable and unscrupulous business: among the £50m worth of counterfeit Viagra and other similar drugs seized over the past five years in Britain, some have been found to contain plaster of Paris, printer ink and even arsenic. Two reasons have accounted for the illegal market. First, the high price Viagra was originally sold at. That dropped significantly in 2013, when Pfizer’s 15-year exclusive patent ran out. The other reason why men have preferred the sometimes dubious anonymity of the internet to the prescriptive dependability of a GP is that if Viagra increases blood flow to the very core of male identity, it’s also a matter that brings blood to the facial cheeks. Despite the apparent ubiquity of the small blue, diamond-shaped pill, the issue it addresses – impotency – remains a subject of no little embarrassment. And where there is embarrassment, humour is seldom far behind. When Viagra launched almost 20 years ago, some of the first beneficiaries of the drug were comedians and chatshow hosts. Not necessarily because they were users of it, but because it formed the punchline to so many of their jokes: “Did you hear about the first Viagra overdose? A guy took 12 pills and his wife died.” By all accounts, Pfizer was a little downhearted that its star turn had become a laughing matter. After all, it had used the conservative figure of Bob Dole, former Republican leader of the Senate, to front its very sober advertising campaign. But the truth is that while ED is undoubtedly a serious issue, the vulnerability of the penis remains an inescapably comic idea – manhood reduced to the unreliable dimensions of a fickle extremity. Even celebrity endorsements could not shift the image of Viagra. Hugh Hefner referred to the drug as “God’s little helper”, but then, given that the dressing-gowned one was dating young Barbie-style twins at the time, his approval was never likely to normalise the drug or render it as unnoteworthy as, say, aspirin or indigestion tablets. David Bailey (79) recently said that he had no problem getting old because Jack Nicholson had introduced him to Viagra. Michael Douglas has also lent his support, calling Viagra a “wonderful enhancement… that can make us all feel younger”. Disinterested observers might note that his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones is 25 years his junior, just as Bailey’s spouse, Catherine Dyer, is 23 years younger than the photographer. For all their promotional benefits, such testaments ultimately serve to highlight an imbalance: namely that a much younger female partner necessitates a certain chemical help. And yet there are reports of young men taking Viagra to improve sexual performance or to counteract the effects of overexposure to pornography. In both cases, it seems that the effects are perhaps more psychological than physiological. Pfizer has long insisted that the drug has no effect on those who don’t suffer from ED, just as taking an aspirin will have no noticeable effect on someone without a headache. Anecdotal evidence contradicts this view, but Pfizer points out the increased placebo effect of ED drugs. One executive said that in studies 20% of the men taking a sugar pill placebo reported “rip-snorting erections”. The mind can play tricks, especially on the penis, arguably the most gullible part of a man. Another aspect of Viagra’s pulsating success story is its name. Rhyming – almost – with Niagara, it manages to conjure up an image of something vital and potent. But originally the brand name, which came out of Pfizer’s “name bank” (made up of invented words that have no meaning in any major language) was assigned to a drug for shrinking swollen prostate glands. It was only because the marketing people didn’t like it for that product that it was returned to the name bank ready for its adoption by sildenafil citrate. Apparently, another option was “Alond”. A rose by any other name may smell as sweet, but it’s fair to say that that rule does not apply to erectile dysfunction pharmaceutical treatments. Alond is just, well, limp. However, some names you can’t make up, and one of them is Ringaskiddy, the village in County Cork, where Viagra is produced at the chemical plant. Nicknamed Viagra Falls, the village is rumoured to have love, or at least sex, in the air. Across the water in Britain, the quality of aphrodisiacal air is open to debate, but the distribution of Viagra users is not. Figures show that men in Bradford are more likely to be prescribed the drug, or similar alternatives, than are those from anywhere else in the country. Blackpool comes second. The lowest prescription rates are in Richmond and Kingston upon Thames. One explanation is a north-south class divide – that health accompanies wealth and the southern middle classes are in a better physical shape and therefore less susceptible to the various complaints that cause ED. Another is that there is a higher premium on having a good time in the north and that, as the Royal College of General Practitioners has found, an ageing population still expects an active sex life – and just possibly the citizens of Bradford and Backpool are a little less inhibited about asking for it than their countrymen down south. As they say in the pharmaceutical business, more research is needed. Until then, the only way for the drug formerly known as UK-92480 is up. THE VIAGRA FILE Born April 1998 in the US, although conceived six years earlier in the UK. Best of times It’s been an almost unrelenting success story, although the first year stands out for its billion-dollar arrival - almost unheralded in a new drug.

As the Socceroos distract themselves from the potentially ruinous chaos that is the current state of things in Australian football, they at least have something to look forward to. Plans can be made, predictions reached, optimism pumped up. Australia have avoided a group of death, and have been awarded a group that features one colossus with the remainder summarised with a big fat ‘Who knows?’ So not entirely dissimilar to the cricket team, then. The Steve Smith of Group C is France, a country with a cartoonish pool of talent to choose from. Didier Deschamps has a buffet of brilliance at his disposal, from Paul Pogba to Antoine Griezmann to Kylian Mbappe, and assorted others in between. The biggest barrier to success in the whole tournament for France is Deschamps himself, a manager unsuited to corralling that sort of individual quality into a serviceable team, but if they don’t win this group then it will surely rank as a bigger shock than their goalless first-round departure in 2002. There’s less certainty about Peru and Denmark. The Peruvians are something of an unknown quantity on the international stage, having not qualified for a World Cup since 1982, but with a pretty solid record at the Copa America. Denmark are a reasonably stodgy outfit, reliant on Christian Eriksen for inspiration with plenty of perspiration surrounding him. All three non-French teams needed playoffs to reach Russia, so at least we know they all have some sort of heart under pressure. But more than anyone they might actually face in this tournament, Australia are surely the real wildcards. Ange Postecoglou’s resignation might not logically have been much of a surprise, given the noises he was making in the weeks before and after the playoff win over Honduras, but the coach stepping down was still the sort of thing you don’t expect to actually happen, like your tyre blowing out on the motorway, or a large surprise tax bill arriving. The question is of course how the players will take to a new manager who will have minimal time actually working with them before the squad is named. And perhaps more pertinently, when that new manager will be in place, with the recruitment process hampered rather by the power-struggle currently engulfing the FFA. The idea of Fifa taking over the running of an association a few months before the World Cup, as is threatened if they don’t sort themselves out, is truly surreal but also very real. Australia can perhaps take some comfort in the knowledge that they’re not the only country to enter this draw in a state of flux. Saudi Arabia sacked Edgardo Bauza last week despite only being in charge for five friendlies, capping a pretty average 2017 for the Argentinean as he was dismissed from his own national team’s job in April. This was also after assorted disagreements led to the Saudis deciding they could do without Bert van Marwijk, despite him guiding them to their first World Cup since 2006. Juan Antonio Pizzi, himself binned by Chile after failing to get the Copa America holders to Russia, is the latest in the firing line. In some ways it was a shame the two teams were in the same pot so couldn’t draw each other, because who doesn’t enjoy a spot of chaos? There’s still time to calm things down, though. Australia don’t play again until March so in theory there’s no massive panic, and international football is so chaotic at the best of times that a small spell with no manager is no definitive barrier to success. With players such as Aaron Mooy, Tom Rogic and what will surely be the last hurrah of Tim Cahill, there’s enough to build upon. And having one outstanding side in the group might actually be a positive: whoever they drew, Australia were never going to finish in first place, so facing a couple of capable but beatable sides is about the best they could hope for. That’s the optimistic view, at least. A more pessimistic forecast might surmise that the state of flux left by Postecoglou’s departure and the general uncertainty elsewhere has already torpedoed Australia’s hopes. Playing France first up might deal a significant blow to morale, if the result goes to form, and from there they will be chasing hope. Peru and Denmark might not be the greatest sides in the world, but they’re more stable than Australia. This draw has given Australia an outside chance of making it through to the knockout stage of the World Cup for just the second time. But an outside chance it is: there’s no need to completely clear the diary after 26 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/dec/03/war-on-waste-new-episode-peels-away-at-food-extravagance","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T21:13:32Z","webTitle":"War on Waste: new episode peels away at food extravagance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/03/war-on-waste-new-episode-peels-away-at-food-extravagance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/03/war-on-waste-new-episode-peels-away-at-food-extravagance","fields":{"headline":"War on Waste: new episode peels away at food extravagance","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australians watched in horror and fascination as thousands of freshly picked bananas – nurtured on a Queensland farm over nine months – were inspected and then dumped because they were a fraction too big or too small for the standards set by supermarkets. Craig Reucassel, the host of ABC Television’s War on Waste, says it’s heartbreaking for the farmers to lose up to 40% of their produce every harvest, chopping up and discarding truckloads of perfectly edible bananas. But Reucassel, whose visit to the farm brought the issue to light on the hit show this year, is heartened by how many people responded. So powerful was the banana-dumping clip from the series that War on Waste has become ABC TV’s biggest ever Facebook post. It has been viewed by 20.3 million people, and nearly half a million have shared it and posted comments. But several months on, has anything changed in the food waste department? Reucassel has made a fourth episode of the highly successful series to find out. The ABC has enjoyed unexpected success with War on Waste, a project referred to as a pan-ABC event. It’s not just a TV series, it’s a multiplatform event with a podcast, a social media campaign, local community events and ABC Radio participation. To gauge current attitudes and habits towards waste and recycling, a national survey was done. The first three episodes averaged 1.3 million viewers, and Guardian Australia understands ABC TV is to announce series two. “I was not expecting a show about waste to do well,” the former Chaser team member told us in the lead-up to the fourth episode airing on Sunday night. “It was a bit of a surprise.” Always the comedian, Reucassel adds: “I never thought anything I’d do would be of any use, actually.” But food waste was not the only issue tackled by War on Waste. More than 4.5m plastic bags are being used every year, nearly a billion disposable coffee cups end up in landfill, and households are throwing away too much food. First the good news. The program’s discussion about disposable coffee cups and how they are not really recyclable because they are lined with plastic captured the public’s imagination. Sales of reusable coffee cups are up 78%. Suddenly cafes are offering discounted coffee if you bring your own “keep cup”. Then the big supermarkets – Woolworths and later Coles – surprised everyone by announcing they would get rid of single-use plastic bags. (The ban affects stores only in states that have not passed legislation banning single-use bags: New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia.) Woolworths Group stores in South Australia, Northern Territory, ACT and Tasmania have already stopped offering the bags in line with state laws. Queensland has legislated to ban single-use plastic bags from 2018. Frustratingly, very little has changed with food waste. Coles in particular, Reucassel says, has done nothing and the millions of bananas that are less than perfect are still being dumped. “I was a bit surprised how much the show taught people about coffee cups but the food waste is harder to solve.” Reucassel says he employs Chaser-style tactics by door-stopping politicians on War on Waste because it brings the audience closer to the issue if it’s entertaining. “The initial war on waste in the UK had these kind of stunts in them,” he says, referring to Hugh’s War on Waste, presented by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. “Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall did not come from a comedy background but they had these types of stunts. We changed some of them and made our own. I really like that aspect of it. I think it helps to bring it to a wider audience. It was back to Canberra again and it was so goddamn cold. In winter in Canberra there are never enough clothes.” Reucassel says the main roadblock to change is politicians who are afraid to put off voters by moving too fast: “Politicians are scared of that first little change.” “There are a lot of changes you can make yourself,” he says. “And the next level is politicians coming on board. I’ve been really heartened by how people have taken to behavioural change. Once you change your behaviour it becomes really natural.” Reucassel says he hasn’t used a disposable coffee cup for a year and his family’s waste bins are no longer overflowing. He did leave a chicken out for too long and it had to be binned, but he is making progress.

Twelve months ago it was Chelsea, on their own record-equalling 13 match winning run, who came to the Etihad and inflicted the first home defeat of the season with a 3-1 win. City were still shell-shocked a week later when they turned up at Leicester in some disarray and were taught lessons in a 4-2 defeat that Guardiola remembers vividly to this day. To get the statistical details out of the way first, City have won every game in the Premier League since Ronald Koeman’s Everton held them to a draw at the Etihad in August. Their sequence stands at 12, and should they beat West Ham at home on Sunday afternoon they will advance to 13 and share the record jointly held by Arsenal (from 2001-02) and Chelsea (last season). The actual record for consecutive Premier League wins stands at 14 but it was set over two seasons, by Arsenal between February and August 2002. Should City beat West Ham they can look at setting a fresh record all of their own, though the league game that follows is against Manchester United at Old Trafford. We can expect to hear a lot from Guardiola about the unimportance of such trivialities as records between now and then, as well as a certain amount of exasperation on the subject of going through the season unbeaten, for what every manager knows is that the next game is always the one that might trip you up. Even if the next game is West Ham. If anyone from Guardiola’s scouting team was watching the Irons in action at Goodison in midweek there was precious little on show to cause any undue concern, though the one thing that might knock City off track is looking too far ahead and taking results against struggling sides for granted. With due respect to Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta, who will be returning to Manchester in more straitened circumstances than was perhaps envisaged, West Ham are struggling at the moment and David Moyes does not yet seem to have a handle on how to turn things around. They were missing Andy Carroll at Everton, yet to start using that as an excuse is possibly to admit that Moyes does not have a great deal of attacking options open to him. Hart, who cannot feature under the terms of his loan deal, and Zabaleta left to join Slaven Bilic and most people – Marko Arnautovic, say – probably imagined a fairly comfortable mid-table existence based on the ability to occasionally summon the West Ham spirit and carry out bandit raids on supposedly superior sides. In fact this happened only once, with the memorable comeback against Tottenham at Wembley in the Carabao Cup, and because league points are a much harder currency than cup kudos Bilic was soon gone, and with him much of what was left of the optimism surrounding the club. Hiring Moyes on a six-month contract hardly screams optimism, does it? It simply means the manager will be easy to remove if there is no sign of climbing out of trouble, and suggests West Ham will soon be in the market for a new manager again whether or not Moyes can make a difference to results. The more pessimistic West Ham fans are already comparing the situation to Sunderland and complaining that Moyes might have to be removed before the end of the season, which is perhaps a little harsh after three matches though fair in the sense that any detectable improvement is hard to identify. Neither does there seem much possibility of immediate respite. After Manchester City, Moyes must prepare his players for league encounters with Chelsea and Arsenal. A trip to Stoke a week on Saturday is the first game West Ham might mark down as winnable; in fact, given that Mark Hughes’s side are lining up among the relegation candidates this season, there might be trouble for Moyes if some sort of corner has not been turned by that stage. Unless he simply wants to collect his contract money and fade away from frontline management, now is the time for Moyes to prove people wrong by showing his credentials as a firefighter. To do that you need to win games that you are not supposed to win, to pick up points against the big clubs. Moyes was never particularly good at that during his time at Everton, even though he more than stabilised the club over the course of 11 years, and his last experience of attempting to keep a side up ended in relegation. If taking points from West Ham’s next three matches seems a tall order, Moyes could take some encouragement from what happened at Crystal Palace under Sam Allardyce last season. Allardyce has just earned a chance at a record seventh Premier League club on the strength of his apparent immunity to relegation, even if Everton possibly acted hastily in assuming the drop was looming. Everyone knows Allardyce kept the Eagles up by virtue of going to Chelsea and Liverpool and winning, not to mention beating Arsenal 3-0 at home, but those results were all in April. In January, the month after he joined, Palace lost at home to Swansea and Everton and were drubbed at West Ham. As late as February Palace were hammered 4-0 at home by Sunderland. Moyes must remember that; it is probably the last time he smiled. Two successive relegations would be nothing to smile about – not many managerial careers would survive it – yet there is still time and plenty of matches. Moyes won’t have to play Manchester City every week, but he will have to start somewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/the-week-in-patriarchy-powerful-men-falling","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T15:18:57Z","webTitle":"The week in patriarchy: more powerful men are falling | Jessica Valenti","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/the-week-in-patriarchy-powerful-men-falling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/the-week-in-patriarchy-powerful-men-falling","fields":{"headline":"The week in patriarchy: more powerful men are falling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"So far, one week hasn’t gone by without a powerful man being accused of horrific harassment and abuse.

To date, in the absence of any evidence of scandal or wrongdoing, pressing questions include: how did descendants of Mattie Turnipseed, Markle’s great-great-great-grandmother, rise, within 150 years, from slavery to royal duties? Does Markle’s half-sister, Samantha, regret saying mean things? And just who, it’s being asked, is Thomas Markle Junior, Markle’s half-brother, who allegedly (charges were never pressed) held a gun to his girlfriend’s head? In the event that Thomas and Samantha, and any non-initiates, are similarly curious about Prince Harry’s lineage, particularly on the ways in which members of his extended family have adapted to lives of total economic dependency, here, in a spirit of reciprocity, is a brief introduction. Key family members and associates, living and otherwise, are presented in alphabetical order. Andrew, Prince Harry’s uncle. Nicknamed, given routinely astronomical expenses, “Airmiles Andy”. Divorced. Economically inactive. A never-advertised post as “roving ambassador” ended in 2011 after exposure of his close friendship with a convicted US sex offender and billionaire, Jeffrey Epstein, who has been described as a “terrific guy” by Donald Trump: “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side.” Prince Andrew also enjoys warm relations with senior figures in Kazakhstan, the effective dictatorship, including with a billionaire who, for reasons still unexplained, bought Andrew’s former home, Sunninghill Park in Berkshire, for £3m above the £12m asking price. Anne, Princess Harry’s aunt. Divorced. Economically inactive. Last year’s hardest working royal, with 114 engagements. State-funded via her mother.

Regularly breaks records for most pointless use of the royal train. Cornwall, Camilla, Duchess of Harry’s stepmother. Divorced. Never not economically inactive. Nicknamed “the rottweiler” by Harry’s mother, Diana. In return, the older duchess reportedly referred to Diana as “that mad cow”. Effectively state-maintained and housed since marriage to Charles. Assured by Charles: “Your greatest achievement is to love me”. Diana, Princess (d 1997) Harry’s mother. Divorced child of divorced parents, she worked briefly before being acquired by the royal family. Gaslighted by her new in-laws.

So, good for McGee. Or is it? Even in showbiz terms, it has to be the kiss of death to have May saying she supports you. There are rumours of ministers in Westminster hiding in cupboards, and jumping off windowsills, to avoid being “supported” by May. May went on to mention another Strictly frontrunner, Alexandra Burke, but then appeared to forget the names of the other contestants. This isn’t good enough. If May is going to indulge in stilted faux-populist chat that errs dangerously close to a critical scene in the 1980 film, The Elephant Man (“I (suck) am (snort) a human being!”), then she should at least know her stuff. Genuine Strictly fans, watching, in the sofa trenches, week after week, don’t tend to say: “Debbie McGee, Alexandra Burke… and, erm, you know, the other ones.” Nor do British citizens pay their taxes for PMs to have tragic meetings about what to name-check in popular culture and then forget half their brief.

The decision follows last week’s announcement that Whirlpool is the ‘worst offender’ for white goods fires in London. The tumble dryers, sold under the Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit brands, have been blamed for a number of UK fires, including one in a London tower block and a blaze in Wales where two men died. Rachel Reeves, chair of the Commons committee on business, energy and ndustrial strategy, accused the US firm of “falling significantly short of their responsibilities” amid continuing concerns about the safety of the dryers. In a letter to Whirlpool UK’s head of communications, Ian Moverley, she demanded to know why he failed to mention the replacement scheme was closing when he gave evidence to the committee in October. “Why did you not mention this when you gave evidence to the committee at the end of October?” Reeves wrote. “Please can you explain why you decided to end this scheme when there are one million defective tumble dryers still being used in households across the UK?” Moverley was unable to answer a series of questions from MPs during the session on 31 October and agreed to supply the committee with additional information after the hearing. The replacement scheme gave consumers the choice to buy a new machine for around £50, well below market value, rather than wait for them to be modified. Whirlpool has said that its decision to withdraw the scheme was down to lack of demand. Reeves added: “For Whirlpool to stop their replacement scheme of their tumble dryers due to a ‘fall in demand’ while 1 million customers still have these faulty appliances in their homes suggests a company falling significantly short of their responsibilities to consumer safety.” It has been reported that customers are desperate to replace their potentially dangerous dryers that risk catching fire when fluff touches the heating element. Whirlpool had previously identified a fire risk with two models of tumble dryers manufactured between 2004 and 2015. The company initially advised consumers the machines were safe to use with precautions while awaiting repair, before stating in February that the dryers should be unplugged until the repairs were done. Last month, a coroner called on Whirlpool to take action to prevent future deaths after an electrical fault in the door of one of its dryers was blamed for a fire which killed two men in a flat in Llanrwst, north Wales, in October 2014. An Indesit model also caused a serious fire in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, leading to the evacuation of more than 100 families. Twenty-five households were temporarily accommodated in hotels due to the extent of the damage. The company conceded that informing the owners of the remaining faulty machines – estimated to be around 3.8 million – had been difficult, despite doubling the number of their call centres. Whirlpool later said in a statement that it was still appealing to remaining owners of the affected models to get in contact so the dryers could be modified for free. “After two years of extensive measures to raise awareness, the number of consumers coming forward has now fallen sharply. This suggests that few affected appliances remain in service,” it said. “We wish to remind consumers that if they still own one of these appliances, it is never too late to get in touch.” It said anyone who owned an Indesit, Hotpoint, Creda, Swan or Proline dryer made between April 2004 and September 2015 could visit https://safety.indesit.eu/, https://safety.hotpoint.eu/ or https://safety-swan.eu to find out if their model was affected. UK consumers could also call Whirlpool’s freephone helpline on 0800 1510905."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/01/donald-trump-admires-and-respects-theresa-may-says-us-ambassador-woody-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T19:58:45Z","webTitle":"Trump 'admires and respects' Theresa May, says US ambassador","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/01/donald-trump-admires-and-respects-theresa-may-says-us-ambassador-woody-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/01/donald-trump-admires-and-respects-theresa-may-says-us-ambassador-woody-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Trump 'admires and respects' Theresa May, says US ambassador","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s ambassador to Britain has insisted that the US president “admires and respects” Theresa May, following the transatlantic spat over Trump sharing anti-Muslim propaganda online. Woody Johnson used an interview with Bloomberg on Friday to attempt to calm the diplomatic storm created by Trump’s retweets of videos from the far-right group Britain First, which prompted Britain’s ambassador to Washington complain to the White House. “The president and the prime minister have a very, very good relationship. I know the president admires and respects the prime minister greatly,” Johnson said. “I know that the prime minister was one of the first, the first visitor to the White House after the inauguration.” He added: “My job and the president’s job is to protect Americans. He’s doing the best that he can. You’re going to have little stumbles along the road. Absolutely. You’re going to have things that happen. But the intent is there and it’s genuine, and it’s going to happen.” May criticised Trump’s sharing of the extremist material, saying it had been “wrong”. But the president followed up his initial retweets with a riposte to the prime minister in which told her to concentrate on fighting terrorism in the UK. Politicians from across Britain’s main parties lined up to criticise Trump’s behaviour on Thursday, with many calling for the offer of a state visit to be formally withdrawn. May passed on an invitation from the Queen for a full state visit when she visited Trump at the White House days after his inauguration. The invitation was accepted – but privately few in government expect it to take place in the foreseeable future. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, condemned Trump’s retweets on Thursday, but urged MPs to focus on the “bigger picture” of Britain’s relationship with the US over the long term. “As home secretary I can tell the house that the importance of the relationship between our countries, the unparalleled sharing of intelligence between our countries, it has undoubtedly saved British lives. That is the bigger picture here and I would urge people to remember that,” she said. Johnson took a similar stance in his conciliatory interview on Friday, saying: “Our special relationship with the UK is centuries old and it’s been well tested through thick and thin, but it’s based on trust. “And trust is something that you earn over a long period of time. And I think trust is 100% there and so we will get past all these things and get on with our main job and leadership in the world, which needs leadership.” Johnson, a billionaire Republican donor and owner of the New York Jets NFL team, also claimed he liked the weather in the UK, finding it to be better than he had expected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/01/rafael-benitez-dissenters-fake-news-forced-out-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T22:30:01Z","webTitle":"Rafael Benítez says dissenters and fake news forced him out at Chelsea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/01/rafael-benitez-dissenters-fake-news-forced-out-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/01/rafael-benitez-dissenters-fake-news-forced-out-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Rafael Benítez says dissenters and fake news forced him out at Chelsea","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rafael Benítez will be reminded of what might have been on Saturday lunchtime when he returns to Stamford Bridge for the first time since his stint as Chelsea’s interim manager. Benítez, now in charge of Newcastle United, replaced Roberto Di Matteo in November 2012 and won the Europa League while finishing third in the Premier League. He would have been happy to continue and enjoyed some strong support within the club but believes the actions of a minority of fans persuaded the owner, Roman Abramovich, to replace him with José Mourinho. “The normal fans, the ones you can find on the streets, were OK with me,” Benítez said. “The majority of people realised I was doing a professional job and were happy. On a daily basis the atmosphere was very positive but maybe some fans, because of my past with Liverpool, were unhappy.” Those dissenters proved sufficiently vocal to derail any plans Chelsea’s hierarchy might have harboured about potentially retaining Benítez in post over the longer term. He believes “fake news” played a part in manufacturing what turned into a campaign to ensure that, despite “saving” Chelsea’s season, he would not remain in the dugout for long. “A teenager in the Czech Republic put on Twitter that I once said I would never manage Chelsea,” said the Champions League-winning former Liverpool manager. “That is simply not true yet this story was created. But I’m telling you, the fans in the street at the end, they were saying: ‘Carry on, you’re doing a great job.’ “All the feedback that I had from the professionals and the board was very positive. We achieved what they wanted. But they couldn’t manage what happened with some fans. In the end, they decided they had to change. “Initially, Abramovich brought me in to save the team. We achieved that and my relationship with him [Abramovich] was really good but a group of fans weren’t good to me. It doesn’t mean they were the majority though; I can tell you a lot of fans were happy with me. At the end, I had a lot of messages telling me I did really well.” Antonio Conte may not be doing quite as well as last season at Chelsea but his Newcastle counterpart refuses to completely write off the Italian’s chances of retaining the title. Although the London club, who are third, trail Manchester City, the leaders, by 11 points Benítez is not entirely sure if things will remain quite as straightforward as they seem. “I don’t know if Chelsea are out of the title race,” he said. “But I do know they are a very strong team who will be closer at the top of the table. They can win a lot of games. “I know Conte because I’ve competed against him in Italy and we’ve taken coaching courses together. He’s a very competitive manager who has done a great job at Chelsea. He’s a winner, he’s someone who is always pushing his team to win trophies.” For the moment, Benítez will simply be content if Newcastle win a few games.

In the past few weeks alone, terrible stories have emerged of the brutal treatment of Rohingya Muslims, forced to flee Myanmar to grim camps in neighbouring Bangladesh. A fortnight ago, CNN ran a devastating film shot undercover in Libya, showing young migrants from Nigeria being auctioned into slavery. The sight and sound of a market in human beings carries a weight that dwarfs other reporters’ graphic accounts of the scale of the trade. The impact of the CNN report drew unflattering attention to the EU-backed programme run by Libya to detain and repatriate migrants in order to prevent them attempting the Mediterranean crossing into Italy or Spain. This is an arrangement of convenience for Europe. It has led to migrants being held in wretched and degrading conditions that in an unusual rebuke of the countries that pay a significant part of the costs, were condemned by the UN as “inhuman”. This week the EU met with members of the African Union in Addis Ababa. The EU has now signed up to a programme to repatriate migrants rather than leaving the huge task to a country that is still in turmoil after the fall of Gaddafi, which was backed by the UK, France and the US. The great majority of the world’s displaced people flee to the nearest safe place, often another poor or middle-income country: in the past year a million refugees have arrived in Uganda from South Sudan. By far the largest part of the responsibility for those displaced around the Middle East has been borne by neighbouring countries, in particular Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Europe has been reluctant and defensive in responding to a crisis for which it is at least partly to blame. There has been a complete failure to agree a fair process for resettlement of refugees across the 28 member states. Greece and Italy have been left, for years now, to manage an unprecedented influx of desperate men, women and children. In an unparalleled international political vacuum, there has been little global leadership. Last year, the New York declaration on refugees and migrants tried to lay the framework for a positive approach. It starts with recognising realities: the forces that motivate young people to risk death in the hope of a better life need to be met not by the kind of resistance that ends up with thousands being penned up in a filthy Libyan detention centre, but by opening up legal channels of migration. Migrants want to work, and they want to be able to send cash home. Remittances are worth many billions of dollars to the economies of the global south; they cannot replace development aid, but they far outstrip its value. This time next year a UN refugee summit in Morocco aims to have a programme for legal migration in place. A humane policy for migrants would make it easier to distinguish and meet our obligations to refugees, those who flee in fear. The responsibility for displaced people has fallen on poorer countries in a grossly disproportionate way. At the very least, there should be a programme of education so that every child in every camp has a school place. Internally displaced people need to be helped to find work (not always easy) and supported with direct cash payments that will go back into the local economy. But all of this depends on changing attitudes, above all moving away from the language of threat. Many people in the rich world want to – and do – support refugees, often in a more personal way than giving money: Canada’s scheme, for example, of finding sponsors for 15,000 Syrian refugees was hugely oversubscribed. Fear often speaks with a powerful voice. But so can that other great human emotion, solidarity. The former foreign secretary David Miliband has called this crisis a test of humanity. It is one that we must not fail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/02/judge-suspends-part-of-quebecs-face-covering-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T02:20:47Z","webTitle":"Judge suspends part of Quebec's face-covering ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/02/judge-suspends-part-of-quebecs-face-covering-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/02/judge-suspends-part-of-quebecs-face-covering-ban","fields":{"headline":"Judge suspends part of Quebec's face-covering ban","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Canadian judge has suspended part of a Quebec law banning people from wearing full-face veils when giving or receiving public services, handing a provisional victory to civil liberties groups who argued that the law is unconstitutional and discriminates against Muslim women. Judge Babak Barin on Friday suspended the portion of the act banning face coverings until the government enacts guidelines for how the law will be applied and how exemptions might be granted. The government of the mainly French-speaking province of Quebec now has a chance to clarify in detail how the law would be put into practice. The law, passed in October, affects everyone from teachers and students to hospital employees, police officers, bus drivers and transit users. While the law does not single out any religion by name, debate has focused on the niqab, a full-face veil worn by a small minority of Muslim women. Lawyer Catherine McKenzie, who is representing the people challenging the law, said the judge “recognised the immediate harm the law was causing to the people it affects outweighed any theoretical public purpose of the law”. Quebec’s centrist Liberal government is defending the law in court, saying it does not discriminate against Muslim women and is necessary for reasons of security, identification and communication. The act’s name refers to “religious neutrality” and “accommodations on religious grounds”. “I’m not unsatisfied with the judgment because there’s no mention that the law contravenes the charters (of rights),” the Quebec premier, Philippe Couillard, told reporters Friday. The National Council for Canadian Muslims welcomed the ruling “as a successful first step”, its executive director, Ihsaan Gardee, said. Opponents of the law say it targets a visible minority that has been subject to threats and violence. Quebec had about 243,000 Muslims as of 2011, according to Statistics Canada, out of a population of 8 million. In January a gunman walked into a Quebec City mosque and shot six people to death. A French-Canadian university student has been charged as the sole suspect. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria have imposed restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils in public places. Denmark plans to institute its own ban."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/02/increase-company-tax-based-on-executive-pay-wayne-swan-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T02:43:50Z","webTitle":"Increase company tax based on executive pay, Wayne Swan says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/02/increase-company-tax-based-on-executive-pay-wayne-swan-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/02/increase-company-tax-based-on-executive-pay-wayne-swan-says","fields":{"headline":"Increase company tax based on executive pay, Wayne Swan says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Governments should increase company taxes if top executives continue to draw huge salaries, in order to give workers a fairer share of the economic pie, according to the former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan. Swan will use a speech on Saturday marking the 45th anniversary of the election of the Whitlam government to argue that political parties on the centre left must be unequivocal in articulating an economic framework that delivers rising living standards for workers. He notes that last year, the head of Commonwealth Bank received $12.3m, “or the combined salary of 250 Commonwealth Bank tellers”. “One way for governments to combat this is by enforcing higher company tax rates the higher that this pay ratio goes. If executives can seize the rewards of a higher share price, why shouldn’t workers benefit too?” Swan, who has been active and vocal in Labor’s internal debate in opposition about the party’s economic direction, says Australia in contemporary political times “has returned to the same fractures as in 1975, with one vast difference: the vested interests in our society are richer, more politically active and are more willing to align themselves with one side of politics than at any time post war”. He says vested interests “will stop at nothing to entrench unfairness at every level: income and wealth inequality, social immobility, and a political process entirely captive to the top end of town”. “The radicalisation of the right and the polarisation of politics demands that centre left parties articulate an economic framework which delivers rising living standards for workers,” Swan says. “If we fail, then neoliberal ideologues – cloaked in Trumpian populism – may lead us down the road to ruin once more”. Swan says if contemporary Labor is to build on Gough Whitlam’s legacy and see off the challenge of right-wing populism, it needs to construct economic policy around four progressive pillars: Sustained full employment, defined as a level of unemployment of 3% or less; An activist fiscal policy, including Keynesian demand management “as a means of eliminating spare capacity and achieving full employment”; A stronger voice for workers; Taming corporate excess from executive remuneration to oligopoly power in the economy, and advancing Australia’s “world-leading progressive tax system”. While the Turnbull government appears to be pressing ahead with its promise to reduce company tax for big business, and is also flagging personal income tax cuts, Swan says Labor must not take a backward step in holding corporations to their tax responsibilities. “Every time we hear the argument that Australian companies pay too much tax, we should take a moment to remind ourselves that in recent years, one-third of our largest corporations paid no tax at all,” he says. “If the Reserve Bank governor considers it reasonable for workers to simply demand higher pay, it should also be fair game for governments to demand that corporations pay their fair share of tax. “We can do no greater justice to Gough’s legacy than by reaffirming boldly our commitment to being the party of initiative, the party of inclusive prosperity, and the party of not just the ‘men and women of Australia’, but of their children and their grandchildren, too.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/01/tiger-woods-successful-second-round-comeback","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T21:54:25Z","webTitle":"Tiger Woods pulls one out of the hat after finding old magic in Bahamas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/01/tiger-woods-successful-second-round-comeback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/01/tiger-woods-successful-second-round-comeback","fields":{"headline":"Tiger Woods pulls one out of the hat after finding old magic in Bahamas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For a Friday afternoon spell, the only danger attached to this Tiger Woods comeback was attached to fevered expectation. His second-round performance at the Hero World Challenge had been impressive enough before Woods cracked a 265-yard approach to within 15ft of the 9th hole. He converted for an eagle and sat alone at the summit of the leaderboard. Crowds whooped and other players took notice. Woods confirmed a front nine of only 31 shots. A social media frenzy was underway. In typifying the complex struggle Woods has endured to even get to a competitive environment at all, one step back succeeded the two forward. The 41-year-old played the inward half in one over par before signing for a 68, with Charley Hoffman’s imperious 63 meaning Woods is five adrift of the halfway lead. Jordan Spieth and Tommy Fleetwood share second at nine under. Still, Woods declared this a “successful” round. When asked whether he still believed victory is a possibility, he offered a reply more typical of his heyday. “What do you think?” Woods did concede he would have gladly accepted rounds of 69 and 68 before the tournament started. Among those Woods has taken by surprise in reaching seven under inside 36 holes is his caddie, Joe LaCava. “He has definitely played better than I thought he could,” said the experienced bag man. Woods was not unduly worried by a dropped shot at the last. It was inevitable after his drive found a horrendous lie. “I built on what I did yesterday, I cleaned it up,” he said. “I just wanted to go out there and just play, compete. “As I told you guys earlier this week, I didn’t know what to expect because I hadn’t played, I hadn’t competed, I haven’t had a fused back before in my life. “These are all new things. As you can see that even with the fused back, I still have some speed out there and these are all things I’ve had to learn and will continue to learn. “This is a new body that I’m getting used to. I felt like today I could have easily gotten to double digits under par. That would have put me probably one or two back but I think I’m still in it. We’ve got two more days and I think it’s supposed to blow a little harder. If that’s the case, I think a good solid round should get me up in there.” Henrik Stenson, who partnered Woods on Friday, cited increased green speeds as being like a major championship. Woods struggled with the pace of long putts in particular. His long game, as was the case in the first round, appeared perfectly sound. The same applied to his physical condition. “There are no issues, none,” said Woods of his back. “That’s one of the reasons I went out and played nine straight days, back home and down here as well. My body’s accustomed to playing. It’s a little different playing tournament golf but the body’s good.” Hoffman laughed at the assertion he may become public enemy No1 by denying Woods what would be an extraordinary Albany victory. “To be completely honest, I said at the beginning of the week I hope he wins,” Hoffman said. “Anytime he’s in contention or even playing brings a buzz to golf that we all need. We need him out here, we want him out here.” Perhaps any wager on Hoffman in event of this particular two-man shootout would not be wise. How Woods would cherish the scene."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/01/google-gender-pay-discrimination-lawsuit","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-02T01:58:52Z","webTitle":"Google refuses legal request to share pay records in gender discrimination case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/01/google-gender-pay-discrimination-lawsuit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/01/google-gender-pay-discrimination-lawsuit","fields":{"headline":"Google refuses legal request to share pay records in gender discrimination case","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Google is resisting a legal request to disclose salary records in a class-action gender discrimination lawsuit, marking the technology company’s latest efforts to prevent scrutiny of how much it pays its female employees. Google attorneys argued in court on Friday that a judge should block a suit brought by former employees alleging systematic pay disparities on behalf of all women at the company. The company is also arguing that it should not have to provide information on the salaries of men and women or disclose wage policy documents until a first ruling on the class-action status. The judge has not yet made an official decision but on Friday appeared to side with the tech giant on a number of issues. The class-action complaint filed in September provided the most detailed formal accounts to date of gender discrimination at Google, alleging that the company denies promotions and career opportunities to qualified women and “segregates” them into lower-paying positions. Google’s latest efforts to thwart the lawsuit and avoid disclosures come at a time when the tech industry is reeling over allegations of misogyny, sexual harassment and an overall lack of diversity. “Clearly the data is not good for them, and they don’t want to turn it over,” James Finberg, a civil rights attorney representing the employees, said after the hearing in San Francisco. “Eventually, the truth will come out, and the truth will show that they do in fact pay women less than men in the same job title in nearly every job.” The suit – which provides accounts of alleged discrimination against a former engineer, business manager and sales employee – builds on claims by the US Department of Labor (DoL). Earlier this year, the federal regulator alleged “extreme” pay discrimination in positions and departments throughout Google and sued the Mountain View, California-based company for salary records as part of its audit. Google has publicly insisted that it has no gender pay gap and is a leader on diversity and inclusion. But the company has also repeatedly resisted efforts to open its books to the government, has tried to block media coverage of its DoL dispute and has faced accusations that its strict confidentiality policies silence whistleblowers. In July, a judge ultimately forced the company to disclose certain compensation documents to federal investigators. In court on Friday, Google’s lawyers argued that it was overly broad to file a complaint on behalf of all women employed by the company in California over the last four years and that the allegations of discrimination extended beyond applicable fair pay laws. “It’s just an open-ended probe into the job duties of every employee in the entire company,” said the Google attorney Zachary Hutton. Later, referencing the plaintiffs’ requests for salary records, he said: “I cannot conceive of a more probing, more onerous set of discovery.” Google faced backlash earlier this year when it argued it was too financially burdensome and challenging to compile the compensation data that the federal government had requested. On Friday, after the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that Google should turn over policy records and salary data the company had already disclosed to the DoL, the Google attorney Felicia Davis argued that the request was premature and that it should come after a ruling on the class-action status of the case. Davis also said some of what the lawyers had requested was too expansive and not relevant, adding: “It’s just a lot of extra work.” Judge Mary Wiss responded: “I don’t know that because it’s a lot of work it shouldn’t be produced.” But the judge questioned the scope of the class-action case and seemed to agree with Google on some matters. She issued no formal ruling, but said she believed there were “deficiencies” in the plaintiffs’ claims, called the suit “overly broad” and said she was inclined to rule in favor of Google in its initial pleadings to limit the class-action scope of the case. She also said Google did not yet have to provide any of the broader documents and records at this preliminary stage. Hutton also repeatedly argued that even if there was a wage gap at the company, it was not necessarily illegal: “Pay disparity by itself does not establish a violation. You have to examine the reasons the disparity exists.” The class-action attorneys argued that, based on the DoL’s investigation and the claims of their plaintiffs, the pay gaps were widespread and unlawful at Google. “There is a serious problem at Google of paying women less,” testified Kelly Dermody, another lawyer representing the employees. “This is a critical cutting-edge matter in society.” Google initially declined to provide a comment. However, following publication of the article, a Google spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano, emphasized in a statement to the Guardian that the judge’s tentative ruling had sided with the company. “The plaintiffs want class-wide discovery but haven’t provided the facts to support that. We argued that discovery should therefore be on hold until that’s resolved. The Judge agreed,” she said. “We believe the data makes our case and have agreed to produce compensation policies and practices, as well as additional compensation data once their pleadings are finalized.” When the case was filed, the company defended its pay practices in a statement: “Job levels and promotions are determined through rigorous hiring and promotion committees, and must pass multiple levels of review, including checks to make sure there is no gender bias in these decisions.” After the hearing, Finberg noted that Google’s attorneys did not deny there was a pay disparity and criticized the corporation for a lack of transparency: “They fought hard against the DoL. They fought hard against us. To me, it’s an indication they have something to hide.” Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/03/dockless-bicycles-sharing-london-transport","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T00:03:26Z","webTitle":"Is shared cycling in London on a road to nowhere?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/03/dockless-bicycles-sharing-london-transport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/03/dockless-bicycles-sharing-london-transport","fields":{"headline":"Is shared cycling in London on a road to nowhere?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Using my phone as a divining rod, I walked towards a bouncing yellow dot and turned down a quiet side street. The road came to a dead end, but tucked away in the corner I found an alleyway. At the end of the alleyway, it split into another alleyway, where I came face to face with a stocky bull terrier, sitting alone, whose expression seemed to calmly say, “Turn back now, and nobody will get hurt.” I did a quiet runner. My first attempt to track down a dockless bike in London was not going well. This year, four dockless bike hire schemes have appeared in the capital, following similar launches in cities including Bristol, Manchester, Oxford and Cambridge. In London, three are still in operation and, while it is tricky to confirm an exact number, there are estimated to be more than 3,000 dockless bikes on the streets. Urbo has acid green and silver bikes in the borough of Waltham Forest; the neon orange Mobikes started out with a trial in Ealing and has just expanded to Islington; Ofo, notable for its New York cab-yellow frames, expanded from its Hackney base in September. OBike, the first company to launch in London last July, is on a temporary hiatus while it irons out some kinks with the local authorities. (In August, Wandsworth council gloatingly tweeted a picture of all the oBikes it had impounded.) I use my own bike in London for the most part, but when I lock it up I inevitably steel myself for it not to be there when I get back (more than 2,000 bikes were reported stolen in London in September alone). The Santander bikes of Transport for London (TfL) are handy for shorter, unexpected journeys – but at £2 for 30 minutes they are now more expensive than a bus and it can be hard to find a free dock. So the concept of a cheaper, dockless bike is promising and the next few months should give some indication as to whether such schemes can work on the mean roads of London, where cycling can resemble a Hunger Games on wheels. In theory, you can pick up a bike as easily as you would order a cab or a takeaway, then drop it off at the end of your journey, wherever that may be. Because of their convenience and cost – for 30 minutes, you’ll pay a quarter of what you would pay for the docked-bike Santander scheme – the idea is that London could become a haven of sustainable, eco-friendly transport. When the mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced the arrival of a new fleet of upgraded Santander cycles in October, he expressed his continuing support for cycling in the city. “Tens of thousands of Londoners and tourists enjoy using the bikes to get around our city every single day, so by making them more comfortable and manoeuvrable we’re hoping they’ll be even more popular. That’s good for our health, our air quality and for tackling congestion.” I love health, air quality and tackling congestion, so I thought I’d try to get an Ofo home from lunch, since its app showed a couple of bikes close to where I had been in north London. That is when I met the canine guardian. But the lack of a bike where promised had a strange effect. I suddenly felt determined to find one, as if it was the summer of 2016 and the app was Pokémon Go. I got a bus to where the next bike was marked, which brought me to the front of a big, locked, gated garage underneath a block of flats. I started to feel as if Ofo was a creepy old troll beckoning me to follow him under a bridge, and it seemed increasingly gung-ho to wave my phone around, looking confused, when commonsense says keep it in your pocket unless you want it to get swiped by a kid on a passing moped. I kept going, got to a third bike, felt as if I had found Pikachu, quickly discovered it was faulty and would not budge, was charged anyway, then got the bus home, 90 minutes after I had set off. Eventually I started to learn the ropes, and the first crucial lesson seemed to be that if the map doesn’t show it on a road, it is probably in someone’s shed, or, as I tried to find my fifth bike, having walked past rows and rows of now beautiful-looking docks, in a locked office car park, just waiting for the person who originally hired it to ride home. These first few attempts were disheartening and made it seem as if we are simply incapable of sharing. Haroon Khan is the head of oBikes in the UK, and says he does not believe that is the case. “I honestly think people can share. There was a lot of scepticism when Airbnb happened – Are people going to want to rent their homes out? Will people trash them? – But we don’t really see that happening,” he says, pointing to the scale of Airbnb compared with the number of complaints. He is hoping that, after discussions with local councils and authorities aimed at agreeing a code of conduct, oBikes will return to London early next year. One of the incentives aimed at getting people to play nicely with bikes is a points system – park in a designated area and you gain points, park it outside one and you lose them. Lose enough points and you will be barred from access. But learning to share is a complicated business. Birgitta Gatersleben, a reader in environmental psychology at the University of Surrey, suggests there could be lessons to learn from an American study of towel re-use in hotels. “They found that towel re-use significantly increased when the normal towel re-use message (save water and energy) included a line stating that most of the guests who had stayed in that room re-used their towel. We are very social beings, so knowing what other people do and think can have quite an impact on us.” My second day searching for dockless bikes was more promising. Urbo is already established in Waltham Forest and it seems to lack some of the problems of its competitors. I found the bikes easily, because it is strongly suggested that you leave them in a designated parking zone. And yet something about these marked-off spaces seemed familiar. They were, essentially, docks. If I wanted more freedom I would need to find an Ofo or a Mobike. I pinched and zoomed the map to find an area where Ofos were dense, and hit upon Islington, London’s dockless bike nirvana. The place was teeming with them. I tried a Mobike – easy to ride, but the lack of gears made it a real grind to get up a hill of any size, so halfway up a particularly steep incline I ditched it outside Tesco. Then, finally, an Ofo, the seventh I had tried to get hold of. It made up for its earlier coquettishness by being a relatively sturdy if inelegant ride, with three gears making the hills slightly easier. Still, riding one feels as if you are being wheeled around a car park in a shopping trolley; they are built for brevity, not endurance. Dockless bikes have been a bumpy addition to many cities. In China, Bluegogo, the third biggest bike share company (after Ofo and Mobike, also Chinese-owned) has just gone bankrupt and there are stunning photographs of its remains: thousands of discarded bikes in eerie piles. In Australia, authorities in Sydney and Melbourne have cracked down on the “urban clutter” of dockless bikes, and there have been complaints in various US cities, from Washington to Seattle, about clutter and vandalism. Haroon Khan says that one of the lessons learned by oBike, from both its London problems and its success in Oxford, where it launched in October after a six-week trial, is to have enough people on the ground managing the fleet. “The key to a good model is to make sure you have a good rebalancing and redistribution scheme throughout the day,” he says. Could these bikeshare schemes ultimately threaten the Santander cycles? Michael Hurwitz, Director of Transport Innovation at TfL, isn’t too worried, and points out that they’ve just had their best November – with 791,961 hires. “We are working hard to improve opportunities for cycling across London and welcome new ideas that have the potential to make cycling easier and more accessible,” he says. “This is particularly the case in outer London, where there are fewer cycle hire options available. However, it is vital that dockless operators work closely with boroughs and TfL to ensure the bike hire schemes are responsibly managed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/03/solution-irish-border-blind-ideology-dup-brexiteers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T17:55:37Z","webTitle":"There is a solution to the Irish border imbroglio.

But blind ideology prevents it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The frustrating thing about the row over the impact of Brexit on the Irish border is that there is an obvious and straightforward solution. When Britain eventually leaves the EU, Northern Ireland should remain within the customs union. While not perfect, it is undeniably the simplest way to avoid the difficulties that would come with a hard border between the two parts of Ireland. But this proposal has been rejected by the DUP. Yet it is tough to be sympathetic to their stance, because ultimately it is one based exclusively on symbolism rather than pragmatism. DUP MP Sammy Wilson stated recently that if the Conservatives are prepared “to have Northern Ireland treated differently than the rest of the UK”, his party could no longer support the government. The problem with this logic is that since the formation of the United Kingdom in 1707, there has always been considerable differentiation between its constituent parts. Scotland had the Presbyterian kirk as its official state church while England had an Anglican equivalent. An independent and separate Scottish legal system is still in place today. Nor is Northern Ireland any different in this regard. Northern Irish banknotes are not accepted in Britain. Gay marriage and abortion are legal in Britain, not so in Northern Ireland. Indeed unionists over the last century have shown themselves to be quite willing to accept different treatment from the rest of the UK when it suits their own predilections. Some would argue that the key to the union enduring over the last 300 years has been the willingness to show administrative flexibility toward local particularisms. Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union would not change that. It is hard to see what practical difficulties the DUP see with this proposal. Granted, the need to inspect trade goods entering Britain from Northern Ireland could conceivably add something to their cost. But would this really not be compensated for by Northern Ireland retaining free access to the EU markets? Such considerations appear pointless, however. The DUP position is unassailable. Through their “confidence and supply” arrangement with the Tories, Arlene Foster and colleagues can block any move to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union. Or so we are told. But the reality is different. If the DUP feels its “confidence and supply” arrangement serves as a big stick to keep the Tories on their side, then they fail to realise that the Conservatives potentially have a howitzer to deploy against their government allies. And that is a border poll. Under the Good Friday agreement, a border poll can only be called by the secretary of state for Northern Ireland. The agreement says the secretary can order such a vote “if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should … form part of a united Ireland”. This language is intentionally vague. The current secretary is James Brokenshire, a Conservative MP. If he decided to initiate a border poll tomorrow, there is nothing the DUP could do to stop him. The DUP might not like the idea of remaining in the EU customs union, but it would look a great deal more appealing if the alternative was dealing with a border poll. In the 2016 Northern Irish assembly elections, 46% of first-preference votes went to parties opposed to Irish unity, with 40% for those in favour. That same year, 56% of the Northern Irish vote was cast against leaving the EU. A vote to retain the status quo would probably begin as the favourite, but a unionist victory in a border poll would be far from a certain thing. In other words, if DUP resistance is the only thing stymying the best solution to the Irish border issue, then the Tories have ample ammunition to play hardball. Except, of course, that this has ideological problems for them as well. John Major’s 1993 declaration that the British government has no “selfish interest” in keeping Northern Ireland within the UK probably reflects the attitude of the majority of British people. But not that of hard Brexiteers. They suffer from what JA Hobson once termed “milomania”, the desire to hoard land on a map. They could no more stomach a border poll than the DUP, afraid of the vote going the “wrong” way. After all, the worst way to launch empire 2.0 would be to surrender the final original piece of empire 1.0. Thus, ideological blindness stops the DUP from accepting a reasonable solution and stops the Tories using their obvious leverage to break the impasse. The irony is that, for over two centuries, the political difficulties between Britain and Ireland have been largely attributed to irrational Irish intransigence in response to enlightened and practical British benevolence. How times have changed. • Caoimhín de Barra is assistant professor of history at Drew University in New Jersey"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/01/michael-flynn-wrongdoing-tip-iceberg","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T19:10:57Z","webTitle":"Michael Flynn's wrongdoing is just the tip of the iceberg | Richard Wolffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/michael-flynn-wrongdoing-tip-iceberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/01/michael-flynn-wrongdoing-tip-iceberg","fields":{"headline":"Michael Flynn's wrongdoing is just the tip of the iceberg","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That scampering sound you can hear is just the rats disembarking from the sinking ship. Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, is not just any old rodent. For so long, he was the only faintly known quantity in national security to be desperate or insane enough to get close to Donald Trump. His guilty plea to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador is no minor development. As all the other stampeding rats know, it is the tip of this perilous iceberg. How can you tell? Because suddenly the White House is dismissing Flynn as a bit player in the history of Team Trump. Ty Cobb, the White House special counsel with the unsavory task of defending Trump on a dozen fronts, issued this statement to the press: “Today, Michael Flynn, a former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days during the Trump Administration, and a former Obama administration official, entered a guilty plea to a single count of making a false statement to the FBI.” Worse than being a nobody, Flynn was actually an Obama official. Yes, seriously. Never mind that he was fired by Obama as head of the defense intelligence agency for being such a screwball. Cue all the talk of the deep state on the fringes of conservative media. But that’s not all. Cobb is in agreement with the real special counsel, Robert Mueller, on Flynn’s multiple crimes. After all, Flynn was fired precisely because he was such a rat. “The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,” Cobb said. “Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel’s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.” Well, at least the last line rings true. Mueller is indeed moving with all deliberate speed, and his direction is totally reasonable. Let us review how far Mueller has traveled in recent weeks. It’s only one month since the guilty plea by one George Papadopoulos, the Trump campaign’s point man on Russia, on charges of lying about his extensive efforts to collude with Russian officials during last year’s election. That means it’s also only one month since Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, was charged with multiple counts of laundering Ukraine government money, along with his associate Rick Gates. Manafort, who is pleading not guilty, was freed on bail of $10m this week. In lobbying, they used to call that nice work if you can get it. And it’s only two weeks since we learned of Donald Trump Jr’s coordination with WikiLeaks about Hillary Clinton’s emails, which you recall were hacked by the Trump campaign’s friends in Moscow. Flynn’s guilty plea suggests he’s avoiding far worse charges in exchange for cooperation with Mueller’s investigations. That isn’t surprising, given his failure to disclose his foreign lobbying and all the reporting about his various deals with Turkey and Russia during his time in the campaign, in the transition, and even in the White House. But there’s more. According to ABC News, Flynn is sharing with Mueller how Trump himself told him to contact the Russians, at first in an effort to coordinate against Isis. Flynn’s cooperation takes the trail of Russian collusion to the desk of the man we all know is at the center of this plot: Donald J Trump. We know it because Trump really can’t help but broadcast his guilt. When the Russians hacked Clinton’s emails, Trump publicly asked them to hack some more. When Flynn back-channeled with the Russians to undermine the Obama administration, Trump tweeted about how “very smart” Putin was. It remains unclear whether Putin feels the same way about Trump. When his son was caught, ironically by email, colluding with the Russian-backed WikiLeaks, Trump tweeted there was “NO COLLUSION!” Maybe the ALL CAPS are the giveaway here. Trump says he believes Putin when he claims he didn’t meddle with Trump’s election. At the same time, he really wants all this Russia stuff to go away. Senator Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the intelligence committee, took the unusual step of going on the record about Trump’s pressure to end his Russia investigation. “It was something along the lines of, ‘I hope you can conclude this as quickly as possible,’” Burr said. Of course, that’s nothing compared to firing the former FBI director James Comey, presumably because he refused to end his Russia investigation before it had really started. All this week there have been warning signs about the cracks appearing in the hull of Steamship Trump. The behavior of the 45th president has grown so bizarre that there is now open talk that he just might be unhinged. Trump managed to astonish the far-right wingnuts with his Islamophobic tweets, cleaving apart his alliance with the British government. He hurled unfounded allegations against news executives, and continued to bleat on about Hillary Clinton’s emails. There’s something so deliciously guilty about a man who claims his election rival was a threat to national security, at the same time as he was compromising national security. Then again, Flynn himself whipped up all the Trumpistas at the party convention crowd by insisting that he would go to jail if he had done one tenth of Clinton’s supposed wrongdoing. Now that’s truly delicious. With all the hindsight that a week gives us, it’s clear that Trump isn’t mad with his reckless tweeting. He’s just desperate: the last caged rat who knows he has nowhere left to go as his one-time friends leave him behind. If he weren’t so crassly offensive, he might just be pitiful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/01/stoke-city-swansea-city-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T18:31:02Z","webTitle":"Stoke City v Swansea City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/01/stoke-city-swansea-city-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/01/stoke-city-swansea-city-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Stoke City v Swansea City: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Mark Hughes has admitted this is a must-win match for Stoke City who badly need to reverse the downward spiral in which they seem locked.

At the outset, the issues in the case were politically sensitive. The Conservatives, then in opposition, were receiving leaked documents from inside the Home Office. Some of these came from the office safe of the then home secretary, Labour’s Jacqui Smith. Christopher Galley, a civil servant, was suspected of copying the documents to the shadow immigration minister, Mr Green. The cabinet secretary called in the Metropolitan police in October 2008 and the police raided Mr Green’s home and his Commons office the following month, holding him for nine hours, confiscating his phone and going through his computers. The arrests rightly caused a massive row. No MP had ever been arrested or had their office searched by police in a leak inquiry. The case trespassed on parliamentary privileges in place ever since Charles I attempted to arrest a group of MPs in 1642. David Cameron condemned the search as Stalinesque. Mr Green said that it was his job to criticise government immigration policy and “that’s precisely what I was doing in this case”. In April 2009, the then director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, decided that there was “insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction” against Mr Galley or Mr Green and said he had taken his decision in part because the leaked information did not damage national security. Fast forward now to last month, when the former Met assistant commissioner Bob Quick told a Sunday Times journalist that one of Mr Green’s office computers in the 2008 search contained pornographic material. Mr Green responded that the claims were “completely untrue” and were “false, disreputable political smears from a discredited police officer”. On Friday a second former police officer, Neil Lewis, repeated the accusations to the BBC. This provoked several senior Tories, including David Davis (who until shortly before the 2008 search had been shadow home secretary) to rally behind Mr Green. Meanwhile the claims are being investigated by the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics chief, Sue Gray, as part of a wider inquiry into allegations against the first secretary; her report is expected shortly. Nine years on, the 2008 raid still festers. Mr Green still bears a raw and understandable grudge against the police search and those who authorised it. His bitterness is amply reciprocated by former police, who feel Mr Green is not telling the truth and is out to get them. Over the years the issues have become tangled up in Tory party politics, in relations between the Met and politicians, in arguments about the press and privacy, including the Leveson inquiry, and now in public concerns about Commons culture. It isn’t just Mr Green who is now more prominent than in 2008. Several others with roles in the original saga, including Mr Davis, Boris Johnson, Sir Keir Starmer and Cressida Dick, now have bigger responsibilities. The Green case is a murky confluence of principles which all matter, though they can sometimes conflict. These include: the defence of parliament’s special privileges, the right of MPs to hold leaked information, the need for leak inquiries to be proportionate to genuine harm, the obligations on police to observe confidentiality and to stay out of politics, the inappropriateness of pornography both in the workplace and in general, and the protection of privacy in matters of sexuality where no illegality is involved. None of these issues, moreover, can be wholly separated from the constant contest for political advantage within and between political parties. In the end, though, the outcome of the Green affair seems likely to come down, and should, to an even more basic principle – which of Mr Green and his accusers is telling the truth? – and to an even more important judgment: which of them should be believed?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/23/what-im-really-thinking-reluctant-christmas-day-guest","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-23T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"What I’m really thinking: the reluctant Christmas Day guest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/23/what-im-really-thinking-reluctant-christmas-day-guest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/23/what-im-really-thinking-reluctant-christmas-day-guest","fields":{"headline":"What I’m really thinking: the reluctant Christmas Day guest","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"So it’s that day again.

The announcement comes amid mounting allegations of sexual misconduct in politics and intense scrutiny over how such claims are handled on Capitol Hill. It emerged last month that accusations of sexual harassment in Congress are overseen by the little-known Office of Compliance, which over two decades used roughly $17m in taxpayer dollars to pay out settlements and awards to federal employees. On Friday, leaders on the House ethics committee called on the Office of Compliance to “promptly” hand over “all records … related to any claims of sexual harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or any other employment practice” prohibited under federal law. “Sexual harassment and employment discrimination are prohibited in the House of Representatives,” Susan Brooks, the Republican chairwoman of the committee, and ranking Democratic member Ted Deutch, wrote. “The law also prohibits actions that have a ‘disparate impact’ on an employee on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or religion, despite appearing neutral in practice.” The request for records applies not only to members of Congress, but also staffers and other officers employed in the House of Representatives. The issue of sexual harassment settlements boiled to the surface earlier this month when it was revealed John Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan, quietly agreed to settle a claim by a former employee that she was fired for refusing his sexual advances. The former staffer was “rehired” as a temporary employee and paid more than $27,000 from Conyers’ congressional office budget, in what was made to look like ordinary payroll. After initially defending Conyers’ legacy, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, on Thursday called on the congressman to resign. Conyers, who is the longest-serving member of Congress, has insisted he is innocent even while a second woman came forward to accuse him of misconduct. Senator Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, has also faced allegations from several women of inappropriate sexual behavior. Two women have said he attempted to forcibly kiss them, while a host others have accused Franken of grabbing their buttocks. The encounters range from before Franken’s time in elected office to when he was already a sitting US senator. Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. Some of the accusers claim Moore, a former judge, molested them when they were teenagers. The allegations have been bolstered by a period of reckoning around sexual assault, with powerful men across entertainment and media losing their jobs following reports of widespread misconduct – often over a period of years. But the careers of politicians who stand accused of sexual harassment have yet to suffer the same fate. Conyers and Franken have thus far declined to resign, saying instead they will cooperate with separate investigations led by the House and Senate ethics committees. Even as Republican lawmakers called on Moore to step aside from the Alabama Senate race, he drew the support of Donald Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual assault by numerous women. It was also revealed on Friday that Blake Farenthold, a Republican congressman from Texas, used taxpayers’ money to settle a sexual harassment claim brought by his former spokeswoman. According to a report published in Politico, Farenthold was sued in 2014 by Lauren Greene, then his communications director, over allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination. Greene also accused Farenthold of creating a hostile work environment and firing her after she complained about his behavior. Although Greene filed a lawsuit in the US district court in the District of Columbia, she dropped the case after reaching a private settlement with the congressman. Gregg Harper, the chairman of the House administration committee, has said the Office of Compliance account was only used once by the House office in the past five years, to settle a sexual harassment complaint amounting to $84,000. Neither Farenthold nor Greene’s lawyer would confirm if their case was the $84,000 settlement in question, Politico reported. The House and Senate both approved resolutions in recent weeks requiring anti-sexual harassment and anti-discrimination training for all members of Congress and staff. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said on Friday federal lawmakers should be held to a “high standard” while noting the 1995 law that paved the way for secret settlements “needs to be updated and upgraded”. “I think we’re all realizing that sexual harassment in America is absolutely pervasive and it’s got to go and we need to end it,” Ryan told NPR. “Nowhere is this more important to set a standard and example than elected officials.” Ryan struggled, however, to say why the allegations against Trump were not being treated as seriously as those against Moore and others. “I haven’t spent my time reviewing the difference in these two cases,” he said. “Roy Moore is trying to come to Congress. “My job here as speaker of the House is to help make sure that Congress is an institution that we’re proud of, and that’s what I’m focused on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/01/800-jobs-may-go-as-toys-r-us-to-close-third-of-uk-stores","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-01T19:08:02Z","webTitle":"Up to 800 jobs may go as Toys R Us looks to close third of UK stores","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/01/800-jobs-may-go-as-toys-r-us-to-close-third-of-uk-stores","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/01/800-jobs-may-go-as-toys-r-us-to-close-third-of-uk-stores","fields":{"headline":"Up to 800 jobs may go as Toys R Us looks to close third of UK stores","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Up to 800 jobs are on the line after it emerged that struggling US retailer Toys R Us is looking to close a third of its UK stores. Toys R Us is understood to be working on a company voluntary agreement (CVA), an insolvency procedure used by retailers to close loss-making stores. It comes as retailers struggle to coax shoppers to part with their cash in the run-up to Christmas, normally the sector’s busiest period of the year. Experts said November had been a disastrous month for the toy industry, with sales down 10% and profit margins under pressure from excessive discounting. Toys R Us is a subsidiary of the eponymous US chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection in September after running up $5bn (£3.7bn) of debts. The collapse came more than a decade after a $7.5bn leveraged buyout by private equity firms KKR, Bain and Vornado. The UK business has been struggling for the same reasons as its parent, as shoppers shun the large out-of-town sheds that are synonymous with the Toys R Us brand, in favour of shopping online or buying toys alongside groceries in supermarkets. Lego, the world’s most profitable toy manufacturer, suffered the first fall in global sales for more than a decade in the first six months of 2017. Toys R Us’s problems are just the latest sign of high street distress. About 2,500 jobs were lost and a further 900 remain at risk at convenience store supplier Palmer &amp; Harvey earlier this week after it called in the administrators, while furniture chains Multiyork and Feather &amp; Black have also recently filed for administration, putting a further 600 jobs at risk. Toys R Us’s UK management is understood to be finalising the details of the CVA – first reported by Sky News – which still has to be signed off by its US parent. Alvarez &amp; Marsal, a specialist adviser on corporate insolvencies, is expected to handle the process, which could prompt 25 of its 84 permanent UK stores to close. Toys R Us trades from more than 100 stores at this time of year, but the figure is boosted by temporary stores opened to cope with the Christmas rush. Toys R Us has more than 3,000 staff in the UK and the plan to rationalise the business could eliminate between 500 and 800 jobs. The chain has been loss-making for seven out of the past eight years, with the most recent accounts filed at Companies House showing an operating loss of £500,000 on sales of £418m in the year to January. The group’s history dates to the 1950s in the US, but it did not arrive in the UK until 1985. The UK stores earmarked for closure are expected to remain open until the spring and will trade as normal during the Christmas period. Staff will continue to be employed as normal throughout the CVA process. Gary Grant, managing director of The Entertainer, the UK’s biggest independent toy chain, said the mooted store closures were terrible news for the toy industry. “It’s been a disastrous November for the industry,” he said. “The high street is having an extremely tough Christmas. The stuff [toys] that are hot are hot, but the rest is mediocre.” In October, it was reported that a number of suppliers had stopped delivering stock to Toys R Us’s UK chain ahead of Christmas because of problems securing credit insurance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/04/death-air-pollution-cut-if-uk-hits-walking-and-cycling-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T12:10:53Z","webTitle":"Death from air pollution would be cut if UK hits walking and cycling targets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/04/death-air-pollution-cut-if-uk-hits-walking-and-cycling-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/04/death-air-pollution-cut-if-uk-hits-walking-and-cycling-targets","fields":{"headline":"Death from air pollution would be cut if UK hits walking and cycling targets","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If the UK hits government targets for walking and cycling more than 13,000 lives and almost £10bn would be saved over the next decade, according to a new report. The study from the transport charity Sustrans has found that meeting government plans in England and Scotland for an increase in walking or cycling would reduce deaths from air pollution by more than 13,000 in the next 10 years. It would also save almost £9.31bn. Xavier Brice, CEO for Sustrans, said that at a time when road transport is “responsible for the majority of air quality limit breaches in the UK” it has never been more important to reduce the number of “motorised vehicles on our roads”. “The new findings reiterate that walking and cycling have a huge role to play in tackling the air quality crisis that causes tens of thousands of premature deaths every year. If we are to make a major modal shift, we need to provide a network of direct protected cycle routes on roads in addition to quieter routes across the UK.” Air pollution contributes to around 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK. The government is being taken to court for a third time over the levels of toxic air in cities across the UK caused by nitrogen dioxide, mainly from diesel vehicles. Many towns and cities are now also failing WHO guidelines for the most damaging type of air pollution known as PM2.5, 45% of which comes from car tyre and brake wear and would not be reduced by a move to electric vehicles. A report last month revealed that every area in London exceeds World Health Organisation limits for PM2.5. Brice said: “We are urging governments at all levels to include funding for walking and cycling infrastructure in their clean air plans and the UK government to prioritise investment in active travel as part of wider urgent action to make air safe again.” Sustrans, in partnership with the environmental consultancy Eunomia, found that if targets to double journeys by bike and increase walking by “300 stages per person” in the England’s Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy were met, this would prevent more than 8,300 premature deaths from air pollution. This would result in £5.67bn in benefits over 10 years through the avoided costs associated with poor air quality, including NHS treatment in hospital for respiratory diseases. Equally, if the aim of 10% of everyday journeys to be taken by bike set out in Scotland’s Cycling Action Plan was realised, it would save nearly 4,000 premature deaths and £3.64bn. Sustran said the gains would be even bigger if wider benefits to health and wellbeing from increased physical activity were included. Twenty-nine local authorities in England that are breaking legal air quality limits now have to pull together clean air plans by November next year. Ann Ballinger, an air quality expert at Eunomia, said: “This is the first time that Sustrans’s data has been used alongside public health data to understand what impacts walking and cycling schemes have on an individual’s exposure to air pollution. “Our analysis suggests investment in cycling and walking has considerable potential to improve local air pollution. We believe this innovative model could be of considerable value in supporting local authorities and government as these bodies consider options to tackle the air pollution emergency at a local level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/04/dave-review-koko-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T13:16:31Z","webTitle":"Dave review – London's most emotionally intelligent teenager","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/04/dave-review-koko-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/04/dave-review-koko-london","fields":{"headline":"Dave review – London's most emotionally intelligent teenager","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Streatham rapper Dave is just 19 years old. It’s something you have to keep telling yourself, because it’s completely bewildering. On his first headline tour, still to release his debut album, he has a sold-out show of 1,400 fans – with an average age at least a year younger than him – singing along to a downbeat, epic state-of-the-nation address about the Grenfell fire, privatised healthcare (his mum is a nurse) and Theresa May (“A question for the new prime minister: how’d you get a heart so sinister?”). He pulls off the same trick on another long and reflective song from his second EP, Game Over – released a month ago – called How I Met My Ex, in which he asks his teenage crowd: “How many men stop their women from achieving what they can, because in secret they’ve been feeling insecure?” Dave broaches these subjects without ever becoming a worthy bore and he’s clearly grateful for the audience’s enthusiasm for his message. “I love jumping around and shouting just as much as you guys,” he says between songs, “but the fact you can listen to me rap about politics for seven or eight minutes means so, so much to me.” His versatility is a vital strength: for all the ostentatious emotional intelligence, the second half of the show is straight bangers. When the crowd start spontaneously singing the chorus to his latest hit, No Words, he tells them to breathe. “Seriously, take one deep breath with me,” he laughs. “You’re going to need the energy.” AJ Tracey comes out to tag-team on 2016’s irresistible (and exhausting) Thiago Silva, and the place goes berserk. After that, the Drake-endorsed single Wanna Know – the version without Drake getting in the way is far superior – seems to have every one of the crowd singing along.

It doesn’t help that the temperature seems to be see-sawing in London - one day frost on the ground, the next you could run in a vest and shorts (well, double Centigrade figures is vest weather in my book). I have an awkward combination of a hatred of too many layers and terrible circulation/ Raynauld’s - which means I end up sporting odd combinations of very lightweight running gear with excessive amounts of peripheral accessories: shorts fine, gloves mandatory. Vest ok, but must wear buff/hat. Last week I even managed to lose feeling in my right ear after forgetting the latter during a cold run. As for the weekend, on Saturday I pootled happily round the local parks, and yesterday took part in the Windmiler club championships - a 5k or 10k race around the paths of Womble territory.

The usual squashed paper cups are present, but the partygoers are children seeking adoption and potential adoptive parents. Such scenarios sound controversial – talent shows with parents as prizes – but the bonds formed at these gatherings can’t be generated by paperwork alone. This series follows such adoption activity days, and explores the lives of those taking part. Mark Gibbings-Jones Rick Stein’s Road to Mexico 9pm, BBC Two Rick arrives in Guadalajara, a city he last visited aged 21 when he was bowled over by its heady romance. He goes to town on a tripe soup that’s said to be a hangover cure, handy for the second leg of his journey, which takes him out on the tequila trail. Back in Padstow, he makes a proper carne con chilli – never to be called chilli con carne, he’s at pains to explain – made with chuck steak and heavy with toasted, dried peppers. Ben Arnold Invasion! With Sam Willis 9pm, BBC Four First of a three-parter by historian Sam Willis, demonstrating that Britain’s idea of itself as an impregnable island fortress requires a willingness to disregard history: Britain has been invaded many, many times. Willis begins more or less at the beginning, getting to grips with the technology that conquered and/or cultivated these islands the first few times, including flint axes, a replica iron age chariot and a Viking longship. Andrew Mueller Motherland 10pm, BBC Two Get ready for the funniest episode of Motherland, or indeed any other comedy on TV this year. Mousey also-ran of the school gates Anne becomes centre of attention as the mums clamour for a place in her car pool. Kevin, meanwhile, thinks his luck is in as he’s finally granted an audience with domestic goddess Amanda. And there’s a glimpse of what’s going on behind Liz’s deadpan face as she realises Julia only sees her as a mum friend, not a going-out one. Hannah Verdier Extraordinary Teens: My Gay Life 10pm, Channel 4 Filming over several years allows this documentary, based around a video diary by a boy called Billy growing up in West Sussex, to tell its upsetting story in full. Billy was seven when he came out and is 11 when he starts talking to camera. From there we see him cope with school, social media and other teen dramas. But the chief antagonist is Billy’s father, a man straitjacketed by his own fear and ignorance, who emerges as a deeply tragic figure. Jack Seale David Jason’s Secret Service 9pm, More4 You’ll see a boyish gleam in the eyes of 77-year-old Sir David, as he indulges his fascination with espionage in this history of the British secret service. The first episode introduces us to the unsung (for obvious reasons) heroes of the first world war, including Belgian refugee-turned-spy Gabrielle Petit and the eccentric Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming. The motors are flashier than Del Boy’s Reliant, but there’s just as much horsing around. Ellen E Jones The Long Road Home 9pm, National Geographic The drama charting the American combat experience in Iraq continues with the story of Tomas Young, paralysed after being shot in a combat zone. Noel Fisher is terrific as Young, who went on to become an antiwar campaigner. While we see him in combat, this is essentially a domestic story that contrasts Young’s 9/11-fuelled patriotism with his subsequent disillusionment and anger (“I’m fucking invisible!”) over the treatment of veterans. Jonathan Wright Film choice Captain America: The First Avenger (Joe Johnston, 2011) 9pm, Film4 Here’s the origin story of Avengers team leader Captain America (Chris Evans). He starts out as Steve Rogers, too weedy to join the US war effort in 1941 until refugee scientist Stanley Tucci’s secret serum turns him into a one-man army. Which is pretty useful, since his foe is Hugo Weaving’s Red Skull and his Teutonic hordes. There’s a nice retro feel to the story that earns the Cap his niche among the myriad superhero sagas. Contraband (Baltasar Kormákur, 2012) 11.25pm, Film4 The Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur remakes his homemade thriller Reykjavik-Rotterdam for an American audience, with Mark Wahlberg as retired smuggler Chris.

Their leaders have been under fire for high pay, students have questioned whether their degrees represent value for money, and some institutions have been reprimanded for failing to diversify their student body, while others have been accused of complacency over sexual misconduct. But 2018 is a whole new year. There are glimmers of hope on the horizon, with a Brexit deal looking likely, the promise of a review of university funding, and a new regulator which claims to have widening access at its heart. It remains to be seen how those developments will pan out, but in the meantime, four higher education thinkers have recommended books to inspire even the most hardened university pessimists during their Christmas break. For the policy wonk: A University Education by David Willetts Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute I had the pleasure of working for David Willetts for over 10 years, so I make no claim to be an objective reader of A University Education. But the book reflects why it was so interesting to work with him for so long. It mixes killer historical facts and sharp policy analysis (including some criticisms of the coalition government) with bold predictions for the future. Most readers will learn something new on every page, just as I learned something new every day I worked for the author. In my view, not enough has been made of two of the book’s strengths. First, it fills a gap on our bookshelves because there has been no really good up-to-date account of how we ended up with the higher education system we have. Second, while some of the reviews have noted how the book ends with a powerful argument for a less specialised education, they have not fully grasped how significant it is for a major Conservative thinker to reject the idea that three A-levels are the ideal preparation for higher education. The author wants to see the higher education sector thrive because, as he admits at the start, “I love universities”. Just imagine what might happen if every policymaker could be persuaded to feel that way. For the socially conscious: How to Resist by Matthew Bolton Anne-Marie Canning, director of social mobility and student success, King’s College London 2017 is the year I discovered community organising through Citizens UK. Their training changed my outlook on how we deliver our widening participation work at King’s College London and challenged my team to think about “people before programme”. It has been the key to getting local parents in Lambeth and Southwark active in tackling the barriers to their children’s educational achievement. Matthew Bolton, deputy director of Citizens UK, has helpfully bundled community organising lessons into a slim book called How to Resist, published this year. Don’t let the title put you off – this isn’t a guidebook to protesting. This is for anyone who is interested in how we make the world a more just place through practical, everyday actions. What stands out is the inspiring stories of ordinary people who have achieved incredible things by working together – for example the living wage and the courage of Abdul Durrant. In our post-Brexit world, our best hope is reaching across boundaries and having meaningful conversations about the things we have in common. This book is crammed with tips and tricks for better dialogues. In the community organising world, relationships are the goal, not just a means to achieving things. Universities could learn a lot as we seek to rebuild trust in our institutions and further reach out to our local communities, not because the knowledge exchange framework wants us to, but because it is the right thing to do. For the literary scholar: Moby Dick by Herman Melville Andrew McRae, professor of renaissance studies, Exeter University The unreliable narrator of Moby Dick declares that we can trust his information about the dimensions of a whale skeleton because he has them tattooed on his right arm. How, Melville’s book asks, might one comprehend these complex and ancient beings? Or, given the book’s open invitation to allegorical interpretations, how might we understand complex and ancient educational institutions? Moby Dick describes a world in which people seek that knowledge and mean to profit from it, driven by calculations of profit and loss, measurable outcomes, value for money. But it also leaves no doubt about the limitations of these valuations – just as it acknowledges the potential for them to render our mysterious, inscrutable beasts extinct. And woe betide the man who becomes obsessed by control, enraged by one whale’s challenge to his authority. As Captain Ahab manically scans the horizon, issuing terse commands to his followers and blocking dissent, his crew is imperilled. Things don’t end well for him. It’s an important cautionary tale for the higher education sector. For the diversity champion: Faces at the Bottom of the Well by Derrick Bell Kalwant Bhopal, professor of education and social justice, Birmingham University Among the many books about race and racism, this remains one of the most challenging. Derrick Bell suggests that racism and its consequences are a permanent and unchanging feature of society. For white people to maintain their positions of power, racism is a necessary constant. Racism protects not only the status quo but also the sense of entitlement that legitimises white people to believe that they are not part of the problem. In my experience of working in higher education, I have continued to experience racism, sometimes on a daily basis. I am always astounded that the rhetoric of equity and inclusion seems a permanent feature of university vision statements yet all the available hard evidence suggests that inequality permeates every layer of our organisations. Bell would not find this so surprising. He notes that “oppression on the basis of race returns time after time”: racism adopts new disguises but delivers the same outcomes, the same structures, the same people at the top of the pile. The challenge for universities is twofold: to acknowledge that racism is an intrinsic and institutional characteristic of its structures and then to instigate change. This book questions whether a society without racism is possible. Bell does not think so. The question for universities is whether they want to prove him wrong. For those in need of comic relief: True Crime on Campus by Paul Greatrix The Guardian higher education network Sometimes, all that deep thinking about policy upheaval can get a little too much. You just want to sit back and be reminded of why you love universities in the first place: because they’re places where people learn things and make mistakes. And occasionally, as Paul Greatrix will tell you, those mistakes are very funny. Whether it’s a student struck in the eye by a projectile chicken nugget or a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle breaking into the campus cafe, this little pamphlet full of genuine security reports from universities provides a welcome glimpse into the lighter side of university life. Half the profits go to the children’s brain tumour research centre at the University of Nottingham, so your laughs will be making a difference, too.

Stokes remains suspended from international duty but Hales is free for selection after confirmation he is deemed a witness not a suspect regarding the incident in Bristol on 25 September. Eoin Morgan’s touring party was due to be announced at the end of the English summer until Stokes’s arrest over the incident. Though the selectors had no choice but to press ahead with the Ashes squad that week, the 50-over side was pushed back. But they will now publish their plans after the conclusion of the second Test in Adelaide and both players are expected to be provisionally included. As in the case of Stokes’s absence from the Ashes series, this does not guarantee both will tour. Stokes is waiting to discover whether he will be charged after Avon &amp; Somerset police handed his case over to the Crown Prosecution Service last week, with the timing of his cricket disciplinary hearing – and any lifting of his suspension - dependent on the outcome. The England and Wales Cricket Board will not begin an internal disciplinary process for Hales or Stokes until the conclusion of any potential criminal proceedings related to the incident. In short, it all remains a bit of mess. As well as alerting the England selectors and management to Hales’s availability, the ECB also approved a “No Objection Certificate” to allow Hales to play in Dubai in the inaugural T10 Cricket League just before Christmas. Neither has played for their country since the third one-day international against West Indies on 24 September, the match they were celebrating when Stokes was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm at 2.35am, before being released under investigation. Stokes made a domestic comeback for Canterbury in his native New Zealand on Sunday and would naturally slot back into England’s one-day side when available. Hales, however, may face a battle to win back his spot as opener after Jason Roy saw out the remainder of the West Indies series in his place and made scores of 84 and 96 alongside Jonny Bairstow. England take on Australia in a five-match one-day series that begins at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 January, before wrapping up at Perth’s new stadium a fortnight later. The two countries then play a Twenty20 tri-series with New Zealand before England’s epic winter continues on the other side of the Tasman with five one-dayers and two Tests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/04/daphne-caruana-galizia-malta-journalist-eight-arrested-murder-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T13:29:11Z","webTitle":"Ten arrested over murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/04/daphne-caruana-galizia-malta-journalist-eight-arrested-murder-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/04/daphne-caruana-galizia-malta-journalist-eight-arrested-murder-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Ten arrested over murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Police in Malta have arrested 10 suspects over the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, the country’s prime minister has said, nearly two months after the anti-corruption journalist was killed by a powerful car bomb. Joseph Muscat told a press conference that eight people – all Maltese nationals, most with criminal records – had been detained in early-morning raids in three different parts of the island. He tweeted later that two more suspects were also in custody. Muscat said there was a “reasonable suspicion” the suspects were involved in the killing of Caruana Galizia, whose popular blog attacked high-level political corruption, shady business dealings and organised crime on the island. The joint police and military operation was the first breakthrough for the Maltese investigation, which has been helped by experts from the FBI, Europol and the Finnish and Dutch security services. Police now have 48 hours to interrogate the suspects and either charge or release them. Muscat, who was a frequent target of Caruana Galizia’s blog reports along with others in his inner circle, said he could give no further details of the arrests, the suspects or the evidence against them, but offered his “personal commitment” that those responsible for the killing would be found. Caruana Galizia’s son Matthew, who is also a reporter, told the Guardian his family were “in the dark” about the arrests and had been given no further information beyond a phone call from a magistrate’s office after the arrests were made public. At a separate event, the island’s police commissioner, Lawrence Cutajar, refused to take any questions about the arrests, which have been called one of the biggest police operations in Maltese history. They took place in Marsa, where other car bombings have occurred, as well as Zebbug, a village in central Malta, and in the northern town of St Paul’s Bay. A section of Lighters Wharf in the port area of Marsa was still sealed off later on Monday as military personnel and police used sniffer dogs to search buildings. The murder on 16 October sent shockwaves through the island and alarmed the EU, which was already concerned about the rule of law on Malta. The bloc’s smallest member state has often been branded a haven for dubious foreign money. Last week, MEPs visiting Malta on a fact-finding mission said they had arrived “seriously concerned” about the rule of law and were leaving “even more worried”. They said an apparent reluctance to investigate and prosecute major cases had created a “perception of impunity”. The journalist’s family are taking legal action against the island’s police, saying the investigation into the killing cannot be impartial and independent since Caruana Galizia wrote critical articles about both the senior officer now running it, Silvio Valletta, and his wife, a top government minister. The family have alleged that her murder was a “targeted killing” of a journalist whose work focused on uncovering “corruption, criminality, conflicts of interest and ethical failures in decision-making” by politicians and their associates. The family have raised other concerns about the investigation, which they say appears to be focusing only on forensic evidence rather than examining financial transactions that could uncover vital evidence. They also suggest leaks from within the police could intimidate potential informants. The most significant investigations by the murdered journalist stemmed from the Panama Papers, a leak of documents from the archives of the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. Malta’s government is offering a €1m reward for information relating to the killing. A top Italian prosecutor, Carmelo Zuccaro, has said he believes the murder could be linked to an investigation he is leading into a fuel-smuggling operation spanning Libya, Malta and Italy and involving organised crime groups in Sicily. Caruana Galizia wrote about some of those linked to the inquiry. Antonio Di Pietro, an Italian politician and judge who was a prosecutor in Italy’s anti-corruption Mani Pulite corruption trials in the 1990s, said on Monday that Caruana Galizia’s murder had all the hallmarks of a mafia-style killing. “It was professional and a classic mafia-style homicide,” Di Pietro told the Times of Malta. “The mafia’s style is intimidation. The target was not only poor Caruana Galizia … but all those around her because it was a clear warning: be careful or you’ll suffer the same fate.” Responding to a public letter from eight of the world’s largest media organisations including the New York Times, BBC and the Guardian, the first vice-president of the EU commission, Frans Timmermans, last month issued a strong warning to Malta. “The eyes of Europe are on the Maltese authorities,” Timmermans said. “We want those directly and indirectly responsible for this horrible murder to be brought to justice.” Additional reporting by Lorenzo Tondo"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/04/abandoned-son-of-police-spy-sues-met-for-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T16:41:37Z","webTitle":"Abandoned son of police spy sues Met for compensation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/04/abandoned-son-of-police-spy-sues-met-for-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/04/abandoned-son-of-police-spy-sues-met-for-compensation","fields":{"headline":"Abandoned son of police spy sues Met for compensation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A man whose father abandoned him as a child while working as an undercover police officer is suing the Metropolitan police for compensation. The man, who has been granted anonymity, alleges in the lawsuit that he has suffered psychiatric damage after discovering at the age of 26 that his father was a police spy, and not the radical protester he had been led to believe. On Monday in the high court, Mr Justice Nicol ruled against an attempt by the Met to have the lawsuit dismissed. The ruling clears the way for the man, identified only as TBS, to continue his lawsuit. He has said he wants “to try to get some answers and an apology” from the police about how he came to be born. TBS said the fact that his birth and childhood were based on a lie had been confusing. “It kind of messes with your identity and who you think you are.” He told the Guardian he had suffered distress because he had grown up without a father figure. Finding out that this father figure “was denied to me because of the actions of the police is even more distressing because they are supposed to be upholders of the law … But they quite clearly are not,” he said. The Metropolitan police agreed three years ago to pay his mother, known only as Jacqui, more than £400,000 to settle a lawsuit she had brought. An undercover officer, Bob Lambert, had begun a relationship with Jacqui during a covert deployment without disclosing to her his real identity. She only found out by chance that Lambert was a police spy more than two decades after their son, TBS, was born. After the discovery, she contemplated suicide and received psychiatric treatment. Lambert has been one of the most controversial of the undercover police officers sent to infiltrate political groups since 1968. He was a member of the Met’s undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad. His deployment began in 1984 when he stole the identity of a dead boy and started infiltrating environmental and animal rights groups. He pretended to be Bob Robinson, a leftwing campaigner, and started a relationship with Jacqui, then a 22-year-old animal rights activist. She has said that when she became pregnant he seemed excited. He was at her side during 14 hours of labour when their son was born in 1985. They lived together for the first two years of his life and, according to Jacqui, Lambert seemed besotted with the baby. Lambert has been accused of setting fire to a branch of Debenhams in 1987 in a protest against the fur trade – an allegation he denies. In 1988, Lambert claimed that he had to flee to Spain as the police were on the verge of arresting him for crimes related to his animal rights campaigning. This was a false story as he had in fact returned to the Met’s headquarters in London and resumed working for Special Branch, later managing the SDS’s covert operations. One of these operations gathered information about the parents of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. In his real life, Lambert was married with two children. But he concealed his marriage and police work from Jacqui and TBS, and then abandoned her, leaving her to bring up their son as a single parent. TBS grew up believing that his father was a dedicated activist who had gone on the run from the police. TBS said his family “told me that story – he was really passionate about his animal rights and he had no choice, it was either stick around and get arrested or go, so it was for the best.” He and Jacqui only found out the truth in 2012 after Lambert was unmasked. She happened to see his photograph in a newspaper article and tracked him down. TBS said: “It is quite scary to me just how the police can dip in and out of people’s lives. They still seem to struggle with realising the impact of what they have done. They seem to think it’s OK not to talk about it because they have got to protect undercover officers out there.” He said the police had seemed content to allow him to go on believing the lie that his father had gone on the run. “It just adds to the confusion really – about how I came into existence and who was aware of it, who was making decisions. “It seems very bizarre that when I was born there was not someone who said: ‘Right, this has gone too far, there’s a whole new life here.’” In his ruling, Nicol said that it was not justifiable to dismiss TBS’s claim as “it does not seem to me that there is anything factually incoherent in his [assertions]”. He ruled one aspect of the claim – whether Lambert’s supervisors had committed misconduct after TBS had been born – was not sustainable, and he asked for more submissions from both sides. TBS’s lawyer, Jules Carey, of Bindmans, said there was “something morally ambiguous” about the police seeking to strike his legal action. He called on the Met to “give [TBS] the answers that he is so desperate for and the apology for their interference in his family life that he deserves”. The Metropolitan police said: “We note the judgment in this case, which will now potentially continue to trial. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further due to the possibility of future proceedings.” Lambert had four intimate relationships while he was undercover. In recent years the Met has paid compensation to at least 12 women who were deceived into sexual relationships by undercover officers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/dec/14/domestic-abuse-violence-women-femicide-review-refuge-cuts-in-numbers","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-14T07:14:25Z","webTitle":"One woman dead every three days: domestic abuse in numbers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/dec/14/domestic-abuse-violence-women-femicide-review-refuge-cuts-in-numbers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/dec/14/domestic-abuse-violence-women-femicide-review-refuge-cuts-in-numbers","fields":{"headline":"One woman dead every three days: domestic abuse in numbers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The rollcall of cuts to domestic abuse services makes grim reading, as do the statistics on domestic abuse. In the year to March 2017, 1.9 million people in England and Wales – 1.2 women and 713,000 men – experienced domestic abuse, according to the Office for National Statistics. Two women are killed every week in England by a partner or ex-partner In 2015 the Femicide Census was launched by Women’s Aid, based on information collected by Karen Ingala Smith and recorded in her blog Counting Dead Women. Between January and September this year, at least 106 UK women have been killed by men, or where a man is the principal suspect, according to the blog. That equates to one women dead every 2.6 days. Nine in 10 women killed in 2016 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland died at the hands of someone they knew, according to the annual Femicide report by Women’s Aid. Of these, 78 women were killed by their current or former intimate partner, three by their sons and five by another male family member. Nine were killed by a stranger. Services to support people experiencing domestic abuse have faced severe cuts since 2010, when the coalition government was elected. According to research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the number of domestic violence cases registered by councils and by the police has risen dramatically in the past seven years, but local authorities across England have cut spending on domestic violence refuges by nearly a quarter (24%) since 2010, from £31.2m in 2010-11 to £23.9m in 2016-17. On one day this year, 94 women and 90 children were turned away from refuges in England, according to Women’s Aid. But there is worse to come. Housing benefit makes up 53% of total refuge funding, but the Departments for Communities and Local Government and for Work and Pensions plan to remove refuges and other short-term supported housing from the welfare system. This means vulnerable women will not be able to pay for placements with housing benefit. A Women’s Aid emergency survey of refuges revealed that more than one-third could be forced to close as a result of government changes to funding. A further 13% said they would have to reduce bed spaces, and Women’s Aid has estimated that this would lead to over 4,000 more women and children being turned away. Charlotte Kneer, a survivor of domestic abuse and chief executive of the Reigate and Banstead Women’s Aid refuge in Surrey, goes further: she believes the changes could mean the closure of every refuge in England. The impact of cuts has hit hard in some places. This year, Sunderland became the only major UK city with no domestic violence refuge after it was forced to find savings of £74m, which included ending its funding for Wearside Women in Need, a non-profit organisation that runs four safe houses and multiple support programmes across Sunderland. There is also a clear link between domestic abuse and a woman’s likelihood of becoming an offender. According to the Prison Reform Trust, 57% of women in prison in the UK report having been the victim of domestic violence. More than half (53%) report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child, compared to 27% of men.

Muffled sounds of heavy breathing and disembodied voices drifted down from above, while from behind me I could hear someone’s footsteps getting closer. I was climbing the 877 steps of the 35-storey Broadgate Tower in the City of London, the latest venue for a mass-participation tower-running event. More than 100 of us were making at least one ascent of the skyscraper. Tower running, or stair climbing, is a sport that is gradually becoming established in the UK. It has, over the past decade or so, imainly been associated with charity events, where huge sums are raised by people dragging themselves up landmark buildings. The best-known of these is Vertical Rush, for the housing charity Shelter. It is also a serious sport in its own right, with a national circuit of races as well as a world championships. For many, though, stair running simply provides an intense, but enjoyable, cardio workout. The Broadgate Tower Run Up was unique in that it catered for all aspects of the sport. As well as playing host to charity runners and the final run of the Tower Running UK championship, the event offered the chance to attempt the first British vertical mile – a daunting 12 climbs (10,000 steps) of the building – or a triple climb, a quarter-of-a-mile challenge. Taking my first steps into the sport, I opted for the latter. All you need is regular running gear is all you need, and Matt Hudson, the founder of the event’s organisers, Total Motion, passed on some basic advice: “It’s all about pacing – start off with a fast walk and then run the last few flights. Also, try and run at least two, even three, steps at a time as it halves the distance.” Competitors set off at 10-second intervals so there was little bumping into each other, although some teamed up with friends. Stair climbing is largely a solitary, if physically demanding pastime, with little to look at (most are held in windowless stairwells) and only the sounds of other competitors for company, Some were wearing headphones, but I got into the zone by imagining I was out in the mountains, focusing on a peak ahead. Far-fetched perhaps, but this spot of urban fell-running got me to the top where I was rewarded with stunning views of London and beyond. Of course, I had two more climbs to make, but at least the lift down – rubbery legs mean it’s the safest means of descent – provided a respite. Lift conversations centred around the health benefits of the sport. Adrian Plant, in his 60s, said he found the sport good for building up his core strength and the high intensity complemented his long-distance cycling. Susan Lash, 57, who had travelled from Bloomington, Illinois, to attempt the vertical mile, told me she had been stair climbing for 10 years. Knee pain from normal running had led to her making the switch, in part because there is no downward pressure on the lift descent. In fact, stair climbing provides a full-body high-intensity workout with an emphasis on the lower body. It builds endurance but it is essentially the pulling yourself up against gravity that delivers the real benefits. Back on my second climb, it was starting to make sense. With little in the way of visual distraction, I concentrated on ticking off steps and floors, mentally calculating speeds. I completed my third ascent with an average of seven-and-a-half minutes a climb. Sharing the lift down with me was Sophie Biggs, a vertical-miler who, despite having just finished her seventh run, had hardly broken into a sweat (she went on to win the race in 1hr 25min). She explained her technique of pulling on alternate handrails. The elite runners, making a single climb as fast as they could, delivered impressive times with the winner, Estonia’s Rauno Tilts, coming in at 4min 30sec. British champion Mark Sims wasn’t far behind, but perhaps even more impressive was his eight-year old daughter doing it in nine minutes. Exemplifying the charity spirit was David Harvey who, with a 20kg pack on his back, completed the vertical mile in less than two hours in a bid to raise money for Student Minds, a mental health charity. Many competitors, though, were happy just to have completed a single climb. Tower Running UK has a list of all upcoming UK events for 2018, as well as a history of the sport. Total Motion organise the Broadgate runs, plus Stairs and the City, a women-only run at the Leadenhall Building in April. The Tower Running World Association and Vertical World Circuit have information about races across the globe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/04/baby-boy-found-to-be-alive-after-delhi-hospital-declared-him-dead","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T13:34:29Z","webTitle":"Baby boy found to be alive after Delhi hospital declared him dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/04/baby-boy-found-to-be-alive-after-delhi-hospital-declared-him-dead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/04/baby-boy-found-to-be-alive-after-delhi-hospital-declared-him-dead","fields":{"headline":"Baby boy found to be alive after Delhi hospital declared him dead","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Police in Delhi have launched an investigation after a baby that had been pronounced dead by doctors was found to be moving in a body bag as his parents prepared to deliver funeral rites. Two doctors have been sacked from Delhi’s upmarket Max hospital in Shalimar Bagh, where the boy and his twin sister were born prematurely at 22 weeks last week. The girl was stillborn and the boy was in critical condition; soon afterwards, doctors pronounced him dead. Indian TV showed images of yellow plastic bags in which the bodies were reportedly wrapped by the hospital and returned to the family. “They handed us both bodies wrapped like a courier package from the back door,” the boy’s grandfather Kailash told NDTV. “After we travelled 3km, we felt a movement in one [bag]. We ripped it open, found bits of plastic and the baby inside, breathing.” He said the family had been preparing to perform the last rites in line with Hindu funeral traditions when a relative felt one of the bags wriggling in his lap. The boy, who has been given the name Champ, is on life support at a Delhi nursing home. “The doctors at the nursing home told us that the boy has several infections because he was exposed to the environment and had been wrapped in plastic,” his uncle told local media. “They haven’t told us whether he’ll survive.” The incident sparked outrage and protests outside the hospital at the weekend. India’s health minister, JP Nadda, called the incident “heartbreaking”. Delhi’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, ordered an inquiry and said he would take the “strongest action”. Max Healthcare said it was “shaken and concerned at this rare incident” and announced on Monday that the two treating doctors would be sacked. Separate inquiries by the hospital and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) are ongoing. Delhi police have said the two doctors are among those being investigated in relation to possible charges of culpable homicide, an offence punishable by up to seven years in jail. KK Aggarwal, the head of the IMA, said the episode was a tragic mistake. “The difference between a mistake and negligence is deliberate action. I don’t think any doctor will do it wilfully,” he said. In June another Delhi hospital sent a “dead” newborn home in a sealed package, where his family discovered the infant was still alive. “I wouldn’t have opened the polythene if it weren’t for the ladies of the family – they insisted on seeing the boy’s face,” said Rohit Kumar, the child’s father. “When we opened the cover we found he was moving his hands and feet.” The premature baby, weighing less than 500g (1lb), was rushed back to hospital but died a short time later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/04/talking-horses-mr-versatile-mick-easterby-can-get-monday-winner","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T09:31:53Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: 'Mr Versatile' Mick Easterby can get Monday winner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/04/talking-horses-mr-versatile-mick-easterby-can-get-monday-winner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/04/talking-horses-mr-versatile-mick-easterby-can-get-monday-winner","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: 'Mr Versatile' Mick Easterby can get Monday winner","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Today’s best bets, by Chris Corrigan Mick Easterby has certainly proved his versatility over the last fortnight, the Sheriff Hutton trainer having saddled winners of a handicap chase, a maiden hurdle, a bumper and an all-weather handicap at Newcastle, from a total of 13 runners. Easterby’s only runner on Monday is Ladies First (12.20) at Southwell. This three-year-old has very much a sprinting pedigree and she tackles six furlongs following her racecourse debut at Wolverhampton two weeks ago over an extended mile. Ladies First finished third there at 28-1, behind two short-priced rivals, and market support for her chance this time would definitely make her of interest. She’s 5-2 at present. Later on the same card, Queen Moon (1.20) has a fine chance. This filly had her first run on the all-weather in October, over the same course and distance, finishing third. The winner and fourth from that race have certainly franked the form since. David Probert again takes the ride on Andrew Balding’s runner, an 11-4 shot.

Ben Pauling and Harry Fry still top the table, with slightly reduced strike-rates since last Monday. Emma Lavelle has shot to prominence, thanks to three winners in the past week. Nick Williams has done well with a handful of runners. Donald McCain has had five winners since our last table was published, moving him up. That’s two more than Paul Nicholls, who has slipped a bit, as has Nigel Twiston-Davies, with just one winner since Bristol De Mai’s Haydock romp nine days ago. Nicky Richards and Jonjo O’Neill have had a couple of winners each. Brian Ellison and Rebecca Curtis got themselves away from the bottom of the table with a single winner each, but both were on the Flat (I’m afraid I don’t have time to weed the Flat runners out of these numbers but they don’t affect many of these trainers).

That would not be unfair, even if caveats do exist. If David Moyes could not conjure a result up here then the semblance of a platform, a hint of the resilience that has deserted his new charges for so long, would reflect well on everyone involved: he got that at the Etihad and, with a little more quality at either end, might even have left with rather more. “We’re going to have to try and find a way to see if we can stop them and make it hard for them,” a characteristically phlegmatic Moyes had asserted before the teams emerged. At that point City’s Tunnel Club concept appeared particularly ghoulish: a safari package for those with deep pockets prepared to watch doe-eyed prey lining up before the grisliest of slaughters. Moyes knew what the rest of us did: he had probably not read the apocalyptic projections that City might trouble the Premier League’s record winning margin, and was presumably ignorant of odds favouring an 8-0 home win above a single-goal win for his side but he was certainly aware of West Ham’s absentee list and had, more to the point, seen both sides play this season. What followed, then, must have seemed a trick of the light. Moyes dropped Marko Arnautovic – who had seemed a viable candidate for a post‑match Pep Guardiola rollocking – from the starting XI, preferring a team chiefly composed of yeomen and make‑dos. They included the 18-year‑old centre-back Declan Rice, who stood in for the stricken Winston Reid and was described by his manager as “a really enthusiastic, good type”. The surprise was that everyone in a West Ham side whose application has routinely fallen well short this season could, on this evidence alone, fit that definition. Rice’s zeal brought an early booking but it was an isolated piece of panic in a composed opening period that, aside from the obvious inconvenience of seeing far less of the ball against opponents who can work miracles with it, saw them pose more difficulties than they faced. The lone front man, Michail Antonio, could have exposed City’s set-piece weakness at the far post and then was not a million miles from converting a cross by Arthur Masuaku, whose willingness to plough the tramlines has made him an early Moyes favourite. As half-time approached a 20-yard drive from David Silva had been the only real cause of alarm; the minutes were drifting by and any onlookers watching play bereft of context could have been forgiven for finding it all a touch stodgy. In fact the lack of activity, of lightning-quick interchanges from City or gross pieces of defensive neglect from West Ham, made things all the more fascinating. A 90-minute slog of nothing could, for Moyes, end up meaning absolutely everything. Angelo Ogbonna’s opener, when it came, did not actually seem a huge surprise. It played to the adage that a team operating at less than full pelt is liable to the sucker punch against anyone; Aaron Cresswell’s cross was pinpoint and the thumping header that met it ensured that those leering through the glass bore witness to an entirely different colour of wounded beast on the walk back in. West Ham’s performance was, at this point, straight out of the textbook. The danger was that City, ears warmed by a manager who had flung a water bottle away in disgust when the goal went in, would almost certainly not be this casual again. Another risk, equally telling, had suggested itself shortly before Ogbonna scored: it was a blow to see Cheikhou Kouyaté, who appeared to tweak his hamstring, depart with the latest in a seemingly endless line of muscle injuries to affect West Ham players and the obvious question was whether their fitness, shown to be inadequate during the latter days of Slaven Bilic, could really face an examination turned up a few notches. In the end it could not and a visibly tiring West Ham, forced deeper and deeper as the second half progressed and unable to make use of the tiring Antonio’s bustle, brought on to themselves a degree of pressure that never looked likely to end well. Moyes felt Rice should have dealt with the ball from Kevin De Bruyne, beautifully weighted though it was, that created the winning goal just as it appeared Nicolás Otamendi’s equaliser might be the only damage. It seemed particularly harsh that David Silva should score so soon after West Ham, on a rare sortie, had almost forced a second goal of their own through an angled Antonio shot that Ederson repelled sharply. Eventually, though, minds and bodies were not quite fresh enough to hold out. “When you play the top teams you’re going to have to do it for 90 minutes – not 60, not 70, but 90,” Moyes pointed out afterwards. Diafra Sakho would have altered that sentiment had he not blazed wide at the end when teed up by Arnautovic. The manager had set his team up pragmatically, not negatively, and West Ham had shown an appetite to attack when they could. The nagging concern is that, on a one-off occasion with scant expectation, credit is easier to come by than it might seem: the real test is how West Ham now perform on an everyday basis – whether the steel that they showed here can be matched by the style that wins points rather than compliments for pluck. Then the positives would look far more substantial."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/04/native-american-alliance-bears-ears-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T12:27:02Z","webTitle":"'We'll see the battle lines': Trump faced by Native American alliance over Bears Ears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/04/native-american-alliance-bears-ears-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/04/native-american-alliance-bears-ears-trump","fields":{"headline":"'We'll see the battle lines': Trump faced by Native American alliance over Bears Ears","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Monday, Donald Trump will visit Salt Lake City. He is expected to formally announce plans to substantially shrink two Utah national monuments: Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears. A review of national monuments was conducted by the interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, who recommended changes to 10 such areas. In seeking to open up more land for development and extractive industries, Trump has the support of Utah’s all-Republican congressional delegation. Orrin Hatch, the senator who invited Trump to Utah, said in a video statement the “outcome” the president will announce “strikes an excellent balance where everybody wins”. Thousands of demonstrators, however, gathered at the state capitol on Saturday in a show of solidarity with Native American tribes that say the move against Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante is nothing less than a “monumental mistake”. A coalition of five Utah tribes with ties to the land – the Navajo Nation, Ute Mountain Ute, Ute Indian Tribe, Hopi and the Pueblo of Zuni – has vowed to oppose any shrinkage of the national monument. Before the formation of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, in 2015, the tribes had never come together. Their leaders say legal action is likely if Trump announces a reduction. Shaun Chapoose, councilman of the Ute Indian Tribe business committee, said this was a significant moment for Native Americans. Many citizens mobilized around tribes opposing the Dakota Access pipeline and alliances were forged around Bears Ears. Despite reverses suffered by the Dakota Access protesters, he said, he sees a reawakening of hope. “Indian country is coming out of its sleep,” Chapoose said. “It’s given an opportunity for us to voice concerns, and it’s made it OK for tribes to talk amongst themselves, like they used to do a long time ago. “At one time, there was this big network of communication going on between tribes. After the reservations system, they got isolated from surrounding neighbors. Bears Ears has brought that back where it didn’t exist. It’s brought Indian Country back together.” Chapoose said that in backing extractive industry over preservation and Native American communities, the Trump administration had drawn a line in the sand. “It’s another slap in the face in the overall relationship between the federal government and the tribes, and local people,” he said. Chapoose said the issue had led locally to a polarization between supporters of the monument and people who want the freedom to use the land for mining, logging and riding off-road vehicles. “It’s turned us back into cowboys and Indians again,” he said. “The tension is higher than it started but it hasn’t reached a plateau. That’s going to happen Monday. Then we’ll see the battle lines.” Davis Filfred, the son of a medicine man and a Navajo Nation council delegate, said he did not want to see Bears Ears become like his tribe’s land, which he said had been contaminated by fossil fuel development. Coalmining in the Four Corners area, he said, offers a cautionary tale. “There is no reclamation, they scarred the whole Mother Earth,” Filfred said. “The way I see it, they’re going to bulldoze Bears Ears, and there will be nothing there. We’ll tell the next generation, ‘You see that ash pit over there, that’s where Bears Ears was. Now it’s a uranium mine.’ “Money cannot replace what we have in terms of wilderness area. It’s habitat to many species, plants and medicinal and ceremonial herbs. You can’t wipe all those away.” Filfred said his Navajo people would continue to hold ceremonies on the land. “More than 150 years ago, the federal government removed our ancestors from Bears Ears at gunpoint and sent them on the Long Walk, but we came back,” he said, in press release issued by the Native American Rights Fund. “The president’s proposal is an attack on tribes and will be remembered as equally disgraceful but once again we will be back,” said Filfred, a military veteran who served in the Gulf. “We know how to persist, we know how to fight and we will fight to defend Bears Ears.” ‘Somebody listened’ Bears Ears was designated by Barack Obama days before he left office, as the first national monument to be requested by native tribes. Regina Lopez-Whiteskunk of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe was in the waiting room at the doctor’s office when she took the call from the federal government. When she thinks of that moment, she cries. “After all of our hard work and time, somebody listened,” she said. “As Native Americans, we are accustomed to being put aside, on the back-burner, being a check mark on someone’s list. No real change is ever achieved, and yet it was being achieved. I was extremely happy, I was crying, but I knew no matter who was in office after that, we would have to defend that monument.” Lopez-Whiteskunk was one of the founding co-chairs of the coalition that seeks to defend Bears Ears. “We are very distinct, sovereign tribes,” Lopez-Whiteskunk said, adding that some tribes were historic enemies and some were not accustomed to women being in the circle of leaders. “When we came together in this unprecedented fashion, we healed our relationships so we could pursue a common goal. At the end of the day, what we held in common was that our identities are tied to the land. A part of a culture is recorded on the land – written on the walls of the canyon.” It is estimated that Bears Ears holds more than 100,000 Native American cultural and archaeological sites, including petroglyphs, pottery, tools and ancestral Pueblo dwellings. Sacred sites have been threatened by looting and vandalism. The hope was that national monument status would preserve and protect the land from desecration as well as potential development by the energy industry. “If some oil rig comes out to explore and eventually develop, they have just ripped out the page of my heritage textbook,” Lopez-Whiteskunk said. “You take that away, you take our language.” Native Americans are caretakers of the land not just for tribes but for all American citizens, she said. “There’s not that many wide-open spaces in our country with the large demand to develop,” she said. “That’s probably one of our biggest threats right now as a country.” Lopez-Whiteskunk said she was not surprised by the turn of events under Trump, but still found it disheartening. “I spent a large part in service to my people invested in this,” she said. “It hurts. It’s like watching someone trying to undo a wonderful deed that you’ve done – not just for Native Americans, but for all US citizens – what we worked so hard on to be targeted for destruction.” No matter what happens on Monday, she said, or in the future, it will not diminish the historic achievement of having Bears Ears declared a national monument. “So many times, our history gets told, monumental decisions get decided for us, but we took it into our hands,” Lopez-Whiteskunk said. “History will tell that story, and we were the owners of that destiny. Nobody will ever take that away.” This article was amended on 4 December 2017 to correct Shaun Chapoose’s title."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/dec/03/the-guardian-view-on-alan-milburns-resignation-brexit-and-fairness-dont-add-up","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T19:46:48Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Alan Milburn’s resignation: Brexit and fairness don’t add up | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/03/the-guardian-view-on-alan-milburns-resignation-brexit-and-fairness-dont-add-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/03/the-guardian-view-on-alan-milburns-resignation-brexit-and-fairness-dont-add-up","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Alan Milburn’s resignation: Brexit and fairness don’t add up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May heads to Brussels on Monday for another round of talks aimed at striking a deal about Brexit terms at next week’s EU summit. Mrs May is pursuing a deeply destructive Brexit strategy, which should be opposed, insisting on the UK breaking with both the EU single market and the customs union. However, the recent mood music on money, citizens’ rights and even on the Northern Ireland border has been tentatively favourable to her hopes of a deal. Even so, as the prime minister prepared for her trip this weekend she was faced with a deliberately disruptive new set of demands from her party’s pro-Brexit extremists, who are determined that the European court of justice can play no part in any transitional phase while Britain breaks away from the EU. Both Mrs May’s diary and the extremists’ demands come right on cue at a significant time. They fully bear out what Alan Milburn said at the weekend as he and his whole team resigned as the government’s advisers on social mobility. Mr Milburn accepts that Mrs May has a personal belief in social justice, and he acknowledges that individual ministers – he singled out the education secretary, Justine Greening – have shown commitment to it in practice. But the former Labour health secretary damningly said it had become obvious that the government as a whole is unable to deliver on the issue. That is because, he added, there is simply too much focus on Brexit. Because of that, there is not enough space in the government’s brain to allow it to translate nice words about social justice of the kind that Mrs May uttered when she became prime minister into effective actions. Mr Milburn’s resignation letter makes clear that the government has neglected the Social Mobility Commission that David Cameron and Nick Clegg set up in 2012 and, even more importantly, that it is not giving enough priority to the social mobility challenges facing Britain. Last week, the commission published an immensely disturbing report. It showed that children from deprived backgrounds face growing hurdles in some of the richest parts of the country as well as in the poorest. While London and its suburbs, as well as parts of several cities, are pulling away, some of the most disadvantaged life chances are to be found in wealthy parts of the south of England, including west Berkshire, the Cotswolds, and the Crawley area of Sussex. Of the 65 social mobility “coldspots” identified by the commission, 60 voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. When that report came out, Mr Milburn said it was essential that mainstream politics offered an answer for those who are trapped by these social divisions. He and his team, who include Conservatives, have now articulated that frustration even more clearly. The problem is only partly that socially concerned Tories don’t turn words into deeds enough. It is that Brexit is not the answer to social injustice that many of the poorest leave voters hoped for. On the contrary. Brexit is a deepening part of the worsening problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/04/international-olympic-committee-russia-doping-lausanne-richard-mclaren","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T10:05:07Z","webTitle":"The IOC must do its duty this time and ban Russia from Winter Olympics | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/04/international-olympic-committee-russia-doping-lausanne-richard-mclaren","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/04/international-olympic-committee-russia-doping-lausanne-richard-mclaren","fields":{"headline":"The IOC must do its duty this time and ban Russia from Winter Olympics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This time there is no justifiable room for doubt, nor reason to go wobbly. When the International Olympic Committee meets in Lausanne on Tuesday it must ban Russia from the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. The scale of its sporting crimes is outrageous. The evidence is conclusive. Only the appropriate punishment has so far been lacking. We live in a world where every story seems to be branded as fake news by fools, trolls, and those irreversibly blinded by their prejudices. Yet remarkably, Professor Richard McLaren’s reports into Russian doping, the second of which was published a year ago this week, have not only withstood every smear but have found their truths hardened. McLaren, remember, told us more than 1,000 Russian athletes across more than 30 sports had been involved or benefited from state-sponsored doping between 2011 and 2015. He told us the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi was corrupted by an extraordinary ruse, in which steroid-ridden urine samples from Russian competitors were swapped for clean urine by using small metal rods to prise open supposedly tamper-proof bottles, which were then passed through a tiny hole in the dead of night. And he told us the Russian state, its security services, its sports authorities and anti-doping agency were all in on the grand deception. Even now it sounds almost too outlandish – an institutionalised conspiracy that John le Carré might have paused before telling – yet it was all too real. The Russian government has tried to discredit McLaren and his main whistleblower, Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the Russian Anti-Doping Agency laboratory in Moscow until fleeing last year – and to cast shades of grey on a black-and-white case, but none of the muck has stuck. Before the Rio Olympics, however, all the evidence was somehow not enough for a conviction. When McLaren published his first report in July 2016, the IOC promised it would not hesitate to take the “toughest sanctions available” against those implicated, with its president, Thomas Bach, saying there had been “a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sports and on the Olympic Games”. And what happened? The IOC flinched, coming up with an unholy fudge that passed the buck to the individual sports and led to 278 Russian athletes being waved through to compete in Rio under their nation’s flag. Many insiders had feared a repeat of that shabby trick before Pyeongchang, especially given that Bach – a good friend of Vladimir Putin – has been so reluctant to criticise Russia. In the past month, however, there has been a dramatic sea change. It started when the World Anti-Doping Agency revealed that it had received fresh evidence from a whistleblower that Wada said had “reinforced” McLaren’s findings. Rodchenkov’s credibility as a witness was further confirmed when the IOC’s Oswald commission said he was telling the truth about the nature of the cover-up when it stripped the Russian cross-country skier Alexander Legkov of his Sochi medals. Legkov is now one of 25 Russians who has been retrospectively banned since the start of November – a number that is still climbing. Separately, the IOC has also said it believes 2014-dated entries in Rodchenkov’s diary which directly implicate Russia’s deputy prime minister for sport, Vitali Mutko, in a state-run conspiracy, is “significant” evidence. Mutko, incidentally, remains in charge of the Russia 2018 World Cup despite McLaren finding an email trail showing he gave the order to “save” a banned player who had failed a drugs test. There are also suggestions from McLaren that the whole Russia team for the 2014 World Cup was under “protection” from the authorities. It was hardly reassuring either that when Fifa’s own ethics committee appointee, Michael Garcia, investigated rumours that bribes were paid to secure the 2018 tournament, the Russian bid committee “made only a limited number of documents available for review” – because “the computers used at the time had been leased and returned to their owner after the bidding process [and then] destroyed”. Fifa has shown little willingness to tackle any of this but there is no reason for the IOC to be so lily-livered. On Tuesday it must make a decision that is both obvious and fair. Ban the Russian team from Pyeongchang but allow those athletes not implicated by the McLaren report, and who have passed sufficient doping tests, to compete under a neutral flag. This solution – which was adopted by athletics for Rio – would serve justice and natural justice. Russia would be deprived of sporting glory but its innocent stars would still get to live out their dreams. It would show that a ban is not about vengeance but fair play. There is growing noise within Olympic circles that the IOC is heading in this direction, and that Russia might respond by boycotting the Games. It would be better served by admitting its mistakes – something it still refuses to do. As Rodchenkov told ESPN: “I wish Tuesday began with a confession and apology from Russia, which would give the world confidence they might embrace truth and reform – [but] this is not the Russian way. If they are not disciplined seriously, they will be laughing at the IOC behind closed doors and plotting their next caper.” It is hard to disagree. This time there must be no weasel words, no back-room deals, no ugly accommodations. Merely justice that is desperately overdue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/dec/03/cardingtons-old-airship-hangars-deserve-a-closer-look","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T18:15:00Z","webTitle":"Cardington’s old airship hangars deserve a closer look | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/03/cardingtons-old-airship-hangars-deserve-a-closer-look","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/dec/03/cardingtons-old-airship-hangars-deserve-a-closer-look","fields":{"headline":"Cardington’s old airship hangars deserve a closer look","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The letters about Footprint Tools (30 November) reminded me that Ian Jack (British industry isn’t dead.

There are so many emotions going through your mind, and everything is negative – I was so mad about the red card.” As it happens, those words belong to Patrick Vieira, who experienced the frustration of being dismissed – unfairly in his view – in a simmering encounter at Old Trafford in 2003. Like Vieira on that heated day, the result ended up favourable enough for Paul Pogba this weekend to ensure the immediate vexation was not punished, as his team-mates maintained a meaningful result without him. But the aftermath brings added complications. For club and player, suspension for this weekend’s showdown against Manchester City, plus a couple more games on top, is a bitter pill. Pogba’s influence during United’s win at Arsenal was immense. His charisma, when he got on the ball with some space to influence opening up in front of his eyes, was a major factor. David de Gea’s goalkeeping masterclass and Jesse Lingard’s cleverly timed runs to finish ruthlessly merited glowing praise. But of the game’s many pivotal moments, the killer blow came when United were being swamped by opponents cranking up their attack in search of an equaliser. Counter time. Pogba marauded down the right channel and when he picked up the ball he beat Laurent Koscielny with a blend of muscle and delicate footwork before clipping over a perfect invitation of a cross that Lingard accepted with delight. There is no obvious replacement for Pogba, especially for a team under pressure in a high-profile game, a situation designed for players with big-match personality to make a difference. It is hard to imagine he will not be missed whatever plan José Mourinho comes up with to try to halt the runaway neighbours. Many details created this humdinger of a match. There was enough going on that it felt like several games within one 90 minutes. Weighty analysis is justified about everything from Arsenal’s sloppy defending, De Gea’s extraordinary double save, the weird statistical contrast between the expected goals and the real scoreline, the way Arsène Wenger’s team created so many chances in a big game (and indeed the efficacy of United’s defence in allowing themselves to be so open even if they got away with it), Alexandre Lacazette’s improvement now that a rapport with his team-mates has bedded in, a couple of penalty decisions, and Pogba’s dismissal. One of the compliments Mourinho paid his team afterwards was about their adaptability. They began with the snappy energy to surprise anyone who suspected a bus parking operation had been ordered, spearing Arsenal slips with an impressively sharp edge. Then they had to hang on. Finally, the way they reorganised when Pogba was sent off after the full weight of his stride landed on Héctor Bellerín’s legs was an example of how to force an opponent to drop their tempo and lose their rhythm. Mourinho was not minded to get into whether a thrilling away performance has any impact on the title scenario. Wenger confronted the same question, phrased in reference to Mauricio Pochettino’s admission that Tottenham are no longer considering themselves involved in any kind of race for top spot. “I am not Pochettino, I am Arsène Wenger. I am here to fight as long as I can, as long as mathematically it’s possible you have to fight, you cannot give any other message out,” he said. “I believe the game [against Manchester United] has to make us angry and even more determined. If I am a player, and I think with what we produced, we have a huge potential. And we lose the game? We cannot accept that. That’s what you want.” Wenger was hurting and angry, reeling about the lack of efficiency that affected them at both ends of the pitch, and said that his players felt the same way. “I feel sorry for the players, that’s why I’m angry … When the performance is of that quality we have to be efficient. We are in this job to be efficient, you know. So I blame myself first. We have lost games here against Man United where we didn’t deserve anything. But what makes you angry is that you produce that performance and in the end you have nothing to show for it. De Gea is an outstanding goalkeeper, I don’t want to take anything away. But we had situations, despite De Gea, we should have scored.” On that note, even in their victory United will have to ponder their own plan considering free-scoring Manchester City have the form to be more ruthless in front of goal. They might need something extra than leaning on a miracle from De Gea to underpin them again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/03/sam-allardyce-gylfi-sigurdsson-everton-huddersfield-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T23:53:00Z","webTitle":"Struggling Gylfi Sigurdsson embodies Everton’s malaise for Sam Allardyce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/03/sam-allardyce-gylfi-sigurdsson-everton-huddersfield-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/03/sam-allardyce-gylfi-sigurdsson-everton-huddersfield-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Struggling Gylfi Sigurdsson embodies Everton’s malaise for Sam Allardyce","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sam Allardyce believes Gylfi Sigurdsson has struggled to cope with the pressure of playing for Everton and the manager plans to bring in a sports psychologist to address the mental frailties of his new charges. The Icelander became Everton’s £45m club record buy, making him £17m more expensive than any previous signing at Goodison Park, when he arrived from Swansea in August and Allardyce feels he has found it difficult to adjust to the demands of life at a higher-profile club. Sigurdsson, who scored just his third goal for his new club in Saturday’s 2-0 win against Huddersfield Town, had a two-season spell at Tottenham Hotspur before rejoining Swansea City but he was not burdened with the expectation that comes with such a huge price tag during his days at White Hart Lane. Allardyce thinks the transfer has brought a culture shock to the player who recorded the third most assists in the Premier League last season but who, because of his cost, has become the face of Everton’s £140m summer recruitment drive. “It is a big club,” he explained. “No disrespect to Swansea, you are playing on a bigger stage so you have to have a greater mentality to come out and produce because the demand is higher to play for Everton. “All fans want entertaining but they want to see a level of ability, too. It is big pressure and a lot of the other players who have come from abroad because of the start of the season, [and] the Europa League, it has not given them a real opportunity to settle in and be able to produce at Everton so that is a disappointment.” Sigurdsson’s protracted move was finally completed on 16 August, depriving him of a pre-season with his new team-mates, and he had also missed Swansea’s summer tour amid uncertainty about his future. Allardyce is convinced that rendered his start more difficult. “Gylfi came so late because of the ongoing saga of ‘How much will he be and will Swansea let him go? Will they or won’t they?’” he said. “In that time he wasn’t really training with the first team and it wasn’t happening for him in terms of a full pre-season. So he is on catch-up.” Everton have seen only glimpses of Sigurdsson’s ability amid a continuing debate about how to accommodate him and Wayne Rooney. The Icelander opened his account for his new club from 50 yards against Hajduk Split and scored again in spectacular style against Southampton last Sunday. A closer-range strike against Huddersfield had a rarity value. If he ranks as Everton’s most expensive underachiever this season, he is far from the only one. While Huddersfield were defeated in part because of Allardyce’s half-time rejig, his initial work has been concentrated more on the psychological than the tactical. Everton have endured the worst European group campaign of any English club and briefly dropped into the relegation zone in a traumatic start to the season under Ronald Koeman. While the caretaker David Unsworth had selected the side for Wednesday’s 4-0 win over West Ham, Allardyce has sought to engineer improvement. “I just had five minutes and talked about a few pointers about how you get better,” he added. He has forged a reputation as both a man-manager and a motivator but has always been willing to call upon experts in specific fields. “Eventually there will not only be us who deliver psychologically, in terms of wanting to make the players stronger mentally,” he said. “I would actually try and find them a sports psychologist because I think that will be very important. If the brain is clear and positive before the lads go out, then they produce a positive performance. If the brain is clouded and doubtful, you don’t see the player produce the abilities he has got. That has obviously been seen on a couple of occasions here with the lack of confidence from the lack of results. But there is nothing better than two wins on the trot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/03/donald-trump-michael-flynn-russia-investigation-abc-news-ross","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T19:14:47Z","webTitle":"Trump's Flynn tweets point to obstruction of justice, say opponents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/donald-trump-michael-flynn-russia-investigation-abc-news-ross","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/donald-trump-michael-flynn-russia-investigation-abc-news-ross","fields":{"headline":"Trump's Flynn tweets point to obstruction of justice, say opponents","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Donald Trump is increasingly vulnerable to charges of obstructing justice and may have inadvertently confessed following the prosecution of his former senior aide Michael Flynn, according to legal experts and senior Democrats. The US president said in a tweet on Saturday that he fired Flynn as national security adviser in February “because he lied to the vice-president and the FBI” about his discussions with Russia’s ambassador to the US last December. Flynn pleaded guilty in court on Friday to lying to FBI agents. This would mean that Trump knew Flynn had committed a serious crime when, according to the former FBI director James Comey, the president asked Comey the next day to halt an FBI investigation into Flynn. On Sunday Trump, who later fired Comey, again denied making such a request. Multiple legal analysts and critics of the president said Trump’s remark was the clearest indication so far that he has tried to obstruct the various inquiries into possible collusion between Moscow and his presidential campaign, leaving him vulnerable to criminal charges. “He could be tweeting himself into an obstruction of justice conviction,” said Richard Painter, a former ethics counsel to the George W Bush administration. “That’s a confession of deliberate, corrupt obstruction of justice,” said Laurence Tribe, a professor in constitutional law at Harvard University. Moving to limit the potential damage, one of Trump’s attorneys, John Dowd, claimed he had written the tweet, which he described as “sloppy”. Dianne Feinstein of California, the most senior Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, which is conducting its own Trump-Russia inquiry, said on Sunday that “what we’re beginning to see is the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice” against the president. “I see it most importantly in what happened with the firing of Director Comey, and it is my belief that that is directly because he did not agree to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation,” Feinstein told NBC’s Meet the Press. “That’s obstruction of justice.” The latest frenzy of activity from the White House followed Flynn’s guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with a sprawling criminal investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, who has already indicted two other Trump campaign officials for alleged crimes and accepted a guilty plea from a third. Mueller’s decision to agree a deal with Flynn indicates that the former national security adviser holds evidence that could help Mueller prosecute even more senior figures for even more serious crimes, according to legal analysts. Experts told the Guardian the wording of Flynn’s plea agreement also left open the possibility that Flynn had already worn a wire or otherwise recorded conversations with other associates of Trump who are under investigation. A central unanswered question is why Flynn lied to the FBI if there was not more serious wrongdoing that he was trying to cover up. “It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful,” Trump said in his tweet on Saturday. “There was nothing to hide!” Flynn falsely denied to FBI agents that he had urged Russia’s ambassador to refrain from retaliating against sanctions on Moscow imposed by Barack Obama on 29 December, in response to Russian meddling in the election. While it is technically illegal for a private citizen to negotiate with a foreign government in dispute with the US, no one has ever been convicted of breaking that 218-year-old law. Documents released by Mueller on Friday said Flynn was being directed around that time by a “very senior” member of Trump’s transition team. Multiple US news outlets reported that this was Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Among issues being examined by investigators is whether any agreement existed between Russia and Trump – or senior Trump advisers – that Trump’s administration would act favourably towards the Kremlin in return for Russian assistance in the election campaign. US intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow mounted an influence campaign aimed at helping Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. The New York Times on Saturday published details of emails from transition team members. One national security adviser, KT McFarland, wrote that Obama’s sanctions would complicate Trump’s relations with a country “which has just thrown the USA election to him”. The Times said a White House lawyer told it McFarland had been referring to how Democrats portrayed the election result. Other comments made by Trump could also put him in jeopardy of obstruction charges. Several Republican senators have said Trump asked them to stop congressional inquiries into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. And after stating publicly that he had fired Comey for other reasons, Trump privately cited Comey’s pursuit of the Russia investigation as the reason, according to a leaked White House transcript. “I faced great pressure because of Russia,” Trump said. “Now, that’s taken off.” On Sunday Mike Rogers, a Republican former Michigan congressman who served on Trump’s transition team, said Trump’s actions around the firings of Flynn and Comey were likely to be central to the outcome of the Russia inquiry. “I do believe James Comey,” Rogers said on CNN’s State of the Union. “I think James Comey is a very good man. I think his testimony is going to be credible.” In a series of increasingly wild tweets on Sunday, Trump attacked the FBI and ABC News, which suspended veteran journalist Brian Ross for an error in his reporting on the prosecution of Flynn on Friday. The president also seized on reports that Mueller fired an FBI agent from his team for having sent text messages critical of Trump during the election campaign. “After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters – worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness,” Trump said in one tweet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/dec/03/arsenal-gifts-undermine-attacking-display-manchester-united-mourinho-wenger","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T12:50:52Z","webTitle":"Arsenal gifts undermine attacking display as United make the right calls | Jonathan Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/dec/03/arsenal-gifts-undermine-attacking-display-manchester-united-mourinho-wenger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/dec/03/arsenal-gifts-undermine-attacking-display-manchester-united-mourinho-wenger","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal gifts undermine attacking display as United make the right calls","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For 79 minutes on Saturday, Arsenal were superb. In that spell, they had 32 shots to Manchester United’s five. They pummelled a team noted for their organisation, creating chance after chance. As Arsène Wenger underlined afterwards, they hammered them on the xG. They forced David de Gea into a Premier League record 14 saves. The problem was that by the time they began that spell, they were 2-0 down. There is an entire chapter in Alex Ferguson’s last but one book devoted to Wenger and how predictable he found Arsenal, how easy they were to counter-attack. Wenger claimed last week that his switch to a back three had helped alleviate that, offeringgreater defensive stability. That seemed, even at the time, like a hostage to fortune and so it proved: all three United goals were the result of Arsenal losing possession. The third was understandable, the ball lost high up the pitch as Arsenal chased the game – although they had been given a warning a few minutes earlier with a Jesse Lingard effort that ended up being deflected on to the crossbar by Petr Cech – but the first two were not. Whatever the tactical approach, whatever grand designs the managers may have, a team who give the ball away as cheaply as that twice in their final third is going to have problems. United were admirably efficient, it’s true, seizing on the gifts Arsenal gave them. The link-up of the front three of Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial and Lingard was exceptional. As at Watford on Tuesday, the sense was of a much slicker trio than when Henrikh Mkhitaryan or Marcus Rashford play off the front man. Pogba’s role in that, linking the back and front of the team, is hugely significant while Lingard is coming more and more to seem like one of those players whose attributes are hard to define but who regularly has a decisive impact on games. Yet whatever satisfaction their interaction brings United there was also the oddity of a Mourinho side, for the second time in a week, taking a seemingly comfortable early lead and then only just holding on to it. Whether Mourinho had intended to pursue his notorious template for big away matches – the “he who has the ball has fear” doctrine outlined by Diego Torres in his biography of the coach – is impossible to say: the game was out of control from the off and remained so until Pogba was sent off. Anything, it seemed, could have happened. In that sense it could not be portrayed as some sort of tactical masterclass – from an attacking point of view this was probably as well as Arsenal have played against a Mourinho team. And yet as soon as Pogba had been sent off, Mourinho closed the game down. United stopped offering a threat on the counter, held their shape and, other than the Danny Welbeck penalty appeal, largely stymied Arsenal. It was as though Mourinho could have killed the game at any moment, it’s just that, with the chances United were creating on the break, he did not feel it necessary. It was notable as well, after all that had been said about the back three last week, that when Shkodran Mustafi went off, having been injured in the challenge that led to United’s second goal, Wenger did not use Per Mertesacker as a straight replacement but brought on Alex Iwobi and switched to a 4-2-3-1. Perhaps he simply reasoned that at 2-0 down he needed the extra forward and he had to sacrifice some defensive cover in the knowledge that a Mourinho side was unlikely to be overly aggressive in the circumstance. The result was Arsenal having a lot of the ball in dangerous areas 30-40 yards from the United goal as United’s two central midfielders, Pogba and Nemanja Matic, were outnumbered. That did not necessarily lead to clear‑cut chances – 15 of Arsenal’s 33 shots in the game were from outside the box – but it did feel significant that when Mourinho went to shut the game down, he brought on Ander Herrera for Martial to add an extra body in that area. Given how strong Manchester City are in midfield, that is perhaps a concern for United before the derby, but without Pogba they would have been forced to use a more obviously defensive presence in that zone anyway. But this was a game that seemed more about psychology than tactics. Mourinho, since his earliest days as a coach, has always spoken of the need to generate the right mindset in his players so they take the right decisions without them having to be pre‑programmed or endlessly practised. The three goals suggested that is close to being achieved at Old Trafford. Arsenal, meanwhile, continue in their age-old habit of making the wrong decisions at precisely the wrong times, undermining themselves before the contest has really begun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/dec/03/house-monteverdi-review-shoreditch-church-london-spitalfields-festival-madrigals-new-music","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T13:48:48Z","webTitle":"House of Monteverdi review – new music and MP3s take on the madrigal challenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/03/house-monteverdi-review-shoreditch-church-london-spitalfields-festival-madrigals-new-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/dec/03/house-monteverdi-review-shoreditch-church-london-spitalfields-festival-madrigals-new-music","fields":{"headline":"House of Monteverdi review – new music and MP3s take on the madrigal challenge","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"‘This year, we have ambitiously aimed at making each event a festival in its own right,” says André de Ridder, the German born conductor, violinist and champion of new music who is artistic curator of the Spitalfields music festival’s winter season. True to his word, his programme for the opening concert – entitled House of Monteverdi and some four and a half hours long – aimed high. Monteverdi’s Eighth Book of Madrigals, the Madrigali Guerrieri et Amorosi, was interwoven with a series of new pieces loosely related to it, or reflecting on it, many of them world premieres. De Ridder’s brief to his composers permitted plenty of leeway. They were asked either to address the Madrigali’s principal themes of love and war, or to take other works by Monteverdi, his contemporaries and successors, as starting points for new compositions. The challenge was daunting. The Eighth Book of Madrigals contains some of the greatest vocal music ever penned, whether for solo voices or ensembles: writing a work that can stand comfortably beside any of its contents is far from easy. The responses differed, inevitably, in scope and form. Jocelyn Campbell’s THEFT2 deconstructs and reconstructs Monteverdi’s vocal line and harmonies in a somewhat overlong sequence of sparse duets for violin (Mayah Kadish) and viola da gamba (Gavin Kibble). Josephine Stephenson’s Now That Heaven and Earth and the Wind are Silent turns to an English version of the text of Or Che ’l Ciel e la Terra e ’l Vento Tace, for an exquisite, unaccompanied madrigal of her own, rooted in the British choral tradition and beautifully sung by the Erebus Ensemble, to which she belongs. Stephenson also contributed a song cycle, Between the War and You – a bleak meditation on war, absence and mankind’s violation of the Earth. Written for the Hermes Experiment, its exacting vocal lines were delivered with considerable intensity by soprano Héloïse Werner. The slowly evolving harmonies at the start of Or Che ’l Ciel e la Terra, meanwhile, are echoed in Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s Shades of Silence, written for period instruments and played by members of the evening’s ensemble, La Nuova Musica. Its shifting soundscape of throbs and discords overstayed its welcome, though Thorvaldsdottir’s music came into its own in her second piece of the evening, Ad Genua, inspired not by Monteverdi but by Dietrich Buxtehude’s Membra Jesu Nostri, a dark meditation on the crucified body of Christ. Scored for soprano solo (Katherine Manley), chorus and strings (De Ridder’s own ensemble Stargaze) its descending, sorrowing phrases oscillate between dissonance and harmonic sweetness before peering into timelessness to contemplate “the eternal music” of God. The Hermes Experiment turned to Monteverdi’s less-known contemporary Giovanni Valentini for their A Response to Valentini, in which the outlines and polyphony of one of his madrigals gradually take shape from vocal and instrumental fragments. Furthest from Monteverdi, perhaps, was Qasim Naqvi’s Fjoloy, written for performance in Stavanger in 2014, and described by Naqvi as a “headphone piece”. The work was composed on a synthesiser and each performer sings not from a score, but from an MP3 track on his or her mobile phone. This permits microtonal tuning and the work passes through a series of dense tone clusters that hover, expand and contract in ways that get unnervingly under the skin. Fine though many of these pieces are – Ad Genua, Fjoloy and Stephenson’s Now That Heaven and Earth deserve repeated hearings – the evening was dominated by Monteverdi in a series of exceptionally strong performances. As authoritative in the baroque repertory as they are in new music, the Erebus Ensemble gave us choral singing of great fervour and resonance, from the hushed opening of Or Che ’l Ciel e la Terra at the start to the majestic, complex polyphony of the bellicose Altri Canti d’Amor that brought the evening to its close. Under David Bates, La Nuova Musica played with admirable dexterity and tangible enjoyment, and the solo singing was often superb. The great Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda came at the concert’s midpoint: Ben Johnson was the assured Narrator, wonderfully committed and intelligent; Manley and Magnus Walker played the conflicted lovers with touching elegance. Manley’s warm tone was heard to advantage in Lamento della Ninfa. Later, she and Johnson joined forces for Zefiro Torna; joyously done, its rhythmic ground bass was exuberantly picked out by Bates’s players. An uneven evening, but consistently fascinating. The Spitalfields music festival is at various venues in east London until 10 December.

And when I reached the place he said, come into my car and talk, I’m in a hurry.” While the car idled in Mumbai traffic, and his young nephew sat in the backseat, Saini says the casting director, Sohan Thakur, started to grope her. “It made me so embarrassed,” the Bollywood hopeful says. “I didn’t know if it was intentional, or by mistake. I was numb, I was freaked out.” After she squirmed from the vehicle, she says Thakur called her with a warning not to share the incident. “He told me, if you say this to anyone, it will be your minus in the industry,” she says. “People won’t see you as a good girl.” Thakur denies the allegations, and has said in a detailed response on Facebook that CCTV evidence supports his account of events and that he will be suing for defamation. Swara Bhasker is now an established, award-winning actor in Bollywood, the Mumbai film industry. But she was fairly new to the business when one director started incessantly texting her on set. It soon escalated to requests for “intense” one-on-one meetings. “He started saying he needed to fall in love with my character,” she says. “He would always call me on the pretext of discussing this lovemaking scene – and I’d go and he’d always be drinking.” Late one evening he knocked on her door while drunk, she says, and demanded she hug him. To endure the project, Bhasker was forced to enlist another crew member as her chaperone. “Now I understand why in the olden days the actresses used to take their mothers on shoots,” she says. Stories of sexual assault and harassment are among several shared with the Guardian by women in Indian film industries. All of those interviewed said the mass unmasking of abusers in the media and entertainment worlds of the US, UK and elsewhere was long overdue in India – but were doubtful such a reckoning would occur any time soon in the world’s largest producer of films. None could identify an offender accused of crimes on the scale of the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who has now been accused of rape by multiple women – allegations Weinstein denies. But what is endemic, they say, is a deeply entrenched culture of actors – mostly women, but some men – being pressured to exchange sexual favours for roles and the promise of fame. “The casting couch is one of Indian cinema’s most open secrets,” says Anna MM Vetticad, a journalist and author on the film industry. “It is always very subtle,” says Bhasker. “People try to insinuate that there are 10,000 girls for one role – so what can you do?” “They make situations uncomfortable and load choices in a way where if women want to get ahead, you have to do certain things,” another prominent actor, Tisca Chopra, says. Both women say they have resisted the “casting couch” even when it cost them work. “I have lost roles,” Bhasker says. “I know the directors who won’t answer my calls because I made it clear I would not get into that relationship situation.” Criticism of this culture is usually expressed as accusations that women are “sleeping their way to the top”, says Vetticad, “instead of pointing to the excruciating pressures women are subjected to in India’s heavily male-dominated industries”. She adds: “Male producers, directors and actors have the power to make and break these women’s careers, and so routinely and aggressively proposition them, or at the very least let it be known that a willingness to grant sexual favours would help a woman professionally.” “It definitely is a problem,” agrees Amit Behl, the senior joint secretary of the Cine and TV Artists Association in Mumbai. Tens of thousands of young actors arrive in film hubs such as Mumbai each year hoping to emulate superstars such as Deepika Padukone or Aamir Khan. “Mentally, in terms of awareness of the laws, they’ve just come from small towns with big dreams – they face maximum exploitation,” Behl says. As in other countries, sexual harassment is likely rampant across the Indian workforce, he adds, but is especially acute in industries such as cinema, where a huge pool of workers, poor regulations and artistic discretion vest enormous power in employers. “It’s an insecure industry in which people take advantage of each other because of this insecurity,” he says. This year, a shocking allegation roused the women of one Indian film industry into action. In February in Kerala state, centre of Mollywood, the Malayalam film world, a prominent female actor was bundled into a car and sexually assaulted for several hours before being dumped on the street. In a bombshell move in July, police arrested a major Mollywood star, an actor known as Dileep, for allegedly orchestrating the kidnapping and assault. He denies the charges. Padmapriya, a National Film Award-winning Mollywood actor, was aghast by the crime – but also by the way the industry reacted to Dileep’s arrest. “All the big actors went and met with him, said everything would be fine,” she says. Some industry figures attacked the victim, suggesting she was lying or might have staged the crime for publicity. “We were very frustrated,” says Padmapriya, who like many Indians goes by one name. What started as a series of Facebook posts in support of the woman snowballed into something unprecedented: the formation of a women’s film collective aimed at quashing sexism and sexual harassment in the Malayalam film world. “It was inspired by our colleague, but the first time we met we didn’t even speak about her – we just talked about our own experiences,” Padmapriya says. “If one woman was talking about the casting couch, I was talking about how I was being sidelined because I was a female actor. “We realised this was much bigger than what had happened to our colleague,” she says. In November, the Women in Cinema Collective was officially registered. It aims to advocate for women, but also provide counselling, legal advice and a formal redressal mechanism for when accusations of sexual harassment or assault arise. Awareness and reporting of crimes against women has grown across Indian society in the past five years, and the film industry has not been immune. “People are becoming more open about it, complaining, expressing their ire on social media, going to the cops,” says Behl. His organisation has received nearly 50 formal complaints of sexual harassment in the past two years, he says, compared with 12 in the three years before. The same whisper networks that trafficked warnings about Weinstein in the US also exist in India. Off-the-record, Bhasker reeled off a dozen household names in Bollywood who are regarded as “serial harassers”. They are unlikely to be unmasked any time soon, she says. Bollywood and other Indian film industries have no appetite for controversy. “This is a not an industry that has typically stood for causes,” Bhasker says. She raises the recent furore around Padmavati, a film about a legendary Hindu queen whose release was indefinitely postponed after protests and death threats against the cast. “Producers don’t go to court. They don’t fight. It is a non-confrontational industry. “Why, in a context like this, would people with tens of millions of rupees to lose align themselves with some powerless struggling girl? They’ll say, sorry babe – just go home. It is not a context that breeds solidarity.” Actors who call out their harassers must also contend with a culture that still shames victims, and which eyes female stars with awe and reverence, but suspicion too. “It is an industry where actors have to wear any kind of dress or do intimate scenes,” Padmapriya says. “And people assume, if you’re up for doing that, then what’s the big deal?” If you have information about sexual misconduct in Bollywood, please contact michael.safi@theguardian.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/03/german-police-and-protesters-clash-as-far-right-afd-elects-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T12:28:27Z","webTitle":"Germany's far-right AfD sidelines moderates as police and protesters clash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/03/german-police-and-protesters-clash-as-far-right-afd-elects-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/03/german-police-and-protesters-clash-as-far-right-afd-elects-leader","fields":{"headline":"Germany's far-right AfD sidelines moderates as police and protesters clash","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The nationalist wing of the German anti-immigration party Alternative für Deutschland has been strengthened and moderate forces sidelined at a party conference marked by protests this weekend. Several people were reportedly hurt in clashes between protesters and police in the city of Hanover on Saturday as the AfD congress chose Alexander Gauland to return to the co-leader post he had held until 2015. Gauland opposes the expulsion of Björn Höcke, an AfD member who said history should be rewritten to focus on German victims of the second world war. Gauland replaces Frauke Petry, who quit to become an independent member of parliament. Her sudden departure two days after the AfD became the first far-right party to win seats in the Bundestag since the 1950s exposed rifts over whether the party should ditch rhetoric such as statements saying Islam was not compatible with the German constitution. Outside the conference centre, thousands of anti-AfD protesters marched carrying placards reading “Hanover against Nazis” and “Stand up to racism”. Earlier, riot police fired water cannon at dozens of people who blocked a road leading to the event, underlining the divisive impact the party has had since it entered the Bundestag for the first time following elections in September. Ten protesters were temporarily detained; several police officers and one protester were injured. The party’s incumbent leader, Jörg Meuthen – a representative of the economically liberal wing of the movement who nonetheless also opposes Höcke’s expulsion from the party – won enough votes to keep his post. But in a vote that dragged into the evening, he was joined as co-leader by Gauland, who ran for the post at the last minute after another candidate seen as a moderate, Georg Pazderski, failed to win enough votes. The sidelining of Pazderski, a former ally of Petry, weakens the influence of those AfD members who are keen to manoeuvre the rightwing party into a position where it could enter a coalition government. Before the leadership vote, Meuthen praised the party, which is often beset by internal strife, for showing unity after two senior members quit in September in protest against what they saw as an unstoppable populist streak. “There are people in this country who don’t only say: ‘We can do this,’ but who actually manage to do something,” Meuthen told delegates, putting a new twist on the “wir schaffen das” (we can do it) message by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, to those who doubted Germany could deal with a record influx of migrants in 2015. Founded in 2013 as a vehicle to oppose eurozone bailouts, the AfD was polling at around 3% nationally two years ago on the eve of the refugee crisis. It has since morphed into an anti-immigrant party that now has seats in 14 of Germany’s 16 regional parliaments. Polls suggest it will win seats in next year’s regional elections in the southern state of Bavaria and the western region of Hesse, which would give it a foothold in all of Germany’s state parliaments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/dec/03/rugby-union-wales-south-africa-six-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T19:02:47Z","webTitle":"Victory over Springboks must not lull Wales into false sense of security | Paul Rees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/dec/03/rugby-union-wales-south-africa-six-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/dec/03/rugby-union-wales-south-africa-six-nations","fields":{"headline":"Victory over Springboks must not lull Wales into false sense of security","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Relief was quickly followed by reality for Wales. Victory against a side that could only be identified as South Africa by the colour of the jerseys completed a mediocre year on a high and their first match in 2018 here against Scotland promises to be a lot more taxing. It took Wales 93 years to work out a way of beating the Springboks and in that long barren run, together with the 15 years that followed, it would only have been rarely said that Scotland posed more of a threat. South Africa were so shambolic in defence that the hosts were able to park the running rugby they have been attempting to refine this year and give their kicking game a service. Wales were 14 points up in seven minutes and 21-3 ahead just before the interval but they ended up hanging on to record their third victory against South Africa in Cardiff in as many years. Their three tries came from kicks, two from Dan Biggar and one by his chargedown of Andries Coetzee’s laboured clearance, although they made little impression with ball in hand. They were without 10 first-team regulars and lost Biggar early in the second half with concussion, but while they look to broaden their outlook they are having to run from behind the gainline in phase play, lacking ball-carriers with impact at forward as well as inside-centre. They are a threat from set-pieces but, with their scrum in disarray against South Africa and attacking lineouts rare because they were awarded only three penalties, they lacked the means to build on their lead. They have players to return for the Six Nations such as Liam Williams, George North and Justin Tipuric, yet it is the lack of carrying options that will tax the head coach, Warren Gatland. He used 38 players in the four autumn Tests, needing to build depth with a number of players who have served him manfully this decade showing signs of wear and tear. It was only a few autumns ago that Gatland talked about Wales becoming a fixture in the top four of the world rankings. They started the weekend in eighth, some way behind New Zealand, England and Ireland, and they will go into the Six Nations unburdened by expectation. Gatland said that he was happy other teams were being talked up, but so did Rob Howley in his capacity as interim head coach at the start of the year and the team finished one off the bottom. Wales may have opted for a playmaker at 12, but the combination of Biggar and Owen Williams is not as complementary as that of George Ford and Owen Farrell for England or Johnny Sexton and Farrell for the British &amp; Irish Lions in the summer. The lack of carriers means the speed of delivery at the breakdown is an issue, an area the South Africa hooker Malcolm Marx sabotaged on Saturday. If the question was ‘why Wales did not build on their healthy lead?’, the answer lay in how their three tries were scored: they came from a cross-kick, a grubber and a chargedown and even Italy in the Six Nations should be more defensively aware than South Africa were in the opening 30 minutes. Wales certainly have spirit and, in the forwards Alun Wyn Jones and Taulupe Faletau, possess two players who have not been worn down by the physical demands imposed on them over the years. They were the difference between winning and losing, driving the team in the crucial final 10 minutes, but at full-back Leigh Halfpenny is struggling to find the thrust his side need in the position. Gatland talked later about the need to mix and match and not rely on one style of play, but Wales remain most comfortable when reading from a script. They need a few ad‑libbers in an international game that is becoming increasingly hectic and the coach, in his final two years in charge, now faces his most challenging period. South Africa’s next match is against England in the summer by which time they could be under new management. A meeting of SA Rugby on 13 December will consider Allister Coetzee’s future as head coach after a difficult two years at the helm. He has conducted himself with dignity and put a plan in place where there was chaos, but he has had to contend with problems that are the province of others. Wales and South Africa are two powers of the game with proud histories who are down the rankings largely because of domestic problems induced by professionalism. Wales have punched above their weight under Gatland, but a top-down approach will not do for either nation, as the weekend showed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/dec/06/lets-roll-the-best-board-games-for-christmas-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-06T10:36:25Z","webTitle":"Let's roll:  the best board games for Christmas 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/06/lets-roll-the-best-board-games-for-christmas-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/06/lets-roll-the-best-board-games-for-christmas-2017","fields":{"headline":"Let's roll:  the best board games for Christmas 2017","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Christmas and board games go together like turkey and stuffing. But if the prospect of endless rounds of Monopoly and Cluedo fills you with dread, there are some far better alternatives. Here’s our rundown of some of the best games to play with your family this festive season. Instead of charades, play … Concept Charades is a mainstay of festive gaming, and there’s something inherently hilarious about watching your aunt Margaret flailing wildly as she attempts to mime The Silence of the Lambs after three sherries. But if you want take things to a slightly more cerebral level, check out Concept. It sees players attempt to silently convey words or phrases by placing tokens on a board covered in symbols. It means you’ll have to be creative to get your meaning across. A man? The sky? Blue and red? Probably Superman. A film? Women? Music? Religion? It could be Sister Act. And, while there are plenty of simple options to play with, anyone who really fancies a challenge can opt for a tougher phrase such as: “To suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.” 4-12 players, 30 minutes, ages 10+, £26.99. Designers: Gaëtan Beaujannot, Alain Rivollet Instead of Scrabble, play … Wordsy Scrabble may be the world’s favourite word game, but by modern standards it’s decidedly clunky. For some real lexicological fun try Wordsy, a slicker, more satisfying alternative that feels a bit like the classic gameshow Countdown. Players compete to make words using a shared set of letters on randomly drawn cards. But while only the letters on the table will score you points, you can add extra ones. In the photo above, for instance, you could create the words “bench” or “packaging”. It means there’s no chance of being left with an unusable cluster of Qs, Xs and Zs. There’s also a clever scoring system where a well-played short word can net you more points than a longer one. The result is simple, brainy and utterly addictive. 1-6 players, 20 minutes, ages 10+, £19.99. Designer: Gil Hova Instead of Taboo, play … Codenames This subtle game of espionage casts players as teams of spies attempting to identify their own operatives from a grid of secret agents’ code names. One player on each side knows the identities of the agents on the board, and they attempt to guide their team-mates to the right answers using a series of cryptic one-word clues. The first team to correctly identify all of their agents wins, but there’s huge potential for confusion along the way. Overly ambiguous hints can lead players to mistakenly identify innocent bystanders or, worse, one of the opposing team’s spies, helping them towards victory. There’s also an assassin lurking somewhere in the grid – and revealing them results in instant, and ignominious, defeat. Codenames squeezes moments of tension and laugh-out-loud humour out of a very simple premise. It’s a must-have game on anyone’s shelf and perfect for playing with big groups. 2-8 players (or more), 15 minutes, ages 14+, £16.99. Designer: Vlaada Chvatil Instead of Trivial Pursuit, play… Timeline Trivial Pursuit is still the default option for family quiz contests, but there are plenty of better alternatives – and the smart but simple Timeline is one of the best. Players start the game with a handful of cards, each showing a historic event, such as the battle of Waterloo or the sinking of the Titanic. You’ll take turns to play cards into a line in the middle of the table, aiming to arrange them in chronological order. Which came first: Hannibal’s crossing the alps, or Caesar’s crossing the Rubicon? The invention of chewing gum, or the invention of the shopping trolley? The beauty of the game is that even when you are unsure of an answer, you can use your opponents’ previously played cards to narrow your options. You might not know whether the execution of William Wallace happened before or after the Black Death, but you can be pretty sure that it was after the reign of Cleopatra and before the American Declaration of Independence. It means that even when you find yourself stumped, you still have a fighting chance. 2-8 players, 15 minutes, ages 8+, £13.99. Designer: Frédéric Henry Instead of fighting with your in-laws, play... EXIT: The Game Christmas may be the season of goodwill, but it can also spark some unholy family bust-ups. If you’re worried about a brawl breaking out over the mince pies, why not try a cooperative game that puts everybody on the same side? The EXIT series is a tabletop take on real-world escape room games, Crystal Maze-style experiences which challenge players to overcome brain-teasing problems using their powers of logic, perception and lateral thinking. This cardboard version comes with masterfully designed puzzles. And for every one you solve, another seems to pop up to take its place, making the game more intricate and absorbing as you play. There are six games in the series, all with different settings, from a top-secret laboratory to an ancient Egyptian tomb. They’re one-and-done affairs: you can’t replay them once you have unravelled their mysteries. But at £13 a pop, they’re cheaper than taking your family to see a movie – and much more fun. 1-6 players, 45-150 minutes, ages 12+, £12.99.

But then Rekeem Harper, the Blackburn midfielder, was sent off at the same time as conceding a penalty – Chris Porter converted – and then, just before the hour, Elliott Bennett was also dismissed. Eddie Nolan soon cut the deficit to one before Porter drew Crewe level, but despite a two-man advantage, they could not force a win; the sides will contest a replay on 12 December. There remains the possibility of a shock following events at the Laithwaite Community Stadium, home to Woking, who fell behind to League One Peterborough and then saw Jonathan Bond save Chez Isaac’s penalty. But with just six minutes remaining Joe Ward earned them a replay at London Road. At Adams Park, Wycombe Wanderers needed late goals from Craig Mackail-Smith and Adebayo Akinfenwa to dispose of the Isthmian League’s Leatherhead, whose run in 1974-75 is also enshrined in FA Cup folklore. Leatherhead had taken the lead after eight minutes, Jack Midson dispatching a penalty, but Sam Saunders equalised with a fine free-kick. In between the two clinching goals, Sammy Moore, Leatherhead’s player-manager, inspired his players by getting himself dismissed. Coventry City, FA Cup winners in 1987, moved serenely into the next round, three goals between the 27th and 48th minutes proving more than enough to account for Boreham Wood. The blow of defeat had, though, already been softened for the visiting supporters by the chairman’s provision of a free continental breakfast for them all. Another former finalist, Luton Town, also enjoyed a relatively stress-free afternoon. Though it took them 40 minutes to breach Gateshead’s defence, they did so twice more inside the 90 minutes and then twice again in stoppage-time to complete a 5-0 thrashing; the goals came from Olly Lee, his brother Elliot Lee, Luke Berry, Daniel Potts and Danny Hylton. But the scoreline was overshadowed by a serious injury to the hosts’ Scott Barrow, who lost consciousness after colliding with his own goalkeeper in the buildup to the first goal – play was delayed for 15 minutes while he was treated. “He is up and talking in hospital awaiting scan results,” confirmed the club later. Elsewhere, Lyle Taylor scored in the 70th and 81st minutes to give AFC Wimbledon a 3-1 win at home to Charlton Athletic, while at the Keepmoat Stadium, Darren Ferguson’s Doncaster Rovers saw off their fellow League One team Scunthorpe; also through are Mansfield Town – for whom Jimmy Spencer scored a hat-trick – and Newport County, who beat Guiseley and Cambridge United respectively. The draw for the third round is on Monday at 7pm. In the second round of the women’s FA Cup, Middlesbrough were only 1-0 up at half-time against Farsley Celtic at Teesdale Park thanks to a goal from Millie Bell but ran riot in the second half, scoring seven more goals, to finish 8-1 winners. Emily Scarr recorded a 15-minute hat-trick while Holly Manders and Bianca Owens both scored twice. Sarah Danby also registered a hat-trick for Huddersfield Town in their 7-0 home thrashing of West Bromwich Albion and Lewes beat Enfield Town by the same scoreline. Coventry United secured their place in the third round by beating West Ham 6-1, with all the goals coming from different players. Coventry were 1-0 up at half-time but the visitors equalised from the penalty spot early in the second half only to see their opponents score five times without reply. Bradford City and Charlton Athletic both enjoyed 5-0 wins against Long Eaton United and Queens Park Rangers respectively while Crystal Palace won 3-0 at New London Lionesses thanks to goals from Megan Chandler, Stafanie Simmons and Gemma Bryan. Lauren Bracewell was the star for Burnley, keeping Stoke City at bay for 120 minutes in a match that was goalless after extra time, and then saving two penalties in the subsequent shootout which her side won 4-1. Derby County needed penalties to see off Hull City after the match finished 1-1 after 120 minutes, as did Stevenage in their win against Ipswich Town. The match between Brighouse Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/dec/03/football-swansea-city-stoke-city-dressing-room-row-martin-olsson","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T22:30:05Z","webTitle":"Swansea City tempers boil over in angry dressing-room row among players","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/03/football-swansea-city-stoke-city-dressing-room-row-martin-olsson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/dec/03/football-swansea-city-stoke-city-dressing-room-row-martin-olsson","fields":{"headline":"Swansea City tempers boil over in angry dressing-room row among players","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Swansea City’s calamitous season is going from bad to worse after it emerged their players turned on one another in a heated row in the wake of their chastening defeat at Stoke City. The disappointment and frustration that has been building for weeks spilled over in an angry confrontation that could be heard outside the changing room following yet another damaging result. Stoke’s 2-1 victory on Saturday condemned Swansea to their ninth Premier League defeat in 12 matches, increasing the pressure on Paul Clement, who delivered a scathing assessment of his team’s performances so far this season after they slipped to the bottom of the table. Although Clement retains the support of the club’s board ahead of next Saturday’s home game against West Bromwich Albion, with the owners hopeful that results can improve in time to allow the coach a chance to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window, the problems are piling up on and off the pitch after the scenes in the dressing room at Stoke. It is understood that some players have privately questioned the level of commitment of a few of their team-mates for a while, and the manner of the defeat at Stoke appears to have been a tipping point when it comes to airing grievances. Although Swansea got off to the perfect start when Wilfried Bony scored early on, the hosts exposed their fragile confidence with two goals in the space of four minutes just before the interval. Martin Olsson, the Swansea left-back, described the exchanges in the dressing room as “heated” and admitted it had reached a stage where players needed to speak their minds. “Now it’s time to get tough and if you need to dig some players out, you need to dig some players out,” Olsson said. “It’s time for us to be men and go and fight on the pitch. When we conceded the first goal, most of the heads go down and we’re not playing as aggressive. It cannot happen. We need to be stronger mentally, much stronger, because it’s going to be a long season. “[Saturday] was one of those days where some frustration came out in the dressing room but it happens in a good way – and it had to happen. We’re still behind each other, there’s some stuff we need to work on.” Asked to elaborate on the verbal exchanges, Olsson said: “Of course it gets a bit heated but in a good way. We all need to wake up as a team and we need to run for each other, create chances, offensively, defensively, like the end of last season.” Olsson went on to say that the blame for Swansea’s results rests with the players and not Clement. “The manager told us what to do. We need to listen to him. We knew there was going to be a long ball in and we had to deal with it [for Stoke’s second goal], and of course the first goal the ball was given away [by Leroy Fer]. Simple, silly mistakes – it’s frustrating.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/03/donald-trumps-racist-retweets-are-offensive-to-all-of-us","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T18:53:39Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump’s racist retweets are offensive to all of us | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/donald-trumps-racist-retweets-are-offensive-to-all-of-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/03/donald-trumps-racist-retweets-are-offensive-to-all-of-us","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump’s racist retweets are offensive to all of us","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We wish to express our profound shock and condemnation of the actions of President Donald Trump in retweeting video messages produced by the extremist far right group, Britain First (Report, 29 November). The videos are gratuitously offensive to all sections of our communities. They have been produced with the clear intention of sowing hatred and division. Had President Trump tweeted this material in error, he has had ample opportunity to retract it and to apologise. Instead, he has reacted to measured criticism of his actions by the prime minister, Theresa May, and the British government, by attacking them and deepening the offence caused. The president’s actions are also extraordinary and unfathomable, not least because the United States and the United Kingdom have had such long, strong and deeply cordial ties. His actions have been described as unorthodox in some quarters. Most right-thinking people think they are plain offensive. We appreciate that the vast majority of Americans do not share the views and attitudes of a president who is rapidly becoming a global pariah. Unless he apologises unreservedly for promoting a video posted by a racist which has been shown to be false by the Dutch government, in our considered opinion, the invitation extended to Donald Trump by the prime minister for a state visit to the UK should be withdrawn.

At one point, it was estimated that the Red Brigades had about 200 fully active members. They almost succeeded in bringing the state to its knees. Perhaps there is a danger of underestimating the fragility of liberal democracy? A few hundred fanatical, violent individuals can cause enormous damage.

There is nothing too satisfying in being plucky losers again. But as the players head home from a gruelling six weeks and the end of a season which, for some, began last December, there is a golden opportunity for the game in England to build on a performance which shows the gap behind the Kangaroos has been bridged somewhat. Perhaps the biggest positive from this tournament is that, for once, England appear to have piqued the wider public’s interest. Playing the final at a civilised hour – their quarter-final and semi-final kicked off at 5am UK time – on BBC One will have inevitably lured some floating viewers on Saturday morning. Growth is not just about a strong international squad; for rugby league, genuine progress is investment in the game’s grassroots, increasing the talent pool at all levels and pushing more people – and money – into the sport. The Rugby Football League will, therefore, have taken a keen interest in the viewing figures for the final which peaked at two million. There has been much discussion of missed opportunities following England’s defeat on Saturday but this, realistically, is the one which matters. It is of paramount importance for the sport’s development in England that there is a clear international plan for the four years leading up to the next World Cup, which will be held in this country in 2021. For that the Rugby League International Federation, which lays the framework for international scheduling, must take some responsibility, but the RFL is at least tasked with making sure there are as many opportunities for England to play as possible. As good as Super League is, if these past six weeks have taught the powers that be anything, it is that international rugby league is where the sport can truly force its way into the mainstream. In the past, rugby league has been guilty of making fans wait a full year for the next England game – that will not be the case in 2018, with discussions already under way about a mid-season Test. This would not be rugby league without some left-field thinking, however. There have been discussions about taking the game on the road, with Denver mooted as a potential location. The Guardian understands those talks have stalled, however, with logistics and the potential opposition stumbling blocks for any game to be taken across the Atlantic in 2018. However, the more England play – the England Knights concept will be revived to play in a new Six Nations tournament next autumn, alongside the Test series with New Zealand – the better. For that to improve, the clubs also need to be on the same page. Super League’s schedule is top-heavy, with an overriding feeling in some quarters that the season is too congested. More international breaks, and more chances to play together, will unlock England’s undoubted potential for whomever is the next coach. And on that point there is also the question of who will be in charge for the mid-season Test next year. Wayne Bennett, whose appointment two years ago was met with some disdain, has unquestionably improved the national side during his time in charge. But he is now out of contract, and at the age of 67 may feel like his time belongs solely in Australia with his club commitments at Brisbane. The RFL, though, would be wise to persuade him this project is worth continuing, because, whether it is Bennett or someone else, the coach inherits not only a talented squad but one which has plenty of years left in it. Of this year’s World Cup squad, only Sean O’Loughlin and Chris Heighington will definitely not be around for the next tournament in 2021. As Cameron Smith, Billy Slater and Cooper Cronk lifted the World Cup for Australia yet again on Saturday, it is perhaps important to remember that they have spent the best part of a decade playing together for both state and country. This group, by comparison, are much earlier on in their international careers – and the fact that Smith, Slater and Cronk will have all retired by 2021 also offers a crumb of comfort. The sport, though, has to seize the initiative and ensure this chance is not wasted, for the good of rugby league."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/dec/04/bma-calls-for-home-office-to-phase-out-immigration-removal-centres","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-04T07:48:19Z","webTitle":"Doctors tell Home Office to scrap immigration removal centres","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/04/bma-calls-for-home-office-to-phase-out-immigration-removal-centres","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/dec/04/bma-calls-for-home-office-to-phase-out-immigration-removal-centres","fields":{"headline":"Doctors tell Home Office to scrap immigration removal centres","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The British Medical Association is calling for immigration removal centres (IRCs) to be phased out and replaced with a more humane system of community monitoring because of concerns about the serious impact on the health of detainees. The report, published on Monday, calls for sweeping changes to the way IRCs are run because of a range of concerns about issues including restraint, segregation, PTSD and the management of complex health conditions. BMA chiefs say a “fundamental rethink” is required by the Home Office. While human rights campaigners have expressed concerns about immigration detention conditions for many years, it is the first time that the doctors’ union has made such a strong call. The BMA says it has published this report because of its growing concern about health and human rights in detention settings. The UK operates one of the largest systems of immigration detention in Europe, holding around 3,500 individuals in 11 IRCs at any one time. The new report, Locked Up, Locked Out: health and human rights in immigration detention, finds that immigration detainees are “vilified and ignored in equal measure” behind bars. The BMA is demanding action from government and policymakers on aspects of detention policy and practice that are detrimental to health. While immigration detention continues, it aims to support doctors and other members of the healthcare team in providing the best possible care for those detained. “In our view, the detention of people who have not been convicted of a criminal offence should be a measure of last resort,” the report states. “Detention should be reserved for individuals who pose a threat to public order or safety. Ultimately, we believe that the use of detention should be phased out and replaced with alternate, more humane means of monitoring individuals facing removal from the UK.” The researchers add that while detention continues, it should be time-limited, with asylum seekers and other migrants detained for the shortest possible time. The report is highly critical of the Home Office and also of NHS England, which has been responsible for commissioning healthcare in IRCs in England since 2013. “Problems with the accuracy and timeliness of health assessments, availability of services, staff shortages, and ensuring continuity of care have all been identified as adversely impacting on the standard of care provided in detention. For some detainees with complex health needs, there is a question of whether their needs can be met in the detention setting,” the report states. Of particular concern to the BMA is the way doctors may find their ethical obligations to patients in conflict with the demands of the centre staff and Home Office officials who may try to draw them into issues around restraint and segregation. The rule 35 process is supposed to highlight specific vulnerabilities, such as torture and PTSD relating to detainees, but the report says the rule 35 process is not always properly understood by detention centre staff. The BMA is calling for a pre-detention screening process to be introduced before individuals are detained to highlight those who are too vulnerable to be locked up. The practice of moving detained individuals into and between IRCs at night or early in the morning should end, says the BMA, unless there are exceptional reasons for doing so. Forced restraint and segregation should be used only as a last resort. In particular, segregation units should not routinely be used as a way of managing individuals at risk of suicide, self-harm, or those experiencing a serious mental health crisis. The authors of the report emphasise that doctors must be able to act with complete clinical independence and ensure that principle is enshrined and respected across the immigration detention estate. Doctors should never be involved in disciplinary or non-therapeutic activities within IRCs. “International standards of medical ethics make clear that any medical involvement in these measures will be in direct contradiction with the doctor’s primary duty to patients.” the report states. “Doctors should therefore resist formal or informal involvement with centre administration or security tasks, such as the use of force or restraint.” Concerns have been raised about the confidentiality of health records in IRCs, with detainees being asked to consent to their medical records being shared with the Home Office. Commenting on the report, Dr John Chisholm, BMA medical ethics committee chair, said: “Migrants and asylum seekers shouldn’t have their health-related human rights infringed and must be able to access healthcare adequate for their needs. The BMA hopes to work with policymakers and other organisations to restructure and develop policies that meet the health needs of people in detention and ensure doctors can meet their ethical and professional obligations. A fundamental rethink of current policies is required.” Emma Ginn, coordinator of the charity Medical Justice, which works to improve the health of immigration detainees, said: “Medical Justice welcomes the call from the BMA to phase out immigration detention. We agree wholeheartedly and call for immediate action. The BMA’s report echoes concerns we have been raising for over a decade of many disturbing healthcare failures. The Home Office and NHS England would be wise to take heed of such an authoritative voice as the BMA.” A government spokesperson said: “Detention and removal are essential parts of effective immigration controls, especially in support of the removal of those with no lawful basis to stay in the UK. “It is vital these are carried out with dignity and respect and we take the welfare of our detainees very seriously. We operate on the basis of a presumption against detention, and the adults at risk policy aims to improve our approach to identifying individuals who may be particularly vulnerable to harm in detention. “The provision of 24-hour, seven-days-a-week healthcare in all immigration removal centres ensures that individuals held there have ready access to medical professionals and levels of primary care in line with individuals in the community.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/dec/03/england-need-for-speed-exposed-joe-root-ashes-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T13:40:24Z","webTitle":"England’s need for speed exposed with weapons at Root’s disposal a concern | Ali Martin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/03/england-need-for-speed-exposed-joe-root-ashes-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/03/england-need-for-speed-exposed-joe-root-ashes-australia","fields":{"headline":"England’s need for speed exposed with weapons at Root’s disposal a concern","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The history of English cricket is littered with moments in the field when, almost to the imagined sound of Herb Alpert tootling out Spanish Flea on his trumpet, the car has shipped many of its constituent parts and is careering downhill at a pace. On the second day at the Adelaide Oval, one that was dominated by Shaun Marsh’s maiden Ashes hundred and capped off by Mitchell Starc’s pinpoint location of Mark Stoneman’s front pad before the rain, the latest such entry came moments from dinner amid a chorus of local derision. By this stage England were already well aware that their evening was heading for a late blitz under lights from Starc and co. Marsh, aided by the almost fraudulently placed No9, Pat Cummins, had combined for a punishing second session that had seen 103 runs shipped for the loss of one wicket and spirits were understandably low. But with two balls to go, suddenly a lifter from Chris Woakes took the shoulder of the left-hander’s bat and the pink Kookaburra ballooned up behind. Weary eyes lit up. Alastair Cook at a solitary second slip and the gully, James Vince, were both on to it. The bowler, whose average away from home was continuing to swell, might somehow nab himself a consolation prize. And yet what followed from England’s first-change was not a sheepish celebration but two arms held out aghast. Cook and Vince had collided in the dive, the right hand of the latter punching the ball from the former’s left to the delight of the Adelaide crowed. This, it is fair to say, was not the scenario envisaged when Joe Root decided to have a bowl five sessions earlier. Root will doubtless wear that call for some time if this Test match and tour continue on their current trajectories. But, like captains who opt to bat first yet somehow dodge any stigma when their side collapses in a heap, he is still beholden to his players. And three innings into this Ashes series with the ball, the weapons at Root’s disposal look a concern. England, truth be told (and perhaps most worryingly for Root), bowled better on the second day than the first. And yet despite an early flicker from Stuart Broad with the dismissal of Peter Handscomb third ball, and Jimmy Anderson seeing two lbws overturned on review, the cluster of wickets required never felt like coming once the, ahem, second new ball lost its lacquer. In fact, where such surges will come from this series is becoming hard to divine, with batsman error appearing the plan with the old ball. Get past the main two and Australia know it gets easier, with Woakes and Craig Overton ever willing but, like most English seamers, the type of bowlers who still need some assistance. Moeen Ali, meanwhile, is simply not right. The result in Australia’s first innings of 442 for eight declared here was all of the home side’s batsmen got set – at least by number of balls faced – with partnerships forming one after another. England’s attack has been picking up wickets at 52 runs apiece so far and, with Mark Wood perennially injured and Ben Stokes suspended, it remains fast‑medium at best. Trevor Bayliss naturally insisted after stumps on the second day that his side can indeed create chances out here. But it was the head coach’s follow-up to this statement that was arguably the more revealing, when he added: “There’s no use wishing that someone else is going to come with a click of the fingers. That’s all we’ve got.” Bayliss, not known to have spent many days watching county cricket, went on to add that pitches in England and the volume of cricket are perhaps not conducive to speed. England have won in Australia before without express bowlers, of course, but on the surfaces witnessed so far, it is starting to look as if the missing element required. It was at the start of the reply that the difference between the two attacks really struck home as on the hi-def big screen at the Cathedral End, Starc’s initial loosener was clocked at 145.3kph. One ball in, after England’s attack had sent down 894, his was already the fastest delivery of the match."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/12/five-things-to-remember-after-getting-the-dreaded-cancer-diagnosis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"Five things to remember after getting the dreaded cancer diagnosis | Ranjana Srivastava","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/five-things-to-remember-after-getting-the-dreaded-cancer-diagnosis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/five-things-to-remember-after-getting-the-dreaded-cancer-diagnosis","fields":{"headline":"Five things to remember after getting the dreaded cancer diagnosis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Amid the greetings of the new year arrives a simple text message, “What do you think?” The story is familiar enough but this time, the cast is different. The patient is related to my childhood friend and across continents and time zone, I feel it all. The desperate bid to find an oncologist, the labyrinth of investigations, the profusion of advice, and above all, the acrid taste of fear arising unbidden. Every day brings a new test. My friend and I talk when we are both awake and free. I text the patient who responds gracefully but doesn’t call. Caught up with my own patients, it’s not until days later that the act strikes me as deliberate, courageous and eminently sensible. Like many oncologists, I am used to calls from friends, friends of friends, relatives, friends of relatives and complete strangers. If you are struck by cancer, and you’re close to an oncologist, it’s tempting to call. But if giving unsolicited advice is inappropriate, dispensing advice out of goodwill can be dangerous. Cancer is many diseases; modern therapy is many different things; emotion and bias are forever lurking in the background. Too much reassurance can bring remorse; too little hope curly questions. Without wanting to dwell on the details, I would want the patient to benefit from the wisdom of others. Here is what I would say. Find an oncologist you like Once a cancer patient, always a cancer patient. Descriptors like cure, partial remission, complete response, and wait and see will cross your path. But the journey is long and arduous, so it pays to have a compassionate oncologist by your side. Cast in an unwanted relationship with a total stranger, you will end up sharing many intimacies with your oncologist. Find one who will listen to you, treat you as a fellow human being and never make you feel small about your smallest worries. Qualifications are important but specialists don’t get where they are without rigorous training and vetting. You don’t have to choose between smart and nice – you deserve smart and nice. Buy a notebook and carry it everywhere One of the hardest things about cancer is losing control. Suddenly, everyone is talking at you and your brain is overwhelmed. But knowledge is power. Since you can’t memorise everything, write down key points such as what tests you have and where, what the oncologist says, what your nurse advises, and all your appointments. Scribble questions that come to you in the middle of the night. Jot down medications and the dates of chemotherapy administration. You don’t need to obsess over detail but in an era of fragmented care, it is invaluable to have your information at your fingertips. When you feel too unwell to recount your history, a neat notebook can tell the story. There are apps that can help but for most people a simple notebook and pencil work just fine. Say no to unwanted advice As if cancer treatment wasn’t trying enough, a common stress for patients is unwanted advice. The checkout clerk offers vitamins to go with your chemotherapy, your brother recommends a naturopath, the boss sends a box of organic spinach, the baker knows someone with the exact same cancer, and your mother won’t leave your side. Then there are those who offer to tell their stories, shave your hair, hold fundraisers and overwhelm your pantry with whole foods. You know that they mean well and you’re touched but it really is OK, even important, to politely but firmly say no to unwanted advice. Knowing someone with cancer elicits myriad feelings in onlookers – sympathy, fear, guilt, love and regret to name a few. It’s not your job to deal with these emotions. Your job is to be kind to yourself and allow yourself time and quiet to make sense of whatever lies ahead. Limit phone calls, emails and messages and send out a weekly update instead. You get to decide who is in your innermost circle; for other well-wishers, suggest a roster of small but important jobs to keep your house running. These jobs might include replenishing groceries, tidying up the house, driving you to treatment, mowing the lawn, folding the laundry or walking your dog. Let things unfold with time When one of my favourite patients presented with advanced disease, she was given a prognosis of six months. Three years later, everyone was amazed by her robust health. My geriatric patient responded better to treatment than people half his age. These two feared the worst but did better. In contrast, other patients fare worse than expected. One of the curiosities of oncology is its endless capacity to surprise and humble even the most seasoned oncologist. Cancer treatment is guided by the available evidence but statistics don’t represent the individual experience. Statistics tell us what happened to the patients in that trial under those circumstances but the real world is different, and every individual is unique, so don’t be in a rush to find out the best and the worst of what happens to everyone else. And despite the profusion of things on offer, saying no more is sometimes the best option. A communicative oncologist will help you understand your situation, and it’s crucial to build a rapport that allows the two of you to canvass good and bad news. Be nice This sounds counterintuitive but being nice to others matters even when you are ill. You don’t need to go out of your way, and in fact, it’s vital that you speak out against inadequate treatment or unprofessional behaviour. But in years of working in a busy hospital with lengthy, unintended delays, here is what I have found about nice patients. They smile, say thank you, and show grace under pressure. Recently, I forgot to see a patient whose file got buried amid my papers. When everyone else had left, and he was still waiting patiently, I was mortified and asked why hadn’t made a fuss. “Clearly, you were busy, dear. Those were all cancer patients.” His generosity left me speechless and taught me a greater lesson than a tirade. Another time, an elderly patient told me to see someone ahead of her “because she looks really sick.” There are few patients sicker than those with brain metastases, yet she cared for someone else’s welfare. Such kindness and sacrifice is almost always noticed and repaid – it’s human nature. Nonetheless, in a cancer clinic everyone understands if you are having a bad day, and your treatment isn’t compromised if you don’t say hello. But when you can, reach out to the people who greet and treat you. It will make a world of difference and make you feel better too. Your family and friends are behind you. So are your doctors and nurses and the unseen people working on treatments of the future. May you find hope and solace in knowing how much care, goodwill and dedication is fuelling your journey. • Ranjana Srivastava is an oncologist and a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/11/my-name-is-jimi-review-jimi-bani-welcomes-us-to-his-tribe-in-rare-gift-of-a-show","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T05:24:18Z","webTitle":"My Name is Jimi review – Jimi Bani welcomes us to his tribe in rare gift of a show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/11/my-name-is-jimi-review-jimi-bani-welcomes-us-to-his-tribe-in-rare-gift-of-a-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/11/my-name-is-jimi-review-jimi-bani-welcomes-us-to-his-tribe-in-rare-gift-of-a-show","fields":{"headline":"My Name is Jimi review – Jimi Bani welcomes us to his tribe in rare gift of a show","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"There are few people I’d prefer to spend an evening with than Jimi Bani: master raconteur, established actor, and soon to be the ninth Chief of the Wagadagam tribe. Which is lucky. Because My Name is Jimi lives and dies on his infectious, irrepressible charm. Directed by Jason Klarwein, this is oral storytelling at its best, with dancing, riffs, puppetry and a good dose of audience interaction. And that’s not all. Bani, whose tribe is from Mabuiag island on the Torres Straits, also brings his family along for the ride: his mother Agnes and elderly grandmother Petharie, both resplendent in bright pink traditional garb, two brothers Conwell and Richard, and his 15-year-old son Dmitri. It’s a bold move, and a risky one, but it works. Co-presented with Sydney festival, this Queensland theatre production takes a fun, fresh approach to the idea that family is everything – and watching four generations interact on the one stage, often in three languages, brings pathos and weight to a celebration of Torres Strait Islander culture, while also exposing its fault-lines and unique challenges. The action starts, fittingly, with the laying down of a welcome mat. It’s a gesture of invitation; Bani has said viewers are basically walking into “our living room”. Sporting a suit and a big grin, he relays the good and the bad of his childhood, including dancing parties – cue a reenactment of a dodgy disco – and nights arguing under the lamppost. If there is nostalgia, however, there is also anxiety over who will carry the culture, language and traditions into the future. For much of My Name is Jimi, which was co-written with Bani’s father Dimple before he passed away in 2015, a fire burns on stage. It represents words Bani’s grandfather once told him: “There is a fire, a bright flame that was lit in the past, it is still burning but the woods are burning out. My job is to put new woods in to keep this fire burning” – and now, Bani, too, sees it as his role to keep the flames alive. Here, that takes the form of relaying fables, using clever puppetry, dioramas, a camera, and projections onto a giant screen. One – in which Bani tells the story of a haggard ogre who steals away children who cry at night, plucking out their eyeballs and skinning them alive – is genuinely frightening. In another more gentle tale a boy tries to cross the water to another island, only to panic and be helped by a friendly crocodile. When the camera spans under the waves to reveals an entire world under the sea – including a moving shoal of glinting fish – it is truly magical. Bani also doesn’t shy away from fraught post-colonial representations of the Torres Strait. This is a window not only into one family but also into a first nations culture that has a difficult history: Indigenous languages on Mabuiag Island, for one, were banned. But instead of lectures or reprimands, Bani uses lashings of humour – and a fair amount of tongue-in-cheek mockery – to expose the wounds of the past and explore the tests to come in the future. This is all delivered in the form of vignettes: memorably, Bani impersonates a Cambridge anthropologist. In a glass box stand his specimens, wearing grass skirts. Soon, however, the professor has them stripping down to the dress of today – shorts, backpacks, and the most important of accessories: a handheld football and speakers wheeled in a pram. When the professor makes a faux pas – declaring that Islanders use Myspace (Myspace? What decade is he in?) – his specimens, who are meant to be stock still and serious, giggle uncontrollably. The smartphone, though, is a serious issue. As Bani tries to install the culture of his ancestors on his son, dimming the lights and hushing his voice in tones of awe and respect, Dmitri takes a call on stage, ignoring his father’s pleas to put down his phone. Humour turns to disappointment; Jimi, distressed, walks off stage and the show stops. It’s awkward, embarrassing, and all-too familiar: a parent feeling dismay and sorrow at the gulf between them and their children. There are parts that work less well. A presentation of a family tree and a test of what the audience has learnt and remembered feels tired compared to the rest of the production. Then there’s the fact that none of the family members, bar Bani, are professional dramatists; Bani’s grandmother, in particular, seems shy on stage, speaking so quietly into the microphone that I could barely hear her. Overall, though, this is a rare gem of a show and a gift to be granted insight into a different culture from a tribal chief.

While the announcement of the new CBA was a positive outcome for rugby across the board, there can be no denying the greatest significance is for the women’s game. There are some of the sport’s diehards who will tell you Rugby Australia had no choice but to give a nod to the women’s element of the Rugby picture. But they are, fortunately, in the minority and are in fact not seeing the modern era of sport for what it is. This pay deal is not simply tipping its hat at the women’s formats; it is a reflection of a changing mindset when it comes to acknowledging the place of women’s rugby in the mix for a successful Australian rugby landscape. This CBA is an acknowledgement that women’s rugby – as with women’s AFL and women’s cricket – is a sporting market which in its own right has come of age and is a key part of the main conversation around pay, welfare and the growth of the sport. For the sevens women, they already participate at a professional level as a consequence of their full-time program, which was initially specifically established to target one major event – the Olympics – and consequently raise the profile of the sevens game and women’s sport, which they have successfully done. They are paid as full-time employees to train and compete at an international level, as are the men. So for these women, the key words in the CBA are parity and welfare, levelling a playing field which deserves to be recognised as equal and recognising the different needs of the players when it comes to health and lifestyle choices off the field. For the women who play XVs though, it is a very different equation, as it has always been, given the gap between their format and the three other branches of the national representative rugby tree. The greatest significance, if not in financial terms, is this agreement will see XVs female players receive the recognition deserved by moving from their long-time amateur status, to a semi-professional one by way of receiving Test match payments and support. Veteran of four World Cup campaigns with the Wallaroos, Louise Burrows, believes this agreement is a step in the right direction for the retention of current players and will also encourage others to take up XVs rugby. “I think for a young female who is talented at many sports, she will look at the growth of all female sports, but with women’s rugby offering equal payments for sevens and match payments for the Wallaroos, will consider playing the game we all love,” she said. Businesswoman Josephine Sukkar has been a significant and long-time supporter of the women’s game. She and husband Tony, through their company Buildcorp, gave the Wallaroos their first major financial support through a naming rights sponsorship in 2016 and have been strong advocates for the growth and development of the women’s national game. Sukkar believes Wednesday’s announcement is indicative of the most significant shift in focus yet seen towards the women’s game by Rugby Australia, but notes the women’s XVs game is perhaps the most complicated element and underlines the fact that sport is a business. “The biggest change that is required is in the women’s XVs,” she said. “Australia is not on its own in trying to work out how to make remuneration of women’s XVs representative rugby commercially viable. To begin with, there are not sufficient Test match opportunities for Australian women to justify a full-time salary. Match payments are an excellent start for the Wallaroos. All of us in rugby need to work to create a product that sponsors will want to align their brands with.” Burrows agrees. “With women playing rugby at a higher level on a regular basis with Test matches locked in each year for the Wallaroos, the team will continue to grow and have more success,” she said. “With success will come more interest and more support. Hopefully with that, more sponsors coming on board. “Most young girls playing rugby have been looking at the sevens pathway due to it being a professional sport and having greater opportunities. Given the new Super W competition and match payments, I think these girls will [now] look at playing XVs and realise it has a genuine pathway.” So will an increase in regular international competition capitalise on the initial investment in the development path through the new Super W competition and underline the value of the CBA inclusion? This pay agreement ends in 2020, as does the current broadcast deal, at which time the strong feeling is Rugby Australia will take a close look at the Super Rugby format and perhaps be tempted to heed recent suggestions to form a more regionally focused men’s XVs competition. If so, will there be an opportunity to launch an equivalent women’s competition enhancing the Super W format – perhaps a Pacific women’s championship – and capitalise on the pathways which have been enabled over this period? While this may seem a pie-in-the-sky notion at this point, surely what this CBA has opened the door to is the possibility for thinking more expansively into the future. Therefore, the structure of these next three years becomes crucial to the success and viability of women’s rugby in Australia at all levels. Josephine Sukkar believes the key to growth will be exposure of the product and this can only come through the commercial marketing and televising of the new national competition. “With exposure come sponsors, who as far as I am concerned are who we need to concentrate on. Government funding is drying up and we need to figure out how to be more independently financially sustainable. All sports, not just rugby.” For Sukkar, this outcome is one in which she feels a personal investment. “We are on a journey. This is social change and it takes time and vigilance,” she said. “We must work to bring our stakeholders along this journey. We women in rugby need to make brands want to be aligned with what we do, what we stand for and how we do it. If we get that right, the money will follow.” For Burrows this outcome has hit much closer to home. As a player and a working mum, juggling the necessities of day-to-day life and training for the Wallaroos has been hard. “We play for the love of the game at all levels, from grassroots through to playing at a state and national level,” she said. “It has always been an honour to play for my country and I have always felt proud of myself in what I’ve achieved. But I think with us being paid, the wider community will now take what we do more seriously.” Women’s sport, and women’s rugby in particular, is a successful and marketable commodity whose time to share the spotlight, and the money, has come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/12/foreign-donation-and-charity-law-changes-likely-to-face-high-court-challenge","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"Foreign donation and charity law changes 'likely' to face high court challenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/foreign-donation-and-charity-law-changes-likely-to-face-high-court-challenge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/foreign-donation-and-charity-law-changes-likely-to-face-high-court-challenge","fields":{"headline":"Foreign donation and charity law changes 'likely' to face high court challenge","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian government’s proposed ban on foreign donations and new disclosure requirements for political campaigners are “likely” to face a constitutional challenge, the Human Rights Law Centre has warned. The HRLC executive director, Hugh de Kretser, told Guardian Australia it was “actively looking at the legality of the bill” and had concluded there were “serious risks that the legislation violates Australia’s constitutional protection of freedom of political communication”. The charity sector has warned that, under the changes, it will not be able to use international philanthropy to pay for advocacy work and will face an increased burden of red tape. The electoral funding and disclosure reform bill requires all groups that have spent $100,000 or more on political activities in the previous four years to register as a “political campaigner”, and could capture charities because of their advocacy work. It introduces new requirements for political campaigners to confirm that only “allowable donors” – such as Australian citizens or residents – give more than $250. Charities must keep foreign donations separate from other revenue to ensure they cannot fund political advocacy. De Kretser said: “This proposed legislation would significantly harm the ability of charities to speak out about the work they do, whether it’s helping the homeless or protecting the environment.” He said the HRLC was focusing on “making sure the proposed legislation does not pass in its current form”. “However, if it does, it will likely be challenged in court.” Constitutional law experts such as Anne Twomey and George Williams have also warned the bill is vulnerable to challenge in the high court because of the implied freedom of political communication. A brief written by HRLC lawyer Hannah Ryan argues that charities will “effectively have to choose between political advocacy and international funding”. The Australian director of the Pew Charitable Trusts, Barry Traill, said examples of advocacy that could not be funded by international donations included World Wildlife Fund calls to preserve Antarctica and RESULTS International’s work to advocate for improved funding for Aids screening and tuberculosis immunisation in Australia and the South Pacific. Ryan also said the bill delegitimised civil society groups “by likening them to party political lobbyists”. Despite the fact the Charities Act banned charities from “promoting or opposing a political party”, the bill would “recast issue-based advocacy as partisan, political work”, she said. The chief executive of Philanthropy Australia, Sarah Davies, said the government had put forward “no evidence … to justify a ban on international philanthropy funding advocacy by Australian charities”. “We’re disappointed that the government is pressing ahead with this legislation despite strong opposition from across the not-for-profit sector,” she said. The government has written a short-form regulatory impact statement on the bill, which is a cabinet document and not publicly available. Davies said there was “no consultation on draft legislation” and Philanthropy Australia believed, given the scope of changes, a “detailed regulatory impact statement” should have been prepared and published. The finance minister and special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, said the government was not concerned about the bill’s legality because it “does not prevent charities from advocating in any way shape or form”. Cormann suggested that only a “very small number of charities” participated in elections and would be caught by its provisions. He said the bill ensured “all relevant political actors are subject to the same transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements and subject to the same ban on foreign political donations”. He said charities could use foreign donations for “non-political activities” and political activities could be funded from Australian sources. “Nothing in the government’s reforms restricts or limits charities’ legitimate activities,” he said. “This bill simply seeks to keep foreign billionaires and foreign governments out of Australia’s elections.” The Greens support a ban on foreign donations in-principle but oppose changes that harm civil society groups. Labor has also called for the ban to apply only to donations to political parties and associated entities. Shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, said Labor shares charities’ concerns the bill will stifle charities. “‘Our hard-working charity sector is one of the most trusted parts of our society and it needs a government that works with them, not against them,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/11/big-new-renewable-projects-planned-across-australia-as-tesla-effect-hits","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T06:20:09Z","webTitle":"Big new renewable projects planned across Australia as Tesla effect hits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/11/big-new-renewable-projects-planned-across-australia-as-tesla-effect-hits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/11/big-new-renewable-projects-planned-across-australia-as-tesla-effect-hits","fields":{"headline":"Big new renewable projects planned across Australia as Tesla effect hits","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia’s renewable energy sector responds to the success of South Australia’s Tesla lithium ion battery. South Australia will build the world’s largest solar thermal plant, and a Queensland wind farm may be the site of a new record-breaking battery. The Aurora solar plant in Port Augusta, SA, will begin construction this year, and is slated to provide 100% of the state government’s electricity needs by 2020, the state’s acting energy minister, Chris Picton, announced on Wednesday. The $650m, 150-megawatt plant uses mirrors and solar power to heat molten salt and generate electricity, and was approved this week by the state government. It will be built by American company SolarReserve, and is expected to create 650 local jobs during construction. In Queensland, French utility Neoen – which partnered with Tesla in SA to create the world’s largest battery – may trump its own creation by building an even larger storage system at the Kaban Green Power Hub, 80km from Cairns. Garth Heron, Neoen Australia’s head of wind development, told Bloomberg the company was looking to create “a very large battery” up north to deal with “a lot of need for electricity storage up in Queensland”. Franck Woitiez, Neoen Australia’s managing director, told Guardian Australia: “The project is progressing and we will look to go out to tender for the selection of our battery provided for this project.” Neither Neoen or Tesla could confirm if Tesla would partner again to make the Queensland battery. A Tesla spokeswoman said the company would not comment on unconfirmed projects or speculation. The South Australian Tesla battery, which is paired with Neoen’s Hornsdale wind farm, has a 100MW capacity – enough to power 30,000 homes for an hour in the event of a blackout. It was used for the first time in December to solve an energy shortfall during a minor heatwave. The founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, delivered the battery in less than 100 days, in partnership with the state government, after state-wide blackouts in 2016 were blamed on renewable energy. In December the state government hailed the battery’s effectiveness in dealing with power outages, and Neoen and Tesla have recently announced plans for a second collaboration to build a 20MW battery in Victoria. In order for the proposed Queensland battery to be the world’s largest, it would have to beat a soon-to-be-completed battery in South Korea, from Hyundai Electric &amp; Energy Systems Co, which at 150MW would take the crown from South Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/11/arsene-wenger-alexis-sanchez-arsenal-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T00:23:49Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger backs Alexis Sánchez to stay despite bench role at Chelsea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/11/arsene-wenger-alexis-sanchez-arsenal-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/11/arsene-wenger-alexis-sanchez-arsenal-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger backs Alexis Sánchez to stay despite bench role at Chelsea","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger said his decision to omit Alexis Sánchez from Arsenal’s starting lineup at Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final was not related to Manchester City’s attempt to sign the forward this month. Sánchez came on in the 66th minute of the 0-0 first leg draw and Wenger not only praised his attitude but expressed a confidence the Chilean would remain at Arsenal after the January window. City have indicated a willingness to pay £20m for Sánchez, who is out of contract at Arsenal in the summer. Wenger was disappointed to lose Jack Wilshere to an ankle ligament injury, which he suggested did not look too serious, but it was the subject of Sánchez that dominated the fallout from the tie. “The team selection had nothing to do with the transfer market,” Wenger said. “I have not to justify every decision I make. Am I confident he will stay in January? Yes. That’s what I want and I want him to stay for longer. When he came on, you could see he created straight away danger. We have to accept as well when you play so many games and Sánchez plays every game that sometimes a breather in the middle of the season helps a little bit. “Sánchez is a guy who is completely focused to play football. You see how he warmed up and how he came on? Like a player who wants to play football and he can make a difference between what’s going on outside and what’s going on on the football pitch. We live with facts, not with psychological theories and the fact is, when you turn out on the pitch, you play football and you give 100%. That’s what he does. “I have no problem. Does he sign now or does he sign in June? The only thing I want to say is the performance and commitment of Sánchez does not depend on the duration of his contract. If I play the next game for Arsenal, it doesn’t matter how long my contract has to go. I want to win the game and I commit [in that game] like I stay forever.” On Wilshere, Wenger said: “He has an ankle sprain and the first look at it was not too bad. But of course for Sunday [at Bournemouth], I think he will be short. It’s a shame to lose him when he’s in such a good form.” Wenger included his new signing Konstantinos Mavropanos among his substitutes and he said that, having first thought of loaning out the 20-year-old centre-half, he now wanted to keep him. “I personally want to keep him until May – to know him better and assess his level,” Wenger said. “The first signs he has shown in training were so encouraging I decided to keep him until May.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/11/thursday-briefing-may-launches-war-on-plastic-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T06:24:48Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: May launches war on plastic waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/11/thursday-briefing-may-launches-war-on-plastic-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/11/thursday-briefing-may-launches-war-on-plastic-waste","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: May launches war on plastic waste","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: Extended plastic bag levy to help cut waste Good morning – and a belated happy new year. I’m Martin Farrer and it’s my turn to take you through the best stories from the UK and around the world this Thursday morning. Before you order your takeaway coffee in a throwaway cup today, think again. Theresa May is today setting out the government’s ideas on how to reduce waste when she unveils a 25-year plan for the environment which will include plastic-free supermarket aisles, an extension of the 5p levy on plastic shopping bags to smaller shops and a tax on takeaway containers. Amid rising concern about the impact of waste such as used plastic water bottles and discarded coffee cups on rivers and oceans, the prime minister will use a speech to list policies which she hopes will eliminate all avoidable plastic waste within 25 years. “In years to come, I think people will be shocked at how today we allow so much plastic to be produced needlessly,” she will say. The plans will also include aid to help developing nations deal with their plastic waste. Pressure groups were consulted by Michael Gove’s environment department about the policies but Greenpeace says it is a missed opportunity because there are no plans for a deposit scheme on plastic bottles. * * * Watershed for NHS – The NHS winter crisis is a “watershed moment” and Jeremy Hunt must spend billions of pounds more on hospitals to help them maintain services, health chiefs have warned. NHS Providers, the body representing hospitals, has written to the health secretary to say that Tory cuts introduced after the 2010 election have starved the NHS of funds leading to worse patient care, understaffing and failure to meet targets. The organisation says the NHS budget needs to rise to £153bn – which is £20bn more than the government has budgeted for – in order to pay for up to 15,000 extra beds needed to cope with a surge in admissions during the winter months. * * * Class struggle – Teachers are facing an “epidemic of stress”, unions say, as research showed that 3,750 teachers in schools in England were signed off on longterm sick leave last year because of pressure of work, anxiety and mental illness. The figure is a 5% rise on the year before, according to a freedom of information request to 152 councils by the Lib Dems, which also shows that one in 83 teachers spent more than a month off work in 2016-17. Schools lost 1.3m days of teachers’ time due to stress and mental health reasons in the last four years. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said teachers worked “more unpaid overtime than any other profession”. * * * Greta Woody Rome – Greta Gerwig says she will not work with Woody Allen again after she responded to criticism that she had dodged questions about her professional links to the director. Gerwig, the actor, writer and director whose film Lady Bird won in two of four nominated categories at this week’s Golden Globes, said in an online discussion that if she had known what she knows now she would not have taken a role in Allen’s 2012 film To Rome With Love. Allen has been the subject of allegations about sexual abuse by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, which he denies. * * * Eugenics row – University College London has launched an investigation into how a senior academic was able to secretly host conferences on eugenics and intelligence whose attendees included Toby Young and which featured speakers including white supremacists. James Thompson, an honorary senior lecturer at the university, was said to have run the London Conference on Intelligence for at least three years. UCL said it did not know about the conference, an invitation-only circle of 24 attendees, which could have led to a breach of the government’s Prevent regulations on campus extremism. UCL was investigating a potential breach of its rules. * * * Je veux être français – As our Brexit wrangles continued with Philip Hammond accusing EU governments of failing to set out what future relationship they want with Britain, figures from France have revealed a tenfold increase in the number of Britons applying for French citizenship. They show that 386 Britons filed applications to become French in 2015, rising to 1,363 in 2016 and to 3,173 in 2017. Over the same period, the number of UK nationals obtaining French citizenship increased from 320 to 1,518. Fiona Mougenot,who runs an immigration consultancy in France, said many applicants were prompted by a wish to retain European citizenship. Lunchtime read: Will football prove Viktor Orbán’s undoing? Hungary once boasted the world’s greatest football team, the Magical Magyars of the 1950s led by the brilliant Ferenc Puskás. So it’s no surprise that the country’s rightwing, populist and football-loving prime minister, Viktor Orbán, wants to make the national team great again by investing in lavish new stadiums and youth projects. But despite his stranglehold on power – the posts of president and national assembly speaker are held by his former five-a-side team-mates – the huge expenditure on football and enrichment of friends is becoming a focal point for protest against his increasingly autocratic rule. David Goldblatt and Daniel Nolan have travelled to Orbán’s home village of Felcsút, where he has built a stadium in honour of Puskás, to examine whether it could prove to be a colossal own goal. Sport Arsenal fans chanted “You don’t know what you’re doing” at manager Arsène Wenger as he served the second instalment of his three-game touchline ban. But Arsenal held firm in a 0-0 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg draw with Chelsea and Wenger could enjoy a little succour in the face of what he calls the “circus” around his club. Publicity surrounding Chris Froome’s failed drugs test has dealt a reputational blow not only to himself but the entire sport, according to the British Cycling chief executive, Julie Harrington. In cricket, England have called up Liam Livingstone for the two-Test tour to New Zealand. The Lancashire batsman is being rewarded for his strong county and England Lions form. And it has emerged Serena Williams was bedridden for six weeks after the birth of her daughter, with medical problems including blood clots on her lungs following an emergency C-section. Business Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has become the world’s richest person after the company’s soaring stock price pushed his personal fortune to $106bn. We look at how his fortune compares from Croesus to Carnegie. It seems unlikely that Bezos will be worried that said stock market surge has paused slightly. Asian markets took their foot off the gas on Thursday and the FTSE100 is set to open flat. The pound is buying $1.35 and €1.13. The papers A bit of uniformity on some front pages around plastic. The Mail leads with the news that Theresa May has backed its campaign against plastic bags. It says the PM has promised to “end of the plastic scourge”, while the i has the headline “War on plastic”. The Telegraph features the plastic story on its front but splashes with a claim that May can reduce tuition fees because she has moved two ministers who blocked her plans. The Times also follows plastic as a story but splashes with news suggesting that EU heads may allow British financial firms access to the single market in return for payments. The Guardian leads on the NHS crisis, saying hospital chiefs are calling for funding to be increased by the tens of billions. The Mirror also leads on the “Health Service In Crisis” and highlights a striking quote from an NHS doctor. The Express has its own health story about a drug-free way to control diabetes while the FT’s splash is on Philip Hammond’s attempt to get Europe to be more enthusiastic for a trade deal.

Hmm, I’ve seen this before, I thought, as I watched a couple of Liberal party press conferences. Wasn’t there the same sort of panic in the early 2000s with “Lebanese gangs”? And before that “Vietnamese crime gangs”? Could this be a racially-based moral panic? So I sent a tweet saying things to that effect, and went off and lived IRL for a bit. When I returned to Twitter, my mentions had gone feral. There were scores of vile messages. I spoke to other people who’d also had the same experience – one tweet about Melbourne’s crime gangs followed by an avalanche of rage. It was a depressing way to start the year but I rationalised it. What could I do? Engage with the anger? Or disengage? I decided on the latter. My Twitter break was great. I didn’t miss it at all. Of course I reflexively went to open it about 25 times an hour. What was the latest scandal? Who was that day’s whipping boy or girl? Which way was the mob moving? Yet, I didn’t want to engage in the rage. I had outrage fatigue – something in my system was buckling, like the person who has been existing on burgers and fries for years and their digestive system suddenly packs in. I was done, spent, I had no anger left and also no appetite for anger. I was craving gentle things. I listened to Ed Sheeran, Lorde and Harry Styles on a loop – stuff that didn’t get the heart rate up. I went to see Call Me by Your Name, a lovely film set in the pre-internet days of 1983, swam in the ocean and read John Grisham thrillers. Instead of looking back in anger, I was looking back at anger and feeling faintly exhausted. This new gentle way of living rolled on. It was great. I forgot about the trolls. Then on Sunday I was at the cricket with my boss. It was 44C (111F) and I was stuck to the seat, half watching, half just staring slack-jawed at the baking pitch when Messenger pinged. It was Emma, an old school friend messaging to say she had found a video of me on the internet and I should take a look. “¿This video is yours? Brigid Delaney 😮” Despite the heat, I immediately got the chills. This had happened before. Friends would contact me saying, “People in the comments section are saying horrible things about you! They are bring brutal!! RUOK?? Look here it is! I’ve cut and pasted the bad comments for you!” I do not thank them for their service. It’s like having a pet kill a beautiful bird and dragging the bloodied corpse to your feet, giving you that look of: “Look! I have present I have for you!” DON’T! I’D RATHER NOT KNOW. “Look at this,” I shrieked, showing my boss the message. “Actually no! Don’t look at this!” The video had already clocked up more than 300,000 views. The cover image was from my Facebook page – I was holding a bunch of flowers I had just bought at the Vic Market and was wearing large sunglasses. Happier times. “They’ve gone into my Facebook and taken my photos and made a video!” It was the alt-right trolls, I thought. They had migrated platforms. “I’m not going to look at it or click on it,” I told my boss. “It will make me too upset.” I tried to think if I had posted any incriminating photos on my timeline that could be doctored into something pornographic. My boss advised me to take it to the IT desk on Monday to check my security settings and see what they could do to protect me from further trolling or hacks. I tried to sit back and enjoy the cricket but as I watched English wickets fall, I thought about the 300,026 people had already seen the violent video. What was in it? Maybe it was a doctored thing of me being beheaded or raped or stabbed in the face. Maybe I was being bashed to a pulp with a cricket bat. That night I had to review a variety show. As I sat in the Spiegeltent and listened to an a capella version of Rihanna’s Diamonds, and was the only member of the audience not to sway during the heart-swelling chords of Peter Cetera’s Glory of Love, I thought instead of 300,026 (probably more now!) being entertained by a video of an effigy of me being beheaded or mauled by a pack of dogs. I felt miserable. That night I barely slept. At work the next day, Mirza from IT said he would look at the video and then take the appropriate steps. I felt vulnerable about someone I knew watching the video. “OK, Mirza, I trust you to see a doctored image of me in a violent, degraded and vulnerable state but please don’t tell me what you see.” Mirza looked sad and depressed about the state of the world. Until 10 minutes later when he came up to me with my laptop. “I have good news!” he said. “It’s just spam.” The link took him to a dead Tumbler page. It was nothing! “It’s a terrible indictment on the world that your automatic reaction to it was that it was probably something violent, misogynistic and alt-right about the video,” said Mirza.

Decorum once associated with the Oval Office has been replaced by “modern presidential”, an amalgam of tantrums, tirades, and tweetstorms, all emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or Trump-owned properties. This break with the past is every bit as much about substance as it is style. Trump’s legal brush-back pitch hurled at the author Michael Wolff, his firing of FBI director James Comey and his taunts of Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s dictator, are not simply poses. They graphically reflect Trump’s understanding of his powers and the deference to which he believes his decisions and person are entitled. David Frum’s Trumpocracy is an attempt by the former speechwriter for George W Bush – author of the term “axis of evil” – and never-Trump Republican to come to grips with this. He laments what he views as “the corruption of the American Republic” and painstakingly catalogs the threats he sees posed by Trump to America, liberal democracy and Europe. Frum is disturbed by Trump’s nepotism and tropism toward kleptocracy, citing a legal ruling obtained by Trump that the White House was outside the scope of federal anti-nepotism laws. More broadly, Frum is alarmed by Trump “disabling” the “federal government’s inhibition against corruption” and his disdain for the notion that the law should be insulated from politics. To prove his point, Frum cites Trump’s expectation of personal loyalty from federal prosecutors and his public comments that the FBI director “really reports to the president”. Frum is not sanguine about a return to old norms in a post-Trump America. He observes that “it took a lot of work by a lot of people over a long time to build even America’s highly imperfect standards of public integrity”. Like Rome, which was sacked in an afternoon, Frum adds, “undoing that work would be a far easier task”. At the same time, Frum confronts the disconnect between white working class voters and America’s elites, and acknowledges that while it was Trump who lit the fuse, the powder that exploded on election night 2016 was all around: “Donald Trump did not create the vulnerabilities that he exploited. They awaited him.” Frum rattles off the systemic stresses generated by globalization and immigration that led to Trump’s electoral college win. In that vein, Frum had already been skeptical about the benefits of immigration. As he writes here, “population is citizenry as well as a labor force … and when it grows slowly, it can less easily assimilate newcomers.” Frum is mindful that the terms “Trump-voter” and Republican are not synonymous. To illustrate this point, he dissects in granular detail how Pennsylvanians reelected Pat Toomey, their incumbent Republican senator, while casting their lot for Trump, then diagrams the Toomey and Trump electoral coalitions. Although their voters overlapped, they were not identical. Class fissures were prevalent. Yet it is over the very issues of class and the country’s red-blue divide that Frum appears to miss part of the picture. It’s not only about jobs, income, opioids or even race. It is also about the impact of America’s 21st-century wars, and who has done the actual fighting and dying. The fact is that red state residents are over 20% more likely to join the military, while the denizens of blue America punch way above their weight when it comes to college. Even as Hillary Clinton won 2.86 million more votes, Trump won 60% of veterans. Ironically, the George W Bush administration helped set the stage for Trump. There was a notable correlation between battlefield casualties and support for Trump. Those parts of the US that felt the carnage more as a reality than as an abstract swung Republican. According to Douglas L Kriner of Boston University and Francis X Shen of the University of Minnesota, “Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan could very well have been winners for Clinton if their war casualties were lower.” Frum’s book is a victim of timing, buffeted by the release of Wolff’s Fire and Fury and the passage of the tax bill. In addition to lambasting Trump for his authoritarian tendencies, Frum takes the president to task for a lack of accomplishments, for delivering “very little by way of an affirmative conservative agenda”. Actually, since the book was put to bed, a lot has changed. Heading into 2018, the tax code has since been upended, Obamacare’s individual mandate is gone and the US recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. While the desirability of any of this is clearly subject to debate, each development is tangible and potentially lasting. The author is on stronger ground when he examines Russia’s role on the global stage, the 2016 election and the intellectual moorings of Trumpism. Frum critically quotes a 2014 speech in which Steve Bannon offered more than a mere dollop of praise for Vladimir Putin, and for that period in American history where “freedoms” were “controlled at the local level”. As a coda, Bannon also described a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower as “treasonous” and “unpatriotic”. And we know how that ended. Frum is less than optimistic as he looks at the US, Europe and the future. Trumpocracy also struggles with how to actually connect with white working class voters, who may have comprised as much as 45% of 2016’s electorate and who are now the heart and soul of the Republican base. As the scholar Barrington Moore Jr. said more than a half-century ago, “No bourgeoisie, no democracy.” How all this plays out in the years ahead remains the open question. Frum, for one, is fearful, and understandably so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/10/donald-trump-russia-special-counsel-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T22:47:35Z","webTitle":"Trump plays down prospect of special counsel interviewing him about Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/donald-trump-russia-special-counsel-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/donald-trump-russia-special-counsel-interview","fields":{"headline":"Trump plays down prospect of special counsel interviewing him about Russia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump has apparently reversed a commitment to meet the special counsel investigating alleged collusion between his election campaign and Russia, insisting that such an interview “seems unlikely”. Robert Mueller’s team of investigators has reportedly expressed interest in speaking with the US president in person, potentially in the next few weeks, though no date has been set. But on Wednesday, asked if he is open to meeting Mueller and whether he would set strict conditions, Trump told reporters at the White House: “We’ll see what happens. Certainly, I’ll see what happens. But when they have no collusion, and nobody’s found any collusion at any level, it seems unlikely that you’d even have an interview.” The comments implied a U-turn from last June, when the president said he would be “100%” willing to testify under oath about his interactions with James Comey, whom he fired as director of the FBI. He said of Mueller then: “I would be glad to tell him exactly what I told you.” At Wednesday’s joint press conference with the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, Trump again protested his innocence with a defence that included the unexpected argument that his defeated election rival, Hillary Clinton, would have played into Russia’s hands by favouring windmills. He repeated an inaccurate claim that “all” Democrats agree there was no collusion. “And when you talk about interviews, Hillary Clinton had an interview where she wasn’t sworn in, she wasn’t given the oath, they didn’t take notes, they didn’t record and it was done on the Fourth of July weekend. That’s perhaps ridiculous. A lot of people looked upon that as being a very serious breach and it really was. “But again, I’ll speak to attorneys. I can only say this: there was absolutely no collusion. Everybody knows it, every committee.” The president described the Russian investigation as a “phoney cloud” that has hurt the government and as a “Democrat hoax” brought up as an excuse for losing an election the party should have won because they have “such a tremendous advantage in the electoral college”. In fact Clinton’s win by nearly three million in the popular vote did not translate to the electoral college. Mueller’s team told the White House last month that they are likely to request an interview with the president, the Washington Post has reported. Trump’s lawyers have previously stated their determination to cooperate with Mueller’s requests. Once again on Wednesday Trump did not criticise Russia’s President Vladimir Putin directly, but he did contend that he is not pursuing policies calculated to please the Kremlin. “I will say this: I am for massive oil and gas and everything else and a lot of energy. Putin can’t love that. I am for the strongest military that the United States ever had. Putin can’t love that. “But Hillary was not for a strong military and Hillary, my opponent, was for windmills and she was for other types of energy that don’t have the same capacities at this moment, certainly.” Solberg, meanwhile reiterated Norway’s support for the Paris climate agreement. Trump added the issue had featured little in their discussions but he might be willing to reconsider the US decision to walk away if it can strike a better deal. “It’s an agreement that I have no problem with but I had a problem with the agreement that they signed because, as usual, they made a bad deal,” he said. “So we could conceivably go back in.” Trump paid tribute to Norway’s use of hydropower, adding: “I wish we’d do some of that.” Hydropower was long America’s biggest source of renewable energy, according to the group Climate Action, with the Hoover Dam still a notable example, but was overtaken last year by installed wind capacity. Facing a rightwing backlash over his apparent willingness to accept a path to citizenship for Dreamers, Trump denied if he might sign an immigration deal that does not include funding for a border wall. “Any solution has to include the wall because, without the wall, it all doesn’t work,” he said. Earlier in the day, the former reality TV host presided over his first cabinet meeting of the year in the cabinet room, where a day earlier he allowed cameras to watch him negotiate immigration with a bipartisan group of senators for nearly an hour. “Welcome back to the studio,” he told journalists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/12/family-violence-rates-rise-in-kimberley-towns-with-cashless-welfare","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"Family violence rates rise in Kimberley towns with cashless welfare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/family-violence-rates-rise-in-kimberley-towns-with-cashless-welfare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/family-violence-rates-rise-in-kimberley-towns-with-cashless-welfare","fields":{"headline":"Family violence rates rise in Kimberley towns with cashless welfare","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Domestic violence has increased significantly in the East Kimberley since the introduction of the cashless welfare card, casting doubt on the government’s claims of its success. Police data obtained under freedom of information law shows domestic-related assaults and police-attended domestic violence reports increased in the Kimberley communities of Wyndham and Kununurra since trials began in April 2016. Melbourne University researcher Elise Klein, who has studied the card’s impact in the Kimberley, said the data showed there was no clear evidence to support making the card permanent. Klein lodged the freedom of information request for the police data. She said the information had taken too long to be made public. She believes there is a link between the card, financial hardship, and family violence. “There’s huge amounts of money being spent here, and I guess the real question is, what other wonderful things could be put in place instead of this card?” Klein said. But the Department of Social Services said there was “no evidence” the cards caused an increase in family violence. “The number of domestic violence incidents reported in East Kimberley in 2016 is likely to have increased because more stringent police reporting meant incidents that were previously not recorded were now included in police reports,” a spokeswoman said. The cashless welfare card is a controversial form of income management, quarantining 80% of a welfare recipients’ payment to a restricted card, which can only be used at certain businesses. The card is designed to prevent the spending of welfare money on alcohol, drugs, and gambling, reducing violence and harmful behaviour as a result. Nawoola Newry has lived in Kununurra much of her life. She believes the card, which some of her family use, has done nothing to address the community’s problems. Instead, it’s restricted the rights of community members, without increasing jobs, training, or employment opportunities, she said. “I don’t believe that it’s reduced alcoholism, I don’t believe it’s reduced crime, I don’t believe it’s reduced domestic violence,” she told Guardian Australia. “There’s a lack of services, there was all these wrap-around services that were promised … we don’t see any of them on the ground.” Late last year, the government seized on an independent evaluation of the cards, which found they were successful in addressing substance abuse, violence, and other harmful behaviour. Then human services minister, Alan Tudge, used the report to announce new trial sites in the Kalgoorlie-Boulder region of Western Australia and Bundaberg in Queensland. The cards were also to be made permanent in the Kimberley and the second trial site in Ceduna, South Australia. Tudge said Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Bundaberg experienced similar problems to the East Kimberley, including alcohol-fuelled violence, which the card had helped reduce. “And that is too many kids born effectively brain damaged from foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, too many women getting bashed because of drunk men boozing up on the welfare dollar, and it is just too much violence generally,” Tudge told Perth radio. “This card helps to stop some of that because it stops the welfare dollar being spent on the booze and spent on the drugs.” Orima Research, which conducted the evaluation, had access to the police data on the Kimberley but did not include it in its report on the cards. Some in the community have expressed strong support for the card. The Wyndham advisory group to the government said they had witnessed a dramatic turnaround in substance abuse and gambling in the community. “Since the card has been implemented in our community we have been impressed by the positive results witnessed firsthand in reducing these harmful behaviours and assisting families to care for their children responsibly,” the group wrote in a submission to a Senate inquiry. Last year local government leaders and Wyndham Aboriginal leaders Bianca Crake and Jean O’Reeri told Guardian Australia that the cashless welfare card was the best available option to reduce alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence, and sexual abuse in their communities. The government has also repeatedly said the card would take some time to address entrenched and long-term problems, and that it was not a “panacea” for social ills. The Kimberley Land Council, representing local Indigenous communities, is strongly opposed to the card. In a submission last year, the council’s deputy chief executive, Tyronne Garstone, said Aboriginal people and communities were often “penalised by punitive, experimental and top-down policies regarding an issue that impacts the whole of society”. Garstone said the card was a “sledgehammer” approach that did little to address the root causes of social problems. Klein said the evidence used to justify the government’s plans for a broader rollout was deeply flawed. The methodology and analysis contained in the Orima Research report has been criticised by the Australian National University researcher, Janet Hunt, among others."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/11/shitty-media-men-list-moira-donegan-comes-forward-author","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T06:21:48Z","webTitle":"Shitty Media Men list: Moira Donegan comes forward as author","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/11/shitty-media-men-list-moira-donegan-comes-forward-author","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/11/shitty-media-men-list-moira-donegan-comes-forward-author","fields":{"headline":"Shitty Media Men list: Moira Donegan comes forward as author","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The author of a document that lists men in the media industry who have been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour has come forward, saying she created the document as “a place for women to share their stories of harassment and assault without being needlessly discredited or judged”. Amid speculation that Harper’s magazine planned to reveal the identity of the list’s author in its March edition, writer Moira Donegan penned an article in The Cut saying she was behind the document. But she’s not the only one: other women have posted on social media to say the list is theirs in an attempt to protect its creator from online trolling. Dubbed the Shitty Media Men list, the anonymous Google spreadsheet was circulated among women working in media in the United States last year. It detailed unsubstantiated accounts of men in the industry accused of everything from questionable behaviour to rape. The list’s existence was first revealed in an article by Buzzfeed, before it was published in full on Reddit. The list was subject to intense criticism, Donegan acknowledged, because its anonymity meant “false accusations could be added without consequence”. She said it had “spread much further and much faster” than she anticipated and admitted she was “incredibly naïve” when she made the list because she “did not understand the forces that would make the document go viral”. But Donegan defended the list’s purpose, calling it an attempt to solve the problem of “how women can protect ourselves from sexual harassment and assault”. She likened it to a “whisper network” where women “pass on open secrets and warn women away from serial assaulters”. She said she hoped the document’s anonymity would “protect its users from retaliation”, and the fact that it was open-sourced would make it “accessible to women who didn’t have the professional or social cache required for admittance into whisper networks”. “No one could be fired, harassed, or publicly smeared for telling her story when that story was not attached to her name,” she wrote. “The spreadsheet did not ask how women responded to men’s inappropriate behaviour; it did not ask what you were wearing or whether you’d had anything to drink.” Donegan’s decision to reveal herself as the list’s author came after rumours circulated that Harper’s planned to reveal its creator. It prompted a backlash on social media because of fears that naming Donegan would expose her to threats, abuse and doxxing. Several Harper’s contributors threatened to pull their articles from the magazine in protest if it published the name of the creator of the list, and other women began taking credit for the document in an “I am Spartacus” attempt to protect Donegan. Donegan says she was contacted by the essayist Katie Roiphe in December to ask her if she would comment for a Harper’s story she was writing on the “feminist moment”. “She did not say that she knew I had created the spreadsheet. I declined and heard nothing more from Roiphe or Harper’s until I received an email from a fact checker with questions about Roiphe’s piece,” Donegan wrote. “Katie identifies you as a woman widely believed to be one of the creators of the Shitty Men in Media List,” the fact checker wrote. However, Roiphe denied in the New York Times that she planned to “out” anyone. But the speculation was enough to prompt Donegan to act. “The outrage made it seem inevitable that my identity would be exposed even before the Roiphe piece ran. All of this was terrifying. I still don’t know what kind of future awaits me now that I’ve stopped hiding.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/11/bob-katter-evasive-about-plans-to-lure-fraser-anning-to-his-party","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T05:54:13Z","webTitle":"Bob Katter evasive about plans to lure Fraser Anning to his party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/11/bob-katter-evasive-about-plans-to-lure-fraser-anning-to-his-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/11/bob-katter-evasive-about-plans-to-lure-fraser-anning-to-his-party","fields":{"headline":"Bob Katter evasive about plans to lure Fraser Anning to his party","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Queensland federal MP Bob Katter is playing coy over speculation he is looking to woo the former One Nation senator Fraser Anning to his party. Anning burst on to the federal political scene in spectacular fashion, taking the spot of ousted Queensland One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts and moments after being sworn in either quit the party or was kicked out – depending on whether party leader Pauline Hanson or Anning is telling the story. Since then, Anning has stayed relatively quiet about his intentions, saying he is content to remain on the crossbench as an independent for now. Enter his “good mate” Katter, who has refused to hose down speculation Anning could become his party’s first federal senator, in a statement purportedly released to quell that very rumour. After it was made known the pair were meeting for dinner on Thursday night, Katter said it was “not unusual” for them to “catch up”, given they “have been close family friends for more than 40 years and they have a lot in common”. “I have discussions with people like Fraser Anning all the time,” Katter said in his statement. “I would be surprised if there was anything much that Fraser and I would disagree on. We both went to the big Christian schools in Charters Towers [north Queensland]. Both of our families were in Charters Towers before there was a Charters Towers, and his family goes back even further than mine. “We both had cattle stations; we are both businessmen and both very strong Bjelke-Petersen men and I hope that we will continue working closely together.” Anning did not respond to requests for comment. It is not the first time Katter’s Australian Party has flirted with taking on board disillusioned former minor party members. Its state MPs, led by Katter’s son Robbie, attempted to woo former Palmer United party MPs to their party banner before the 2015 election, but to no avail. Queensland’s KAP has also worked on creating a crossbench voting bloc in an attempt to swing more influence in the state parliament, where Katter Sr makes frequent appearances despite his federal jurisdiction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/11/labor-mp-michael-danby-used-taxpayer-money-for-trips-to-queensland-with-wife","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T01:48:24Z","webTitle":"Labor MP Michael Danby used taxpayer money for trips to Queensland with wife","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/11/labor-mp-michael-danby-used-taxpayer-money-for-trips-to-queensland-with-wife","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/11/labor-mp-michael-danby-used-taxpayer-money-for-trips-to-queensland-with-wife","fields":{"headline":"Labor MP Michael Danby used taxpayer money for trips to Queensland with wife","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Federal Labor MP Michael Danby has once again been caught up in in controversy, this time for using taxpayer dollars to fund trips to Queensland with his wife, during which he conducted no parliamentary business. Danby has put the use of taxpayer money down to “administrative errors”. Over several years, Danby charged taxpayers almost $15,000 for six trips to Queensland with his wife, and for expenses related to those trips such as limousine rides, Fairfax Media reported on Thursday. On three of those trips, he claimed expenses despite conducting no parliamentary business. In a statement, Danby told Guardian Australia that reports he had misused taxpayer money were “misleading”. “All of my personal travel I have paid for myself,” he said. “Over the last decade in parliament there have been instances where administrative errors have been made, either by the parliamentary travel agent or by my office. On each occasion, these errors have been identified by our internal audits and rectified long before the Fairfax attack.” Fairfax reported that on three of the trips to the Gold Coast, Danby did conduct official business and attended union functions and meetings. Those trips lasted four to six days, and while he paid for his own accommodation and meals, taxpayers paid for his wife to accompany him. A spokesman for Danby told Fairfax this was in accordance with parliamentary rules. The spokesman also said Danby had since repaid expenses related to two other Gold Coast trips, including a week in Cairns in 2012 that cost taxpayers $3363.96, and a $2,000 trip in 2015. Danby performed no parliamentary duties on those trips. It is the latest in a series of headaches for Danby. In October, he rejected reports that senior Labor figures were planning to dump him in the preselection process before the next election because of continuing concerns about his behaviour. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, was reportedly “deeply unimpressed” after Danby used taxpayer money to fund an advertisement in the Australian Jewish News criticising ABC Middle East correspondent Sophie McNeill of being biased in her reporting of the Israel-Palestine conflict. In the 2016 election, Danby suffered a 2.18% swing against him in his inner-city marginal seat of Melbourne Ports. It was later revealed that he took a trip to Israel shortly after the election while claiming medical leave."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/12/more-australian-graduates-head-into-part-time-jobs-as-economic-chill-persists","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"More Australian graduates head into part-time jobs as economic chill persists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/more-australian-graduates-head-into-part-time-jobs-as-economic-chill-persists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/12/more-australian-graduates-head-into-part-time-jobs-as-economic-chill-persists","fields":{"headline":"More Australian graduates head into part-time jobs as economic chill persists","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"University leavers in Australia are increasingly settling for part-time employment after graduation as a flood of job seekers holding bachelor degrees dilute their own buying power. On Friday the latest graduate outcomes survey revealed that the last decade has seen a rise of 17 percentage points increase in the number of university leavers in part-time employment, while the number of recent graduates in full-time work remains stubbornly below below the levels of the global financial crisis. It’s what the survey authors say is part of a “pronounced trend towards part-time employment among graduates”. Between 2008 and 2017 the proportion of employed graduates working part-time increased by 17 percentage points to 38% of all graduates. While the shift to part-time employment is part of a broader trend in the labour market, it’s particularly pronounced amongst university leavers. For example in 2017 male graduates were far more likely to be employed part-time than the overall male workforce. Part-time employment was 32% for male graduates compared with 18.7% for employed men overall. Phil Lewis, the director of the Centre for Labour Market Research at the University of Canberra, said the trend to part-time employment was down to supply and demand. Between 2009 and 2016 domestic undergraduate enrolments grew by 33%, which Lewis said was have an impact on employer choice. “There’s a certain number of people and a certain number of jobs,” he said. “When the economy is booming the queue becomes very short so employers take whoever they can get [but] the huge increase in graduates since the introduction of the demand-driven system just means the queue gets bigger. “These people will get a job eventually but at the moment new graduates are right at the back because employers can pick whoever they want.” The survey also found that since 2008 the full-time employment rate among bachelor degree holders has fallen from 85% to 71.8%. Bruce Guthrie, a research manager from Graduate Careers Australia, said: “In a way it’s the unfortunate timing of an increase in graduate output coinciding with a reduced demand for new graduates. “I used to hold out hopes that the situation would return to pre-GFC levels of strong employment outcomes for new graduates but it looks like the GFC has dislocated many industries and patterns of doing business world-wide and it might be that we’ll never get back to those levels of demand.” The survey comes as the federal education minister Simon Birmingham engages in a war with universities over funding. In its mid-year budget update the government announced it will cut $2.2bn from universities predominantly through a two-year freeze in commonwealth grants funding for teaching and learning – effectively the end of the demand-driven system. The minister has signalled that he will seek to force universities to improve graduate outcomes by attaching performance-based measures including graduate outcomes to funding. He said the survey demonstrated the benefits of “ensuring universities are more accountable and transparent about the job prospects of their graduates”. “For example the results show that 82% of graduates with degrees in teaching secured full-time employment within four months of finishing, with the figure dipping to 60% for graduates in the creative arts and communications fields,” he said. But Catriona Jackson, Universities Australia acting chief executive, pointed out the figures only accounted for graduate outcomes four months after graduating. “The data shows that graduates, like everyone entering the labour market, need time to establish in their careers. But this immediate outlook can shift quickly – within three years of finishing their studies, nine in 10 graduates are employed full-time,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jan/11/justine-greening-blocked-bid-reduce-tuition-fees-nick-timothy","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T06:10:13Z","webTitle":"Justine Greening blocked bid to reduce tuition fees, claims ex-May aide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/11/justine-greening-blocked-bid-reduce-tuition-fees-nick-timothy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jan/11/justine-greening-blocked-bid-reduce-tuition-fees-nick-timothy","fields":{"headline":"Justine Greening blocked bid to reduce tuition fees, claims ex-May aide","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Theresa May’s former chief of staff has accused the former education ministers Justine Greening and Jo Johnson of blocking attempts to reduce university tuition fees and reform higher education. Nick Timothy, who quit the prime minister’s office after last year’s general election, claimed the former education secretary and universities minister blocked proposals to reduce interest rates on student loan repayments and allow institutions to charge different fees. Writing in a column in the Daily Telegraph on Thursday, Timothy said the ideas could be revived by the government after this week’s reshuffle, in which Greening resigned after refusing to be moved to a different department and Johnson was shifted to the Department for Transport. Timothy also denied any involvement in Greening’s departure, but said the former education secretary “put the brakes on policies that work”. He wrote: “Young people must be given better choices at 18. Right now, the incentives tell them to go to university. Many emerge with good degrees, but others come out with a costly qualification that makes little difference. On average, they will graduate with debts of £50,000, the highest in the world. Those who do not go to university – still more than half of young people – are neglected by a system guilty of institutionalised snobbery.” Timothy also urged the new education secretary, Damian Hinds, to support the prime minister’s universities policy review. “Greening blocked proposals to reduce tuition fees and refused to hold a proper review of tertiary education. Hinds must be brave enough to do that, to ensure universities are better, fees are lower, and young people get the technical or academic education that suits them. He is already touted as a potential future prime minister: if he gets this right, he will be a convincing candidate for the job,” he said.

Bill Kenwright, the Everton chairman, confirmed at the club’s AGM on Tuesday the present estimate for completion of the stadium was £500m, but there was unexpected consternation when it was revealed the council would be chipping in with a loan for more than half the cost. It was initially assumed Liverpool City Council might simply be acting as guarantor for a private loan, until Anderson clarified the situation by explaining the council intended to borrow the money itself. “There is no risk to the city or the council from what we are doing,” the Labour mayor told the Liverpool Echo. “We are trying to bring in more revenue and this should make a profit of nearly £200m over the next 25 years. “There are restrictions on what we can do with revenue support grant money and council tax. They pay for services, so no one need worry about that. What we can do as a council is borrow at cheap rates and with that money we can help regenerate a wide area of north Liverpool as well as helping Everton. People have got to understand this is a commercial deal to enable us to make money.” It is estimated the city council could make £7m-a-year profit from interest charged on a loan of £280m over 25 years, plus extra revenue from business rates and related developments once the stadium is up and running. Opposition councillors have questioned why the city needs to get involved as a partner when they believe the club would be able to raise finance through private means, and not for the first time Anderson has had to deny going out of his way to favour the club he is known to support. “I’m a mayor first and an Everton supporter second,” he said. “To people who ask why Everton FC should benefit from the city council at a time when Liverpool faces austerity, I would point out we are trying to raise money to protect services. “The development site we call Liverpool Waters, from the Pier Head to the docks at Seaforth, was planned to take 30 years and a $5bn investment. We think this is a way of accelerating the regeneration of the region, bringing in jobs, investment and new housing. First it will be a deal that benefits Liverpool, and second it will be a deal that benefits Everton FC.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/11/saudi-arabia-women-professional-stadium-fan-al-hilal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T16:10:00Z","webTitle":"‘I can’t describe my feelings’ – Saudi women finally allowed into games | John Duerden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/11/saudi-arabia-women-professional-stadium-fan-al-hilal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/11/saudi-arabia-women-professional-stadium-fan-al-hilal","fields":{"headline":"‘I can’t describe my feelings’ – Saudi women finally allowed into games","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Forget Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona, the biggest move in the world of football this month will come on Friday as women step inside a Saudi Arabian stadium to watch a professional game from the stands for the first time in the country’s history. Al-Ahli will be trying to close the gap at the top of the Saudi Premier League behind Al-Hilal with a win over Al-Batin but more attention will be paid to the make up of those in the crowd. Until now, in the country ranked by the World Economic Forum in 2016 as 141th out of 144 on gender parity, women have been forced to watch the beautiful game on television. Those caught inside a stadium, as one woman was in December 2014, were arrested. The Saudi government announced last October that the long-standing ban was coming to an end, in at least in three stadiums to start with. Arenas in Riyadh, Jeddah and the eastern city of Dammam will have special sections for female fans. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was elevated to his current position last July, has been easing restrictions on women. In June the driving ban is set to be lifted. After the 32-year-old allowed women into a Riyadh stadium last September to celebrate the country’s national day in a move that went well, the next step was obvious. It is set to be a significant one not least because there is genuine passion for the sport in all sections of Saudi Arabian society. Ghadah Grrah could not watch her favourite team Al-Hilal even in the final of the 2014 Asian Champions League though female fans of Western Sydney Wanderers were allowed inside the King Fahd Stadium. Her wait, however, is finally coming to an end. “It can be hard to have to watch your team only on television especially when it is a big game or a final but now my wish is coming true,” the 22 year-old tells the Guardian. The fact that it is a huge game against Al-Ittihad of Jeddah, national and continental rivals, just adds to the anticipation. “I don’t know how to describe my feelings to you,” she adds. “I have been waiting since I became a fan in 2010 and it is such a pleasure to go to a match for my favourite team in Saudi Arabia. I am very excited.” Saudi Arabia is an Asian powerhouse with numerous continental titles at club and country level. The national team reached the second round in a first World Cup appearance in 1994 and celebrated qualification for their fifth World Cup in September. Their coach, Bert van Marwijk, was quickly released and his successor, Edgardo Bauza from Argentina, was dismissed two months later to be replaced by his compatriot Juan Antonio Pizzi. Decision making by the Saudi Arabian Football Federation may be erratic but the government’s call to allow women into stadiums is anything but, according to the Jeddah-based journalist Aseel Bashraheel. “There are many female fans in Saudi Arabia,” she says. “Many of my female friends and family are huge football enthusiasts. I’ve been to my share of cafes in Jeddah on many game nights and I’ve witnessed all the ladies around me watching the games animatedly and cheering loudly with their husbands and kids. I’ve seen my aunt and uncle cheer for opposing teams and then bicker and tease each other when their teams win or lose.” It is expected there will be an major influx of women for the opening games before a lull, with numbers hopefully gradually increasing over the months and years to come. “There will be a lot of women attending games as they have been waiting for this for many years,” says Khalin Ghadin of the Saudi Premier League, although the official acknowledges there has been some negative reaction on social media. “There was some criticism. Any decision brings criticism but most people support it.” Bashraheel knows it will take time for more conservative elements in the country to be won over. “There were those who welcomed the decision and expressed their eagerness to attend a family-oriented football match. And then there were others who believed the decision goes against Saudi’s culture and tradition.” That culture may be not quite as immovable as previously thought. “Society is changing in Saudi Arabia but I also believe there’s always room for more change.” For Grrah it is a good start and the Al-Hilal fan believes that Saudi soccer was never solely a male preserve anyway. “Saudi women have long been involved in the culture of football, this was never applicable to men only. If a woman is at the stadium with her husband, father or brother, the players will be more excited. We have been waiting for a long time and this is a new feeling for everyone. I think it will be a wonderful event.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/10/julian-assanges-bid-for-diplomatic-status-rejected-by-uk-government","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T23:10:53Z","webTitle":"Julian Assange’s bid for diplomatic status rejected by Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/10/julian-assanges-bid-for-diplomatic-status-rejected-by-uk-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/10/julian-assanges-bid-for-diplomatic-status-rejected-by-uk-government","fields":{"headline":"Julian Assange’s bid for diplomatic status rejected by Britain","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Foreign Office has turned down a request from the Ecuadorian government to grant the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, diplomatic status as a means of breaking the stalemate over his continued presence in the UK. The development comes amid reports that Assange – an Australian who has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy for more than five years – has recently become a citizen of the South American state. If awarded the status of a diplomat, it is thought, Assange could obtain certain rights to legal immunity and might be able to leave the embassy in Knightsbridge, and eventually the UK, without being arrested for breaching his former bail conditions. Swedish prosecutors last year unexpectedly dropped their investigation into allegations against him, which included a claim of rape. He had been resisting extradition to Stockholm for years. Assange still faces arrest for breaching bail conditions if he steps outside the embassy. WikiLeaks has voiced fears that the US will seek his extradition if he leaves the embassy. It is rumoured that there is a sealed US indictment ordering his arrest. An FCO spokesperson, confirming the latest attempt to resolve the impasse, said on Wednesday night: “The government of Ecuador recently requested diplomatic status for Mr Assange here in the UK. The UK did not grant that request, nor are we in talks with Ecuador on this matter. Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice.” At the same time Assange appeared on his Twitter account for the first time wearing an Ecuadorian national football shirt. There were reports in newspapers in Quito that he had recently been granted a national identity number. On Wednesday, the Reuters news agency reported it had found an entry for “Julian Paul Assange” in Ecuador’s Civil Registry, which only includes Ecuadorian citizens. Earlier this week Ecuador’s foreign minister, María Fernanda Espinosa, said her country was seeking a “third country or a personality” to mediate a final settlement with the UK to resolve the impasse and that it was “considering and exploring the possibility of mediation”. “No solution will be achieved without international cooperation and the cooperation of the United Kingdom, which has also shown interest in seeking a way out,” she told foreign correspondents in Quito, according to Agence France-Presse. Assange, who has received numerous visitors to his modest quarters in the embassy, ranging from Nigel Farage to Lady Gaga, has described the period since his initial arrest as a “terrible injustice”. Not being able to see his children grow up was “not something I can forgive”, he said. For several years, Metropolitan police officers maintained a constant watch of the embassy, which is situated behind Harrods in central London, at a cost of at least £11.1m, according to figures released by Scotland Yard in June 2015. Four months later, police lifted the round-the-clock guard on the basis it was no longer proportionate. A United Nations panel concluded in 2016 that Assange was under arbitrary detention."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/10/spread-betting-fca-warning-dear-ceo-letters-protect-punters","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T19:19:21Z","webTitle":"Just writing 'Dear CEO' letters won't protect the spread-betting punters | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/10/spread-betting-fca-warning-dear-ceo-letters-protect-punters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/10/spread-betting-fca-warning-dear-ceo-letters-protect-punters","fields":{"headline":"Just writing 'Dear CEO' letters won't protect the spread-betting punters","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Each time regulators lift the lid on the spread-betting industry the stench turns out to be horrible. “Consumers may be at serious risk of harm from poor practices,” says the Financial Conduct Authority after a 12-month review of how contracts-for-difference, or CFDs, are sold and marketed to amateur punters. By FCA standards, the language is extreme. Others might say it is describing a right old racket. A CFD is a way to bet on the price movement of a financial asset – such as a share, index or currency pair – without having to own anything. You win or lose according to the difference in price over the life of the contract, or when you close the bet. As ever with spread-betting, it’s an opportunity to crank up returns in both directions via massive leverage, sometimes running to 100 times the original stake. In other words, CFDs are high-risk financial products, meaning firms are told to be careful about who is allowed to play, and how. Here is the rough summary of the FCA’s review of 19 providers and 15 intermediaries: the rulebook is being widely ignored. Most firms couldn’t define satisfactorily their target customer. Most providers had “flawed due diligence processes” for taking on distributors. Conflicts of interest are rife. One firm had its chief executive as its head of compliance, which is a serious no-no. Perhaps we should not be surprised. When 76% of the customers are losing money – the FCA’s statistic – the incentive for firms to cut corners is plainly great. Several firms have now pulled out of the market, reports the regulator, and action will be taken against one. Really, though, you’d expect a stiffer general response than a “Dear CEO” letter, which amounts to a warning to firms to get their act together. Consumer protection has limits, of course, since a regulator can’t always save punters from their own foolishness. And, yes, there may be truth in the idea promoted by self-declared respectable spread-betting operators that a wave of Cypriot-based new arrivals has caused most of the problems. But come on, complaints about this industry are not new. The hope is that tougher EU rules to be adopted by the UK will finally improve standards. Maybe. But it will require the FCA to do better with the new regime than it has with the laxer one – writing letters doesn’t quite cut it. M&amp;S leads way on pay … sort of Humphrey Singer is a good hire for Marks &amp; Spencer as finance director, everybody agrees, but there are two notable features to this appointment. The first reflects well on M&amp;S. Singer is joining from Dixons Carphone without the usual adornments of a free car (with driver) plus outsized pension benefits. The latter allowance has been royally abused by companies. A director’s non-participation in the corporate scheme has become an underhand way to hand him or her more up-front cash while filing the sums under the innocuous heading of “pensions”. But when these “in lieu” payments have reached 25% of salary – the current rate for M&amp;S executives – they have lost all connection with pension benefits as understood by the rest of the population. You can be sure the workers aren’t getting 25% contributions. Singer will still be entitled to bonuses and share incentives at M&amp;S, but his basic whack will be a clean £600,000. On a comparable basis – in other words, including her car and pension nonsense – the outgoing Helen Weir was getting £757,000. If Singer’s clearer (and lower) basic package implies more transparency on pay under the newish M&amp;S chairman, Archie Norman, it’s very welcome. M&amp;S could do with a dose of that. Others should follow the lead. The other oddity doesn’t look so good. Weir is being allowed to leave at the end of March to pursue her “plural” career but will be paid according to her contract until early November. That might be understandable if Singer’s arrival coincided with Weir’s exit, but it won’t. Dixons Carphone expects to keep him until July. So there could be three or four months when M&amp;S is without a permanent finance director but is paying Weir £14,500 a week to stay at home. Nice work if you can get it. Sainsbury’s ahead of schedule Sainsbury’s refusal to give separate trading figures for Argos rightly frustrates retail analysts, but the general picture seems clear. The £1.1bn takeover of the chain in 2016 remains a smart piece of business when you remember that the buyer inherited a £700m credit book. Sainsbury’s reckoned on finding £160m of savings from the actual Argos business, via joint purchasing and suchlike, and is getting there ahead of schedule. Some £80m-£85m will arrive this financial year, some £15m-£20m better than predicted. That was enough for a small upwards bump to overall profit forecasts. It all helps – especially when general trading conditions are stable in the sense of pedestrian. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/11/jon-gruden-head-coach-oakland-raiders","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T10:00:17Z","webTitle":"Is the Raiders' move for Jon Gruden just an expensive grab at the past?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/11/jon-gruden-head-coach-oakland-raiders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/11/jon-gruden-head-coach-oakland-raiders","fields":{"headline":"Is the Raiders' move for Jon Gruden just an expensive grab at the past?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This was in the summer of 2000, back when Jon Gruden was still the impossibly young coach of the Oakland Raiders fighting a team owner stuck in the past. We were walking across a threadbare field at the team’s training camp – a makeshift operation set up behind a country hotel – and he kept shaking his head at the tufts of grass that looked like islands in an ocean of dirt. His face was a mix of disgust at the shoddy conditions and pride for the way he made the best of them. “Look at this,” he said with a laugh. Nothing about owner Al Davis’s Raiders screamed first-class in those days. That was the charm of the league’s most dysfunctional franchise. You didn’t need to be fancy to roll in Davis’s roughshod outfit. When Davis hired Gruden in 1998, one of the coach’s greatest selling points was that, as a 35-year-old, he came cheap. And yet he had been a brilliant choice for Davis, a taskmaster driven to make a flophouse of a franchise right. The season before his hire, the Raiders had practically quit on their season, with one star showing up to practice clad in a fur coat. Now two years into the revival, Gruden had given the team some character. But Gruden’s two respectable 8-8 seasons (they had gone 7-9 and 4-12 in the two years before his arrival) had not pleased Davis. Gruden didn’t run the owner’s beloved vertical passing offense, choosing instead the more deliberate but effective West Coast system learned from his mentor Mike Holmgren. So even with Gruden about to push the Raiders to within a game of the Super Bowl in the 2000 season, rumors flew that Gruden’s rebuild was going to cost him his job. As we walked that day I asked him about the whispers. He stopped. He scowled. “I don’t have a conscious fear of failure,” he said. Then he smiled. “I kind of like the rumors,” he added. “It’s part of the job.” Watching Gruden this week, as he sat at a dais with Davis’s son Mark, after accepting a contract that could pay him up to $100m to revive the Raiders again, I wondered if it was possible for him to be that cocksure young man on the broken football field. He is in his mid-50s now with a snug security that coaches never get: guaranteed employment for the next 10 years. He’s lived the past nine seasons in the comfort of the broadcast booth – still attached to football but safely removed from the grind that devours coaches’ souls. Nobody had to light a fire inside the Gruden who stood on that worn practice field nearly 18 years ago. His ticket to infamy came in winning his fight with Al Davis and the old Raider way. But that was before the Super Bowl he won with Tampa Bay, before he appeared to tire of coaching, before the Gruden Grinders on TV, before Gruden’s Quarterback Camp, before Gruden became a brand. Coaching isn’t the same when you boast a cult of personality. Who knows if he can spark his new team, but doing so after years away isn’t easy. In 2004, Washington’s legendary coach Joe Gibbs left broadcasting and returned to the franchise where he had won three Super Bowls in the 1980s. Like Gruden, Gibbs had become a name, running a successful racing team. He had moderate success in the four seasons that became known as “Gibbs 2.0” twice squeaking into the playoffs as a wild card but never coming close to the greatness of before. When Gibbs left again, at 67, he seemed drained, worn from the rigor of coaching in a modern age. Gibbs loved to talk about the all-nighters he and his staff pulled while game-planning during the season. He’d refer to the joy of hearing the early-morning trash trucks as he toiled under the office lights. The young Gruden liked to boast of his own endless hours spent at work. On the day we talked in 2000 a reporter had told Gruden he wanted to follow the coach through his workday. Gruden roared with laughter and suggested they meet a little before 4am at a favorite convenience store to grab coffee. Later that afternoon he stopped practice, angry that the Raiders defensive players – who were dominating the workouts that day – had been taunting their team-mates on offense. He called the entire team to the middle of the field. He shouted about respect, about dignity, about “playing like a champion”. His players dropped their heads. They listened. There were no more taunts the rest of practice. Can this Gruden stop practices for lectures the way he once did? Will he want to? On television he seems like he was back then: hyper, aggressive, growling at things that displeased him. But now he has set a new standard for coach’s pay, blowing apart the old structure and signaling an era where coaches might become as wealthy as the best players they coach. Al Davis never would have given a coach $100m, but Al Davis has been dead more than six years now. The Raiders will soon leave Oakland and their tired old stadium for an extravagant palace just off the Las Vegas strip. Gruden won’t be the gritty young coach on the barren field any more. He will be a man making $100m in a city where the nights glow and nothing is real. Is that enough to make the Raiders great once more? Or just an expensive grab at a mirage from the past?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/16/why-does-it-cost-32093-just-to-give-birth-in-america","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"Why does it cost $32,093 just to give birth in America?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/why-does-it-cost-32093-just-to-give-birth-in-america","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/16/why-does-it-cost-32093-just-to-give-birth-in-america","fields":{"headline":"Why does it cost $32,093 just to give birth in America?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Stella Apo Osae-Twum and her husband did everything by the book. They went to a hospital covered by insurance, saw an obstetrician in their plan, but when her three sons – triplets – were born prematurely, bills started rolling in. The hospital charged her family $877,000 in total. “When the bills started coming, to be very honest, I was an emotional wreck,” said Apo Osae-Twum. “And this is in the midst of trying to take care of three babies who were premature.” America is the most expensive nation in the world to give birth. When things go wrong – from pre-eclampsia to premature birth – costs can quickly spiral into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. While the data is limited, experts in medical debt say the costs of childbirth factor into thousands of family bankruptcies in America each year. It’s nearly impossible to put a price tag on giving birth in America, since costs vary dramatically by state and hospital. But one 2013 study by the the advocacy group Childbirth Connection found that, on average, hospitals charged $32,093 for an uncomplicated vaginal birth and newborn care, and $51,125 for a standard caesarean section and newborn care. Insurance typically covers a large chunk of those costs, but families are still often on the hook for thousands of dollars. Another estimate from the International Federation of Health Plans put the average amount insurers paid for a vaginal birth in the US at $10,808 in 2015. That is quintuple the IFHP estimate for another industrialized nation, Spain, where it costs $1,950 to deliver a child. The amount insurers pay for births in America is lower than the amount billed by hospitals because insurers negotiate lower prices. Even the luxurious accommodations provided to the Duchess of Cambridge for the birth of the royal family’s daughter Princess Charlotte – believed to have cost up to $18,000 – were cheaper than many births in America. Despite these high costs, the US consistently ranks poorly in health outcomes for mothers and infants. The US rate of infant mortality is 6.1 for every 1,000 live births, higher than Slovakia and Hungary, and nearly three times the rate of Japan and Finland. The US also has the worst rate of maternal mortality in the developed world. That means America is simultaneously the most expensive and one of the riskiest industrialized nations in which to have children. American families rarely shoulder the full costs of childbirth on their own – but still pay far more than in other industrialized nations. Nearly half of American mothers are covered by Medicaid, a program available to low income households that covers nearly all birth costs. But people with private insurance still regularly pay thousands of dollars in co-pays, deductibles and partially reimbursed services when they give birth. Childbirth Connection put the average out of pocket childbirth costs for mothers with insurance at $3,400 in 2013. In Apo Osae-Twum’s case, private insurance covered most of the $877,000 bill, but her family was responsible for $51,000. Apo Osae-Twum was the victim of what is called “surprise billing”. In these cases, patients have no way of knowing whether an ambulance company, emergency room physician, anesthesiologist – or, in her case, a half-dozen neonatologists – are members of the patient’s insurance plan. Even though Apo Osae-Twum went to a hospital covered by her insurance, none of the neonatologists who attended to her sons were “in-network”. Therefore the insurance reimbursed far less of their bills. There are few studies that estimate the number of families who go bankrupt from this type of unexpected expense. One of the best estimates is now outdated – conducted 10 years ago. But one of the authors of that research, Dr Steffie Woolhandler, estimates as many as 56,000 families each year still go bankrupt from adding a new family member through birth or adoption. “Why any society should let anyone be bankrupted by medical bills is beyond me, frankly,” said Woolhandler. “It just doesn’t happen in other western democracies.” Since Woolhandler conducted that research in 2007, 20 million Americans gained health insurance through the Affordable Care Act health reform law, and consumer protections were added for pregnant women. But Republicans and the Trump administration have pledged to repeal these consumer protections. “People face a double whammy when they’re faced with a medical condition,” said Woolhandler. Bankruptcy is often “the combined effect of medical bills and the need to take time off work”. There is no nationwide law that provides paid family leave in the US, meaning most families forgo income to have a child. And although childbirth is one of the most common hospital procedures in the nation, prices are completely opaque. That means Americans don’t know how much a birth will cost in advance. Dr Renee Hsia, an emergency department physician at the University of California San Francisco and a health policy expert likened the experience to buying a car, but not knowing whether the dealership sells Fords or Lamborghinis. “You don’t know, are you going to have a complication that is a lot more expensive? And is it going to be financially ruinous?” According to Hsia’s 2013 study, a “California woman could be charged as little as $3,296 or as much as $37,227 for a vaginal delivery, and $8,312 to $70,908 for a caesarean section, depending on which hospital she was admitted to.” Apo Osae-Twum and her family only found relief after a professional medical billing advocate agreed to take their case. Medical Cost Advocate in New Jersey, where Derek Fitteron is CEO, negotiated with doctors to lower the charges to $1,300. “This is why people are scared to go to the doctor, why they go bankrupt, and why they forgo other things to get care from their kids,” said Hsia. “I find it heartbreaking when patients say … ‘How much does this cost?’” Did you receive an unexpected or unmanageable bill after giving birth?

Watford, in 10th place, are only five points away from the relegation zone, anxiously looking over their shoulder and at risk of getting caught up in a survival battle that threatens to reel in more clubs than even before. Maybe that will serve as a marketing line for the TV companies in the months to come, especially as the title race is about as interesting as a cabinet reshuffle. Life lower down is rather less predictable or, to put it another way, competitive for all the wrong reasons. Eight clubs have failed to pick up more than a point per game (only three were in that position at the end of last season and they were all relegated) and every team in the bottom half has a double‑digit negative goal difference already. The concept of leagues within leagues is nothing new, especially with the top six operating on a totally different level financially to everyone else for many years now, yet this season and last, when only six points separated Southampton in eighth from Watford in 17th, there has been a shift towards a two-tier division. As things stand, Champions League ambitions burn and relegation fears grow either side of the thin line that separates Burnley and Leicester City, who are involved in a two-way fight for seventh spot and potential Europa League qualification, from the rest of the division. Everton, in ninth, are seven points behind Burnley in seventh and the same distance from the relegation zone, which rather sums up what the Premier League has become with its “squeezed middle”. The top six are pulling away while the playing field has levelled among the rest – albeit not in a good way. Although there are individual cases where clubs are clearly making progress and punching above their weight – Sean Dyche’s Burnley spring to mind – it is hard to escape the feeling when watching Premier League football these days that, collectively, the standard has fallen among those clubs in the bottom half of the table. That argument would probably jar with top-flight managers, whose stock response in press conferences is to describe the Premier League as unforgiving and say it gets better and better every year. But does “the best league in the world” really keep improving right across the board? Speak to Swansea City, West Bromwich Albion and Stoke fans, or Southampton and West Ham supporters – all clubs in the bottom six – and the chances are many will pine for days gone by and, rather than say the majority of their opponents are playing football at another level, instead tell you how their own team are a shadow of the one they watched a few years ago. As well as Huddersfield and Brighton have done to give themselves an excellent chance of extending their stay in the Premier League beyond their first season, there is no getting away from the fact so many established clubs are underperforming and have badly lost their way. Bournemouth make up the bottom six along with Swansea, West Brom, Stoke, Southampton and West Ham, all of whom have spent a total of 40 consecutive seasons between them in the Premier League and are presently between four and nine positions lower than where they finished last year. There is no single reason why things have unravelled at those clubs. In some cases flawed decisions at boardroom level will be the root cause, for others it will be poor management, while disappointing recruitment in the transfer market and underachievement on the pitch will have played a part to varying degrees, too. The fact West Brom, who have gone 20 league matches without a win, finished the summer with the joint-fifth highest net spend in the Premier League suggests money is not the be-all and end-all, even if Swansea supporters would argue that walking away from that window with a £25m profit after selling their best two players was asking for trouble. Stoke were also in credit come the end of that period. What is clear is the chasm between life at the top and the bottom of the Premier League is as wide as ever, on as well as off the pitch. The top six clubs have already put 100 goals past the bottom six, winning 31 of the 42 encounters and losing only two. They are sobering statistics given we are talking about established Premier League clubs playing against one another. For some of the relegation-threatened teams the default setting in those fixtures seems to be to try to avoid a hiding and pilfer a point by parking the bus – tactics that have arguably been exposed by Bristol City’s much more adventurous approach against Manchester United and Manchester City in the Carabao Cup, when a Championship club proved what can be achieved against higher-calibre opponents by pressing high and playing with ambition, belief and courage. Whether that will prompt any Premier League managers to adopt a more attacking approach for the rest of the season remains to be seen. In all likelihood it will still be all about scrambling to safety by grinding out a few victories against clubs in and around them and desperately trying to find that hinterland called mid-table."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/10/new-york-city-to-end-cash-bail-for-non-felony-cases-in-win-for-reform-advocates","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T20:50:36Z","webTitle":"New York City to end cash bail for non-felony cases in win for reform advocates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/new-york-city-to-end-cash-bail-for-non-felony-cases-in-win-for-reform-advocates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/new-york-city-to-end-cash-bail-for-non-felony-cases-in-win-for-reform-advocates","fields":{"headline":"New York City to end cash bail for non-felony cases in win for reform advocates","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The district attorneys for Manhattan and Brooklyn have announced that their offices will no longer seek bail for most non-felony cases, allowing defendants to be released on their own recognizance rather than sit in jail or fork over big sums of cash while awaiting trial for crimes deemed less serious. The change could save New Yorkers millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of days of jail time, and follows a city, state and nationwide trend towards reforming the system of pre-trial justice. The Manhattan DA, Cyrus Vance Jr, said his office would follow the new directive from Tuesday and would no longer request cash bail in most misdemeanor and violation cases. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez’s office began doing similarly last year. “Over the past eight years, we have made the advancement of criminal justice reform a part of the mission of the Manhattan district attorney’s office, right alongside our centuries-old founding mission of public safety,” Vance said in a statement. “Our reform mission requires that we continually evaluate the justice system we have in the context of the city we are today, and identify practices which result in unfair or unnecessary consequences for New Yorkers accused of crimes.” According to data compiled by the New York Criminal Justice Agency, about 18% of non-felonious arrestees in the city were issued some bail amount in 2015. Defendants who have bail set must either provide it in full to the court, pay a bondsman to cover it for them or remain in jail awaiting the resolution of the charges. Criminal justice advocates, along with several US courts have argued that this system, which allows people to be held in jail even if they have not been convicted of a crime, so long as they are poor, is unproductive and unconstitutional. “Symbolically, whether it affects a few people or a lot of people, it is a move in the right direction,” said Cherise Fanno Burdeen, CEO of the Pretrial Justice Institute, a non-profit that works to end money bail and scale back the use of pre-trial detention. “It’s a recognition by the city that the current system is broken.” New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, also announced his support for bringing an end to cash bail statewide in his “state of the state” address last week. New Jersey made a similar move in 2016, and state legislatures in Missouri, Ohio, Alabama, California and Maryland are expected to debate legislation in early 2018 that would do the same. A bipartisan group of US senators have also discussed legislation to outlaw cash bail nationwide, but it has not gained much traction. According to a comprehensive 2014 report from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, there were more than 225,000 misdemeanor arrests in New York City in 2013, and the average misdemeanor jail stay in 2015 was 17 days. In addition, NYCJA found that the median bail set for a New York City misdemeanor arrest was $1,000. If all of those figures were to hold true, and New York’s other boroughs followed the lead of Manhattan and Brooklyn, the impact could be profound. Some 40,000 New Yorkers could avoid a cumulative 680,000 days in jail annually, waiting for trial or save $40m in bail owed to buy their temporary freedom. It is quite possible those boroughs will too. On Tuesday, the Bronx DA, Darcel Clark, told the Citizen’s Crime Commission that her office supports bail reform generally, adding: “If we are not asking for jail, then we should not be asking for bail. For my [assistant] DAs, the default is no bail.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/10/canada-swatting-hoax-charge-kansas-tyler-raj-barriss","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T20:00:25Z","webTitle":"Man accused of fatal Kansas 'swatting' hoax charged in Canada over similar call","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/canada-swatting-hoax-charge-kansas-tyler-raj-barriss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/10/canada-swatting-hoax-charge-kansas-tyler-raj-barriss","fields":{"headline":"Man accused of fatal Kansas 'swatting' hoax charged in Canada over similar call","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Los Angeles man accused of making a hoax 911 call that led to a fatal police shooting in Kansas is now suspected of making a similar call days earlier in Canada. Police in Calgary said on Tuesday that charges of mischief and fraud had been laid against Tyler Raj Barriss, 25. The charges stem from an incident in late December in which tactical unit and patrol officers surround an apartment in the western Canadian city after evacuating nearby units. Police said they were responding to an emergency call in which a man claimed to have shot his father and said he was now holding his mother and younger brother hostage. “While officers were on scene trying to confirm the reported information, Calgary 911 received another call from a female who lived at the address, who believed she was the victim of a swatting call,” said Peter Siegenthaler of the Calgary police service. “The female exited her residence and officers confirmed that the initial report of a shooting and hostage scenario was false.” Nobody was hurt during the incident. Police believe the woman – who said she had been warned by another person online about the hoax – was targeted due to her online persona. They described the hoax as a case of “swatting”, in which a person makes a bogus emergency call in order to get a tactical team deployed to an address. “Anyone can make these calls. You don’t have to be very sophisticated,” said Siegenthaler. “We know that swatters can be teenagers in their bedroom making a swatting call while Mom and Dad watch TV.” The incident in Calgary took place six days before a similar hoax south of the border left an unarmed man dead. In late December police in Wichita, Kansas, surrounded a home after receiving a 911 call in which a man said he had shot his father and was holding a gun to his mother and younger brother. Audio of the call captured the man saying calmly that he had poured gasoline inside the home “and I might just set it on fire”. Swat officers descended on the address. When a man – later identified as 28-year-old Andrew Finch – stepped out on the porch of the home, police ordered him to put his hands up and move slowly. The man moved his hand toward the area of his waistband and an officer, fearing the man was reaching for a gun, fired a single shot. Finch died a few minutes later at a hospital. Police said he was unarmed. The bogus call had been reportedly made after a dispute over a small wager during an online video game tournament, according to gaming news service Dexerto. The mother of the victim, however, said her son did not play video games. Barriss has been charged in Kansas with making a false alarm. Authorities in the US said Barriss has a history of making false reports to police. In 2016 he was convicted on two counts of making false bomb reports against two Los Angeles schools and TV station. Police and court documents have linked him to some 20 alleged incidents involving bogus threats against universities and media outlets. Calgary police said it was unlikely that Barriss would be extradited to Canada to face charges, but that he would be arrested if he ever attempts to enter Canada."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/10/father-micheal-lynch-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T18:06:49Z","webTitle":"Father Mícheál Lynch obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/father-micheal-lynch-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/10/father-micheal-lynch-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Father Mícheál Lynch obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My uncle, Father Mícheál Lynch, who has died aged 83, was an Irish-born Catholic parish priest who ministered in various parts of the English Midlands for more than 40 years, before retiring in Lincoln. Born in Dublin, he grew up on a farm in County Longford, the oldest of six children of Eugene Lynch, a farmer, and Rose (nee McDonald), a teacher. After completing his training for the priesthood at All Hallows College in Dublin in 1958, he began his vocation in the diocese of Nottingham, where he quickly became renowned for his community work and skill at fundraising. His first curacy, in 1958, was in the Sacred Heart parish in Leicester, where, among other things, he encouraged local musicians to play at weekly dances. These became important community events and generated essential funds for the parish. His expertise at fundraising was noticed by his bishop, and two years later he was transferred to Alfreton in Derbyshire – still in the Nottingham diocese – to help raise money for the building of a new Catholic primary school. In 1970 he was appointed parish priest in Oakham, Rutland, where he took on the job of amalgamating two parishes, St Thomas of Canterbury at Exton and St Joseph and St Edith at Oakham. He was also responsible for the construction of a new church for the growing Catholic population, and set about the task with great enthusiasm. In 1975 the St Joseph’s Catholic Church and meeting rooms were formally opened, the old church becoming a thriving social centre that helped to raise funds to pay for other parish works. The community in Oakham benefited socially from Mícheál’s love of music as he brought many show bands from Ireland to perform at fundraising events to help repay the church loan. His friendship with many of these performers, including Larry Cunningham and the Mighty Avons, Big Tom, Philomena Begley and the Bards, continued for the rest of his life. In 1985 he moved to the parish of SS Peter and Paul in Lincoln, where he oversaw the construction of its new social centre, wrapping it around the existing church. As chair of governors at St Hugh’s Catholic primary school, he was also involved in transferring the school to a new site in the city. Mícheál was popular in every parish in which he ministered, and was particularly close to the Traveller community, appearing as an officiating priest in the Channel 4 reality show Big Fat Gypsy Weddings. He retired from full-time ministry in 2000 due to poor health, but continued to provide pastoral care to the community until last year. He is survived by his five siblings and 14 nieces and nephews."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/10/toby-young-indiscretions","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T19:52:29Z","webTitle":"Toby Young’s indiscretions | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/10/toby-young-indiscretions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/10/toby-young-indiscretions","fields":{"headline":"Toby Young’s indiscretions","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"So now we have Toby Young as martyr, penalised for past indiscretions and not allowed to turn over a new leaf with his work in education (‘Tory cronyism could not save his job’ … Young stands down despite PM’s backing, 10 January).

So it proves with A Ghost Story (Lionsgate, 12), David Lowery’s beautiful, confounding, time and space-bending tale of romantic devotion and longing – a casually inventive American indie that gradually belies its humble mumblecore beginnings. On the one hand, it delivers on the promise of its title to almost goofily literal effect: not only does leading man Casey Affleck play an actual ghost for the bulk of its running time, but one clad in the old-school white sheet of a million last-minute Halloween getups. It’s a nod to tradition that only underlines how far the film spirals from expectations in all other senses. After outlining a brittle living-world romance between Affleck and Rooney Mara’s midwestern hipsters, the film first jolts us with the former’s sudden death, before springing into an aching study of mutual mourning and loneliness in the dead and living parties alike. (Aptly, it all looks like a forgotten, sun-faded family album: the corners of the frame bevelled throughout, the colours restfully muted.) Lest you start expecting Whoopi Goldberg and Unchained Melody from this setup, all that is a mere prelude to something more elastic and cosmic in scope: a visual and sonic ode to the relentless passage of time. If that sounds affectedly fey, trust in the clear, clean, transporting nature of Lowery’s film-making. When Bafta announced its film award nominations this week, they were hailed as representing a banner year for British cinema, thanks to hefty coups for the big, brash likes of Dunkirk and Darkest Hour. Largely sidelined, however, were fresher voices from the independent fringes, among them Welsh-Zambian newcomer Rungano Nyoni, whose strange, sly, startling debut, I Am Not a Witch (Curzon Artificial Eye, 12), flashes as brazenly singular an aesthetic and storytelling style as Britfilm has seen in several years. Following the fortunes of an eight-year-old Zambian girl persecuted and exiled by her community for alleged witchcraft, it’s a heightened, surrealist fable, styled with sleek afropunk flair and streaked with blood-dark comedy, beneath which throbs a raw, very real anger over institutional corruption and socially embedded misogyny in modern-day Africa. After these richly idiosyncratic visions, there’s a certain curl-on-the-couch comfort to be had from the classical genre construction of It (Warner, 15), a surprisingly crisp, efficient adaptation of the first half of Stephen King’s dense horror opus. Delivering the expected killer-clown chills at a rattling rate, with a more sinuous psychological-creep factor than you’d expect from Hollywood’s current horror factory, Andy Muschietti’s film effectively milks much the same resource of 80s nightmare nostalgia as Stranger Things. You know what you’re getting, even as you shudder with uncertainty over what immediate scare lurks around the corner. Dina (Dogwoof, 15) was the documentary toast of last year’s Sundance film festival, but was never quite so warmly embraced elsewhere. That may be because Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini’s patient, affectionate suburban character study shifts tone with disquieting fluidity. Positioning itself as a heart-coddling triumph-over-adversity crowdpleaser, the film intimately follows a sprightly fortysomething woman with Asperger’s as she plans her wedding to her doting, likewise autistic boyfriend, before taking a sharp left into deeper, more anxious realms of abuse and trauma. Finally, to Netflix, where the first film in a far-too-long 18 years from Alison Maclean – director of the hangdog slacker gem Jesus’ Son – is now streaming after bypassing UK cinemas. The Rehearsal is a low-key but snakily intriguing comeback, returning Maclean to her native New Zealand: freely adapted from an early novel by Booker prize winner Eleanor Catton, it’s a life-versus-art psychodrama centred on a naive drama student (a fine James Rolleston) whose personal affairs become awkwardly entangled in the stage exploits of his peers and opportunistic teacher (Kerry Fox). The payoff to its tangy, simmering setup is deliberately, disconcertingly abrupt in a way that leaves the film more an amuse-bouche than a full meal, but it’s a thrill to have Maclean belatedly back, and on still playful form."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/21/guided-fell-running-coast-to-coast-route-cumbria-lake-district-yorkshire","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T06:30:13Z","webTitle":"Cross country: trail running the coast-to-coast route","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/21/guided-fell-running-coast-to-coast-route-cumbria-lake-district-yorkshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/21/guided-fell-running-coast-to-coast-route-cumbria-lake-district-yorkshire","fields":{"headline":"Cross country: trail running the coast-to-coast route","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Burning with exertion, I shuffle up the hillside, a sweaty mess. Beside me, the heather is also dripping – with morning drizzle. A fresh, Lakeland breeze envelops me as I climb out of the sheep-speckled valley, mud squelching under my feet. This is trail running in the fells – though right now the word “running” is a misnomer. Happily, Mark Sandamas of Coast To Coast Packhorse (pictured above, with the writer), a company that helps walkers and cyclists, as well as runners, to tackle the 192-mile coast-to-coast route, doesn’t consider my plodding gait a problem. “The beauty of trail running is that your pace is dictated by the changing landscape,” he tells me as we pause to drink in views of majestic Crummock Water far below. “You hike up steep sections to preserve energy, then let the brakes off and flow downhill.” I’ve come to the Lakes to run part of the route devised by fell walker and guidebook writer Alfred Wainwright in 1973. The trail runs from St Bees on the Irish Sea to Robin Hood’s Bay on the North Sea, traversing the Lake District, Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors. Long popular with walkers, the route is now opening up to a different kind of outdoor enthusiast: trail runners. This year, Coast to Coast Packhorse is offering guided running holidays along the entire route, with options of 10 days (averaging 19 miles a day) and 12 (averaging 16), as well as self-guided options. The first guided trip departs on 3 June, but I’ve joined Mark on a shorter soft launch. In four days, I’ll make it to just under halfway, to Kirkby Stephen, a total of 83 miles. I’m glad to learn that the trips are not all heads-down running: there are plenty of stops and easier options. You can hop in the van which also transports your bags, or hire a bike to cover more ground. “Trail running is accessible, requires little kit and immerses you in nature,” says Mark. “You don’t have to be a hard-core runner, just after adventure.” A challenge like this requires training. Mark recommends building up to running around 45 miles a week, including two back-to-back off-road runs of around 14 miles each. “The key is regular training, not high intensity. Following an intermediate half-marathon or marathon plan would get you to a sufficient level and build a good stamina base,” he says. Guided groups will have a maximum of 10 runners, plus a guide. We set off from St Bees, picking up a pebble for eventual deposit at Robin Hood’s Bay as tradition dictates, before striding up the towering red cliffs. We pass nesting puffins and the hulking St Bees lighthouse, Britain’s last to be fired by coal. Trotting on, we head east, with the weather at our backs as Wainwright intended. We wolf down a meat pie in Cleator, a former mining village, before hiking up Dent Fell for our first view of the Lake District mountains. Five hours and 16 miles later, we’re at the Shepherds Arms in Ennerdale for our first night. Accommodation is different every night, and includes a 17th-century inn in St Bees and a Quaker meeting place in Grasmere, but they all serve good food to power us up the hills. Jelly-legged and mud-splattered, I’m exhausted but feel a huge sense of satisfaction. I wolf down a steak-and-ale pie and a local beer, swapping stories with Mark and the two other (Australian) runners on the trip. Despite aching limbs and the prospect of doing it all again tomorrow, there’s a cheerful atmosphere, and I appreciate the camaraderie on tough sections the following day. Going that bit faster also means we have time to explore. On our second day, a lovely section skirting Ennerdale Water and passing Haystacks – the hill where Wainwright’s ashes were scattered – I arrive in Grasmere early enough to snatch an hour in the Wordsworth Museum. I’ve already toured the poet’s home, Dove Cottage, and found his gravestone in the churchyard before weary walkers appear. We splash through streams, clamber over stiles and jog past countless walkers, who stare curiously. While we bounce along in light trail shoes and small packs, they seem weighed down with heavy rucksacks and stiff walking boots. I run and stumble and trudge and walk, and all the while Mark points out landmarks and gives me tips to improve my downhill technique. “Look ahead, lean forwards and don’t overthink it,” he says. I switch off my brain and let my legs take control. Soon I’m picking up the pace and whooping as the scenery rushes by. As I hurtle downhill, a Lakeland panorama is unveiled, rugged green fells in golden sunlight. “Running here makes me feel like a millionaire,” Mark calls. I’m inclined to agree. Sweat, mud and all. • The trip was provided by Coast to Coast Packhorse (c2cpackhorse.co.uk), whose 12-day guided tours start on 3 June from £1,310.

Adela, a clown in a circus, and Miriam, an airport worker falsely accused of corruption, both fell victim to a social ecosystem that ruthlessly preys on the weak. We hear their stories through narrations that are bruised by the traumas they have survived. Miriam, along with her colleagues at Cancún airport, found herself separated from her child and imprisoned far from home. Her state-appointed lawyer explained that she was what was commonly referred to as “a payer” – someone who pays for the crimes of others. The prison, she discovered, was a “self-governing” facility, run by a cartel as a money-making racket. Adela, meanwhile, is haunted by the abduction of her teenage daughter 10 years before. The words of the women run through the film like still-fresh scars; they are superimposed over footage that gives a poetic resonance to the pathos of the stories. The lashing storms that give the film its evocative title are a potent visual metaphor throughout the picture.

They have also faced more demanding employers, whether head teachers, academy bosses or school inspectors. When the Guardian surveyed more than 4,000 teachers nearly two year ago, many blamed increased bureaucracy designed to measure pupil progress and their own performance as behind the rise in working hours. One told the Guardian: “I work 60 hours a week on average and still don’t feel like I’m doing a good enough job. If I want a life outside work I just get too exhausted.” At one primary school in Bristol, the remaining teachers – those not on sick leave due to stress – all quit at the end of the school year in July 2017. Is it worse for teachers than other professions or industries? Many modern careers are stressful. Teaching is unusual in being relatively safe in its working environment and job security but still high in stress. A YouGov survey commissioned by an education charity last year found 75% of teachers in the UK reporting symptoms of stress – including depression, anxiety and panic attack – compared with just 62% of the working population as a whole. Suicide risks for primary and nursery school teachers in England was 42% higher than in the general population between 2011 to 2015, according to the Office of National Statistics. Some 102 suicides were recorded as primary and nursery schoolteachers in the period. What do teachers want? Many teachers blame efforts to please the Ofsted school inspectorate as a significant cause of the increased stress. In recent years unions have identified some time-wasting practices, such as “triple marking” of school books to measure pupil attainment. But many also say the pressure to perform under the threat of poor Ofsted ratings is another cause of high stress, as well as the government’s league tables that rank schools by exam results and can be used to punish school leaders if they fall below certain levels. The rapid pace of policy changes introduced by the Department for Education in recent years has also been blamed, especially the overhaul of A-level and GCSE exams that has seen new courses and curriculum introduced, as has key stage one and key stage two tests in primary school. What is the government doing? The Department for Education argues it is supporting schools to reduce unnecessary workload, and has pledged to give schools and teachers longer notice of policy changes. Meanwhile, Ofsted has made strenuous efforts to puncture myths that it requires specific types of marking or teaching within classes, and no longer grades individual teachers during inspections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/10/how-best-to-ensure-the-future-of-the-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T19:52:51Z","webTitle":"How best to ensure the future of the NHS | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/10/how-best-to-ensure-the-future-of-the-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/10/how-best-to-ensure-the-future-of-the-nhs","fields":{"headline":"How best to ensure the future of the NHS","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Polly Toynbee (Opinion, 9 January) refers to a “sinister phalanx of Tory lobbies” pressing for “a royal commission on NHS funding”, with ourselves at the head – with a secret agenda to “demolish” the principle of a universal health service. This is impressively wrong. The call by Maurice Saatchi – the chairman of our thinktank – for a royal commission has been echoed by many medical professionals, as well as such non-Tory figures as Alan Milburn and Norman Lamb, both former health ministers. Our proposal states explicitly and repeatedly that the founding principles of the NHS must be respected, and fully accepts that additional funding will be needed: all we ask is that the commission examines alternatives for this beyond general taxation, for the simple reason that the public will almost certainly be reluctant, or simply unable, to pay the colossal amounts required on current trends. Nor is our proposal limited to NHS funding alone, as Polly also suggests: we argue that a royal commission should examine the alarming gap in health outcomes between rich and poor, the linkages between health and social care, the case for and against greater private sector involvement, and so on. There are millions who do not have the choice to opt out. We owe it to them to work out what the NHS could be doing better – and to put it on a sustainable footing for the coming decades. Robert Colvile Director, Centre for Policy Studies • “I want to help people feel better when they are at their most vulnerable.” This is perhaps the most frequently used phrase at medical school interviews. Thousands of prospective medical students who apply each year to our medical schools are expressing their motivation to help and contribute. They have a deep desire to better the society in which they live, to bring relief to pain and suffering and to care for the people who need it the most. They are committed to this cause because their ambitions are sincere. Now, as the NHS faces one of its toughest winters yet, we students are shocked by what we see. We look at our colleagues working desperately hard in a struggling system, we see how they despair as they see patients being failed. Longer trolley waits, delayed discharges and cancelled operations. No one can deny the deep sense of loss of hope for a future spent in a fulfilling career where there’s adequate time and resources to look after patients in the way they deserve. As the doctors of the future, our ask is simple. It’s for a system where we can offer patients dignity and hope, and fulfil the dreams that made us embark on this journey.

The prime minister did not move any cabinet minister with frontline Brexit responsibilities. Nor did she even attempt to. The pro-Brexit trio of David Davis, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove all remained in post, as did Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd from the pro-European side. David Lidington’s promotion gave Mrs May a pro-European consigliere to replace the pro-European Damian Green. In broad essentials the Brexit balance is unchanged. Indeed if the reshuffle had a coherent original purpose it was specifically not to do with Brexit at all. The shake-up was supposed to signal that this government has goals other than Brexit, mainly bread-and-butter domestic ones that may attract hard-pressed voters – for example in health, education and housing – and that there are new ministers ready, willing and able to reach them. In the event, the reshuffle was a botched job, which has drawn attention to Mrs May’s weaknesses and not her strengths, real or imagined. It was a surprise that Jeremy Corbyn did not make more of this weakness in the first prime minister’s questions of the new year on Wednesday. Yet a political killer instinct of that sort is not the Labour leader’s style. He preferred to attack the state of the National Health Service – understandably in many ways, of course, since the health crisis is profound and it is rising fast up the list of the public’s concerns. Just as the non-barking dog is the key fact in the Sherlock Holmes story, so the absence of Brexit is the key deceit in the reshuffle. This government will be judged on many things, but it will stand or fall in 2018 by its handling of the Brexit talks. The fact that Mrs May did not use the reshuffle to push more determinedly towards her preferred Brexit outcome is an eloquent fact. It proclaims one of two things: either that she still does not know her preferred course; or that she is too weak to enforce it within her divided party and government. Quite possibly it proclaims both of these things together. The consequence is that 2018 is beginning as 2017 ended – with ministers pretending to themselves and to the public that much more is in play over Brexit than is in fact the case. Yet the completion of phase one of the Brexit talks last month involved large choices by Mrs May whose significance has still not been fully understood. In particular, by agreeing that the Irish border will remain soft – and accepting that this agreement will be binding – she has chosen to take Britain down a path that could, and should, lead to a soft Brexit. Politically, Mrs May is reluctant to spell this out, and even to face it herself. Perhaps that will change when she makes her next keynote speech on Brexit, possibly next month. If she does, however, it would be a break with all her past practice. Experience says she will use her own form of Brexit doublespeak for as long as she can get away with it. She will pretend that the agreement she hopes for this year will be a detailed deal (no chance), that the subsequent transition period is for implementation (it is for negotiation) and that the UK will leave the single market and customs union for good, while retaining all the advantages of both (dream on). This week, ministers are still playing this same game. Mr Davis and Mr Hammond were in Germany on Wednesday trying to get a cherry-picking deal that the EU and the Germans have consistently said is not on offer. Mr Davis moans that the EU warns of the perils of a “no deal” outcome even though the UK government itself still treats this as an option. Mrs May has survived until now by pretending that Brexit is one thing when in fact it is another. In the same manner she has started 2018 by pretending that Brexit is sorted when in fact it is not. Yet be in no doubt. This is the year when the fantasy collides with the facts. This dog will both bark and bite. Neither Mrs May nor anyone else should pretend otherwise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/11/london-schools-cricketing-mission","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T10:00:17Z","webTitle":"London Schools reforms after scandal and revitalises cricketing mission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/11/london-schools-cricketing-mission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/11/london-schools-cricketing-mission","fields":{"headline":"London Schools reforms after scandal and revitalises cricketing mission","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"For 92 years the London Schools Cricket Association has been a grand, slightly rickety sporting charity, its mission to promote cricket in the London area and bring the game to those outside an increasingly narrow county system. Unlike quite a few good ideas, this one actually works. Two of England’s last three all-format captains, Alastair Cook and Eoin Morgan, played for London Schools. Denis Compton played for London Schools. As did Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst, although only Hurst ever made it into county cricket, the hammer of West Germany famously scoring 0 and 0 not out in his only match for Essex. The list goes on. One of English cricket’s great friendships, the John Emburey‑Graham Gooch axis of the 1980s, a kind of white-flannel Charles and Sebastian of its time, was forged on a London Schools tour of Zambia and Kenya. Mike Selvey, once of Middlesex, England and these pages, got his first real step-up on an LSCA tour of India, where he opened the bowling to a teenaged Sunil Gavaskar. To this day hundreds of London kids train all winter and spend summers playing against minor and major counties, in the process bringing what was once the national summer sport into places from which it has now retreated. The England and Wales Cricket Board has just spent a great deal of money on Lord Patel’s consultation into “engaging with the south Asian community”. London Schools continues to do this as a matter of course. This is a place where cricket is vibrantly alive. Which is a good thing too because for a while last year the LSCA looked on the verge of winking out of existence altogether. It has been a deeply troubled 14 months, beginning with the news that a previous LSCA committee had employed Wasim Aslam – formerly known as Wasim Majid and a convicted child sex offender – as fixtures secretary. The Guardian subsequently reported this had taken place with the written approval of the ECB’s then-welfare officers, on the condition the individual concerned had no contact with children. This never made much sense given the LSCA is concerned solely with children’s cricket. In the event the individual concerned ended up attending LSCA festivals as an organiser, an appalling misjudgment. The backlash was entirely deserved. So London Schools entered a netherworld. Various counties turned their backs. The ECB eventually withdrew its endorsement, advising counties not to engage with the LSCA at all. At which point that was pretty much that. To all intents and purposes the alma mater of Cook, Gooch, Compton, Hurst, Moore and Godleman was frozen in carbonite, defunct, a pariah organisation. Fast forward six months and the picture has changed. A group of concerned individuals, some former LSCA players, most with children who play in the system, have intervened. At the end of a lengthy and at times difficult process every position of authority in the organisation has been scoured out. So enter the new guard. Selvey has agreed to stand as the new president. Paul Weekes, also former LSCA and Middlesex, will act as an ambassador for the coaching department. The author of this article is on the new LSCA committee as communications officer. The ECB has been stern but supportive. The chairman, Tom Harrison, has followed the process at arm’s length. Towards Christmas the dam finally broke with a new instruction that the ECB would now support full engagement with LSCA under the new regime. “I am very pleased to report that LSCA have undertaken wholesale reform of their management and government functions,” Harrison, wrote in an email to the counties. “I am now writing to you to rescind the previous concerns and I hope that you will now be able to resurrect your previous positive relationships with LSCA.” For London Schools, and for the hundreds of kids who get exposure to high-level cricket through the system, it is both a huge relief and, in effect, a moment of resurrection. In the words of Selvey: “The ECB has been very thorough, quite rightly, in demanding complete change, both in personnel and procedure. As aformer London Schools player I am delighted to come in to the new organisation and see this in action. London Schools is all about giving city kids access to a high standard of cricket. With the ECB’s help we can now get back to focusing on just that.” This is of course a timely topic generally. The latest TV rights deal has shored up the money sloshing around the elite but the ECB is right to be concerned about shrinking participation, a narrowing demographic and the dying away of the game in schools. Twenty-five years ago England fielded a World Cup final team with two players, Chris Lewis and Phil DeFreitas, from the same London comprehensive. This could not happen now. It is not a London issue: the sport is invisible in many urban areas. London Schools and organisations like it everywhere have a role to play in fighting against this drift. If the LSCA owes a debt of gratitude to the ECB for its survival, just carrying out its normal duties should repay this several times over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/21/randy-newman-trump-ivanka-song-toy-story-smiths","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T12:00:20Z","webTitle":"Randy Newman: ‘I've written a song about Trump and Ivanka – but it needs a little work’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/21/randy-newman-trump-ivanka-song-toy-story-smiths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/21/randy-newman-trump-ivanka-song-toy-story-smiths","fields":{"headline":"Randy Newman: ‘I've written a song about Trump and Ivanka – but it needs a little work’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The prospect of lunch with Randy Newman straddles the line between exciting and scary. He’s one of the great American songwriters, no question, but from a distance he seems intimidating. His work is brainy and funny, but can also be brutal. Famously, he offended an entire subset of the human race in his most commercially successful song, Short People, which railed against their “little noses”, “tiny little teeth” and the “platform shoes on their nasty little feet”. As any Newman-ologist (and the man himself) will tell you, the kerfuffle over those particular lyrics was rooted in a misunderstanding about the nature of his songwriting. While most members of the craft approach it from the first-person perspective, Newman usually writes in the voice of a narrator, often a person only their mother could love. It’s a simple, liberating device but it has caused endless confusion. This is all very unfair but still, here I am, walking through the door of Locanda Portofino, an Italian restaurant in Santa Monica, far from the tourist hustle of the Californian beach and the Third Street Promenade. I am 15 minutes early and nervous. The surroundings are cosy but hardly grand, the welcome is noticeably warm. “I’m meeting Randy Newman,’’ I say. The waiter’s friendliness broadens into a full-blown smile. “Ah, Mr Newman!” Suddenly, the prospect of lunch grows a little less intimidating. Right on cue, Newman arrives. He is hobbling just a little. Having just finished the US leg of a tour to promote his latest album, Dark Matter, all that travel has taken a toll and he hopes to schedule a knee replacement operation before his forthcoming European tour, which includes shows in Edinburgh, Gateshead, Dublin and London. (Since this interview took place, the knee condition has forced Newman to cancel the tour.) He sits down and smiles. “I live nearby and it’s a friendly place,’’ he says when I ask him why he picked this particular restaurant. “And the food is really good.” I start with a question about money, prompted by my young son’s suggestion that writing songs for Toy Story must have made Newman “really, really rich”. Indeed, one Canadian website estimated his wealth at $100 million. He laughs. “That’s way out, trust me. I’ve no idea where they got that one from. Might have been someone who wanted to get me into trouble with the taxman.” He’s been working on the soundtrack for Toy Story 4, so it’s safe to assume he’s doing pretty well? “When I look at the [royalty] statement it doesn’t seemed to have dropped that much from two or three years ago or even four or five years ago,’’ he says. “I’ll probably get paid more for Toy Story 4 than Toy Story 1, but maybe a bit less than I did for two and three. That’s just the way the industry has gone.” We spend some time discussing the impact streaming services such as Spotify have had on musicians’ income, as well as commiserating about the late Leonard Cohen, who went back on tour at the age of 77 after being left virtually penniless by a former manager whom he successfully sued for stealing $5 million. Newman is hitting the road by choice. “There’s people out there applauding and I like it,’’ he says. He is accompanied on the road by his manager. There’s no band on stage, just Newman and a piano: “I don’t have the same connection with the audience. When I’m playing by myself I can hear people rustling over here or coughing over there. If I’m playing ballads and they are shuffling around, I won’t play as many ballads.” We order – burrata prosciutto to share, carbonara with white truffle for Newman and for me, on his recommendation, penne vodka (pasta, cream, tomatoes and a generous amount of vodka). While we are waiting for the food to arrive, the conversation turns to all things British. He has a passable knowledge of Scottish football. “Celtic and Rangers, right? It’s kind of crazy, I believe.” “Occasionally,” I tell him. He’s also a huge fan of the Smiths and the kitchen-sink dramas of the 1960s that inspired the band’s aesthetic – Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, The L-Shaped Room, This Sporting Life. Like most Smiths fans, he’s distressed to hear that Morrissey’s political views appear to have taken a rightward turn. “Shame. He’s one of the great lyricists.” High praise from someone who writes with a wit and intelligence that few others have matched. Newman is a skilled musician, the scion of a Hollywood musical dynasty – his uncle and childhood mentor Alfred Newman scored more than 200 movies during Hollywood’s golden age, winning nine Oscars – but he sides with those who argue he is a better lyricist than tunesmith. “My lyrics are definitely more distinctly different,’’ he says, breaking out a verse from 2012’s I’m Dreaming of a White President, his sarcastic retort to the racist, anti-Obama birther movement: “I’m dreaming of a white President Just like the ones we’ve always had A real live white man Who knows the score How to handle money or start a war Wouldn’t even have to tell me what we were fighting for He’d be the right man If he were a white man” (It’s quite something to have Randy Newman sing you one of his own songs over lunch.) Newman ends the serenade with a shrug. “Pretty strong, huh,’’ he says. “I think I get it from my dad, who was a doctor but wrote songs his whole life. They were old-fashioned songs, even for the 1940s and 50s, but he wrote good lyrics. He was real good but he was born too late.” Songwriting was a hobby for Newman senior but it’s been a 50-year career for his son, even if it hasn’t always been a labour of love. He only releases an album, on average, around every eight and a half years, in part because he finds the songwriting process to be a form of torture against which his only protection is a strict work schedule. “Eight till five if I’m doing a movie, eight till noon if I’m writing songs,’’ he says. “When they cared if an artist released a record a year they would have someone sit at the door so I would stay in the room. I’m just sitting at the piano, trying to find something I can get a ride on. You tell yourself, get in there and put in four hours, just hang in. What else you got to do? If nothing happens, nothing happens. But it is a long four hours when nothing happens. “Even after all the things I’ve done in terms of quantity I don’t have confidence I could do more, and I always have a really good excuse why it is going to be a disaster. I never liked the process and I am 74, so I’m not so sure I will continue to do it.” It is hard to imagine Newman abandoning his craft, not least because he is an artist whose creative urges appeared to have intensified with the age. He is an avid consumer of news – “I go to bed with political podcasts. It drives my wife crazy” – and in this age of American madness, his country needs him at least to offer satirical relief amid the craziness. He did write a song about Trump before the election but left it off Dark Matter because he concluded it was just too vulgar. “But I’ve got this other idea, one with a girl protagonist, let’s call her Ivanka, and she could be singing, ‘Dear Daddy … but I have been wondering lately if you know what’s real, I sometimes think … da-de-da … do you know that you are fucking crazy?’ “I don’t know. Something like that. I need to do a little work on it.” He does. And the smart money says he will.

Williams has been out of action with a groin/hernia injury sustained in Wales’s win against Georgia on 18 November but has taken a full part in training this week and provided he encounters no adverse reaction he will line up for the two-times European champions in Swansea. “He’s available for selection,” the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said. “It was a hernia, groin issue and those things can be complicated. You don’t know really how long it’s going to be. We’ve taken our time but he looks pretty good. Today and tomorrow he needs to make sure there’s not a reaction to today. “It’s always a calculated gamble to bring someone back who hasn’t played for a bit but I think you do have the odd exceptional player who is able to do that and is good enough for you to want to put that player in. Liam is probably in that category. He’s an exceptional player and it’s great to get him back just before he’ll go away again [with Wales].” With George North (knee) and Hallam Amos (ankle) unlikely to be fit for Wales’s Six Nations opener against Scotland on 3 February, the return of Williams will be welcomed by Gatland, particularly with Leigh Halfpenny a doubt for the Scarlets against Bath on Friday. Gatland is already without Dan Lydiate, who was ruled out for the rest of the season on Tuesday, as well as Williams’s fellow 2017 Lions Sam Warburton, Taulupe Faletau and Jonathan Davies. For Saracens, the return of Williams, who has three tries in his two European appearances this season, is just as significant, considering they are third in their pool, two points behind the Ospreys and seven behind Clermont. Last weekend they were boosted by the returns of Billy Vunipola and Maro Itoje in an imperious victory at Wasps, however, and against the Ospreys McCall will be close to having a full contingent to choose from, though Duncan Taylor misses out with another head injury. “It’s the first time for a few years we’ve been in a fifth pool match where everything is on the line,” said McCall, whose side lost their record 20-match unbeaten run in Europe at home to Clermont last month. “It’s a new experience for us even to be in that position so early in the competition. If we win we’ve got a chance of getting to the quarter-finals.” The former England international Matt Banahan will join Gloucester next season after 12 years at Bath. Gloucester’s director of rugby, David Humphreys, said: “His versatility and ability to play in a number of positions across the backline adds real depth to our squad.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/10/new-york-city-plans-to-divest-5bn-from-fossil-fuels-and-sue-oil-companies","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T18:35:49Z","webTitle":"New York City plans to divest $5bn from fossil fuels and sue oil companies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/new-york-city-plans-to-divest-5bn-from-fossil-fuels-and-sue-oil-companies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/new-york-city-plans-to-divest-5bn-from-fossil-fuels-and-sue-oil-companies","fields":{"headline":"New York City plans to divest $5bn from fossil fuels and sue oil companies","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New York City is seeking to lead the assault on climate change and the Trump administration with a plan to divest $5bn from fossil fuels and sue the world’s most powerful oil companies over their contribution to dangerous global warming. City officials have set a goal of divesting New York’s $189bn pension funds from fossil fuel companies within five years in what they say would be “among the most significant divestment efforts in the world to date”. Currently, New York City’s five pension funds have about $5bn in fossil fuel investments. New York state has already announced it is exploring how to divest from fossil fuels. “New York City is standing up for future generations by becoming the first major US city to divest our pension funds from fossil fuels,” said Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor. “At the same time, we’re bringing the fight against climate change straight to the fossil fuel companies that knew about its effects and intentionally misled the public to protect their profits. As climate change continues to worsen, it’s up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient.” De Blasio said that the city is taking the five fossil fuel firms – BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell – to federal court due to their contribution to climate change. Court documents state that New York has suffered from flooding and erosion due to climate change and because of looming future threats it is seeking to “shift the costs of protecting the city from climate change impacts back on to the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat”. The court filing claims that just 100 fossil fuel producers are responsible for nearly two-thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution, with the five targeted companies the largest contributors. The case will also point to evidence that firms such as Exxon knew of the impact of climate change for decades, only to downplay and even deny this in public. New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is investigating Exxon over this alleged deception. New York was badly rattled by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and faces costs escalating into the tens of billions of dollars in order to protect low-lying areas such as lower Manhattan and the area around JFK airport from being inundated by further severe storms fueled by rising sea levels and atmospheric warming. De Blasio’s office said climate change is “perhaps the toughest challenge New York City will face in the coming decades”. New York’s lawsuit echoes a similar effort on the west coast, where two California counties and a city are suing 37 fossil fuel companies for knowingly emitting dangerous levels of greenhouse gases. One of those firms, Exxon, has complained that it has been targeted by a “collection of special interests and opportunistic politicians” as part of a “conspiracy” to force the company to comply with various political objectives. The legal action and the divestment draw perhaps the starkest dividing line yet between New York and the Trump administration on climate change. Under Trump, the federal government has attempted the withdraw the US from the Paris climate accords, tear up Barack Obama’s signature climate policies and open up vast areas of America’s land and waters to coal, oil and gas interests. De Blasio and the city comptroller, Scott Stringer, have come under pressure for several years from activists to rid New York’s pension funds of any link to fossil fuels, with some environmentalists claiming the city has been too slow to use its clout to tackle climate change. Stringer admitted the divestment will be “complex” and will take some time but said the city’s pension funds could promote sustainability while also protecting the retirement of teachers, police officers and other city workers. “New York City today becomes a capital of the fight against climate change on this planet,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate group 350.org. “With its communities exceptionally vulnerable to a rising sea, the city is showing the spirit for which it’s famous – it’s not pretending that working with the fossil fuel companies will somehow save the day, but instead standing up to them, in the financial markets and in court.” Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief and architect of the Paris climate agreement, added: “The exponential transition toward a fossil-fuel-free economy is unstoppable and local governments have a critical role to play. There is no time to lose. “It’s therefore extremely encouraging to see NYC step up today.” New York joins cities such as Washington DC and Cape Town in divesting, along with universities such as Stanford in California and Oxford in the UK. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, notable for its links to the past oil wealth of John D Rockefeller, has also sought to divest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/14/david-ramirez-were-not-going-anywhere-review-resonant-defiance","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T08:00:21Z","webTitle":"David Ramirez: We’re Not Going Anywhere review – resonant defiance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/14/david-ramirez-were-not-going-anywhere-review-resonant-defiance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/14/david-ramirez-were-not-going-anywhere-review-resonant-defiance","fields":{"headline":"David Ramirez: We’re Not Going Anywhere review – resonant defiance","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"On the face of it, Texas singer-songwriter David Ramirez’s third album title suggests the anomie of small town Americana, all shut factories and thwarted Bruce Springsteen escapes.

LGBT women interviewed by Human Rights Watch (HRW) said they had been beaten, evicted from their homes and ostracised by their communities. Many struggled to find accommodation and employment. Wendy Isaack, who researched and wrote an HRW report on the subject published this week, said family members rarely rounded on men in the same way. “Often when people say they are documenting human rights abuses of LGBT people they primarily focus on gay men and they don’t tell women’s stories and the violence that women face in their homes, in a place they are supposed to feel safe and protected. This was our most troubling find,” she said. “Because they are women, you have a number of factors at work: you have the patriarchy, you have the need to control women’s bodies and what decisions women make with their bodies and their minds. That, coming together with sexual orientation, puts women at higher risk of domestic violence. “In fact, none of the gay men I interviewed reported violence from family members. Not a single one of them.” Although Ghana has a comprehensive law on domestic violence, a fear of the 1960 Criminal Offences Act, which is interpreted as criminalising gay sex, serves as a barrier to seeking justice. The law has created a climate in which discrimination against LGBT people is the norm, said the report. A lesbian couple, Dorothy and Emily, said they were attacked by a mob in their village in the Ashanti region of southern Ghana, after Emily’s mother revealed their sexuality to the community. “About 20 to 25 people came into the room,” said Dorothy. “[My partner] was naked, her mother told her to get dressed. One of the guys took a cutlass from the house, wanted to put it on my vagina. We struggled and he burnt my stomach with a piece of hot steel. They managed to cut [my partner] on the face. There was a major hole and she was bleeding. The crowd wanted to kill both of us.” The women were forced to leave their home without reporting the incident to the police. A neighbour who initially offered them shelter and money to pay for hospital care later demanded sex, leaving the couple homeless. “We don’t have jobs now, so we are forced to do things we don’t want to do. We must have sex with men to survive – we have no family, no money, nothing.” Unemployment caused by a person’s sexual orientation is a significant problem, the report found. Those interviewed often referenced sex work as their only option. Teresa, 28, told HRW that LGBT people in Accra, where she lives, can’t get work. She said: “Nobody wants to give them jobs. Also, when the family finds out, they don’t pay your school fees, so you are uneducated. There is also no support to learn a trade. When both lesbian partners don’t work, the femme partner is expected to date and sleep with men to get money — sometimes they both must do sex work to survive.” Other lesbian and bisexual women in Ghana have little choice but to marry men because of family pressures. Upon discovering their 25-year-old daughter was in a relationship with a woman, Hasina’s parents accepted 1,800 cedis from a 49-year old man who wanted to marry her. Ghana is a liberal democracy that prizes fundamental human rights, yet it has repeatedly rejected calls by UN bodies to repeal the Criminal Offences Act against “unnatural carnal knowledge”, said HRW, who described the country as one of “profound contradictions”. Unlike other African states, Ghana has not moved to increase penalties against gay people. • This article was amended on 11 January 2018 to alter a reference to the Criminal Offences Act of 1960 as “colonial era”. Ghana gained independence in 1957."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/discussing-inheritance-is-too-important-to-be-left-until-someone-has-died","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T06:44:51Z","webTitle":"Discussing inheritance is too important to be left until someone has died","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/discussing-inheritance-is-too-important-to-be-left-until-someone-has-died","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/13/discussing-inheritance-is-too-important-to-be-left-until-someone-has-died","fields":{"headline":"Discussing inheritance is too important to be left until someone has died","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Inheritance, a fantastically awkward familial topic during life and after death, can ease – or cause – serious stress. It is never convenient to discuss taxes and wills with your dad, or reveal to your aunt that you are not that interested in the heirlooms that have been in the family for, oh, centuries. But, then again, squabbling with your siblings over the silver after the funeral doesn’t seem appealing either. It is all strange and morbid because, whenever you have it, the conversation about inheritance is predicated on one ominous certainty: that the people we love are going to die. I don’t know if a guidebook on inheritance etiquette exists, but with research suggesting that millennials are set to inherit more than any postwar generation, perhaps now is the time to publish one. Data from the Resolution Foundation revealed that inheritable wealth for those currently aged 20-35 will double in the next two decades, reaching an all-time peak in 2035. The biggest catch is that the average age at which most people will benefit is 61. The report also highlighted that this mega transfer of wealth will further entrench societal inequality in our lifetimes; people tend to couple up with those of a similar financial background, and more than 80% of millennials who already own their home have parents who are homeowners, whereas nearly half of non-homeowning millennials have parents who don’t own their homes. For many, then, this news won’t affect them in the slightest. The report indicated that about a third will have no property wealth to inherit and those of us who do will find that it comes far too late to alleviate life’s biggest financial burdens – children and houses. Saying that, inheritance should be a topic raised by families while they are still alive, to reduce the risk of post-funeral family feuding and provide clarity concerning parental wishes and plans. It is a shame that so many of us find it all too awkward. I remember the knotted dread that bound my stomach aged eight or so, when my grandparents sat my dad, his siblings and us kids down on the sofa to explain their thoughts when it came to divvying up their items. Back then, the idea of existing without any of them felt uncertain and hazy, like a mirage. Then, many years later, before my father got sick and the tornado of all that was yet to happen to us was just a grey dot on a distant horizon, he used to joke about me and my brother inheriting our small, suburban home when he wanted a favour around the house. “This will all be yours when I’m gooooone,” he would boom in a mock-ghoulish tone, dragging out the vowels for dramatic effect. He would smile and say: “So you better practice looking after it now.” He even managed to keep up the old joke after his terminal diagnosis. It felt insanely ridiculous – even insulting to him at times – to discuss something as trivial as money when he was battling a venomous cancer, but I know it gave him great comfort to ensure that everything was in place for me, my mum and my brother after he died. I realise how lucky I am that I had such a caring and conscientious father, who spent most of his life planning ahead for my benefit. I have noticed recently, though, that other friends who have sick or elderly parents are also starting to have difficult conversations about money – but this shouldn’t just be done in the face of death, we should start while we are all alive and well. Finances are often a taboo topic among families, and approaching inheritance the wrong way can come across as disrespectful and pushy at best – and at worst, it can obliterate relationships. However, research such as that from the Resolution Foundation, could help to spark important discussions about inheritance now, before it is too late. @GeorginaLawton"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/09/manchester-city-v-bristol-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T21:47:56Z","webTitle":"Manchester City 2-1 Bristol City: Carabao Cup semi-final first leg – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/09/manchester-city-v-bristol-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/09/manchester-city-v-bristol-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City 2-1 Bristol City: Carabao Cup semi-final first leg – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And that’s that! Aguero’s winner is the last act of a highly entertaining David-versus-Goliath battle. Bristol City would have taken this result at the start of the evening, but it’ll sting right now. On the touchline, Pep Guardiola theatrically congratulates Lee Johnson for his team’s performance. It’s a bittersweet moment for the Bristol City boss; his side were magnificent tonight and he’s earned that praise from one of the most successful managers in the game. But they need to win at Ashton Gate in the second leg now. Having gone toe to toe with the runaway Premier League leaders, pushing them to the limit, Bristol City will still think that they can do something special in a fortnight’s time. But how close they were to a very precious result tonight! Heartbreak for Bristol City! The hosts stay patient, pinging the ball around the edge of the box. Suddenly, out on the right, Bernardo Silva curls a delicious cross into the box. It’s falling onto Aguero’s head, 12 yards out. Fielding comes, but can’t get there. Aguero rises and glances a header into the middle of the empty net! 90 min: Bristol City are pinned back in their own area again. Walker and De Bruyne probe with great insistence down the right, again and again, but there’s no way in. Sterling opts to put his head down and run down the same wing like the clappers. He reaches the byline and pulls back, but can’t find a blue shirt. Bristol City hack clear. There’s going to be three added minutes. 88 min: Paterson finds a little bit of space to the right of the Manchester City box. He can’t get a shot away. But Bristol City come again, and the hosts are unable to clear a high ball. It drops to Walsh, just to the right of goal, 12 yards out. He attempts a no-backlift whack into the top right, but slices it high and wide right. 87 min: De Bruyne suddenly bursts down the inside-right channel and into a small pocket of space. Enough space to line up a shot from the edge of the box. He lashes a stunning shot towards the bottom left; it’s deflected an inch wide of the post. De Bruyne takes the resulting corner himself, but he seriously overcooks it and the danger is gone. 85 min: Stones faffs around 30 yards from his own goal, and is very nearly stripped of the ball by the brilliant Reid. The striker would have been free on goal. So nearly so very careless. 84 min: Manchester City pin the visitors back in their own area. This really is defence versus attack. Walker probes down the right side, Danilo down the left. Sterling buzzes around. But Bristol City hold their shape and there’s no way through. 82 min: But Bristol City keep on the front foot. Out on the right, Wright flicks a ball inside for Brownhill, who helps it on to Reid. An ambitious effort to curl one across Bravo and into the top left goes all wrong. But the clock ticks on. Bristol City can see the finishing line now. The next ten minutes or so will seem like ten years to the Championship side. 81 min: A throw for Bristol City deep in Manchester City territory down the right. Brownhill flings it into the area. Mangala is forced to concede a corner. Nothing comes of it. 80 min: Walker comes on for Zinchenko. 78 min: Danilo powers down the right but can’t force his way into the Bristol City box. The visitors have recovered their equilibrium since rocking in the immediate wake of conceding. Manchester City’s fans are getting a little frustrated. 76 min: De Bruyne tries to trick a way through a packed Bristol City defence with a flick down the inside left. Sane doesn’t read the clever dink and the ball bounces through to Fielding. 74 min: Manchester City’s desperation betrays them for the first time, Gundogan trying his luck from 30 yards. The ball flies 30 yards high and wide. Pep Guardiola springs off the bench, presumably to tell his players to calm down. Plenty of time left for the victory they desperately desire. 73 min: Liam Walsh, Bristol City’s new signing from Everton, comes on for Magnusson. 70 min: Aguero comes on for Toure. 69 min: De Bruyne turns on the gas down the right and reaches the byline, cutting a ball back for Sterling who smashes straight at Fielding. Then another wave of attack as Sane glides down the inside-left channel before teasing as low diagonal effort wide right of the goal. 67 min: Manchester City win a corner down the left as Wright denies Sane space with a last-ditch defensive header. The corner’s cleared, and soon enough Reid is battling with last-man Danilo, high up the pitch in Manchester City’s half. Danilo very nearly loses possession dangerously, but a trick later sees him wander away from bother. The chances of this ending 1-1 have to be quite slim. 66 min: It may just be that the best form of defence for Bristol City is attack. Reid, Paterson and Brownhill are all involved in some crisp and confident triangulation down the middle. A lovely sweeping move which ends when Magnusson is caught offside down the left. 64 min: A little respite for Bristol City as Paterson beats Zinchenko down the right. But his low cross, bumped into the area in the hope of finding Reid, is easily snaffled by Bravo. 63 min: A couple of corners for Manchester City; a lot of concern for Bristol City. They can’t get out of their final third right now. They just about deal with the set pieces. 61 min: Sane loops the free kick into the mixer. Fielding goes down to gather and makes a mess of it. The ball nearly drops to Toure. Eventually, after some rat-a-tat pinball, Bristol City hack clear. But they are seriously on the ropes now. 60 min: But now Bryan is booked. Sane, free on the left, crosses too deep. De Bruyne tries to recycle the ball to the right of the box, and is high-kicked to the floor by Bryan. Wild. A no-brainer of a yellow card, in more ways than one. 59 min: Bristol City have suddenly lost their heads a little bit. Bryan is very fortunate not to become the third of their team to go into the book in short order, coming through the back of Sterling in the midfield. The referee thinks a stern chat will suffice. 58 min: Before the free kick is taken, Smith is booked for faffing around in the box. Eventually De Bruyne slams the ball into the wall. Bristol City clear. 57 min: De Bruyne races straight at a backtracking Flint, and clanks into him on the edge of the Bristol City area. Free kick, and a booking for Flint. This is a very dangerous position for Manchester City. These are very dangerous times for Bristol City. Scratch that: they were holding their own. In a flash, Bristol City’s lead is gone. De Bruyne strides down the inside-right channel. He slips the ball to Sterling on his outside. Sterling could shoot from a tight angle in the box, but pulls the ball back instead, a return pass which De Bruyne lashes into the top right! 53 min: Sterling very nearly circumvents Magnusson down the right, but the Bristol City full back is determined to hold his ground and eventually manages it. The visitors are under pressure - not quite under siege yet - and they’re holding their own. So far. 51 min: Mangala gets his feet in a tangle and concedes a corner. Flint very nearly gets a header on target, six yards out, but the hosts clear and go on the quick break. Pack should deal with the danger in the centre circle, but is way too elaborate and allows Sterling to race off with the ball. Sterling makes it to the area, and shoots from a position on the left. Fielding parries bravely and the danger is eventually mopped up. 50 min: De Bruyne, central and homing in on the Bristol City area, slips a ball to Sane on the left. Sane looks to fire a low diagonal shot into the bottom right, but his effort drifts well wide of the target. 49 min: Danilo romps down the right and into the area. He shoots from a tight angle, but Fielding holds onto the ball well. 48 min: Sterling slides in from the right and very nearly threads a diagonal ball to release Sane into the area on the left. Wright reads the danger brilliantly and hooks away. 46 min: Sterling makes off immediately down the right and wins a corner. Stones gets his head to De Bruyne’s delivery, but he’s been a-pushin’ and a-shovin’, and the referee has a good hard parp of his whistle. And we’re off again! A freshly bollocked Manchester City get the ball rolling for the second half. There have been no half-time changes to either side. “Flint’s crossbar-shaving clearance to rob Sterling proves Pep Guardiola right,” argues Peter Oh. “Bristol are indeed a tall, tall team!” Half-time reading: Well, well, well. 45 min +1: Manchester City very nearly equalise, but are denied by a wonderful goalline clearance from Flint! Sterling is sent scampering into space down the inside-right channel, and into the box. He draws Fielding and chips over the keeper. The ball’s floating into the net, but Flint gets back on the line and eyebrows a stunning saving header over the bar! The resulting corner comes to nothing. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. The visiting fans are going wild! Reid tucks the ball into the bottom left! Bravo guessed right, but couldn’t get a strong enough hand on the effort. The Championship side take a shock lead! And it’s nothing more than they deserve. 43 min: Brownhill robs a dithering Mangala in the centre circle. He zips down the inside-right channel and slides the ball forward for Reid, who strides into the area and is upended by Stones! What a clumsy lunge! 42 min: Manchester City snooze, and nearly give up a huge chance. Pack strokes a long ball down the middle, and suddenly Bristol City are three on two! Smith makes off down the right. The ball’s hooked into the middle, a poor pass, but Paterson can’t ricochet it into the net as he slides in. The hosts clear again. 40 min: Brownhill turns on the jets and wins a corner off De Bruyne down the right. The set piece is aimed at Flint, but Baker gets in the way, and the hosts are able to tidy up. 39 min: On the touchline, Pep Guardiola looks ... well, not concerned, exactly. But his expression is certainly pensive. Bristol City are proving a tough nut to crack. 37 min: Manchester City come at the visitors again. Bernardo Silva is found in acres down the right and enters the area. Instead of shooting, he opts to cross into a thicket of players. Wright tries to clear with a very curious backheel. A wee bit over-ambitious, that. The ball ends up at the feet of Gundogan, who has space and time on the edge of the box. But he scoops a harmless effort over the bar. 35 min: A corner for Manchester City on the right leads to another on the left. The second one’s taken quickly and shuttled back up the wing for Gundogan, who whips a shot-cum-cross towards the top right. Mangala tries to help the ball on with a flick header, but can only send it out for a goal kick. 33 min: Bristol City make another sortie upfield, Smith racing down the left and crossing high for Reid. Mangala clears, but the ball drops to the in-rushing Pack, who skelps a wonderful low first-time shot towards the bottom left. Bravo does very well to gather that without spilling it. Lovely football all round. Magnificent shot and save. 32 min: Wright is getting worked over by Sane down the left. So he resorts to a rather cynical block. He’s in danger of a booking, but gets away with it. The Manchester City free kick is lumped into the box in the no-nonsense style. Fielding claims, drops, and claims again. 30 min: Bernardo Silva has a shot from distance. It deflects out left for a corner. The ball’s whipped into the mixer, and out of play to the right of goal. Under it, Stones falls, the result of a very light hands-on challenge from Wright. It’s the sort of decision you get in Merseyside derbies these days, but it’s no penalty. Stones moans, but nobody else in blue bothers. 28 min: And now some head tennis in the Bristol City box. The visitors eventually clear their lines, but Manchester City are beginning to turn the screw after a quiet few minutes. 27 min: Sane sashays past Wright down the left after toying with him in the cat-versus-ball-of-wool style. He reaches the corner of the six-yard box and has a belt, but Fielding kicks away well with his feet. 25 min: Manchester City haven’t threatened for a few minutes, but you can’t keep a good team down for long, and Sane tears down the left, attempting to beat Fielding at his near post from a tight angle near the byline. Bristol City only half-clear their lines, and De Bruyne, on the left-hand corner of the area, has another try at whipping an outrageous shot into the top right. He’s not far off doing so, but once again he’s denied by the keeper. The resulting corner isn’t up to much. 24 min: Another corner for Bristol City down the left. This one’s a bit better, and Flint, standing on the penalty spot, nearly gets his nut on the ball. Mangala powers a header clear. 22 min: Smith’s tenacity earns Bristol City a corner on the left. The delivery isn’t all that, and a chance to put some more pressure on Manchester City is frittered away. But the visitors are playing with great desire and confidence here. They’ve obviously decided they’re not going to go down wondering. It’s a very positive approach. 20 min: Paterson falls over while defending deep on the Manchester City right. Sterling makes off with the ball and feeds Silva, whose attempted curler towards the bottom left flies way wide. 19 min: A free kick for Bristol City that’s effectively a corner out on the right. It’s scooped into the area and the home side don’t look particularly comfortable under the high ball. It’s half cleared to Paterson, just to the right of the D. Paterson has a shot that’s so woefully mishit it’s kept in play to the right by violent spin. Smith picks up possession but can’t keep the pressure on the hosts, and De Bruyne steals the ball from him, mopping up. 16 min: Bristol City go up the other end, Smith winning the ball off a snoozing De Bruyne. He feeds Bryan on the left, who has a dig from 25 yards out. Bravo doesn’t deal with it particularly well, allowing the ball to squirt off to the left. Smith is first to the loose ball, and should probably have a shot from a tight angle, but instead plays a square ball to nobody. A let-off for Manchester City. 15 min: Sane skates in from the left wing and plays a diagonal ball across the face of the area. Sterling gently helps it on to Bernardo Silva, who cutting in from the right, drops a shoulder to move back inside and looks for a curler into the top left. The ball deflects off a Bristol City ankle and nearly nestles in the top right. Corner, which is wasted. 13 min: The Manchester City fans respond with a quick burst of “Come on City!” Their heroes are more than often ahead by now, after all. 11 min: Reid and Paterson ping the ball between each other, advancing with style down the left. The travelling fans entertain themselves with a few none-too-serious olés. Then a long throw in from the right. Paterson smashes a shot from the edge of the box straight into the startled mush of Stones. 9 min: Manchester City are asking some serious questions, though. De Bruyne, quarterbacking from deep, nearly releases Sterling down the inside-right channel, but Flint sticks to Sterling like glue and the Manchester City man can’t zip clear on goal. Then there’s another wave of attack, Gundogan twisting and turning and screwing a weak shot wide left from the left-hand side of the D. 8 min: A nice, lively start to the game, this. Toure slips a ball down the inside-right channel and very nearly releases De Bruyne, but Fielding, bravely wandering well off his line, comes out to close the Manchester City man down. The chance is gone. 7 min: Paterson swings a ball wide right for Brownhill, who takes a touch, has a think, and hoicks it back into the box. Bravo is slightly hesitant, the ball dropping to the left of the goal, and Paterson gets to it before it goes out of play for a goal kick. But he’s flagged for offside. 5 min: Sane and De Bruyne combine down the left, the former eventually slipping a pass down the flank for the very busy Gundogan, who earns a corner. The set piece is played back up the wing for De Bruyne, who looks to dispatch a spectacular curler into the top right. Fielding claws it out for another corner, this time from the right. And this time it’s a non-event. But what ambition by De Bruyne. And that’s a stomach-settling save for the Bristol City keeper. 3 min: A high ball oscillates above Wright, just outside the Bristol City area. He chests back to Fielding, and the Manchester City fans scream for a penalty kick. Nope! To be fair, the players don’t put much into the claim. 2 min: The travelling Bristol City fans are giving it plenty. This is a proper cup atmosphere. But the hosts nearly silence them early, as Gundogan makes good down the right and finds De Bruyne just inside the box. De Bruyne fires low into the six-yard box, but before any Manchester City player can make a move towards the ball, Baker hacks clear. And we’re off! Bristol City get the ball rolling. They take the opportunity to stroke it around the back for a bit, then launch upfield. At which point it’s Manchester City’s turn to get a feel of the ball. The teams are out! Both teams sport their famous first-choice colours: Manchester City in sky blue, Bristol City in robin red. A magnificent atmosphere at the Etihad, helped along by 8,000 Bristol City fans; no away team has brought a larger support to this stadium. We’ll be off in a minute! Lee Johnson speaks! “We’ll be as brave as possible and try to play our game. It’s a great game for us and we want to enhance our reputation. The players want to do everything they can to get opportunities at goal and to be successful. It’s a semi-final, and it would be rude not to give every last bit of energy we’ve got, and we’ll see where that takes us. Their selection is very respectful to us, there is some real quality on the pitch, it’s a real challenge for the players. You’re in a League Cup semi-final and you want to play their best, because it’s a very good experience. We’ve got 8,000 fans behind the goal, and we’re really looking forward to the game.” Pep Guardiola speaks! “We will try to win the game, we take this competition seriously. Bristol City can play. They can use long balls, set pieces, throw-ins, and they are a tall, tall team. But they can play. They have good players in the middle with ability. We have to pay attention.” Manchester City make four changes to the team that saw off Burnley 4-1 in the FA Cup at the weekend. Nicolas Otamendi, David Silva, Fernandinho and Sergio Aguero make way for Eliaquim Mangala, Yaya Toure, Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne. Bristol City named a second-string team for their FA Cup defeat at Watford last weekend, with this tie and their promotion bid in mind, so there’s not much point referencing that. Instead, let’s compare tonight’s XI to the one sent out to compete seriously against Manchester United last month ... and there’s just the single change, goalkeeper Luke Steele finding himself replaced by Frank Fielding. Manchester City: Bravo, Danilo, Stones, Mangala, Zinchenko, Gundogan, Toure, De Bruyne, Sterling, Bernardo Silva, Sane. Subs: Walker, Aguero, Delph, Adarabioyo, Fernandinho, Ederson, Diaz. Bristol City: Fielding, Wright, Flint, Baker, Magnusson, Brownhill, Pack, Smith, Bryan, Paterson, Reid. Subs: Walsh, Taylor, Steele, Engvall, Eliasson, Kelly, Vyner. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Bristol City have been here before. In December 1970, they faced the Tottenham Hotspur of Pat Jennings, Alan Mullery, Alan Gilzean, Martin Chivers and Martin Peters in the semi-final of the League Cup. In the first leg at Ashton Gate, Alan Skirton gave City the lead on 57 minutes, taking advantage of a mix-up between Jennings, Peters and Phil Beal. But 15 minutes later, Peters crossed long from the left and Gilzean headed a fine equaliser. Second Division City held Spurs to a goalless draw after 90 minutes of the return at White Hart Lane, but Chivers and Jimmy Pearce broke their hearts in extra time. Nineteen years later, City were in the Third Division when they reached the semis again, the trophy by now sponsored by Littlewoods. Nineteen-year-old centre back Paul Mardon gave them a 65th-minute lead against Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest in the first leg at the City Ground, only for John Pender, under pressure from Lee Chapman, to turn the ball into his own net with five minutes remaining. It required Neil Webb to set up Garry Parker in the 114th minute of the return at Ashton Gate to settle it for Forest. Clough gave his opposite number Joe Jordan a kiss on the cheek. So that’s two League Cup semi-final appearances for Bristol City. And on both occasions they’ve given top-flight opponents a tougher time than anyone expected. This Manchester City side may be on another level to those Spurs and Forest sides ... but in the cups, you never know. Shocks can happen: just ask Manchester United. Can Bristol City give their Mancunian namesakes a fright? We’ll soon find out. It’s on!

Take ********, whose “first and final” album The Drink is out at the end of the month. They’re probably pronounced Guinness, given this self-penned guide to their name: “Generally Underwhelmed. Incognito. Niceties. Not Even Slightly Suggestive.” Their aggressively out of tune Bontempi jams, like Dean Blunt tinkering in a haunted bingo hall, aren’t likely to bother the mainstream, so they might as well stop people even being able to talk about them. Or is it the opposite – that they’re making their very unpronounceability a talking point? Well, whether obfuscation or marketing device, they’re far from the only ones to choose a name that requires a record company briefing before you can insert it into dinner party conversation. !!! When the enduring Brooklyn dance-punks emerged in around 2000, they said you could pronounce their triple-exclamation name with any trio of monosyllables, though Chk Chk Chk was the one that stuck. Saying “Pyow Pyow Pyow” like a child with a laser would have been my choice, but never mind. ∆ This is the actual name for Alt-J, and, after three albums of underwritten, maddeningly vague nothing-pop, remains the most notable thing about them. The triangle is what you get when you tap alt-J on a keyboard; the ennui you experience explaining this tedious conceit is a neat distillation of their entire oeuvre. ttttttttttttttttttttt “I accidentally put my finger down on the t on the keyboard while I was searching up YouTube and this is what I find”, as one listener says. As marketing strategies go, it’s perhaps not the most finessed, but let’s just call this Montreal duo “t” for the sake of argument. Their echoing freak-folk tracks, like woo-tooo-i-ooo-t’ooo, are essayed across five Bandcamp releases, and nicely recall Animal Collective or Sunburned Hand of the Man. †‡† The late-noughties “witch house” scene featured emaciated white people re-embracing heroin chic and making dystopian rap instrumentals, as an excuse for some very silly band names. †‡†, also known as Ritualz, was up against the likes of ///▲▲▲\\\\\\, oOoOO and M△S▴C△RA. You can even make your own via this witch house band name generator. SHXCXCHCXSH This Swedish duo make creepy ambient techno for listening to in the woods at night – their pair of EPs last year, Rösten, were excellent and their most dancefloor-facing material yet. They get more unpronounceable points for their 2016 album SsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSsSs. Sunn O))) Featuring bone-dissolving riffs where each note lasts about two minutes, these magnificent doom metallers have gone from dressing up as trees to collaborating with Scott Walker and achieving a kind of high-cultural cred. A party trick is to go to a Sunn O))) gig and start talking loudly about how much you like “Sunn Oh” – within seconds you’ll have attracted a gaggle of portly mansplainers saying: “Actually, it’s pronounced Sun.” Ungl’unl’rrlh’chchch A mysterious Newcastle trio whose name sounds like a Welshman trying to rid some persistent catarrh. They have one self-titled release to their name, with tracks full of dark ambient pulsations and non-specific menace, called things like Deep Engulfing Ancient Evil Chambers. Judging by this live video the keyboard player has a nice line in arm-mounted spikes. Eximperituserqethhzebibšiptugakkathšulweliarzaxułum This quite wonderful name starts off all fine and Latin, and then strikes out into ancient unpronounceability, using Ancient Egyptian, Akkadian and Sumerian lettering.

According to a recent study by the British Medical Association, a lack of available beds creates a backlog that often leads to severe delays in emergency departments. Analysis of official NHS data suggests the same knock-on effect this winter, with a greater proportion of ambulances delayed on days hospitals are forced to open more “escalation beds” to cope with increasing admissions. Official NHS ‘occupancy rates’ fail to demonstrate the real level of overcrowding in hospitals this winter According to official data, between 92% and 99.9% of beds have been occupied at the University Hospitals of North Midlands trust this winter, yet even these alarming figures mask the true scale of the pressure that hospitals are facing. The trust has had more patients than core beds every day this winter, with the increased capacity coming from escalation beds – extra beds brought in on temporary wards to cope with demand. It has had to provide 4,737 bed days – one escalation bed used for one day – more than any other trust in the country. Emergency medicine consultant Richard Fawcett said his department was closed to ambulances, having “run out of corridor space”, leading to “third world” conditions. How is your local trust coping? These problems are not unique to one trust, this is the story across the NHS this winter. Here are the next five worst affected trusts Walsall healthcare trust in the West Midlands is also among the worst affected, operating at 100% capacity for 38 out of 49 days so far this winter, despite adding over 2,700 extra bed days. An emergency medicine consultant told the British Medical Association of the “impossible” situation faced by staff who were “at the end of their tethers” at a Midlands hospital. “The corridor into the hospital was so busy we couldn’t have got a cardiac arrest patient through it into the resuscitation room. “There were people in our corridors for eight hours before we could see them.” Hospitals opened the equivalent of nine extra hospitals some days this winter The winter crisis reached its peak on 2 January with trusts requiring 5,075 extra beds in a order to cope with demand, equivalent to more than nine average-sized hospitals. This is an increase on the the same time period in 2016, supporting claims that the NHS is facing its worst crisis in years. “We are seeing conditions that people have not experienced in their working lives,” according to Dr Taj Hassan, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. NHS England admits that the service “has been under sustained pressure [recently because of] high levels of respiratory illness, bed occupancy levels giving limited capacity to deal with demand surges, early indications of increasing flu prevalence and some reports suggesting a rise in the severity of illness among patients arriving at A&amp;Es”. This has a knock-on effect for patient care. As hospitals open escalation beds, the percentage of ambulances that are delayed rises dramatically Analysis of official NHS data suggests a relationship between the number of escalation beds open across the country and the percentage of ambulances that are delayed by at least 30 minutes, leaving patients stuck in the back of ambulances waiting to be admitted to A&amp;E. This corresponds with findings by the BMA last year that bed pressures can cause delays to both patients waiting to be seen and so-called “trolley waits”, when patients have been seen but have to wait for a bed to become available before being admitted. At the peak of demand on 2 January there were 5,075 escalation beds required across all trusts and almost a quarter of all ambulances were delayed by 30 minutes or more. Compare that to a day in late November, when only 9% of ambulances were delayed and 1,957 extra beds provided. Medical experts agree that high levels of bed occupancy lead to more frequent bed transfers, and a greater risk of patients acquiring infections such as MRSA, or ending up on wards inappropriate for their condition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/09/uk-christmas-retail-winners-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T08:43:17Z","webTitle":"The UK Christmas retail winners and losers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/uk-christmas-retail-winners-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/09/uk-christmas-retail-winners-profits","fields":{"headline":"The UK Christmas retail winners and losers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The crucial Christmas trading season can be make or break for retailers. As the festive season got under way, companies faced intense competition to win sales as cash-strapped consumers constrained by falling real pay sought out the best deals. It was tough for the whole retail market but, with most of the major retailers having now reported, more winners have emerged than losers. Winners Tesco The UK’s biggest supermarket chain is one of the winners even though its sales performance fell short of some City expectations. It reported like-for-like sales growth of 1.9% for its UK stores, a performance it said was thanks to the strength of its food business which saw underlying growth of 3.4%. Dave Lewis, Tesco’s chief executive, was upbeat, saying Tesco is “firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions.” John Lewis Underlying sales at John Lewis department stores rose 3.1% over the six weeks to 30 December. Its sister chain Waitrose enjoyed growth of 1.5% on a like-for-like basis. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said the group had traded well but the widespread discounting in the market had hurt profits as its “never knowingly undersold” pledge forced it to match rivals prices. Sainsbury’s The UK’s second-largest supermarket benefited from its merger with Argos, despite experiencing “challenging conditions”. The company upgraded profit expectations by about 5%, saying it had been able to make cost savings from its tie-up with the retail chain earlier than expected. Sales at established stores rose by 1.1% in the 15 weeks to 6 January, in line with consensus. The company said Argos had gained market share, despite a 1.4% fall in sales almost entirely due to the closure of dozens of outlets of the DIY chain Homebase, as a result of the change in ownership. Sainsbury’s increased grocery sales by 2.3%, partly as a result of inflation, and there was an 8.2% surge in sales at the group’s convenience stores and a 7.3% rise online. Next The fashion and homeware chain kicked off the festive reporting season in style, beating forecasts by reporting a surprise rise in sales. Next received a last-minute boost from the the colder weather in the run-up to Christmas, which helped the retailer achieve a 1.5% increase in total sales in the 54 days to 24 December. It was much better than the 0.3% fall that City analysts had predicted, and prompted Next to upgrade its profit expectations for the year to January. Morrisons The UK’s fourth largest supermarket chain was a Christmas hit with bargain-hunting shoppers, after it said it had held the price of a basket of key festive items at the same level as the previous year, despite the rising cost of many commodities. Morrisons said it had improved customer service by opening more tills and improving stock availability, while shoppers snapped up premium foods, children’s clothes and bags of vegetables. Sales rose by 2.8% in the 10 weeks to 7 January, well ahead of the 1.7% expected by analysts. AO World Internet retailers have also done well. Online electrical retailer AO said it was “on track” as it posted UK revenue growth of 11.4% in the three months to 31 December. Revenues in its Europe business jumped nearly 60% excluding currency effects, and overall group revenues advanced 16.6%. Even so, AO, which sells domestic appliances and electronic products in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, remained “cautious given the uncertain UK economic outlook”. Boohoo The online fashion retailer had its best Black Friday period ever and said its PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands, acquired in late 2016 and early 2017 respectively, were faring well. Overall revenues doubled to £228.2m, with Boohoo up 25% to £142.6m in the four months to 31 December – slightly worse than expected. But PrettyLittleThing beat expectations with a 191% surge in revenues to £73.8m and Nasty Gal made £11.9m. The retailer raised its forecast for full-year group revenue growth to 90% from 80%. Joules The recently floated clothing chain popular with middle-class women and known for its bright floral prints and pink wellies enjoyed a bumper Christmas. Sales jumped 19.2% in the seven weeks to 7 January, compared with the same period a year earlier. Joules said sales had grown both in its chain of shops and online, with the chief executive, Colin Porter, putting the success down to the “strength of the Joules brand, unique product proposition and customer engagement”. The company, which has 118 UK stores, said gross retail margins were unchanged over the festive period because it took “a selective approach to promotional activity”. Fat Face The casual clothing retailer was another festive winner, revealing a 12% increase in total sales in the five weeks to January. Fat Face said its decision not to go down the pre-Christmas discounting route was crucial to its success. “We continue to believe that giving our customers price integrity before the big day has been central to this performance,” said Anthony Thompson, chief executive. Like-for-like sales over the five weeks rose 8%, and it had its best ever week of sales in the week ending 30 December. Oxfam Vintage designer clothing and first-edition books helped drive a sharp rise in online sales at Oxfam over Christmas. They jumped by one-third in the eight weeks to 23 December, increasing total sales by 1.2% to £16.9m. The charity store chain also more than doubled sales of its ethical Sourced by Oxfam gifts. Losers Marks &amp; Spencer Marks &amp; Spencer reported a downbeat set of figures with a slump in sales of both food and clothing. Chief executive Steve Rowe admitted there had been a “mixed” performance. Like-for-like clothing and homewares sales at the highstreet stalwart fell 2.8% while, despite inflation of about 3.7%, sales in its food halls were down 0.4%. House of Fraser Another loser, House of Fraser said sales in its stores fell 2.9% in the six weeks to 23 December. Its internet sales were also down 7.5%. Its chief executive Alex Williamson said it had pulled back from discounting to shore up profits. Last week it emerged that the department store chain is pushing its landlords for a rent cut, and planning to downsize some of its stores. Card Factory The greeting card retailer warned on profits, despite “solid” like-for-like sales growth of 2.7% in the 11 months to 31 December. The FTSE 250 firm, which opened 48 new UK stores during the period, is now expecting underlying profits for the year to come in between £93m and £95m. This is less than the £97m expected by analysts and last year’s profits of £98.5m. Card Factory blamed the weaker pound and wage inflation as well as a bigger sales proportion of less profitable non-card products, which will result in extra costs of £7m to £8m. Signet Jewelers Another loser, the company posted a 5.3% decline in same-store sales to $1.9bn (£1.4bn) for the nine weeks to 30 December. Sales at its H. Samuel and Ernest Jones chains in the UK dropped more than 10% on the same basis, with bridal and diamond fashion jewellery struggling, although luxury watches and online sales fared better. Debenhams The first big shock of the Christmas reporting season came from Debenhams last week, which brought its festive update forward by a week to issue a profits warning. The department store chain said sales of seasonal gifts and clothing had fallen, despite heavy discounting. Sales fell by 2.6% at Debenhams’ established UK stores, open for more than a year, in the 17 weeks to 30 December. Shares fell by 15% after the retailer warned full-year profits would come in between £55m and £65m – sharply below City expectations of £83m. Mothercare The baby and maternity products chain was another festive loser, after its decision to hold off from discounting in the run-up to Christmas failed to pay off. Mothercare was forced to issue a profits warning after like-for-like sales fell by 7.2% over the 12 weeks to 30 December. The retailer said pre-tax profits in the full year to the end of March were likely to be somewhere between £1m and £5m – well below City expectations of £10m and a far cry from the £19.7m achieved a year earlier. Shares plunged by more than 30% to an all-time low of 42p. Moss Bros The men’s outfitter warned that profits would be slightly lower than expected, blaming lower shopper numbers in its stores. Like-for-like store sales slumped 8% in December in what the company described as “a very challenging backdrop”. It said consumer demand was weaker while it faced “cost headwinds”. Total retail sales rose 1.6% in the 23 weeks to 6 January, helped by a 12.3% rise online. It said profits for the year to the end of January would be between £6.5m and £6.8m, which it said was slightly below analysts’ expectations. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/09/minister-rejects-call-for-in-depth-inquiry-into-john-worboys-case","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T15:51:16Z","webTitle":"Minister rejects call for in-depth inquiry into John Worboys case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/09/minister-rejects-call-for-in-depth-inquiry-into-john-worboys-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/09/minister-rejects-call-for-in-depth-inquiry-into-john-worboys-case","fields":{"headline":"Minister rejects call for in-depth inquiry into John Worboys case","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The new justice secretary, David Gauke, has rejected calls for an “end-to-end inquiry” into the case of the serial sex attacker John Worboys, who is about to be released from prison. But he backed proposals for greater transparency from the Parole Board in explaining why offenders are freed and how assessments of future risks are conducted. Meanwhile, one of Worboys’ victims, who testified against him in his criminal trial, has said she feels “terrified” at the prospect of his release because she believes he knows where she and other victims live. Responding to Gauke’s comments, she said: “Worboys knows where I live. How do I know he’s not going to come after me? I’m terrified. Why wouldn’t I be? The most important thing now is that the Parole Board tell us how they came to this decision before he is released. “This man was a prolific sex attacker for five to 10 years, probably more. Some reports suggest he might have had hundreds of victims, while he dismissed his actions as ‘banter’. He showed no remorse. “Reports also suggest that just two years ago he still believed he had done nothing wrong. How on earth can this man now be deemed safe? I was assured by the police that Worboys would never be released from prison as he would always pose a serious threat to women. What has changed?” She added: “The justice secretary has today suggested that the law could be changed retrospectively, which would allow us victims to be told why the Parole Board has made this decision. That must now happen as soon as possible. Until it does, we can have zero confidence that he won’t reoffend.” Gauke said in a Commons statement that a review to be completed by Easter would be limited to how far the Parole Board can go in explaining its decisions about individual offenders and improving its relationship with victims. He said he doubted whether retrospective changes could be made. He said one victim who had asked to be kept informed of Worboys’ release had not received an email that was sent out. He defended the board’s work, referring to the hundreds of pages of evidence it had considered in the Worboys case. He said Worboys’ crimes were “horrific”. The former black-cab driver was convicted in 2009 of one count of rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. Gauke said: “While it appears that the correct procedures were followed [by the Parole Board], the fact that some victims learned of the decision [to free Worboys] from the media suggests that there is a need to review these procedures and examine whether lessons can be learned and improvements can be made. “There is a strong case to review the case for transparency in the process for parole decisions and how victims are appropriately engaged in that process, and consider the case for changes in policy, practice or the Parole Board rules, or other guidance or procedures including the victims’ code.” Gauke rejected calls from Labour’s justice spokesman, Richard Burgon, for an “end-to-end review” of the Worboys case, including the way the initial police investigation and the prosecution were handled. “The public is asking questions about police failings and why there were no further prosecutions,” Burgon said. He said the justice system had been subjected “to the greatest level of cuts” of any government department, and privatisation of the probation service, which is supposed to liaise with victims, had been left in a “chaotic” state. Mike Penning, a former police minister, called for an investigation into why the Crown Prosecution Service had not pursued charges relating to complaints from other victims. The CPS later said in a statement: “Sentences can be imposed consecutively. However, following Worboys’s conviction after the trial, the judge imposed notional terms of 10 years for the offences of administering a substance (the maximum) and sexual assault, which were ordered to run concurrently to the notional sentences imposed in respect of the rape and assault by penetration of 16 years. “The defendant was made the subject of an IPP [Imprisonment for Public Protection sentence]. Accordingly, the CPS were of the view that in the absence of any further allegations of rape and assault by penetration (which carry a maximum penalty of life), it was unlikely that any further convictions would significantly alter the final notional sentence of 16 years, if at all.” The Metropolitan police has not received any fresh information relating to Worboys and is not currently investigating him. A judicial review of the Parole Board’s decision to release Worboys could yet be launched by lawyers on behalf of his victims. Harriet Wistrich, a solicitor who represents two victims who have taken their claim for compensation over police failures to the supreme court, said this week: “We are looking at any way we can to challenge the decision on his release.” The probation service has told victims that Worboys’ release licence will include a condition “not to approach or communicate, directly or indirectly, the victims … without prior approval of the supervising officer”. It said his conditions would include reporting to a supervising offender manager every week, and he would be under supervision for at least 10 years. Any breach of the licence conditions could result in Worboys being recalled to prison."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jan/09/world-perilous-place-wishlist-2018-elhadj-as-sy-red-cross","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T14:33:04Z","webTitle":"The world is in a perilous place.

Here's my wishlist for change in 2018","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ours is a world overflowing with suffering. It is a world desperately in need of solutions. Many of its crises require political leadership and courage – something which in 2017 was often in short supply. So instead of suggesting that 2018 should be a year of solutions, my new year wishlist is for 12 months of change. My first wish is for more education. The children trapped in crises today should not lose the opportunity to contribute to their world tomorrow. But of the estimated 462 million young people aged three to 18 living in countries affected by armed conflict, disasters and other emergencies, 75 million are not receiving adequate schooling. More than half of those displaced from Rakhine state in Myanmar are children. We are at risk of losing a generation. Education must become a priority in humanitarian settings, not an afterthought. It also needs to be specifically tailored to help children process the horrors they have witnessed, and to counteract the horribly compelling narratives put forward by extremist groups. Teaching should also extend to communicating humanitarian values, which can help mitigate ethnic or religious hatred. This is a massive collective task, and one on which the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is already working. The second wish is just as bold: 2018 should go down in history as the year the world seriously mobilised for health emergencies. The deadly rise in recent years of forgotten or unknown diseases – like Ebola, Zika, yellow fever and plague – is a reminder of how vulnerable we all are to the next, and perhaps long overdue, public health emergency. The rapid movement of people across borders and around the globe is often cited as the source of our vulnerability to pandemics, but there is another deeper reason. Massive economic inequality and woeful under-investment in public health systems and capacity mean that too many countries are ill-equipped to respond to health crises. Weak health systems anywhere should worry us all. Diseases know no borders. None of us are safe until all of us are safe. In countries where health systems are chronically weak and unable to cope, we need more clinics, more hospitals, and more nurses and doctors, backed by better resources and better training. And the key to confronting pandemics effectively lies in early detection and very rapid response. Well-prepared communities are best equipped to help detect epidemics and stop them promptly. Governments and international organisations need to engage with communities, promote local ownership, invest in local action, and build trust. That is where people like Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers come into the equation, linking isolated and remote communities with formal health structures. Which leads me to my third wish for 2018: the world needs to invest much more in strengthening this kind of grassroots action. People working on the ground are still not getting the recognition they deserve, and are too often treated as sub-contractors. The great shame here is that these teams are often best placed to bring about change. They are always there in communities on the side of people in need; they speak local languages and understand cultures, and they are committed to helping their neighbours in crises and far beyond. This is especially so in the growing number of regional disasters that rarely hit the headlines or attract international funding. The answer isn’t simply to shift the burden of emergency response to the shoulders of communities, but to develop a complementary humanitarian system which is as local as possible, while being as international as necessary. There will always be the need for specialised expertise. But this shouldn’t come at the expense of local teams. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is part of this process.

It starred Elliott Gould as an American archaeologist in Sweden, who has an affair with a beautiful, troubled woman, played by Bergman regular Bibi Andersson. To promote it, Bergman and Andersson made an extraordinary appearance on America’s Dick Cavett Show – an unimaginably rare TV outing for this director, rather like seeing Jean-Luc Godard pop up on Trevor Noah’s The Daily Show. Seated next to his very quiet star, Bergman declared: “I think acting is a very special women’s profession. Women have much more talent for acting. I think women, perhaps from education, are more used to enjoying looking into the mirror that is the audience or the camera’s eye. If a man stands in front of a mirror, he can perhaps feel a little bit ashamed. He looks at his clothes, his hair and his face. A woman by education is not ashamed of looking at herself.” Could Bergman really have been so naive as to think that was true? Did he really imagine that a wince of dissatisfaction at one’s own reflection was restricted to balding, ageing males, and that women were all as beautiful as the goddesses of his own movie universe? Or was he using women and female characters to exalt his own narcissism and male anxiety? In 1983, he made a short film, Karin’s Face, all about family photographs of his mother Karin (it was a name he continually favoured for characters). A Freudian interpretation of Bergman’s women is tempting, if glib – although the director is himself virtually a parallel Freud, presiding over his own modern mythology of sexual dysfunction and family tragedy. Bergman – the great poetic master of doubt, faith, love, erotic enchantment and the silence of God – was born 100 years ago this year. Although he had the seriousness and poise of Ibsen or Strindberg, in his younger days he was capable of great comedy and gaiety. His centenary is being celebrated with a complete retrospective at London’s BFI. Among many other things, this is a chance to look anew at the generation of female stars who found immortality through his movies. These women also found themselves submitting to an intense and intimate working relationship, which sometimes became a sexual one. Bergman was married five times and a great deal of his income was earmarked for child support. Many female stars found him intrusive and oppressive: he might conceivably today find himself liable to a #MeToo complaint. There is something uneasy about the fact that Harriet Andersson began her relationship with Bergman after going to his office to discuss her career over tea. No one did more to popularise Bergman for English-speaking audiences than Woody Allen. Like his Swedish idol, Allen adored and fetishised women, returning to the same faces like Monet to his lilies. Bergman, though, did not share Allen’s obsessive interest in younger women. It is worth pointing out that the Swede’s 1978 film Autumn Sonata – starring Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann as a mother and daughter – is about a stepfather abusing a young teen stepdaughter and being specifically identified as morally culpable. There was almost a Bergman “type”, and it is no accident that such stars were often cast as sisters or even mirror-images of each other. The Bergman female star would be lit, framed, styled and cast in a distinctive way – an open-faced, often blonde woman whose beauty was complicated by a pained or martyred aspect. Ullmann and Bibi Andersson each portrayed the ultimate tragisexual Bergman heroine in his compulsively watchable Persona of 1966. Ullmann is a stage actor who retreats into silence after a nervous breakdown, Andersson a nurse tasked with coaxing her into speech at a summer lake house. They do look strikingly similar and their relationship becomes intensely and erotically intimate, but also alien and mysterious, like trying to embrace your reflection in the mirror – the mirror Bergman claimed female performers found more congenial. In 1972’s agonised Cries and Whispers, Ullmann, Harriet Andersson and Ingrid Thulin play Agnes, Maria and Karin, three sisters in the early 20th century. Agnes is dying of cancer and her two sisters have come back to the family home, ostensibly to care for her, but are in fact in full retreat from the breakdown of their marriages, secretly convulsed with self-hate, guilt and despair. They resent the maid Anna, played by Kari Sylwan, who has an intense bond with Agnes and climbs into bed with her for a very sensual pietà, the servant cradling her mistress’s dying body, bringing pain and sexual desire into a shocking interrelationship. When the character played by Thulin, who had starred in Bergman’s masterly Wild Strawberries, mutilates herself with broken glass, the sceptical observer may see a contrived or even self-parodic flourish. But Bergman’s unflinching seriousness carries it off: a premonition of Isabelle Huppert’s ordeal in Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher. The movie is similar to 1963’s hypnotic and nightmarish The Silence, in which two sisters travel through a fictional European country, living through the trauma of a Hungarian-type uprising with tanks on the street. Anna (Gunnel Lindblom) is the younger sister, a single mother with a little boy in tow. Bergman’s first closeup shot of her face on the train is a shocking masterpiece: she looks inert, blank, as immobile as a corpse, but is in fact stupefied with boredom and resentment of her bossy intellectual sister. Ester (Thulin again) is part disapproving, part fascinated by Anna’s casual sexual adventures. She masturbates in bed. But her moans of pleasure are weirdly similar to moans of pain, because Ester is very ill. Her cries have the same desolate quality as Agnes’s in Cries and Whispers – Bergman has the same need to amplify and complicate the proclamation of sex. Perhaps this minister’s son felt he could only portray the act in the context of punitive suffering. Bergman is renowned for those colossal closeups of women’s faces, and his greatest were on the overpoweringly charismatic Harriet Andersson, his former lover. In his 1953 film Summer With Monika – a movie that had something of the French new wave and the British kitchen sink about it – Andersson is Monika, the carefree girl who has to shrug off sexual abuse at work and who falls in love with Harry, an earnest young man who takes her for a summer of love on his motor launch and gets her pregnant. They then enter a brief and squalidly unhappy marriage. The film was much talked about for the daring shots of Andersson swimming naked. Yet now it is most remarkable for a single closeup of her face, as she is about to cheat on her husband with a man who has given her a light in a bar. Her face fills the screen and her gaze is directed straight into the lens. Is she defiant? Contemptuous? The whole film could have been contrived for that single staggeringly powerful image. Coercive and condescending Bergman may have been to his female stars, but no one else could have given Andersson a moment as glorious as that. One very atypical Bergman star was the superbly elegant, worldly and witty Eva Dahlbeck, who was probably just too genial to be yet another of his sexy but desolate enigmas. She is perhaps most entertaining in 1954’s uproarious romantic comedy (yes, he did once make them) A Lesson in Love. It is basically Bergman’s Philadelphia Story, a comedy of remarriage with Dahlbeck in a role that might be played by Katherine Hepburn, with the Cary Grant part taken by the very young, noticeably relaxed Bergman team player Gunnar Björnstrand. (There is also a Bergman male: upright, uptight, sometimes mutton-chopped and often gaunt and disapproving, a role frequently taken by Björnstrand, Erland Josephson or Max von Sydow.) Maybe Bergman’s rapture was a dimension of his religious doubt: if he couldn’t believe in God, or indeed that unsatisfactory reflection of himself in the mirror, then he could turn to those passionately curated images of female beauty about whose transcendence there could be no debate. This was a kind of religious truth, but one that caused its own kind of anguish. Was he, perhaps, inspired by Strindberg’s A Dream Play, featuring Agnes, the daughter of a god who descends to Earth to investigate humanity, to sympathise and bear witness to human pain? Bergman did once produce the drama and the playwright is mentioned in Fanny and Alexander, Bergman’s semi-autobiographical movie from 1982. In its final moments, a young actress asks her mother-in-law, a retired actress, to take part in a production of this play. She laughs and shrugs off the idea of acting in Strindberg, saying: “That nasty misogynist!” Bergman wasn’t a misogynist. But I think, to the very end of his days, women were a mystery to him, and this gave rise to a passionate kind of worship and even creative ownership. Whatever the truth, one thing is undeniable: he created some of the greatest roles for women in cinema history. • Ingmar Bergman: A Definitive Film Season is at the BFI Southbank, London, until 20 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/10/six-review-henry-viii-wives-arts-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T09:26:28Z","webTitle":"Six review – Henry VIII's wives form girl band to take a pop at history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/10/six-review-henry-viii-wives-arts-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/10/six-review-henry-viii-wives-arts-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"Six review – Henry VIII's wives form girl band to take a pop at history","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Everyone knows the old rhyme about Henry VIII’s wives: “Divorced, beheaded, died. Divorced, beheaded, survived.” Now, fledgling musical talents Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss offer a chance to see the women live and kicking in a concert. Fed up with only being famous for being married to Henry, the queens perform as a girl band, Six, vying to get their voices heard and their stories told. “What hurts more than a broken heart?” asks Natalie Paris as Jane Seymour, staking a claim for her story as the saddest. “A severed head,” retorts Christina Modestou, as Anne Boleyn. It’s a nice idea, neatly done, in a show that began as a student production at last year’s Edinburgh fringe. The show’s potential was spotted and composer George Stiles (of Stiles and Drewe fame) is the executive producer and musical supervisor of this professionally cast version. It’s a lively calling card from Marlow and Moss, whose musical influences are more 21st-century pop than Greensleeves. The minxy Anne Boleyn sings a catchy Lily Allen-ish number entitled Don’t Lose Your Head and Jane Seymour is the queen of the power ballad. With a torch song to lost love, Izuka Hoyle suggests that there was more than meets the eye to Catherine Parr, the surviving wife who lost the love of her life in marrying the king but used her position to support female education. It’s seldom laugh-out-loud funny, but it does have an edge, not least in the way it keeps reminding us how women are erased from history. “One word in a stupid rhyme,” complains Aimie Atkinson’s Catherine Howard about her lack of personal profile, before launching into a terrific number which details the way men groomed her from the age of 13. Genesis Lynea has fun with Anne of Cleves, enjoying divorced life in her own castle, and Renée Lamb is a sharp-tongued Catherine of Aragon, constantly jockeying for position, dismissing Howard as the “least relevant Catherine” and resisting attempts to send her to a convent because she wouldn’t look good in a wimple. It may be cloaked in silliness, but Six makes some serious points about female victimhood and survival. • At Arts theatre, London, until 22 January.

That’s not (just) me talking, that’s how “loads of people” have greeted the Lancastrian since her standup debut in 2016. “Some people are quite up for being pigeonholed like that,” says Willan. “But I think nuance is important.” What do onlookers mean when they peg Willan as “northern” and “working-class”? How accurately can those labels describe any of us? Those are the questions posed by her second show, Branded, which tours next month. With it, Willan enacts phase two of her manifesto, as she calls it, to bring authentic working-class voices into the mainstream – while questioning why those voices are momentarily hip again. Branded was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy award last summer. It’s a terrific hour of personal-meets-political standup, gleefully complicating notions of class, feminism and northern identity, even as it masquerades as blunt Boltonian good cheer. “I use my own experience as a metaphor for bigger issues,” says Willan. “I find academic political comedy isolating. It’s very clever, but is it engaging to everybody? Would my mum sit and listen to it?” What her mum would do is a moot point, given that she was a heroin addict who features in both of her daughter’s autobiographical solo shows. “I’ve not seen her for three years,” Willan says. “I don’t know where she is.” Mum loomed largest in Willan’s first show, which recounted her childhood growing up in care. “Rude, rebellious and defiant,” are the words that dogged teenage Willan on social workers’ reports she obtained from Bolton Council. They don’t remotely describe how she is in person, or on stage, where she’s thoughtful, fun-loving and sympathetic. Her early career was forged in theatre: Willan founded then quit the Manchester-based theatre/cabaret outfit Eggs Collective, which featured on the BBC’s Performance Live last year. She then made solo theatre, including The Novice Detective, about her search for her dad – which she’s now adapting into a sitcom for children. Standup didn’t cross her mind. “I’d always been a funny human,” she says, “but I never really thought of doing it.” Responding to advice from a producer at BBC Comedy, she took it up in 2014, challenging herself to “find a way to make it funny in five minutes that my mum was a heroin addict, without freaking people out”. She soon started to feel at home in comedy. “I’d hidden my background, and not realised I was doing it. Theatre and live art is so middle class, so dominated by one type of person. And my communication style would often be misunderstood, would be considered aggressive when I was just being direct.” Comedy may be no shangri-la for working-class artists (“It’s a pay-to-play industry now: Edinburgh costs a fortune”) but it was an improvement on theatre. And, she says, “I’ve been able to say what I wanted to say in standup. You can talk about quite dark things in a light-hearted way.” One of those things is the period when Willan funded her arts career by working as an escort, which she addresses in Branded. She didn’t dedicate a whole show to the subject, though, because “it shouldn’t be made a big thing of. It’s just a bit of who I am.” Willan isn’t alone in broaching her experience of sex work in her comedy: Desiree Burch made a show about working as a dominatrix; Fern Brady talked about stripping. But Willan’s interest – in keeping with Branded’s theme – was in exploring how “escort” becomes just another simplistic label, a glamorous or demonised identity resistant to nuance. She was nervous of addressing it onstage, mainly because her family didn’t know about it. How candid to be about her offstage life is an ongoing question for Willan. “I try to protect my family. There’s lots I’ve not said.” For her next show, due in 2019, she’s “weaning myself off retrospective family material”. But she’ll continue to explore, and fight for, working-class representation, specifically the plight of care leavers like herself. Alongside the standup, Willan runs her own company, Stories of Care, a writing project for children in care and those who have just left. Unusually for a comic, her tours are Arts Council England-funded – because they come with a mentoring offer and free tickets to care leavers. Her aim is to ensure “they’re not just having their stories written, but that they’re at the forefront, and in the director’s chair”. She’s leading from the front in that regard, with a roster of TV projects brewing. But there’s still a class ceiling. “I’m an actress,” she says, “but I wouldn’t get cast in a Jane Austen thing. I’d never get Elizabeth Bennet – I’d get the cleaner.” Working-class may be “cool” now, she says, “but what I find is they want your identity and your story, but not the personality that goes with it. They want you to represent something – to pop you in the Caroline Aherne box, because it’s empty at the moment – rather than allowing you to come with your own point of view. It’s still very elitist. And that’s got to change.” Branded is at ARC, Stockton-on-Tees, on 10 February; then touring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/09/bad-weather-hampers-efforts-to-contain-oil-tanker-fire-off-china-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T10:59:17Z","webTitle":"Weather hampers efforts to contain oil tanker fire off China coast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/09/bad-weather-hampers-efforts-to-contain-oil-tanker-fire-off-china-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/09/bad-weather-hampers-efforts-to-contain-oil-tanker-fire-off-china-coast","fields":{"headline":"Weather hampers efforts to contain oil tanker fire off China coast","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Bad weather has hindered efforts to contain a tanker fire and oil spill off the coast of China, as environmental groups warned of a potential catastrophe. The body of one sailor had been found and 31 others were missing after an Iranian-owned tanker collided with a container ship about 160 nautical miles east of Shanghai on Saturday evening. The Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tonnes of light crude oil or about 1m barrels. However, strong winds, rain and waves up to four metres high were impeding efforts to contain the fire, locate the missing crew members and limit environmental damage, China’s transport ministry said. Rescuers onboard 13 vessels were searching an area of 900 sq nautical miles (3,090 sq km). The tanker “is in danger of explosion and sinking, and the toxic gas … is very harmful to rescue workers on the scene”, officials said. The Sanchi was loaded with condensate, a form of oil that only remains in liquid form under specific conditions and is more volatile compared with crude oil. Nearly three days after the collision, as fires continue to burn, environmental concerns are mounting. “We are extremely concerned about the potential environmental impact of the collision and fire,” said Rashid Kang, a campaigner at Greenpeace. “Condensate oil contains much higher proportions of soluble and toxic chemicals. We are not expecting to see the kind of devastating thick oil slick associated with crude oil spills, but are worried about the toxic pollution that could be caused from leaks of condensate.” Another concern is the impact on local wildlife. “The environmental impact of this disaster could be catastrophic,” said Dave Tickner, a freshwater adviser at the World Wide Fund for Nature. “The consequences will be far more severe if it affects a wide area of ocean or the Yangtze estuary, which is hugely important for wildlife, including significant numbers of migratory birds and a range of fish species. We need urgent action to clean up the spill and ensure the environmental consequences are limited.” Chinese authorities were investigating the cause of the crash. The Sanchi, a Panamanian-flagged vessel owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company, was sailing to South Korea from Iran when it collided with a Hong Kong-flagged cargo ship, the CF Crystal, carrying 64,000 tonnes of grain. The Crystal’s 21 Chinese crew were rescued."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/09/hundreds-of-flying-foxes-die-in-searing-australian-heat","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T11:14:47Z","webTitle":"Hundreds of flying foxes die in searing Australian heat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/hundreds-of-flying-foxes-die-in-searing-australian-heat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/hundreds-of-flying-foxes-die-in-searing-australian-heat","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds of flying foxes die in searing Australian heat","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A colony of flying foxes has been nearly wiped out by extreme heat in Campbelltown in south-west Sydney, according to environmentalists. The Help Save the Wildlife and Bushlands in Campbelltown campaign posted a series of images to Facebook showing the corpses of the animals lying in the ground, apparently after they had died from dehydration in the soaring temperatures. The group say more than 400 of the animals were lost, many of them juveniles. Volunteers have been working to save the animals, rehydrating them and taking them to places where they can be kept cool. Temperatures in Sydney reached a 80-year record high of 47.3C on Sunday. Cate Ryan, one of the first volunteers on the scene, told media “it was unbelievable. I saw a lot of dead bats on the ground and others were close to the ground and dying. I have never seen anything like it before.” The campaign group also regularly post information about why protecting the species is so important for the local habitat. “Flying foxes are intelligent and remarkable,” the group says. “These unique animals help regenerate our forests and keep ecosystems healthy through pollination and seed dispersal. They don’t use sonar like smaller, insect-eating bats; only their eyes and ears, like us. They see as well as a cat at night and are just about as smart. Flying foxes are foresters keeping the eco-system together. If we are to keep the remnants of our forests healthy, we need the flying foxes.

In December Bougainville landowner groups were called to vote on allowing Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) to renew their mining licence and potentially reopen the Panguna mine, but the vote was split. “If we went ahead now, you could be causing a total explosion of the situation again,” the Bougainville Autonomous Government (ABG) president, John Momis, told the ABC on Monday. The Panguna copper mine was central to the civil war and blockade in the 1990s that killed tens of thousands of people. Conflict escalated after landowners protested environmental damage by the mine and the lack of economic benefit for local people. The Rio Tinto-owned BCL was forced to close the mine, and discussion in recent years about reopening it has sparked hostilities in the nearby communities. In June protesters blocked Momis and other political leaders from accessing Panguna to sign an agreement with landowners, which the ABC reported would have opened the way for BCL to work towards returning. Legislation passed in 2015 gave traditional landowners greater ownership over resources as well as powers over the establishment or reopening of mines, but confusion and division remains. At the time of the BCL vote local journalist Aloysius Laukai reported Momis said mining by any company would be “untenable” under the circumstances. However on Monday Momis told the ABC the moratorium only strictly applied to BCL, not other potential operators. The moratorium is a dramatic turnaround in policy from the ABG, which determined people felt BCL didn’t deserve a social licence to run the mine. The ABG owns a 36.4% share in BCL, and has consistently said reopening Panguna was essential for the island’s economic self-sufficiency if it is to become independent. Luke Fletcher, the executive director of an Australian-based NGO, Jubilee, said it wasn’t clear if the turnaround was “a temporary retreat or a permanent change of direction”. “It could be they’re just biding their time for another couple of years, or they’re considering opening Panguna with other operators,” Fletcher said. “It does seem the intention is still to reopen the mine.” The Papua New Guinea government is the only other major shareholder after Rio Tinto left in 2016. It has said it will give its 17% share to Bougainville, making the ABG majority shareholders of a company that has just one project – a mine over which the ABG has now placed a moratorium. BCL is yet to be officially informed of the moratorium, but learned of it through media reports. The company’s Port Moresby general manager, Mark Hitchcock, said it had sought further clarity, as it still “firmly believed” it had strong support among landowners. “Hitchcock said previously held community forums led by the ABG had also demonstrated strong majority support and this reflected the company’s own experiences on the ground,” a spokesman told Guardian Australia. “He stressed that BCL was a local company majority owned by the people of PNG, including Bougainville and had always acted in good faith after being invited to enter a new process for the redevelopment of Panguna by the ABG and landowners.” BCL claimed it had support from eight of the nine landholder groups, as well as the Special Mining Lease Osikaiyang Landowners Association. It said minority elements – and competing mining interests – were disrupting consensus. There were disputes with the association’s chair, Philip Miriori, BCL said, citing a letter from 367 authorised customary heads who disputed Momis’s characterisation of the vote as a “narrow divide”. The customary heads told PNG’s Post Courier the meeting was given a submission signed by 320 of the heads giving their support to BCL. As the resource-rich country moves on from civil war and towards independence, it is increasingly looking to mining for its economic future. West Australian company Kalia Ltd recently announced it had signed a land access agreement with north Bougainville landowners, allowing the start of a “full-scale exploration program”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/16/help-us-the-australian-made-purgatory-of-manus-drains-the-refugees-of-hope","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T17:00:01Z","webTitle":"'Help us': the purgatory of Manus made in Australia | Tim Costello","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/16/help-us-the-australian-made-purgatory-of-manus-drains-the-refugees-of-hope","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/16/help-us-the-australian-made-purgatory-of-manus-drains-the-refugees-of-hope","fields":{"headline":"'Help us': the Australian-made purgatory of Manus drains the refugees of hope","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Towards the end of last year, I travelled to two very different sites of refugee despair. The first was the vast congested refugee camps of Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, bloated by more than 600,000 people who identify as Rohingya Muslims who had fled their burning villages in Myanmar. In almost 15 years of international aid work, I have rarely been confronted by such misery and vulnerability. The following month I went to Manus Island as part of a fact-finding mission under the auspices of the Australian Council for International Development to witness the conditions of refugees and asylum seekers who have been stalled there for more than four years under Australia’s border protection policies. In terms of physical suffering, fear and desperation, there was no comparison. But if Cox’s Bazar brought to mind the gates of hell, then Manus was a purgatory – made in Australia. The suffering of the Rohingya is a question that Myanmar must ultimately answer. Manus is my government’s cruelty. The impact of meeting those who are held there – and also witnessing the impact on the people of Manus, who have been dragged into this Australian quagmire – was more personally unsettling because their suffering has been created by my government. It was a surreal irony to meet Rohingya refugees who have been locked up on Manus while the Australian government simultaneously supports international humanitarian appeals to aid the Rohingya in Cox’s Bazar. In both Cox’s Bazar and Manus I was struck by the absence of hope, the most shocking of all deprivations. Among the Rohingya, it was the hopelessness of a stateless people, stranded between Bangladesh and Myanmar, while on Manus it was the hopelessness of refugees violently cut off from the countries of their birth but unable to reach the countries of their dreams. My first glimpse of Manus refugees was of desperate faces shouting “Help us” as Papua New Guinea police, doing the Australian government’s dirty work, broke up the former detention centre. They forcibly removed more than 300 men who were refusing to go to the new facilities, 24km away, in no small part because it offered no solution to their indefinite detention. Then I met the Kurdish journalist, writer and film-maker Behrouz Boochani, who fled Iran in May 2013 in search of a place where he could write freely, but writes instead from an island prison. Chauka, Please tell us the Time, his 2017 documentary about Manus was shot over several months on a mobile phone, with Boochani sending the files one tiny piece at a time to his Iranian co-director, Arash Kamali Sarvestani, in the Netherlands. His autobiographical novel will also soon be published. I met him squatting down outside a fruit stall in Lorengau central market. He rolled a cigarette and talked about his arrest the day before during the refugee protests, and his imprisoned life on Manus Island. He is a striking man, lean, intense, acutely aware of the advocacy role he plays among the forgotten men of Manus. He told me about the quirk of fate that landed him on Christmas Island on 23 July 2013 – his 30th birthday and just four days after Kevin Rudd announced that refugees arriving by boat would have “no chance” of being settled in Australia. In detention he has refused to be defined by the number he was given – MEG45. Instead he has asserted his identity as a writer and witness in what he calls “this hell of a prison”. Others I met on Manus Island included Karam, also a Kurdish Iranian, whose wife was pregnant when he was forced to flee for publishing poetry in Kurdish. He had not seen his four-year-old son and was intermittently in tears about his loss. He said when he Skypes his family, he breaks down, thinking that he should be there to protect them. I asked him why he wouldn’t settle in Papua New Guinea and at least tell his son and wife they would soon be reunited. He said, apart from the few prospects and volatility of PNG, it would be another eight-year wait to reunite the family. Most of the refugees I spoke to had been drained of hope. They have a heaviness of spirit about them. Their struggle is existential: they are told that Australian public opinion is against them, detained, ignored, sent the message that they are somehow outside the scope of ordinary human kindness, out of sight and out of mind. Proverbs says that hope deferred makes the heart sick, and many of the refugees I met on Manus have plunged into the heart sickness that is deep depression. Many said they no longer wanted to come to Australia. But neither could they go back. They have been stranded on a remote island, far from everything they have known and loved, somewhere between their fears and dreams. Tim Costello is chief advocate of World Vision Australia.

His welfare bill is anything but","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When visiting the Wayside Chapel’s annual lunch for the homeless on Christmas Day, prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said of the event, “It’s practical love, it’s unconditional love, it’s really what Christmas should be all about” – a laudable sentiment. By 2 January it seemed that “practical, unconditional love” was nothing more than a sop for the season as the Turnbull government celebrated a deal with the Nick Xenophon Team that would allow them to cut people’s income support for a month for failing to meet certain obligations. On Christmas Day, love. In the new year, judgment. It’s worth considering what, exactly, is meant by the concept of “love” in a social context. What would it mean for a prime minister, or others with their hands on the levers of change, to truly commit to “practical, unconditional love”? Practical love is the firm decision to use whatever power and privilege one has to bring about meaningful change for the better for those whom you claim to love. Love without accompanying action is just a word, bereft of meaning and powerless to bring change. Welfare changes, such as those the Nick Xenophon Team is supporting, should be immediately discarded. According to social services peak body, the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss), up to 80,000 job seekers will have their payments cut, people who find themselves in hospital will have their payments delayed and people without work will no longer have their income support back-payed to the date of lodging their application. Clearly, none of this will help people pay their mortgage, rent or find secure housing. Those without secure work are already forced to live on Newstart payments that haven’t increased in real terms for more than 20 years and place recipients more than $390 a week below the poverty line. Rather than threatening deeper destitution, Newstart needs to be increased to give people a decent foundation on which to begin to build a life that meets their potential. Employment should be a means to an end – including being able to afford a place to live – but the current government glorifies casual, insecure work, seeks to cut penalty rates and other benefits and attempts to undermine the ability of workers to organise and protect their jobs through a sustained attack on the unions that exist to defend them. The government should abandon the pretence that casualisation of the workforce benefits workers and their families and instead support legislative change that would ensure casual workers would automatically convert to permanent status after six months with one employer. With family and domestic violence being the most common cause of homelessness, accounting for around 36% of demand for homelessness services, support for compulsory domestic violence leave would help more survivors transition into secure housing. Adequate funding backed by the development of a coherent national community mental health strategy would assist in both the prevention of homelessness and the successful transition of homeless people into homes and employment. With more than 250,000 people in Australia sitting on public housing waiting lists and more than 460,000 households spending more than 50% of their income on housing, practical love for those in power would involve addressing both the causes of housing stress and increasing the supply of social housing. Despite broad acknowledgement that public and community housing is grossly underfunded, there have been no significant increases in housing stock for the last 20 years. Practical, unconditional love would not only cause those who control the nation’s budget to invest in building more homes for those who need them, it would also seek to stop people becoming homeless in the first place – as far as that goal can be obtained. One place to start could be the broad adoption of the principles of the “Zero Project”, coordinated by the Don Dunstan Foundation, in which Adelaide has committed to becoming the first city outside of the US to achieving “functional zero homelessness” which is reached when the number of people who are homeless on any given night is no greater than the housing availability for that night. The adoption of any – in addition to increased recurrent funding for new social housing stock – of these strategies would significantly reduce the number of Australians suffering housing insecurity and see Turnbull acting out his definition of the Christmas spirit rather than his harmful New Year resolution. At the Wayside Chapel’s Christmas lunch, Pastor Graham Long said, “I think this event will get bigger and that’s because more and more people are becoming homeless.” If the prime minister truly loves the people he danced with, we will see him leverage his considerable power and privilege to avoid the fulfilment of this tragic prophecy in 2018. • Brad Chilcott is the founder of Welcome to Australia and the pastor of Activate Church in Adelaide"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/09/two-consenting-adults-couples-across-australia-make-marriage-equality-real","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T06:07:48Z","webTitle":"'Two consenting adults': couples across Australia make marriage equality real","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/two-consenting-adults-couples-across-australia-make-marriage-equality-real","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/two-consenting-adults-couples-across-australia-make-marriage-equality-real","fields":{"headline":"'Two consenting adults': couples across Australia make marriage equality real","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Usually at a wedding, the biggest cheer follows the kiss. At the long-awaited wedding of Ron van Houwelingen and Antony McManus, the thunderous applause came somewhat earlier. “Marriage as we know it in Australia – are you ready for this?” celebrant Coral Teague asked, standing beside the couple on the stage at the David Williamson Theatre at Melbourne Polytechnic in Prahran, where they met as students in 1987. Teague paused before saying the words Van Houwelingen and McManus fought for 30 years to enact. “Two. Consenting. Adults.” Until 7 December, the Australian Marriage Act had specified that marriage was between a man and a woman. The auditorium cheered. Many of the guests had campaigned alongside Van Houwelingen and McManus in Equal Love Victoria or have roots stretching further back, to the start of the Aids epidemic, when one grand lady hosted annual Christmas dinners for men whose partners had gone and whose families didn’t want them. The ceremony on Tuesday was more than just a wedding, more than a celebration of love. It was a triumphant victory party, a sincere thank you to the 61.6% of Australians who voted yes in the postal survey on marriage equality, and a raised middle finger to the politicians who made that vote necessary. “Ron, together we fought for this,” McManus said in his vows. “And, darling man, we won.” It was the 17th time the couple of 30 years had tied the knot but the first legal ceremony. “I don’t know how many times I have actually illegally married people, but these two I have married a lot,” Teague said. They held it at the earliest possible opportunity: 9 January was the first day that same-sex couples could marry, unless they had special circumstances to waive the 30-day waiting period to apply for a marriage licence. Ten-year-old Evie MacDonald, who is one of the faces of the Safe Schools campaign, was the ring bearer. A cast of musical friends, including Katie Underwood, dedicated songs to the couple. With rainbow flags waving from the seats and the marriage certificate freshly signed, Van Houwelingen turned to the audience. “Hey,” he said, “have you met my husband?” It was a day crowded with nuptials. Commonwealth Games relay runner Craig Burns married Luke Sullivan at 12.01am at Tweed Heads, timing their ceremony so that the official, legally binding words were said once the date had ticked over. In Melbourne, Teegan Daly and Mahatia Minniecon did the same thing. Three hours later, when midnight struck in Perth, Western Australia, Kelly and Sam Pilgrim-Byrne were married at 12.01am on the steps of state parliament with 10-year-old daughter Charlotte looking on. Gillian Brady and Lisa Goldsmith, together for eight years, were married at the same time at Perth gay bar The Court. Kelly Pilgrim-Byrne told the ABC after the ceremony that, despite being together for 24 years, the couple had never planned their wedding day. “It was never anything we considered because it was never anything that was available to us,” she said. “So we never had those dream about what would our wedding look like … we never, ever considered it, because we never thought it would happen in our lifetime.” In Tasmania, Roz Kitschke and Lainey Carmichael were married in a 5.30am ceremony in the gardens of their Franklin home. Long-time marriage equality advocate Rodney Croome was there. “The joy and happiness at this morning’s wedding was proof, should it still be needed, that love is love,” Croome said. At the more civilised hour of 8am, Rebecca Hickson married her partner of nine years, Sarah Turnbull, in Newcastle. It was the second wedding for the couple; Hickson told AAP they had their “big hoo-ha ceremony” three years ago, and were reaffirming those vows. At the Van Houwelingen and McManus wedding, cabaret artist Mama Alto, singing Etta James, put it best: “Equal love at last.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/09/performance-funding-at-university-not-credible-says-education-expert","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T05:30:50Z","webTitle":"Experts question government's university funding model","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/performance-funding-at-university-not-credible-says-education-expert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/performance-funding-at-university-not-credible-says-education-expert","fields":{"headline":"Experts question government's university funding model","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government’s plan to tie university funding to student performance is unlikely to make a big difference to enrolments unless changes are made to the way different disciplines are funded, experts have warned. This week the government used the release of the latest employer satisfaction survey for graduates to push its case for changes to higher education funding announced in its mid-year budget. The survey found that about 84% of employers were satisfied with the qualifications students were getting at university, while 88% of students thought their degrees had prepared them “well” or “very well” for their jobs. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, said the figures were “encouraging” but that they “reinforce the need to ensure our higher education institutions are focused on the work readiness of graduates”. “Australia has excellent universities but they must place student outcomes at the forefront of their considerations to meet the needs of our economy, employers and ultimately boost the employment prospects of graduates,” he said. “That’s precisely why the changes we announced in Myefo [the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook] will link additional funding for bachelor courses to performance outcomes.” In December, the government announced it would effectively end the demand-driven funding system introduced by the Gillard government in 2012 by freezing commonwealth grant scheme funding for bachelor degrees at 2017 levels in 2018 and 2019, with increases from 2020 subject to performance targets. Universities Australia has argued the freeze amounts to a $2.2bn cut to the sector. But some experts have questioned whether performance funding would really have an impact on university behaviour. Andrew Norton, a higher education expert from the Grattan Institute, said the promise of performance funding was often “not credible”. “One problem is that performance funding is pretty speculative because there’s no law that says the government has to pay this money in the end,” he said. “This has been one of its great flaws; the criteria constantly change and often the money is abolished in a future budget, so it doesn’t make sense for universities to make major changes because it’s not a credible promise.” The employer satisfaction survey pointed to higher satisfaction levels for vocationally oriented courses, such as engineering and health. Satisfaction with those graduates was almost 10% higher than those from courses such as management and commerce. Birmingham said universities should be responding to those signals “to ensure course offerings are aligned with the expectations of employers so as to ultimately improve the job prospects of graduates”. But Norton said the funding mix between disciplines meant that freezing commonwealth funding would penalise health and engineering more than courses with lower employer satisfaction. This year commerce and law degrees will receive the lowest per student payment from the commonwealth, while health degrees receive among the highest. “If you’re enrolling students in commerce or law you still get most of the funding rate from the student contribution, indexed to inflation while the commonwealth’s share retracts,” Norton said. “And if the labour market demands areas such as health and engineering it doesn’t make a lot of economic sense to respond because at the margins universities will only get the student contribution, which is a third or less of the funding rate.” The 2017 employer satisfaction survey questioned more than 3,000 companies on their views. It found a 93% satisfaction rate with foundation skills such as general literacy, numeracy and communication skills and 90% satisfaction with adaptive skills such as teamwork. Universities Australia’s acting chief executive Catriona Jackson said the results showed university graduates were meeting employers’ expectations. “Employers have given university graduates the equivalent of a high distinction,” she said. “These results tell an overwhelmingly positive story about graduates in the labour market and that universities are preparing their students well for their chosen careers. “Employers are seeing, first-hand, the world-class quality of university graduates that we’re producing in Australia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/09/ashes-series-2017-2018-guardian-writers-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T10:00:16Z","webTitle":"Ashes 2017-18: our writers’ end-of-series awards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/09/ashes-series-2017-2018-guardian-writers-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/09/ashes-series-2017-2018-guardian-writers-awards","fields":{"headline":"Ashes 2017-18: our writers’ end-of-series awards","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Best player Steve Smith is a freak. To think he started the series with a supposed drought of international centuries having not raised the bat since March. This really is a special player we are watching. Adam Collins Steve Smith, of course. There was an element of self-denial in his batting. He could have swashbuckled more but decided against. Instead he took great pleasure in exhausting and exasperating England. Vic Marks Steve Smith, who eclipsed his opposite number and delivered a lesson to the England batsmen about putting a high price on his wicket. Only the good folk of Adelaide – where the ball moved – missed out on the Australian captain’s excellence. Ali Martin Steve Smith – who else? The 28-year-old has taken his game to a new level, racking up Bradman-esque numbers in the process. He adapted to conditions superbly – illustrated by his fastest and slowest hundreds among the three he scored – and led from the front. Jason Gillespie When he first played against England Steve Smith was dismissed as a joke. Now his run-scoring is ridiculous. The scale of his brilliance is demonstrated by one of the most used phrases of the series: “Behind only Donald Bradman”. Rob Smyth Breakthrough player What a lovely story Mitch Marsh is. Sure it took a while but he now has the game to match the belief. Well worth the wait. AC Pat Cummins had played only five Tests in five years. Here he played five in seven weeks and made Australia’s bowling attack complete. VM Dawid Malan arrived, with a maiden hundred in Perth and finishing with an average of 42.55. English tradition dictates we must now debate a move up the order. For Australia, Pat Cummins defied predictions superbly to get through the series. AM Dawid Malan has demonstrated he has the temperament for Test cricket against as good a bowling attack as there is going around. JG Dawid Malan emerged as this team’s Paul Collingwood: gritty, resourceful, adaptable and selfless. No England team should leave home without one. RS Best match We allowed ourselves to believe, for about 14 hours, that Adelaide was heading towards a classic finish. Annoyingly Australia’s bowlers decided otherwise. AC There were no great matches. There was the glimmer of a contest when we turned up for the final day in Adelaide, whereupon England were swept away at the venue which gave them their best chance of victory. VM Adelaide went into the fifth day with all four results still possible, even if it was quickly snuffed out in masterful fashion by Josh Hazlewood. But sadly, there was no classic to report on this tour despite 25 days of play across the series. AM Adelaide, as the first Ashes day/night Test and being as close as we got to a thriller. Being an Adelaide boy, am I going to say anything different? JG The joker of playing under lights at Adelaide led to umpteen plot twists and England were closer than the scorecard suggests to one of their greatest victories. RS Best moment Dave Warner’s dismissal that wasn’t on Boxing Day. It deserved to be debutant Tom Curran’s maiden scalp if he had not just overstepped. The roar of the crowd – first the Barmy Army then 88,000 locals in response – was something to savour. AC Steve Smith’s brilliant catch at second slip to dismiss Dawid Malan in Sydney seemed to sum up how he controlled the entire series like a puppetmaster. VM Mark Stoneman versus the quicks in Perth encapsulated the white heat of Ashes cricket but it was probably Mitchell Starc’s howitzer out of a crack that detonated James Vince’s stumps later in the same Test. Utterly unplayable. AM When Pat Cummins removed Chris Woakes in Perth, caught behind for the wicket that reclaimed the little urn for Australia. JG Nothing made the heart race with excitement like Mitchell Starc’s wonderball to James Vince at Perth. RS One thing I would have changed Scheduling. It continues to be a bad mistake having the two marquee Tests at Melbourne and Sydney played at the end of the series. They must be shuffled into the middle of the contest. AC They are considering changing the schedule so that Melbourne and Sydney become venues for the second and third Tests in the series with the final one in Adelaide on Australia Day. Not a bad idea. And the pitch in Melbourne. VM One thing I’d change would be the events during the early hours of 25 September in Bristol, which left a cloud over England’s tour off the field and damaged their team on it. AM Remove the tactical use of the DRS. It was originally brought in to minimise the howler decision. Let’s empower the umpires and back them to make the right decisions. JG The infantile, dishonest media coverage of non-stories like Jonny Bairstow’s social awkwardness and the supposed ball-tampering at Melbourne. Save that clickbait crap for football. RS The 2019 Ashes will be... When Australia get it together in England. They have struck gold with their fast-bowling trio and Steve Smith is the undisputed best player on the planet. Not a bad base from which to launch an Ashes campaign. AC Closer because they take place in England. Fitness permitting the key men in the Australian team will still be around. That may not apply to the England side. VM Played on emerald green pitches, probably, and provide England with some Ashes cheer after the inevitable semi-final meltdown in the World Cup that summer. AM Australia’s for the taking. They have the bowling attack to capitalise on English conditions. England rely heavily on too few with bat and ball. JG The last chance for the core of this Australian team to win a series in England and therefore, hopefully, a classic.

On receiving the accolade for the third time – the others coming in 2014 and 2016 – Oshoala was teary as the road to her latest win has been anything but straightforward. Having won the golden ball and the golden boot at the 2014 Under-20 Women’s World Cup as Nigeria finished runners-up – added to an African Cup of Nations winner’s medal the same year – the young striker started to turn heads internationally. So when she was unveiled as Liverpool’s latest recruit in January 2015, and with the then manager, Matt Beard, labelling her “one of the best young players in the world”, the transfer was headline news across Africa. Yet despite the evident talent, the Super Falcons star struggled to make her mark in England. After a year at Liverpool, blighted in the end by injury, and a switch to Arsenal, her two-year sojourn in Europe came to an end when she chose to join Dalian Quanjian in the Chinese Women’s Super League in February 2017. That is what has made this CAF player of the year award mean so much. With many writing her off she has proved she still has an eye for goal and bags of ability. All the while the Nigerian national team remains in long-term limbo having not played or trained since their 2016 ACN win. “I think it has to be the best moment of my career so far,” says Oshoala, reflecting on the award. “This is my third one and the best because 2017 was a very difficult journey for me. It was tough for myself, my family and everyone around me because I had to decide to leave Arsenal. A lot of people said to me: ‘Oh she’s going to China. She can’t make anything out of that.’” But rather than not cope Oshoala has thrived. With 12 goals she was the Chinese Super League’s topscorer, helping Quanjian to league and cup titles before being named the league’s best player. “At the end of the day it has been a great move for me. I had to put in a lot of work. I worked harder because I had to prove people wrong,” she says. It may not have worked out in England but Oshoala is grateful for her time at two of the WSL’s top clubs. When she joined Liverpool the club had won back-to-back WSL 1 titles and Oshoala took the inaugural BBC’s women’s player of the year award in May 2015. “I think I had a good time at Liverpool and Arsenal. When I was at Liverpool I hit good form. I then got injured and was out for the season. That was tough to take. Before the new season Arsenal came in for me and I thought: ‘I haven’t played for the second half of the season and the top team wants me.’ I had to take a chance and go there.” But the move south did not pan out: “It was good initially but I had a few issues and I had to choose whether to make the switch to the Chinese Super League.” Football in China is a different kettle of fish from that in England. However, it is also surprisingly competitive and growing. “We have more top players moving here from Europe. I get messages from different players around the world who want to know what the league is like. Of course the pay is better but it’s not just about the pay. Lots just want to experience something dramatically different.” And while the overall level may be considered lower, it is a more level playing field across the league. “When you go to England or France you see teams taking 7-0, 8-0 beatings but you don’t get that in China,” she says. “It’s much more even. Every team has players in the national team and players from abroad. That’s what you need. “I think this is one of the best leagues I’ve played in because it’s rare you see games with large margins. It’s difficult and competitive. If you don’t have a strong character and are coming from Europe for the first time, I think you would find it tough to adapt.” While her club football is more settled – she plans on staying in China for at least another season – the situation with the coachless international team is a struggle: “It’s been difficult for the team so far. It’s been hard for the girls fighting for wages [the team held a sit-in protest over unpaid allowances following their 2016 ACN win], getting friendly games for ourselves and fighting the federation to give us anything, to get us a coach. But I spoke with the federation president and they have a couple of friendly games lined up. One with France on 4 April has been announced already and I think 2018 will be better for us.” Being reliant on hand-outs from the men’s side is not the answer for Oshoala, though. “We don’t want to be sharing with the men’s team any more and waiting for the funds to be able to do things,” she said. “We need our own committees that can run things for the women. We also need top professional coaches. Football is getting harder. There are a lot of teams out there that are getting better every year. We need to do everything within our reach to move forward, keep people in Africa and make us strong enough to compete on a world stage.” Talking points • Manchester City’s recruit, Denmark international Nadia Nadim, wasted no time opening her WSL1 account, scoring in the sixth minute as they beat Reading 5-2 to maintain their unbeaten league campaign. Elsewhere a late own goal from Arsenal goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal handed Chelsea a thrilling 3-2 victory at Kingsmeadow watched by 2,570. Liverpool added to pointless Yeovil’s woes, beating them 8-0 on Merseyside. • In the draw for the Women’s FA Cup, Manchester City travel to Brighton, who will get a taste of life in the top tier before their move into WSL 1 next year. Arsenal visit Yeovil while Chelsea take on London Bees. Full draw here. • Lyon thrashed Racing Besançon 20-0 as they progressed to the last-16 of the Coupe de France. Ada Hegerberg and Eugénie Le Sommer both scored four. • In the transfer window Sarah Jones and Lilli Maple have rejoined Crystal Palace from Watford, London Bees have recruited Katie Wilkinson from Aston Villa and the PSG defender Laura Georges has left for Bayern Munich. Leah Galton has also joined the German club from Sky Blue in the US. • The Danish national women’s team, following their historic equal pay deal, have confirmed that television rights for all their home games until 2023 have been bought by national broadcaster DR."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/08/jeremy-corbyn-eu-single-market-after-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T21:11:28Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn insists UK cannot remain in single market after Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/08/jeremy-corbyn-eu-single-market-after-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/08/jeremy-corbyn-eu-single-market-after-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn insists UK cannot remain in single market after Brexit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has insisted the UK cannot be a member of the single market after Brexit, disappointing some of his pro-European Union MPs. The Labour leader told colleagues that it was not possible to stay in the single market, as he set out his Brexit policy to the parliamentary party on Monday night. Some within Labour have been increasing calls for Corbyn to listen to the party’s pro-EU membership and commit to staying in the trading bloc. But Corbyn stressed that this was not an option, as he addressed the reasons why he would not attend a single market summit convened by the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford. A senior Labour source said: “The single market is not a membership club that can be joined so we seek through negotiation to retain the benefits of the single market. “As he said in his letter back to Ian Blackford, the summit rests on the falsehood that the single market is a membership organisation which you can join, which it is not. Our approach for a jobs-first Brexit, which involves retaining the benefits of the single market, is through negotiation with the EU.” His comments prompted frustration from some pro-EU MPs in the meeting, who believed that Corbyn had been persuaded to keep the door open to staying in the single market for longer than the transitional period after Brexit. One Labour MP said: “The key thing is about keeping all the options on the table when it comes to the single market and customs union. It is clear from recent polling that an overwhelming majority of Labour members, supporters and voters believe this.” Corbyn explained to his MPs and peers that Labour would now be embarking on a fresh push to prepare for government. His shadow ministers will have meetings to discuss policy and strategy over the next week and are not expected to be subjected to a reshuffle. “This weak and struggling government is causing untold damage – and we need to replace it as soon as is possible,” he told the parliamentary party. “So, as I said in my new year message, we are staking out the new centre ground, as a government in waiting.” He signalled Labour’s intention to keep up the pressure on the government on domestic policy issues, while branding May’s reshuffle as “a pointless and lacklustre PR exercise”. “We’re not only seeing growing problems across the NHS; the cost of travel is going up; our social security system is being dismantled; our housing crisis has been cruelly exposed by the terrible Grenfell fire, and by the Conservatives in Windsor who want to sweep rough sleepers from the streets and the government’s threat to jobs and living standards from its chaotic Brexit negotiations,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/08/netanyahu-son-bragged-about-gas-deal-outside-strip-club-tape-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T12:44:21Z","webTitle":"Netanyahu son bragged about gas deal outside strip club, tape reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/08/netanyahu-son-bragged-about-gas-deal-outside-strip-club-tape-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/08/netanyahu-son-bragged-about-gas-deal-outside-strip-club-tape-reveals","fields":{"headline":"Netanyahu son bragged about gas deal outside strip club, tape reveals","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lawyers for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanayhu, tried to stop the broadcast of an embarrassing audiotape in which Netanyahu’s son Yair suggested his father helped push through a $20bn deal to the benefit of a gas tycoon. The recording of the conversation, which took place outside a strip club, is the latest revelation to cast light on the Netanyahu family’s relationships with wealthy tycoons, which have so far spawned two corruption investigations into the prime minister’s activities. According to the Israel Television Channel, the tape features the voices of Yair Netanyahu and Ori Maimon, a son of the gas tycoon Kobi Maimon. Maimon Sr is a shareholder in Isramco, which owns the Tamar gas fields. According to the reports, Yair and friends, with his government-provided security guard and driver in tow, were going from one strip club to another. He and Maimon can apparently be heard arguing about 400 shekels ($116) as they leave the club, with Yair reportedly telling his companion: “Bro, you got to spot me. My dad made an awesome deal for your dad, bro, he fought, fought in the Knesset for this, bro.” He continues: “Bro, my dad now arranged for you a $20bn deal and you can’t spot me 400 shekels?” The recording was apparently made in 2015, at a time when Israel was in the midst of a political controversy over newly discovered natural gas deposits and the rights to drill in them. What is most likely to cause uproar in Israel is the revelation that a state security guard and government-provided car ferried Netanyahu’s son and his friends between strip clubs. The provision of a security detail for Netanyahu’s children was already controversial. While Yair, now 26, has a reputation for his crass behaviour, his remarks – serious or not – also feed into a growing sense of outrage in Israel over the cosy relationship between the Netanyahus and wealthy businessmen. The disclosure of the tape comes at a highly sensitive moment for Benjamin Netanyahu as he awaits police recommendations in two corruption investigations into his behaviour, one of which involved the receipt of gifts from wealthy benefactors. That investigation, known as Case 1000, involves the billionaire Australian businessman James Packer, whose own relationship with Yair Netanyahu has come under the spotlight. Public concern over the slow pace of the police investigations have spawned weekly anti-corruption demonstrations calling for Netanyahu to stand down. The Netanyahu family attorney, Yossi Cohen, sent an urgent letter to the Israel Television News Company on Monday demanding it withhold the recording’s contents from the public. In a statement to the television channel, a spokesman for the Netanyahu family said the recording was a “witch-hunt” meant to undermine the prime minister. In an apology issued later by Yair Netanyahu he said: “In a evening conversation, under the influence of alcohol, I spoke nonsense about women and other things that were better left unsaid. “These remarks do not reflect who I am, the values on which I was raised and my beliefs. I regret the remarks and apologise if anyone was hurt by them. In addition, the things I said to Maimon were a dumb joke and joking around with him, as anyone could tell. I never took an interest in the natural-gas framework agreement and never had any idea about its details,” he said in a statement. In his own remarks on the affair, Netanyahu said: “My son was correct in saying yesterday that he had spoken foolish words. He said, it’s not me, Yair. He said that these are not the values that characterise him. And he’s right.” Yair Netanyahu last year drew unexpected praise from US neo-Nazis – including the far-right website Daily Stormer – after posting an antisemitic meme on social media. The image showed the billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a frequent target of antisemitic attacks, with a reptilian creature and a hooded, hook-nosed Elder of Zion–type dangling inducements before three of the family’s enemies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/09/take-the-kids-to-ragged-school-museum-east-london","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T06:30:01Z","webTitle":"Take the kids to … the Ragged School Museum, east London ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/09/take-the-kids-to-ragged-school-museum-east-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/09/take-the-kids-to-ragged-school-museum-east-london","fields":{"headline":"Take the kids to … the Ragged School Museum, east London ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In a nutshell In 1877 Dr Thomas Barnardo opened the Copperfield Road Free School, the largest of three ragged schools (charitable institutions that offered the poorest children a free education) in a row of three warehouses on Regent’s Canal in Tower Hamlets. Now an underfunded, independent museum (opened in 1990), a small exhibition offers an insight into how tough life was in east London in the late 1800s, but the highlight is one of the original classrooms where visitors can attend a lesson led by an actor in Victorian costume. The museum is in the second phase of applying for a lottery grant, which will allow it to make vital repairs to the largest of the three warehouses, though the aim is to retain the authentic atmosphere of the building. Fun fact In 1881, Dr Barnardo took 2,500 Sunday school children by train on an outing to Theydon Bois in Essex. Best thing about it The lesson. We sat at small wooden desks while stern “Miss Perkins”, dressed in long skirt, high necked blouse and wire-rimmed glasses, taught us our letters and numbers, slamming her cane down on her lectern if any of us misbehaved. My seven-year-old son was slightly appalled at the idea of going to school on a Sunday but enjoyed it once he got there, especially learning about the various cruel punishments Victorian school children were subjected to. A dressing up box of torn clothes means kids can look the part during class. What about lunch? The tiny “cafe” is little more than a counter with a kettle. It’s a latte-free zone though this didn’t stop one smartly dressed customer asking for one. Tea, instant coffee and hot chocolate are all £1. There are packets of bourbon and digestive biscuits (40p), Snickers bars and that’s about it. We sat at the window with our drinks, watching a coot build its nest on the canal. Exit through the gift shop? Often the bête noire of this column, I felt obliged to buy something just to support the project. Pocket money toys (marbles, pencils, skipping ropes, minature cars, balloons) cost £1-£2. There are also a few books on local history and postcards (30p). Value for money It’s free – donations are encouraged. Opening hours Between 10am and 5pm every Wednesday and Thursday, and 2pm to 5pm on the first Sunday of each month when lessons (2.15pm or 3.30pm) are offered on a first come, first served basis. There are activities during school holidays (Wednesdays and Thursdays only). Outside these times the museum runs a schools programme, with 16,000 school children coming through the doors each year. Getting there The nearest stations are Mile End tube and LimehouseNational Rail/Docklands Light Railway. Or it’s a bus ride from Liverpool Street or Stratford rail stations. Verdict I loved it. It’s utterly uncommercial though this is due to lack of funds more than intention. This is an authentic slice of East End history that strives to inspire children through its work. Lottery money will help them modernise the exhibition and cafe. 7/10. • raggedschoolmuseum.org.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/09/east-coast-line-tory-scandal-bailout","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Catch the East Coast line – a fast track to Tory incompetence and scandal | Aditya Chakrabortty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/east-coast-line-tory-scandal-bailout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/east-coast-line-tory-scandal-bailout","fields":{"headline":"Catch the East Coast line – a fast track to Tory incompetence and scandal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 1787, a splendid metaphor was born. Catherine the Great of Russia set out on a cruise along the River Dnieper to survey a new colony. To wow the empress, her lover, Prince Gregory Potemkin, organised fake villages along the bank and tricked out his men as honest serfs. As Catherine’s boat floated by, the serfs stood and cheered – then stripped off, dismantled their settlements and ran downstream to do it all over again. And so the world was gifted the Potemkin village – a byword for ruling-class deceit and disinformation. While the Kremlin has cornered the market in Potemkinism, dictators everywhere like to indulge. Only, the more you look around today’s Britain, the more Potemkin villages you see. When Windsor’s council leader tells the police to clear his streets of homeless people before Harry and Meghan’s wedding, he speaks a language any tsar would grasp. When the NHS stops doing routine operations yet whistles that all is business as normal, it’s practising Potemkinism. And then there’s the way ministers act with our railways. Britain’s privatised railways are rife with facades and fakery. Interviewed by Andrew Marr at the weekend, Theresa May claimed that private ownership of our train services had brought a flood of extra cash. Indeed it has – not from the businesses, but from us, the public. We’ve paid for all the real investment in the railways – whether in Pendolinos or on the track – which is how we’ve ended up with an extra £30bn in national debt. Ministers pretend that the woeful Southern Railway is a private train service. Yet Southern is controlled by the state, which hands it to a company to run. Southern’s ultimate managers are little more than government officials, paid billions by the state to leave stricken commuters miles from home. As for Prince Field Marshal Potemkin, he has clearly been reincarnated as Chris Grayling. Quite a comedown, I’ll admit – from handsome swashbuckler to an oh-yes-he-is, oh-no-he-definitely-isn’t Tory party chairman. But what Russia’s commander-in-chief did with an army, Grayling attempts with bureaucracy and bullshit. Consider: in the run-up to Christmas, the transport secretary issues a new rail strategy. For the most part neither new nor strategic, the 44-page document does have buried deep inside mention of an “East Coast partnership”. That, Grayling insists, is not a bailout. It turns out to be a bailout. Virgin Trains East Coast (Vtec) offered the government £3.3bn to run the services between London and Leeds, Edinburgh and Aberdeen from 2015 till 2023. Even at the time, that was silly money. When Vtec’s baloney business forecasts turned out to be just that and the company began losing money, its managers and owners set about lobbying. It appears to have worked: Grayling is letting Vtec out of the contract in 2020, three years early. As for the £3.3bn Vtec promised taxpayers, we’ll be lucky to get half that. According to executives’ latest modelling, by 2020 they plan to have paid a total of £1.7bn. That leaves £1.6bn missing. This stitch-up is, as former transport minister Andrew Adonis says, indefensible. It will put you and me hundreds of millions out of pocket; it is bound to disrupt commuters, and it has cost Whitehall more time and money to sort out the replacement. Meanwhile, the billionaire owners of Vtec have just been rewarded for grotesque business failure with a ministerial card reading “get out of jail free”. When business is booming, the operators never offered to cough up an extra penny. Now that reality isn’t conforming with their fanciful forecasts, they cry on a ministerial shoulder and are offered a multimillion-pound concession. What’s more, any other train service in financial trouble now has the precedent to demand Whitehall cuts them a similar concession. With one bungled decision, the transport secretary has shifted all the risk from the private sector to taxpayers, while leaving the businessmen with all of the cashflow and none of the recriminations. In Grayling-speak, this counts as a triumph. But remember: this same meathead once made it his job to stop prisoners getting books. He could have fined the Vtec managers. He could have prevented them running any new train franchise. He should certainly have done what Adonis did in 2009 to National Express, the last private-sector firm to run into trouble on the East Coast line: confiscate the business and nationalise it. The best demonstration of Grayling’s leniency is the way Richard Branson has started doing the Tory’s PR, hailing his “pragmatic decision”. Meanwhile, shares in his partner company Stagecoach shoot up 12% on the ministerial announcement – a sure sign that someone is making money out of this deal, and that it’s not the taxpayer. Stagecoach, by the way, is on the shortlist for three other rail franchises – it will almost certainly score one or more of them. For our Potemkin minister, the operators of East Coast mainline make the perfect fit. Both company and the trains bear the Virgin logo, but it is in fact 90% owned by Stagecoach; the Virgin group has only a 10% stake. These are two of the biggest transport names in the world. Both are involved in running the West Coast mainline. Yet neither have ever offered extra cash to the public purse when business is booming. Naturally, Branson preens at photocalls for his new superfast fleet, claiming, “We’ve brought in the new Azuma train.” This, it is implied, is his much-trumpeted investment. What he fails to mention is that the entire £2.5bn fleet was initiated, commissioned and paid for by the government. Neither Virgin nor Stagecoach need public handouts. Branson is worth £5bn, while Stagecoach’s founders, Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, are also stars of the Rich List. Last financial year, the CEO of Stagecoach got £966,000 in pay and benefits. More to the point, the academic researchers at Corporate Welfare Watch calculate that, between 2011 and 2014, Stagecoach took over £1.2bn in government grants while Virgin Trains received £834m in grants and subsidies. Stagecoach, responding on behalf of itself and Virgin Trains, says it “doesn’t recognise” these sums , but they are documented and sourced on the Corporate Welfare Watch website. The message is: companies can milk the public for billions when they’ve got a good story to tell – but when the story has an unhappy ending, they can milk the public for hundreds of millions more. The commentariat has paid next to no attention to this fiasco. But the East Coast mainline is a far bigger story. This is one of the largest contracts government has with the private sector. On the other side of the table, two of the biggest businesses in Britain have just been thrown one hell of a bone. This is a grade-A scandal. Labour should really go after this one. All they need is to be smart and fast – because this debacle is big and important enough to warrant Grayling’s resignation. The story of Potemkin, don’t forget, ended with him being rumbled almost immediately. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist • This article was amended on 17 January 2018 to clarify that Stagecoach was also responding on behalf of Virgin Trains and on 15 March 2018 to replace a reference to Virgin with a reference to Vtec, the partnership of Stagecoach and Virgin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/08/theresa-mays-reshuffle-thrown-off-course-by-defiant-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T21:42:45Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's reshuffle in disarray as Justine Greening quits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/08/theresa-mays-reshuffle-thrown-off-course-by-defiant-ministers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/08/theresa-mays-reshuffle-thrown-off-course-by-defiant-ministers","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's reshuffle in disarray as Justine Greening quits","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Theresa May’s new year reshuffle was thrown off course when senior members of the cabinet refused to move and Justine Greening quit the government after turning down a job as work and pensions secretary. Earlier, Jeremy Hunt rejected a new position as business secretary and instead persuaded the prime minister to allow him to remain at health in a beefed-up role taking on more responsibility for social care. That meant that a planned move for Greg Clark did not go ahead, and he instead remained at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The result was a less dramatic shake-up than planned on a day that began with a social media gaffe in which the Conservatives’ official Twitter feed wrongly congratulated Chris Grayling for becoming party chair. In fact, Patrick McLoughlin was replaced by Brandon Lewis, the Great Yarmouth MP, and Grayling remained as transport secretary. Greening spent more than two hours inside No 10 before refusing to take up a role at the helm of the Department for Work and Pensions and being removed as education secretary. The Putney MP’s resistance followed days of newspaper reports suggesting she was facing the sack. A government source said: “Justine was offered DWP but declined to take it. The prime minister is disappointed but respects her decision to leave government.” Greening, who is seen as on the modernising wing of the Conservative party, was praised by the party’s leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, and backbencher, Heidi Allen. Davidson said she was sorry to see the minister go Allen said she was “bitterly disappointed” for her colleague, adding: “A dreadful shame we have lost such a progressive, listening, compassionate woman from government”. Another Tory MP, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian it was a “dreadful error to let her go”, adding: “May gives in to the boys but effectively sacks a woman born and raised in Rotherham, who went to the local comprehensive, who is bright and more than able, and who won a marginal seat beating Labour – oh, and she happens to be in a same sex relationship.” Supporters of Greening argued that she had worked hard to improve the party’s popularity with teachers, among whom support had slumped in recent years, and had focused heavily on technical education and social mobility. According to allies, Greening wanted to remain in position, focusing on young people, rather than take up her fourth secretary of state role. She tweeted that it had been an “honour and privilege” to serve since 2010 and would continue focusing on “equality of opportunity for young people”. The MP who represents Putney, a London constituency with a young electorate that voted heavily to remain in the EU referendum, is likely to be outspoken on re-engaging with younger voters and on the question of Brexit. Her departure came after one senior Tory told the Guardian that Greening had been seen as too close to the teaching trade unions and resistant to the party’s education policies. Another figure claimed she had been thought of as overly vocal and critical during cabinet meetings. Greening was replaced by Damian Hinds as education secretary, while Esther McVey was named work and pensions secretary. Other key moves included Matt Hancock taking over at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; Karen Bradley moving to the Northern Ireland office; and David Gauke becoming justice secretary. That role was vacated by David Lidington, who took over in the Cabinet office, replacing Damian Green who was forced to resign for failing to tell the truth about pornography found on his work computer. Lidington, the former Europe minister, will chair key Brexit cabinet committees and deputise for May at prime minister’s questions, but he was not given the title of first secretary of state. Many other positions remained unchanged with Philip Hammond staying as chancellor, Amber Rudd as home secretary, David Davis in charge of Brexit, Boris Johnson as foreign secretary and Liam Fox at trade. Rudd will take over the responsibilities of minister for women and equalities - a role that was carried out by Greening. Sajid Javid’s department was renamed the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government as part of May’s domestic policy drive that will see a particular focus on housing, school standards, the environment and the NHS. Other ministers keeping their positions included the chief whip, Julian Smith, international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, and Elizabeth Truss who will continue to attend cabinet as chief secretary in the Treasury. James Brokenshire resigned as Northern Ireland secretary for health reasons. Hunt, who was initially slated to become business secretary but stayed at the Department of Health, had to apologise on Twitter on Monday night for pressing the “like” button on a tweet that said Greening had quit government. He quickly made clear that it was a mistake. James Cleverly, MP for Braintree, was appointed deputy chair, while there were 13 additional posts of vice chair covering areas such as youth, women, communities, business and policy. One of the appointments was Kemi Badenoch, the MP for Saffron Walden. Rob Halfon, a select committee chair who has called for his party to do more to win over working class voters, said the appointments of Lewis, Cleverly and Badenoch marked “Essex man and woman taking over the top echelons of the party”. “This means we are a white van Conservative party and that is a good thing,” he said, arguing that the new Conservative HQ team had people who believed in social justice, had a strong work ethic and understood modern campaigning. “That is radical but what will be really key is whether [the prime minister] does the same on Tuesday in ministerial positions.” Sources said that May hoped to use the second day of her reshuffle to boost the Conservative party’s “talent pipeline”, ensuring that the wider ministerial team was younger, with more female and minority ethnic MPs, to make the party more representative of voters. The changes did not see more female MPs in full cabinet roles, but did increase the number of women invited to attend cabinet to 10. Jeremy Corbyn told Labour party’s MPs that the impact of “Tory austerity” was hitting home in 2018 and that the country was suffering the most serious NHS winter crisis yet. “And yet the government’s big plan for the new year is to dodge the real issues and reshuffle the pack in a pointless and lacklustre PR exercise.” The former Tory chancellor, George Osborne, noted that a number of his old Treasury colleagues had been promoted in what he called an “unusual reshuffle”, naming Gauke, Hinds, Javid, Clark and Hancock. However, he said he was sorry to see Greening go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/08/turkish-cyprus-set-for-coalition-after-rightwing-party-fails-to-get-majority","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T22:39:24Z","webTitle":"Turkish Cyprus set for coalition after rightwing party fails to get majority","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/08/turkish-cyprus-set-for-coalition-after-rightwing-party-fails-to-get-majority","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/08/turkish-cyprus-set-for-coalition-after-rightwing-party-fails-to-get-majority","fields":{"headline":"Turkish Cyprus set for coalition after rightwing party fails to get majority","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Efforts are set to begin on forming a coalition government in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus after the rightwing National Unity party won parliamentary elections but failed to secure a majority in parliament. In a setback for forces seeking to reunite the island’s feuding ethnic communities, the UBP won 35.6% and 21 seats in the 50-member house – a reflection of its control over the levers of power after 27 years in office. The pro-solution and centre-left Republican Turkish party (CTP) came in with 20.9% and 12 seats. Turkey, the only country to recognise the self-styled republic and its main financial backer, was quick to congratulate the prime minister, Huseyin Ozgurgun. But how easy power sharing will be is far from sure. Longevity in office has also had a corrosive effect. The UBP – previously in coalition with the stridently nationalistic Democratic party which won 7.8% and three seats – has been widely linked in the statelet to corruption and malpractice. The snap election was held against a backdrop of broad voter disaffection and allegations of abuse of power, misappropriation of public funds and anger over perceived subservience to Turkey. For the first time, debate over how to overhaul the system eclipsed the Cyprus issue – and talk of reuniting an island divided since 1974 when an attempted coup aimed at union with Greece spurred Turkey to invade. The reformist People’s party (HP), which emerged third with 18.1% and nine seats had, like the CTP, ruled out cooperating with the rightists before the poll. At least 26 seats are required to form a government. “The central theme of this election was corruption and good governance and the UBP and Democratic party are synonymous with corrupt and bad government,” said Hubert Faustmann, professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia. “They will find it difficult to form a government unless the CTP and HP betray their election pledge.” What had emerged, he said, was a murky political landscape where neither hardliners nor moderates had triumphed. Even if the Rebirth party, representing Turkish settlers, which won two seats, joined forces with the UBP and Democratic party, the three-way government would be in with a wafer-thin majority."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2018/jan/09/disney-fox-superhero-movies-marvel-cinematic-universe","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T13:04:19Z","webTitle":"Apocalypse now: what happens when the X-Men crash the Marvel Cinematic Universe?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/jan/09/disney-fox-superhero-movies-marvel-cinematic-universe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2018/jan/09/disney-fox-superhero-movies-marvel-cinematic-universe","fields":{"headline":"Apocalypse now: what happens when the X-Men crash the Marvel Cinematic Universe?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When it comes to flawed big screen superheroes, Marvel has always been top dog. There’s Iron Man, the billionaire, genius and philanthropist who nevertheless struggles in his private life (and once almost accidentally caused the destruction of humankind with his techie meddling). There’s Spider-Man, the young hero who seems to find defeating bad guys a whole lot easier than negotiating the complexities of teenage life in the Big Apple. And there’s Thor, whose original concept of heroism clashed so badly with that of his dad Odin that he was cast out of Asgard for being a pompous gasbag. Mistakes, for Earth’s mightiest heroes, seem to come with the territory. And yet ever since Robert Downey Jr’s Tony Stark first climbed into his shiny red suit almost a decade ago now, the studio behind the Avengers has refused to make any major blunders of its own. Apart from the odd early gaffe (The Incredible Hulk) and mid-period folly (Thor: The Dark World, Ant-Man) Marvel has pursued the task of creating a credible universe for its superheroes with a remarkable knack for mostly getting it right. Even the dimmer instalments failed to knock the wider galaxy of shiny superstars off course, largely because Marvel always seems to have something bigger and brighter waiting to be released. Thor 2 was followed into multiplexes by the double whammy of Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy, while Ant-Man segued smoothly into the hard-hitting superhero smack down of Captain America: Civil War and the mesmerising comic-book head movie known as Doctor Strange. Like a football manager who effortlessly integrates his latest £100m signing into an established team of champions, Marvel supremo Kevin Feige has gently introduced new heroes such as Strange and Tom Holland’s Spider-Man to the ranks of the Avengers without risking the overall balance of the team. The key has been meticulous planning and a refusal to rush movies into production, two basic rules of engagement that rival DC has singularly failed to follow (and reaped the consequences). But there’s an argument that Feige et al face their greatest challenge yet following Disney’s $66bn purchase of 20th Century Fox last month, which brought the X-Men under the same big-screen banner as the Avengers (just as they are in the comics) for the first time in the modern era, and presumably means there is nothing to stop Disney-owned Marvel from incorporating Fox’s legions of mutant superheroes into the wider MCU. The clamour for Wolverine, Deadpool and co to appear in Marvel films has already begun. But Feige would be wise to continue the softly softly approach that has served him so well. Because the X-verse, such as it is, has the potential to ruin all the hard work Marvel has put into the MCU up until now if it is not integrated properly. Whereas Marvel has been set up from the beginning as a unified space for its heroes to have adventures in, Fox has approached its rights to the X-Men in a far more muddled way. While the main X-Men series all sit together on the same timeline, movies such as Logan and Deadpool are far less conclusively part of the same universe, to the extent that different actors (Tómas Lemarquis and Stephen Merchant) played mutant Caliban in X-Men: Apocalypse and Logan, even though the two films were released just nine months apart. Fox currently has X-Men movies Deadpool 2, The New Mutants, Dark Phoenix, Gambit, X-Force and the James Franco-starrer Multiple Man on its slate. Of these, only Deadpool 2 and X-Force are likely to boast the kind of joined up thinking that is a cast iron requirement for inclusion in the MCU. The New Mutants does not even fit the same genre as its stablemates. Josh Boone’s tale of four young people with nascent powers who have been trapped in a mysterious facility by unknown forces is largely being pitched as a horror movie, so the integration of its core characters into the reasonably cheery MCU appears unlikely. There are Fox superheroes who could be seamlessly integrated, of course. Deadpool has often had an amusing man-crush on Spider-Man in the comics, and Marvel has even begun to borrow the zany, meta-fuelled style of Tim Miller’s 2016 movie for its own entries. (Thor: Ragnarok is a case in point) Wolverine, with Hugh Jackman having finally hung up his adamantium claws, looks ripe for a Spidey-style reboot within the Marvel fold, and an MCU-led reinvention of the core X-Men (Professor X, Magneto, Jean Grey, Storm etc) would certainly be something to see. Yet what would happen to the actors playing these characters, currently stuck in the 1990s? James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender have occasionally done sterling work as Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr respectively, but would presumably have to be aged up were they to suddenly turn up in the modern day MCU. Perhaps Doctor Strange could somehow pop back in time and rescue them from their current purgatory, some time after next year’s Dark Phoenix? But what would happen to the superheroes who don’t fit snugly into the MCU? Would they continue to plough their own furrows? Would Disney-Fox simply draw a line under their big-screen adventures and reboot? This might be a pity, particularly in the case of offbeat curios such as Multiple Man and James Mangold’s mooted Logan spin-off about Dafne Keen’s X-23. Neither seems likely to survive a Disney-led cull, should it prove to be in the offing. Marvel has its own problems to override as it approaches a second decade of the MCU. With Captain Marvel and Black Panther – both potentially totemic figures – due to get their own standalone movies in 2018 and 2019, it could be 2020 before the studio has the chance to begin integrating the X-Men into its wider world of superheroes. Feige has hinted he is not even certain that the universe will continue to exist in its current form, which suggests that the events of this year’s Avengers: Infinity War and its 2019 sequel could be so monumental as to throw doubt on everything Marvel has so far given us. Does the studio really need the added complication of being forced to add the X-Men into the mix? On the other hand, might integrating Marvel Comics’ mutants prove to be the fresh injection of energy that the MCU needs to keep it thriving well into the 2020s? One thing’s for sure, Feige and his team can’t afford to start making major blunders this late in the game. The future of the world might not be at stake, as it usually is when Tony Stark and his pals drop the baton, but the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe certainly could be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/08/bundy-family-charges-dropped-nevada-armed-standoff","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T22:39:59Z","webTitle":"Stunning victory for Bundy family as all charges dismissed in 2014 standoff case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/08/bundy-family-charges-dropped-nevada-armed-standoff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/08/bundy-family-charges-dropped-nevada-armed-standoff","fields":{"headline":"Stunning victory for Bundy family as all charges dismissed in 2014 standoff case","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A judge has dismissed conspiracy charges against rancher Cliven Bundy and his sons, marking an extraordinary failure by US prosecutors and a decisive victory for the Nevada family who ignited a land rights movement in the American west.

Cliven Bundy, 71, and his sons Ammon and Ryan were accused of assault, threats against the government, firearms offenses and obstruction, stemming from the family’s refusal to pay grazing fees for their cattle in Nevada, which escalated into an armed conflict at their ranch in 2014. The judge declared a mistrial in December and ruled on Monday that prosecutors could not retry the case, arguing that the US attorney’s office had willfully withheld evidence and engaged in misconduct. Angie Bundy, Ryan’s wife, said she hoped the ruling would boost states’ rights and encourage federal regulators to leave ranchers alone. “The federal government is overstepping so many bounds. I’m hoping they will let states and counties do their jobs and stay out of our land,” she told the Guardian by phone from court. “I hear from ranchers all the time about the horrible abuses they are enduring. I’m hoping this will give some people relief.” The stunning defeat for the government – which has also been accused of lying and deceptive tactics in their prosecution of the Bundys – outraged environmental groups that have advocated the punishment of ranchers who defy land-use laws and have supported tighter regulations to protect public lands. “It’s just a horrific outcome,” said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity. “This is going to empower both the militia and the politicians who want to steal America’s public lands. It’s an absolute disaster.” The Bundys first made international headlines in 2014 when the government attempted to seize their cattle, but retreated in the face of hundreds of supporters at the family ranch in Bunkerville, some heavily armed. Emboldened by the victory, Ammon and Ryan helped lead a takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon in January 2016 to protest against the imprisonment of two local ranchers. That standoff ended after police killed one of the leaders and arrested the Bundys and their followers. US prosecutors subsequently charged the family and dozens of other men with conspiracy and other charges for both the Nevada and Oregon cases. A jury found the Bundys not guilty in Oregon in 2016, a surprise verdict that increased pressure on the federal government to secure a conviction in Nevada. But the case unraveled after defense attorneys argued that prosecutors failed to disclose evidence relating to government surveillance cameras and snipers at the ranch during the 2014 dispute. Last month, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, directed a US justice department expert to assist in the case. Suckling pointed out that Bundy’s cattle continue to graze on federal lands in violation of the law and argued that the decision could encourage supporters to launch new conflicts to fight for unregulated grazing, mining and logging on public lands. “I’m really distraught and outraged at the prosecution and the FBI for their incompetence.” Cliven Bundy, who became a hero to some rightwing activists in the west and has been in jail for nearly two years, emerged from court on Monday wearing a cowboy hat, telling reporters: “I’m feeling pretty good … I’m not used to being free. I’ve been a political prisoner.” Angie said she was grateful to hear the judge Gloria Navarro reprimand prosecutors. “Her words today gave me some hope in the justice system,” she said, adding, “We are so excited to get grandpa home and get our family back together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/09/alton-towers-the-wicker-man-rollercoaster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T09:28:27Z","webTitle":"Sorry, Alton Towers.

The Wicker Man just isn’t a rollercoaster ride","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I don’t know what The Wicker Man did to hurt people, but enough is probably enough. What began as one of the greatest British movies of all time is about to become, of all things, a rollercoaster. Alton Towers has just unveiled a new Wicker Man attraction, featuring an eponymous 58ft effigy that bursts into flame as you plunge in and out of it at high speed. A chilling, folky, doom-laden meditation on the consequences of unchecked religion now shares a form of entertainment with Professor Burp’s Bubbleworks. The indignity. It’s a move akin to making a Rosemary’s Baby board game, or a Don’t Look Now inflatable bouncy castle set. It doesn’t make a terrific amount of sense, all said. The Wicker Man – in which Edward Woodward visits a remote island to track down a missing child – is a film that lives and dies on its ability to build a slow sense of mounting dread. When Woodward’s Sergeant Neil Howie arrives on Summerisle, the audience is struck by a muted and unexplained disquiet. It takes an hour and a half for that disquiet to come into full, roaring focus; by the time the island’s horrifying masterplan has been revealed, we’ve come too far to ever find our way back again. It is bleak and brilliant and unusually literate, and it absolutely does not lend itself to a 90-second children’s ride that ends with a polite reminder that photos of your experience are available at the exit for 20 quid. Of course, The Wicker Man isn’t the first horror film to become a rollercoaster. For the last nine years, Thorpe Park has been running a ride based on the Saw franchise; a series which, in part, delighted in drowning people in vats of liquidised pig intestine. But that rollercoaster makes perfect sense, because it’s based on a film that teenage boys like. The Saw films are all immediate and visceral. They’re a non-stop joyride of scream and squelch that pander to our basest instincts. They are a dare, a game of chicken. They are probably the closest that films can get to rollercoasters. I’ve ridden the Saw coaster myself, and it is exactly like the films. It starts, you go “argh”, then you go “yuck”, then it ends and you never think about it again. It’s perfect. All of which puts it on the exact opposite end of the horror spectrum to The Wicker Man. Show the average teenage boy The Wicker Man and, aside from the moment where you see Britt Ekland’s (double’s) bum, it wouldn’t be able to hold their interest at all. It’s too slow-moving and thoughtful to be adopted into such a mainstream attraction. You’d have better luck making a rollercoaster based on Eyes Without a Face or Under the Skin or Amour. I might be getting this wrong, of course. I might have misread the press release and not realised that The Wicker Man ride is actually based on the 2006 Neil LaBute film, where Nicolas Cage punches a woman in a bear suit and then gets murdered by bees. But even then, that doesn’t deserve to become a rollercoaster either. It deserves to become an attraction where a stranger puts a metal dustbin over your head and beats you unconscious with a cricket bat. Whichever way you slice it, The Wicker Man is simply not rollercoaster material. Unless all of this is a ruse. I’ve been giving it some thought and I’ve come to the conclusion that, while a rollercoaster absolutely does not suit The Wicker Man, a rollercoaster queue does. Think about it, you spend hours and hours laid bare before the elements in a weird and forced situation, often surrounded by evangelical people you neither like nor trust as your back starts to ache and your guts start to churn, to the point that you end up questioning your desire to even join it in the first place. Perhaps the most faithful thing that Alton Towers could do to The Wicker Man ride is just make it a tedious, endless queue to nowhere that ends with a video of one of your pets burning to death. Now that’s a rollercoaster I could get behind. • Stuart Heritage writes about film, TV and music for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/09/hacked-off-data-protection-bill-fail-victims-consumers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T13:00:19Z","webTitle":"Hacked and hacked off: without change this new data law will fail victims | Alex Neill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/hacked-off-data-protection-bill-fail-victims-consumers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/hacked-off-data-protection-bill-fail-victims-consumers","fields":{"headline":"Hacked and hacked off: without change this new data law will fail victims","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Your name, your email address, your home address, your bank details, your credit or debit card details. You probably cannot count the number of times that you have been asked to share these important pieces of personal data with a company or organisation in the past weeks or months. As more and more of us report sharing an ever increasing volume of our personal information online, is enough being done to keep it safe? The more information we share, the greater the risk there is of us falling victim to a data breach. While in some cases you may just need to update all your passwords, the loss of more important, personal data could have serious consequences, including leaving you at greater risk of being subject to fraud. Over the past year, we have seen reports of high-profile hacks of numerous organisations – Yahoo, Uber and Equifax to name just three. More recently we have heard about the serious security flaw in Intel’s computer processors that could leave millions of people around the globe at risk of a data breach. It’s not surprising that in a recent study we found that nearly three-quarters (73%) of people were concerned that the information they had shared online could be at risk of a leak. Despite regular news about such massive hacks, there is still no system in place for consumers affected by a data breach to seek collective redress. Such a mechanism would allow for independent bodies to represent classes comprised of all consumers negatively impacted by a data breach, which hadn’t been properly handled by the organisation that held that data, whether or not the consumers were aware that they had been affected. This would streamline the process, implementing a time- and cost-efficient way to deliver effective justice for victims. At present, if a company does not offer you redress directly, it is only available through a lengthy and potentially expensive route that an individual would need to take via the courts. In addition, we recently found that as many as one in five people don’t know how to claim redress following a data breach. The data protection bill is currently being debated in the House of Lords, which gives the government a unique opportunity to amend it to offer greater protection to consumers. In its current form it is inadequate for holding organisations to account when there is a breach of data laws, since it relies on individuals knowing they are affected, knowing their rights and proactively starting a claim or appointing a representative. It must be amended so that independent organisations acting in the public interest can help groups of affected consumers to get redress. The clock is ticking. The House of Lords must use this opportunity to support consumers’ ability to hold companies to account or risk shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. • Alex Neill is managing director of home products and services at Which?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/11/czech-voters-to-give-verdict-on-presidents-anti-immigrant-populism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"Czech voters to give verdict on president's anti-immigrant populism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/11/czech-voters-to-give-verdict-on-presidents-anti-immigrant-populism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/11/czech-voters-to-give-verdict-on-presidents-anti-immigrant-populism","fields":{"headline":"Czech voters to give verdict on president's anti-immigrant populism","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Czech president, Miloš Zeman, has been accused of promoting a climate of “vulgarity, incompetence and corruption” as the Czech Republic heads into a presidential election widely seen as a referendum on his controversial brand of anti-immigrant populism and the country’s place in the western alliance. The scathing critique has been issued by a rival candidate, Jiří Drahoš, a former chairman of the Czech academy of sciences, who has emerged as the main challenger to Zeman in this week’s poll, to be held on Friday and Saturday. Defeat for Zeman could profoundly affect Czech politics, particularly the future of the recently installed prime minister, Andrej Babiš, who heads a minority government heavily dependent on the current president’s support for its survival. Drahoš told the Guardian that, if elected, he would not allow Babiš, a billionaire businessman and the Czech Republic’s second richest man, to continue as prime minister because he is facing criminal fraud charges over €2m (£1.8m) of European Union grants given to a farm and conference complex he owns south of Prague. Drahoš pledged to “restore the moral authority” once associated with former Czech leaders such as the late Vaclav Havel, which he said had been squandered by Zeman’s penchant for incendiary statements and the rise of populist parties in parliament. He vowed to reverse the president’s friendly approach to Russia and instead reaffirm the Czech Republic’s commitment to the EU and Nato. Zeman has called for referendums on continued membership of both. Drahoš’s stance is aimed at strengthening the Czech Republic’s pro-western orientation in contrast to its cold war membership of the pro-Moscow Warsaw Pact alliance, when the country was part of Czechoslovakia. “For me, the Czech Republic must look not toward the east but to the west, to western democratic countries,” he said. “Without question, the Czech Republic needs to restore its moral authority, not just in the post of the president but also at the level of government and both houses of parliament. “We say in Czech that ‘the fish stinks from the head’ and that perfectly sums up the current situation..” Drahoš, 68, said one of his main criticisms was Zeman’s perceived closeness to the Kremlin, which he said threatened Czech democracy and was motivated on Russia’s side by a desire to destabilise the EU. “President Zeman’s current stance toward Moscow is unacceptable,” he said. “This is one of the main reasons that he needs to be replaced. I have already warned that we can easily be manipulated by a Russian disinformation campaign and influence. “We have seen this trend during the USA presidential election and in Germany, France and Catalonia. The Russians don’t want a strong, united and stable Europe.” Zeman, 73, a former prime minister and Social Democrat leader, has caused consternation with his vocal opposition to western sanctions against Russia over its annexation of eastern Crimea from Ukraine. One of his closest aides, Martin Nejedlý, is chief executive of the Czech subsidiary of the Russian energy firm Lukoil, fuelling unproven suspicions of hidden financial interests in the president’s relations with Moscow. Despite such controversies, Zeman has retained the approval of a majority of Czech voters since his election in 2013 thanks to his hardline rhetoric against immigration and Islam, which are popular stances even though the country has only a small Muslim population. Nevertheless, pollsters say Zeman is electorally vulnerable, citing a combination of widespread opposition to his anti-western attitudes and concerns over his advanced age and supposed ill-health. “He is trusted by more than 50% of the voters but his electoral support is lower because a segment of his supporters don’t want him re-elected for various reasons – for example that he is too old and they want someone new,” said Jan Hartl, head of Stem, a Czech polling agency that has projected that Drahos could defeat Zeman by 48.5% to 44% in a second-round run-off. A run-off poll will take place on 26 and 27 January if, as anticipated, no candidate in the nine-man field gets more than 50% in this weekend’s election. That would probably pit Zeman against Drahoš, who has consistently come second to the president in opinion surveys. “If, say, Zeman and Drahoš go into the second round, all the opposing candidates would ask their supporters to back Drahoš – or indeed any opponent of Miloš Zeman,” Hartl said. “A common denominator of all the anti-Zeman candidates is that they all fear our country is facing a crucial historical period when it’s not sure what its main orientation is – east or west. And Miloš Zeman is seen as the symbol of an eastward-looking politician.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/09/liverpool-mayor-joe-anderson-police-ross-barkley-everton-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T17:09:13Z","webTitle":"Mayor of Liverpool asks FA and police to investigate Ross Barkley’s Chelsea move","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/09/liverpool-mayor-joe-anderson-police-ross-barkley-everton-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/09/liverpool-mayor-joe-anderson-police-ross-barkley-everton-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Mayor of Liverpool asks FA and police to investigate Ross Barkley’s Chelsea move","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The mayor of Liverpool has asked police to investigate whether Ross Barkley’s cut-price transfer from Everton to Chelsea constitutes fraud. Barkley joined the champions last week for £15m having rejected a £35m move to Stamford Bridge on transfer deadline day in August. The move so incensed Joe Anderson, Liverpool’s elected mayor and a lifelong Evertonian, he posted a series of tweets on the day criticising Barkley and the player’s agent while calling on the Football Association and Premier League to investigate the deal. Anderson has now written to the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, and the Premier League executive chairman, Richard Scudamore – in an official capacity and using mayor of Liverpool headed paper – alleging the transfer “could be seen as a deliberate attempt to drive down a player’s value in the transfer market so as to benefit the player, his agent and the buying club”. And he claims to have contacted “the appropriate police authorities” with a request they investigate the deal for fraud. Barkley had six months remaining on his Everton contract and could have left on a free transfer at the end of this season. He pulled out of the move to Chelsea in August having ruptured a hamstring. Anderson describes the stated reason as “a groin strain”, yet Barkley needed surgery to reconnect the hamstring and has not played this season as a consequence. In his letter to Scudamore and Clarke Anderson writes: “I believe the circumstance of his transfer now warrants serious investigation. There seems to me to be at least a public perception that collusion has taken place. While that may not be the case, it is in your interest this is at least looked at to reassure fans transfers will be monitored more closely and no individuals are benefiting inappropriately. “Football fans are often treated as the forgotten minority and the Premier League would not be the fantastic product it is without them. Those committed fans pay exceptional ticket prices to watch their team play which I believe gives them a stake in this whole process, and they deserve the right to a degree of transparency. “I am so concerned about the circumstances surrounding this transfer I am asking the appropriate police authorities to consider whether any fraud has taken place.” Barkley’s £60,000-a-week wage with Everton is believed to have at least doubled at Chelsea, where he has signed a five-and-a-half-year contract. Anderson was widely criticised on Twitter last week for using his mayoral position to criticise a transfer between two Premier League clubs. Everton have not registered any complaint over a deal they sanctioned but Anderson defends his efforts in the letter. He adds: “As a politician – and someone who supports and rightly welcomes scrutiny under the Nolan Principles – I feel it is right the public receive an assurance on this matter and that transfers are monitored more closely. I hope we can count on the sport’s governing bodies to provide those assurances.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/11/tesco-and-john-lewis-enjoy-a-good-christmas-but-ms-downbeat","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T08:07:14Z","webTitle":"Tough Christmas for retailers as shoppers feel the squeeze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/11/tesco-and-john-lewis-enjoy-a-good-christmas-but-ms-downbeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/11/tesco-and-john-lewis-enjoy-a-good-christmas-but-ms-downbeat","fields":{"headline":"Tough Christmas for retailers as shoppers feel the squeeze","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Three of the UK’s biggest retailers have delivered disappointing Christmas figures as weak consumer confidence and ferocious online competition take their toll on the high street. Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Tesco reported their Christmas sales on what had been billed as Super Thursday in the City, but it proved to be a flop with investors. M&amp;S and Tesco ended the day as the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index with more than £1bn collectively wiped off the value of their shares. Retailers are trapped in a profit squeeze as the devaluation of sterling pushes up the cost of sourcing products at a time when shoppers’ spending power is under pressure and they are making fewer trips to the shops and scouring the internet for the best deals. “Super Thursday turned out to be the day of disappointments,” said Whitman Howard analyst Tony Shiret. M&amp;S reported a sales slump in clothing and food as a series of own goals, including a misfiring website and high food prices, compounded tough market conditions. At Tesco, although its supermarkets chalked up underlying growth of 1.9% over the key Christmas weeks, the City complained it had not delivered the “slam dunk” expected. M&amp;S’s chief executive, Steve Rowe, revealed the store had been forced to remove products such as wrapping paper and Christmas cards from its website after operational issues at its high-tech warehouse in Castle Donington meant it was unable to deliver them to customers in time. Clothing and homewares sales slumped 2.9%, while food sales fell 0.4%. Its website trailed rivals with growth of 3%. There were also issues in M&amp;S’s upmarket food halls as shoppers headed there for organic turkey, with sales up 42%, but not for the trimmings. The chain was also caught up in a brussels sprout price war after rivals slashed the cost of the Christmas staple, making M&amp;S’s offering look expensive. “We have more to do in some of the commodity items where there really is a battle on price,” said Rowe. “We have not been sharp enough there. The consumer is quite fragile and volatile, if you give them a reason not to spend they’ll take it.” Employee-owned department store John Lewis fared better, with sales breaking through £1bn for the first time during the six-week Christmas period. But sales were hard won, with the John Lewis Partnership, which also owns Waitrose, warning that profits would be down this year after it matched the blizzard of price cuts that began on Black Friday. John Lewis’s “never knowingly undersold” pledge means it has no choice but to take part in events like Black Friday, even if they dent profits. “If it didn’t exist, I wouldn’t invent it, but it’s here, and it’s here to stay,” said John Lewis managing director Paula Nickolds. John Lewis slashed its staff bonus for the fourth year running in 2017, reducing it to 6% of pay – the lowest payout since 1954. With profits under pressure again this year, analysts suggested the staff bonus could be in the firing line again. M&amp;S’s weak food sales handed it the wooden spoon for Christmas 2017 as arch-rival Waitrose enjoyed growth of 1.5% thanks to hit products such as chocolate and ginger mince pies and citrus sherbert lazy gin created by celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal. The major stock market-listed chains enjoyed mixed fortunes over Christmas 2017, with strong online sales helping Next deliver better-than-expected figures, while mid-market rival Debenhams fired off a profit warning. Other casualties included Mothercare, Moss Bros, and House of Fraser, where underlying sales fell 2.9%. Even Card Factory found the going tough as shoppers skimped on Christmas cards. Online fashion retailer Boohoo is among the few standout successes, with sales doubling over Christmas as its fashion-hungry shoppers snapped up inexpensive party outfits. Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: “There are Christmas winners and losers every year, and the slew of trading updates we’ve seen in the past 10 days shows that 2017 was no different. Despite rising prices, shoppers managed to find a way to treat themselves to more mince pies and craft gins than ever before. “While most of the figures we have seen are flattered by inflation, the grocers have proven that consumers will spend where the offering is right. Non-food stores were not so fortunate. A cold snap just before Christmas boosted some fashion retailers, but sales of toys and jewellery were disappointing across the board.” Earlier this week, Theo Paphitis, the owner of Ryman and Robert Dyas and a former judge on the BBC’s Dragons’ Den show, said trading conditions were the toughest he had faced: “In all my years I have never seen it so hard and unforgiving where the shopper will punish you if you take your eye off the ball.” Tesco’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, insisted the store had delivered a phenomenal performance despite the City’s negative reception. Its food sales were strong, but household goods did less well, with sales of TVs, home computers and DVDs in decline. Some analysts were also critical of the weaker-than-expected performance delivered by its website and Express convenience stores. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jan/09/australia-batting-endurance-ashes-steve-smith-lehmann","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T22:46:00Z","webTitle":"Pace bowling and patient batting key to Australia’s Ashes plan coming together | Geoff Lemon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/09/australia-batting-endurance-ashes-steve-smith-lehmann","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/09/australia-batting-endurance-ashes-steve-smith-lehmann","fields":{"headline":"Pace bowling and patient batting key to Australia’s Ashes plan coming together","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“Our plans worked perfectly.” One could imagine Darren Lehmann as a supervillain. That saurian monolith of a scone, complete with Blofeldian vasculature. Spinning around in a high-backed chair with that knowing squint. More likely to be stroking a bottle of white wine than a white cat – a crisp Riesling, perhaps, to cut through the third-session torpor? Come, come, Mr Cook, you derive just as much pleasure from crushing touring teams as I do. In its inception, back in the dim mists of 2013, the Lehmann masterplan could be generously described as uncomplicated. Bowl fast, score faster. Aggression was the only way. It failed in England, worked a charm for the return Ashes a couple of months later, and failed more spectacularly in England in 2015. Michael Clarke personified it. The worse your form, the harder you swing, became the then-captain’s guiding principle, encapsulated in his accidental 10 off 15 balls during the Trent Bridge disaster. Clarke swung himself off his feet and recognised it was time to swing himself out of Test cricket. But “play your natural game” remained the mantra of a team through thrashings against Sri Lanka away and South Africa at home. By the end of last September’s stoush with Bangladesh, the current era’s captain had a personal tally reading 15 collapses in the last 13 Tests. Steve Smith was not amused, with the lack of amusement that only Smith can muster – there is no Border or Ponting rage about the man, more an obsessive late-teenage fastidiousness born of no prior Australian captain. For Smith, that number was unsustainable. There was no fanfare about a new approach, because it did not carry the same sense of threat, but a new approach was definitely taken. In Brisbane for this Ashes series, we saw the early turning point that defined the tour, as Smith turned a parlous 76 for 4 into a position of command. It was abnegation of pebble-kneeling intensity, Smith’s slowest hundred in a career that has enjoyed the chance to freewheel. England had good bowling plans to all the Australians, and 10 of them worked. Yet Smith withstood, offering denial to himself and England even-handedly. Every ball that landed where they wanted, he forsook. The occasional one where he preferred, he acceded, rarely with lavishness: of his unbeaten 141, only 56 came in boundaries. He penitently absorbed 326 balls in the process, a strike-rate of 43. Thus, on he went. He led the run-scoring, of course, but duration was the standout: 1416 deliveries faced across the series, 448 more than the next in line, from seven out of 10 possible innings. Only two of his knocks were under three and a half hours. He totalled 35 hours and 37 minutes at the crease: insert arbitrary stat about how many times that would let you watch Gone With The Wind while laying spaghetti end-on-end to the moon. As much as Smith out-endured his team-mates, they followed as best they could. Shaun Marsh was the standout: 968 balls and 22 hours 45, with pivotal hands in four of five Tests, all with his attacking instincts pared back to a series strike rate under 46. The ever-punchy David Warner barely capped 52. Of the top seven batsmen, Mitchell Marsh scored fastest with 57.04. The only Australians to hit the 60s were Mitchell Starc, who slogged 44 runs, and Jackson Bird, who made four from six balls once. Had the Lehmann of 2013 governed a top order striking in the 40s, they would probably all have been sacked by series end. This later version has embraced a different way. “Long periods of time with their two senior bowlers in Broad and Anderson,” he confirmed. “We wanted them to bowl a lot of overs. That was certainly a plan in the first innings of every game.” Australia did not need to dominate England by smashing them. They dominated by beating them slowly, by making them work harder without ever feeling they were in the game. Where the need for speed has been tempered with the bat, it did not need to be with the ball – at least not in Australian conditions. Of course speed still needs accuracy – just consult a certain Barmy Army song. But Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Patrick Cummins had that in spades. There were not many loose deliveries, and the scarcity meant some still went unpunished. Their relentlessness meant that eventually, England’s batsmen always slipped. “In Australia you need velocity, you need pace, it’s simple,” said Lehmann. “History shows that. In England it’s a different story.” Hopefully, this means there is still a future for the unlucky Bird, handed a turf sandwich by filling in on a Melbourne pitch so dead that they hold parades for it in Mexico. Bird has proved his worth before, and could still be key in England in 2019, along with perennial Adelaide understudy Chadd Sayers – but it is hard to imagine how Lehmann could move past his current bowlers if they remain fit and available. Asked if they could be the best attack he has coached, he said “They certainly have the potential to be. Harris, Siddle, Johnson and Lyon were pretty good four years ago, but these guys are younger, they’ve got the appetite to be great.” Aside from the impressive trick of how Nathan Lyon today is younger than he was four years ago, the spinner has himself become a force in terms of accuracy. The way he dropped the ball on a length as soon as he started each spell was key in restraining scoring and creating chances for his quicks. Consistency came through in the quartet’s wicket tally: 21, 21, 22 and 23 for the series. Which number belongs to who is irrelevant.

But Brexit is perhaps one of those classic pyrrhic victories that cheers the troops while sowing the seeds of a seismic defeat that may lie just around the corner. Yes, it is quite something that the Tories are still neck and neck with Labour in the polls, and they could still win the next election. But their position nonetheless suggests encroaching twilight, for reasons that run much deeper than the prime minister’s shortcomings, the fact that she is now on to her third work and pensions secretary in 18 months, or the way that Jeremy Hunt’s howling failures have been rewarded with even more responsibility. The evidence is plain. At the general election, Labour was hugely ahead in all age categories under 40. The fact that the polarities were completely reversed among the over-50s heralded a new politics deeply divided along generational lines, with the Tories seemingly on the wrong side of history. Six months on, the spectacle of Conservative politicians now believing that their revival might lie in pirouettes over foxhunting or a new drive on “school standards” compounds the sense of a force nominally in power but all at sea. A question: do the Tories meaningfully exist any more beyond Westminster and the closed circles of power and influence highlighted by the Toby Young fiasco? Corporate donations and hired help might just about get them through election campaigns. But while Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party can justifiably claim to be a mass movement, the Conservatives have not released any membership figures since 2013, and are reckoned to have as few as 70,000 members. According to recent polling, 71% of Conservative members are men and 44% are 65 or over. More than half of card-carrying Tories still support the death penalty; three-quarters agree that “young people don’t have enough respect for traditional British values”. The grassroots may have liked Priti Patel’s claim this week that they are “the beating heart of our movement”, but that may well be part of the problem. That said, even as the Tories have ossified, the long, fitful process of modernisation that began in the wake of the Major years has had some successes. Nineteen minority-ethnic Conservative MPs does not seem like much, but such figures as Patel, Sajid Javid and the newly appointed deputy chairman, James Cleverly, attest to progress. At least at the top, the party’s acceptance of gay and lesbian people is obvious. David Cameron’s embrace of diversity and social liberalism combined with Conservative belief in free-market economics to produce at least flashes of a libertarian, meritocratic politics that might speak powerfully to the Britain of the future. George Osborne now seems to be keeping this credo warm at the Evening Standard; whether it has any serious chance of revival remains unclear. Brexit, after all, has turned out to be this strand of Conservatism’s nemesis. Perhaps more than ever, the loudest elements of the Tory tribe speak a paranoid, backward-looking language consciously at odds with anything modern (witness all those front pages of the Daily Mail, and their baiting of any Tory MPs deemed to step out of line). The project of leaving the EU has given new life to such howlingly retrogressive Tories as Liam Fox and the preposterous Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man whose rise is a pretty sure sign of a party with precious little interest in collectively understanding its predicament. God knows if enough Conservatives will ever realise it, but the unreconstructed Thatcherism these politicians personify is surely finished. Britain’s housing crisis and the impossibility of home ownership for countless people under 40 surely demand something different. Old Tory watchwords such as aspiration and ambition are too often bywords for debt and insecurity. Privatisation is now less a byword for consumer sovereignty than a signifier of crony capitalism. From time to time, there have been attempts to come up with a Conservatism more relevant to people’s 21st-century problems – “blue-collar Conservatism”, the idea of the Tories as a “workers’ party” – but their legacy seems to amount to little more than a handful of old articles and dormant websites and Twitter feeds. If a Tory reformation is what is needed, there is a Conservative political tradition that screams out for a revival: pragmatic, moderate, less concerned with ideological purity than steadily getting stuff done. It is one of the grimmer aspects of Theresa May’s fate that in her brief burst of confidence, before the election smashed her dreams to bits, this seemed to be where she was headed. But now she has neither the wit nor political space to develop it. Whatever form Conservatism takes, lefties such as me will always see in it a fundamental set of hypocrisies and delusions, and the combination of needless austerity and the lunacy of Brexit may curse the Tory party for a very long time. In the long run, it will be further tested by huge changes to technology, work, and the age balance of the population that are demanding new thinking from all sides. But even so: it surely ought to be doing better than it is. What of such neglected or abandoned ideas as the “big society” and the northern powerhouse? Conservative leaders could set store by the basic ideals of the market but also be keenly aware of its failures. They could take the bold step of actually building some social housing; they could call out monopolistic train and energy companies and banks in the name of genuine capitalism. Someone at Central Office ought to reread the conservative philosopher Michael Oakeshott: “To be conservative … is to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery … present laughter to utopian bliss.” This kind of Conservatism would have avoided Brexit like the plague. Still, combine its essential disposition with the Cameron-Osborne era’s modernism, and you might have the start of something. In Scotland, this combination seems to form the essential philosophy of the Tory leader, Ruth Davidson. Meanwhile in England Toryism seems to have been commandeered by a coalition of freaks and throwbacks sitting atop a political machine that is sputtering to a halt. So it is, perhaps, that once-great political empires slowly turn to dust. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/jan/09/data-protection-bill-amended-to-protect-security-researchers","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T18:45:59Z","webTitle":"Data protection bill amended to protect security researchers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/09/data-protection-bill-amended-to-protect-security-researchers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jan/09/data-protection-bill-amended-to-protect-security-researchers","fields":{"headline":"Data protection bill amended to protect security researchers","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government is to amend the data protection bill to protect security researchers who work to uncover abuses of personal data, quelling fears that the bill could accidentally criminalise legitimate research. The move follows a Guardian report on the concerns, and has been welcomed by one of the researchers who raised the alarm. “I am very happy with the amendments,” said Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity and privacy researcher. The bill will contain a clause making it a criminal offence to “intentionally or recklessly re-identify individuals from anonymised or pseudonymised data”, with the potential of an unlimited fine for offenders. When it was first published in August, security researchers feared they could fall foul of the law if they carried out research demonstrating inadequate anonymisation on the part of others. Now the government has introduced an amendment to the bill providing an exemption for researchers carrying out “effectiveness testing”. Researchers would have to notify the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) within three days of successfully deanonymising data, and demonstrate that they had acted in the public interest and without intention to cause damage or distress in re-identifying data. Matt Hancock, the new culture and digital secretary, said: “We are strengthening Britain’s data protection laws to make them fit for the digital age by giving people more control over their own data. This amendment will safeguard our world-leading cybersecurity researchers to continue their vital work to uncover abuses of personal data.” Olejnik said the amendments offered “a reasonable compromise” between the needs of researchers and the risks that exceptions could be abused. “I’m especially impressed with designing a responsible way of submitting privacy weaknesses directly to ICO. In this way, the role of ICO is even strengthened as a mediator between researchers and organisations. “The whole case underlines the need of careful analysis of proposed regulations, whether in UK or beyond. These days, badly designed technology regulations have the potential to negatively affect entire societies.” Poor anonymisation of data is a common problem. In 2006 AOL released an “anonymised” selection of search queries that revealed affairs, illnesses and criminal activity when it was deanonymised simply through cross-referencing with phonebooks. That same year Netflix was sued after it released poorly anonymised reviews that outed a closeted lesbian. In August last year a pair of German researchers purchased the “anonymous” browsing habits of 3 million Germans from a data broker, and succeeded in uncovering the porn habits of a judge, medical problems of an MP and details of active criminal cases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/14/sundays-best-tv-mcmafia-the-south-bank-show-40th-anniversary-special","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T06:00:19Z","webTitle":"Sunday’s best TV: McMafia; The South Bank Show 40th Anniversary Special","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/14/sundays-best-tv-mcmafia-the-south-bank-show-40th-anniversary-special","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/14/sundays-best-tv-mcmafia-the-south-bank-show-40th-anniversary-special","fields":{"headline":"Sunday’s best TV: McMafia; The South Bank Show 40th Anniversary Special","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"McMafia 9pm, BBC One Consequences are looming for James Norton’s fund manager as the crime saga moves glacially forwards: the back half of episode four puts several dull subplots on hold to focus on whether one gang of hoodlums can steal a crateload of drugs from another.

The company, which is worth around £5.4bn and has 9 million UK customers, was accused of “dodging” EU rules by imposing the new fee, which applies whether payment is made by cash or card. Some customers said they had deleted the Just Eat app in protest, while others called for a boycott. Just Eat makes millions of pounds a year in revenue from its 50p card payment fee – money that it was set to lose this weekend. Angry customers expressed their displeasure on Twitter and other social networks, with one claiming: “At least Dick Turpin wore a mask.” The new 50p service charge took effect on Monday. The company said that applying the fee equally across the customer base “ensures fairness for all”. However, some commentators were quick to point out that the FTSE 100 firm’s move comes just days before a ban on card fees takes effect. From 13 January, as a result of an EU directive, all extra charges added to payments for goods and services made with a credit or debit card will be outlawed. The Treasury has said that while so-called surcharging was common practice across the UK, these fees were “unfair” and a “rip-off”. However, some commentators had warned that they expected many companies would either hike their prices to compensate for the loss of this money, or change the name of the fee to get around the rules. On Twitter, Hollie Borland claimed the new charge was a “sneaky way of getting around the ban on service charges for card payments”, while Chris Allen said: “It just feels you’re blatantly and deliberately forcing everybody to pay an additional 50p to cover the fact you can’t charge those by card 50p.” Just Eat revealed in 2016 that “payment card/admin fee revenue” accounted for about 13% of its total revenue. With the company forecasting revenue for 2017 at between £500m and £515m, that suggests the loss of the card fee cash would have cost it more than £50m. The new charge could generate even more revenue than the old one, as it applies to all orders, however they are made. The company said in a statement: “As of 8 January 2018 we have made a change to the way restaurants are charged to process Just Eat orders – a 50p service charge will be implemented for all orders. The 50p charge simply means that along with our restaurant partners, we can continue to deliver the best possible takeaway experience.” Fees for paying with plastic – most commonly a credit card – are routinely levied on everything from low-cost flights and tax bills to cinema tickets and takeaway meals, but the Treasury has said these would be consigned to history from this Saturday. The ban affects official bodies and government departments as well as companies. HM Revenue &amp; Customs currently charges a fee for paying a tax bill using a credit card. It has decided that from 13 January it will no longer accept personal credit card payments. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/10/free-speech-obsessives-no-platforming-establishment-universities","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T06:00:40Z","webTitle":"Don’t be fooled – these free-speech obsessives approve of no-platforming | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/10/free-speech-obsessives-no-platforming-establishment-universities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/10/free-speech-obsessives-no-platforming-establishment-universities","fields":{"headline":"Don’t be fooled – these free-speech obsessives approve of no-platforming","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When people obsess over a trivial issue, it usually means they are avoiding a more important one. The intense focus on student politics, and in particular no-platforming, by middle-aged journalists – columnists and leader writers at the Telegraph, Spectator, Times, Mail and Sun – suggests to me that there is something they would rather not see. As it happens, I agree with them: the no-platforming of people whom students find offensive is often wrong (though not in the case of direct hate speech towards minorities, or the incitement of violence). But I also believe that, on the scale of global importance, this issue ranks about 12,000th. This is student politics, for God’s sake. Daft ideas and failed experiments are its raison d’etre. Yet this middle-aged obsession is taken so seriously by a government that is otherwise slashing the state that it has set up a new public agency to police student follies. This is the body – the Office for Students – that caused such controversy by appointing no-platform obsessive Toby Young to its board (he resigned on Tuesday after realising he had been a bit too free with his own free speech). Why does this issue command such attention? What is it that these people would prefer not to see? Perhaps it is the far graver no-platforming that prevails across adult public life. For instance, the incoming vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University is a man whose views, if they belonged to a student, would be quickly condemned. In his current post, as University of Hong Kong vice-chancellor, he signed the following letter: “We treasure freedom of expression, but we condemn its recent abuses. Freedom of expression is not absolute, and like all freedoms it comes with responsibilities. All universities undersigned agree that we do not support Hong Kong independence, which contravenes the Basic Law.” Digging his hole deeper, he now claims that the phrase “recent abuses” refers not to the pro-independence protests at universities but to unrelated instances of hate speech. How can this meaning be deduced from the letter? Is a man who first rails against free speech, then engages in such sophistry, fit to serve in this role? Shouldn’t the minister responsible for the OfS take an interest in the matter? Or is easier to attack a handful of confused 18-year-olds? Another resounding silence concerns the US government’s deletion from its websites of thousands of documents that mention climate breakdown. The US agriculture department instructs that the terms “climate change” or “greenhouse gases” should not be used in its publications; and the federal government bans the words “vulnerable”, “entitlement”, “diversity”, “transgender”, “foetus”, “evidence-based” and “science-based” from an agency’s budget reports. This is real censorship, not a feeble attempt by a few teenagers to prevent their peers using trigger words. Could it be that our free speech crusaders quietly approve? Lord Lawson gave a lecture last year, claiming that “the suppression of freedom of speech in the universities now is one of the great problems of our time”. Somehow he forgot to mention that he served in the government that banned Sinn Féin and 10 other organisations in Northern Ireland from being heard on television and radio broadcasts, regardless of what they were saying. This was not an occasional no-platforming but full-on prohibition. But perhaps the real discomfort is that the worst no-platforming of all takes place within our newspapers. In the publications most obsessed with student silliness, there is no platform for socialism, no platform for environmentalism, no platform for those who might offend the interests of the proprietors. In the Telegraph, as its former chief political commentator Peter Oborne says, there is no platform for criticism of – or even embarrassing news about – some of its major advertisers. In the Daily Mail, Dominic Sandbrook warned that universities “are becoming bubbles of received opinion, echo chambers in which the same lazy prejudices … reverberate unceasingly.” Yes, that’s the Daily Mail, which has made its own contribution to free speech on campus by calling on readers to report views it disagrees with: “Have you – or do you know anyone – who has experienced anti-Brexit bias at university? Email university@dailymail.co.uk.” A column in the Sun warns: “Universities risk looking more like places of darkness, intolerance and ignorance.” This admonition comes from a newspaper that during the EU referendum campaign, according to research at Cardiff University, published 220 pro-leave letters and one pro-remain letter. The newspapers that claim to be so incensed about no-platforming are not above seeking to deny people a platform. When the broadcaster Chris Packham spoke out against the shooting industry, both the Mail on Sunday and the Telegraph published articles that sought to have him sacked from the BBC. The BBC resisted this attempt, but – disciplined by both press and government – across much of its output it has unthinkingly succumbed. For instance, while it broadcasts series such as Mary Berry’s Country House Secrets and Elizabeth &amp; Philip: Love and Duty, it provides no documentary platform for those who seek to break the stranglehold of patrimonial wealth and power. Where’s the balance? I’m not claiming that journalists try to distract attention from their own industry. Quite the opposite. Projection is something we do unconsciously, to avoid facing uncomfortable truths. We should all seek to challenge ourselves unceasingly, in the forlorn hope of combating this tendency. I believe that a healthy media organisation, like a healthy university, should admit a diversity of opinion. I want the other newspapers to keep publishing views with which I fiercely disagree. But they – and we – should also seek opposing views and publish them too, however uncomfortable this might be. Otherwise media organisations are vulnerable to the charge they level so freely at students: creating a safe space in which only the views they find congenial are heard. Yes, to use their unpleasant term, there are some snowflakes at university. But there’s a blizzard in the newspapers. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/10/western-balkans-backsliding-on-democracy-says-lords-committee","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T00:01:33Z","webTitle":"Western Balkans backsliding on democracy, says Lords committee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/10/western-balkans-backsliding-on-democracy-says-lords-committee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/10/western-balkans-backsliding-on-democracy-says-lords-committee","fields":{"headline":"Western Balkans backsliding on democracy, says Lords committee","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Progress towards full democracy and commitment to the rule of law in the western Balkans is either stagnating or going backwards as the UK’s influence in the region declines, a Lords committee has said. Russian and extreme Islamic influence is expanding, state capture of civil institutions is growing and support for EU membership is in decline, the international relations committee says. Some nationalist leaders point to the UK’s planned departure from the EU as a sign that European values are no longer relevant, it adds in a report. Since the UK voted to leave the EU, its longstanding advocacy of the Balkans countries’ EU membership is not just paradoxical but untenable in the eyes of many, the report says. The Brexit decision also deprives the Balkans of their chief advocates in Brussels. The peers say the UK must ensure that a western Balkans summit planned for London this year maps out a long-term security and political commitment to the region in conjunction with the EU. It urges the UK to act as an advocate for Balkan states such as Macedonia to be allowed to join Nato. The Balkans summit is seen as one of the Foreign Office’s key chances to show Britain will remain engaged globally after Brexit. The Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said he hoped the summit may lead a relaxation of the UK visa regime. The committee, including some of the most senior foreign policy experts in the Lords, says the risk of diminishing UK traction comes at a time when some political leaders in the Balkans are making “regressive, dangerous and destabilising calls” for a redrawing of the national boundaries and secession. These politicians are pursuing the unfulfilled goals of the civil wars of the 1990s. It says Russian soft power has expanded, partly by placing a large number of Russian Sputnik correspondents across the region who now service mainstream media. “The main agency sources of news, particularly in Serbia but also in Republika Srpska and Montenegro, is Sputnik,” it says. Although Russian influence can be exaggerated and the BBC World Service is returning to the region, Moscow’s effect has been to “slow progress towards good governance and the region emerging as fully democratic”, the committee finds. The Russian influence has coincided with growing “state capture of civil society” and especially the media. The Foreign Office has warned of “increased backsliding on freedom of expression in some countries in the region. This includes political interference in the work of public broadcasters, a lack of transparent public funding of media and intimidation of journalists”. Moscow has been able to fill a vacuum created in part by unhelpful statements such as that made by the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who said EU membership was off the agenda for the Balkans “until some distant date in the future”. Surveys show that far more Serbian citizens would prefer to be allied with Russia (67.2% in favour and 18.8% against) than join the European Union (50.9% vs 38.8%). The committee says the decline in support for the EU is not in the UK’s interest “as EU membership is the most reliable path for western Balkan countries to achieve security, stability and prosperity. Post-Brexit the UK must continue wholeheartedly to support the accession ambitions of western Balkan countries.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/09/concerns-raised-over-churchs-donation-to-new-minister-damian-hinds","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T18:13:10Z","webTitle":"Concerns over Catholic church's 2014 donation to Damian Hinds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/09/concerns-raised-over-churchs-donation-to-new-minister-damian-hinds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/09/concerns-raised-over-churchs-donation-to-new-minister-damian-hinds","fields":{"headline":"Concerns over Catholic church's 2014 donation to Damian Hinds","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The new education secretary accepted more than £5,000 from the Catholic church in 2014 to pay for a parliamentary intern. Damian Hinds, who was appointed on Monday to succeed Justine Greening, listed the donation in the register of members’ interests as “an educational allowance of £5,116.25 and accommodation provided for an intern in my parliamentary office for 10 months”. The Catholic church is demanding the scrapping of a 50% cap on the selection of children on religious grounds at state-funded faith free schools. Hinds has publicly supported the removal of the cap, in contrast to Greening who defended it as a means of ensuring fair access to high-performing schools. In a debate in Westminster in 2014, Hinds said: “If [Catholic schools] were open to all, they would lose their distinctive character – not immediately, but over time.” There are more than 2,000 Catholic schools in England, about 10% of the total number of state-funded schools, educating more than 820,000 pupils, including 36% of other faiths or no faith. Many of the schools are over-subscribed. Humanists UK, which has led a campaign against plans to drop the 50% cap on religious selection at free schools, said the funding of interns by the Catholic church “represents inappropriate influence within parliament and raises questions about conflict of interest”. Other MPs who have listed Catholic funding of around £5,000 for interns are Mike Kane, the shadow schools minister, and Emma Lewell-Buck, the shadow children and families minister. John Pugh, a former Liberal Democrat MP who was education spokesperson in 2002-05, accepted a £4,000 donation to fund an intern. The Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales, which represents the church, said it had run an intern scheme for the past 13 years involving more than 100 young people selected by the church. Many were placed in parliament with Catholic MPs from all parties. “A lot of young people are interested in politics and public life. We think that’s a vocation, and it’s part of our public mission to give them a step up,” said Greg Pope, of the CBC. “It is categorically not the case that we expect anything in return from the MPs or the interns. The interns are working for the MPs, not the Catholic church.” Andrew Copson, of Humanists UK, said: “A third of state-funded schools in England are run by religious organisations, which are gifted broad freedoms to privilege and discriminate against children, parents, and teachers on the basis of religion. Given this, one would think that the level of religious influence over the education system is bad enough without the pernicious and deeply inappropriate political lobbying conducted by the Catholic church. “In light of the financial support that the new education secretary has received from the Catholic church, questions must surely be asked about whether or not Damian Hinds has a conflict of interest in making a decision on the 50% cap.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Any financial interests of members are declared on the Register of Members’ Financial Interests and are a matter of public record. This donation and the details of what it was used for was published in 2014, in line with this process.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/09/hero-lorry-driver-helps-stranded-woman-hospital-give-birth-mersea-island","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T16:20:35Z","webTitle":"'Hero' lorry driver helps stranded woman get to hospital to give birth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/09/hero-lorry-driver-helps-stranded-woman-hospital-give-birth-mersea-island","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/09/hero-lorry-driver-helps-stranded-woman-hospital-give-birth-mersea-island","fields":{"headline":"'Hero' lorry driver helps stranded woman get to hospital to give birth","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A new mother has thanked a “hero” driver who loaded her car onto his lorry so she could escape high tide on a flooded causeway in time to give birth. Kelly Brinkman was in labour and waiting for 3ft 6ins-deep (1.2m) sea water to recede on the Strood causeway from Mersea Island, Essex, when lorry driver Justin Tacey spotted her worried partner. The couple had been unable to get their Ford Kuga onto the flooded causeway to get to hospital. Realising their predicament, Tacey offered to load their car onto his higher lorry, which normally carries diggers, and drive across the water. When the couple made it back on the road and arrived at nearby Colchester hospital, his actions proved to be crucial. Brinkman had to undergo an emergency caesarean section, and 30 minutes later her daughter Lillie was born. “The only thing I can think of is that Justin was meant to be there for us,” Brinkman, 32, said. “If it was not for him, we could be telling a completely different story now. “Something or someone was watching over us, I have no doubt about it. If Justin had not been there, I have no idea what we would have done or what would have happened. “As it is, we were sent home with a healthy little baby and a story which is going to be well known on the island for years to come.” Tacey, a 45-year-old father-of-four from Norfolk, had made a delivery to one of the holiday camps on the island and was heading to Suffolk. “We had a word with the coastguard and decided it was worth giving it a go,” he said. “It was probably the only way forward. We got the car on the back of the lorry and we had to take it really steady. “If I had gone much faster then there is a chance she would have had the baby on the back of the lorry, the poor girl. “I was just doing what anyone else would have done.” Tacey was hailed as a “true gentleman” by a spokesman for the West Mersea coastguard rescue team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jan/09/when-peter-preston-had-to-dive-for-cover","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T19:27:41Z","webTitle":"When Peter Preston had to dive for cover | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/09/when-peter-preston-had-to-dive-for-cover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jan/09/when-peter-preston-had-to-dive-for-cover","fields":{"headline":"When Peter Preston had to dive for cover","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your obituary of Peter Preston (8 January) highlights his courage and his defiance of the disabilities caused by his childhood polio. I met him in 1965 in Rawalpindi, where we were covering a short war between Pakistan and India (he for the Guardian, I for the Sun). To get close to the frontline, reporters were piled into two Jeeps travelling with a column of Pakistani troops. From time to time the column was strafed by Indian fighter jets. When we saw them coming we had to climb out of the Jeeps and take refuge in dry ditches alongside the road. This was obviously more difficult for him than for the rest of us, but he managed without fuss and never sought to excuse himself from such demanding expeditions, which he saw as all part of the job. Michael Leapman London • It was with great sadness that I heard of Peter Preston’s death. When I launched the Canarian News in the 1980s Peter kindly sent a letter for our empty letters page encouraging a new publication. Later he arranged for a transcript of Peter Wright’s Spycatcher to be delivered by a very slow Telex to help us publish extracts while the Guardian fought its own legal battles in the UK. In Madrid and Budapest he continued to support with letters of encouragement, in the latter case as we published in eastern Europe during a febrile time for publishers and journalists. Finally, back in the UK when we launched local community newspapers he sent a note of encouragement extolling “local, local, local news”. A true champion of newspapers and a mentor for those of us just setting off in the business. Kevin Hall Sheffield • Many years ago, when the Guardian’s distribution was appallingly erratic, I wrote to the editor saying that I was going to have to give up as a reader. I got a letter back begging me to hold fire for a fortnight – things should get better – and sending a cheque to cover the cost. Distribution did improve, but significantly that cheque came from Mr Peter Preston’s personal account, and says everything about the man. Chris Woolf Liskeard, Cornwall • In all my years reading the Guardian, an article by Peter Preston impressed me more than any other: his piece about the discrimination directed at gay people. He talked of his experience as the father of twins. It was factual and moving and I hope it challenged the thinking of any reader who might have believed that being gay or not gay is a choice or something determined by upbringing.

Research from the Sutton Trust showed 34% of the 29 ministers attending cabinet went to independent schools, compared with 30% of her first cabinet last year. The figures are lower than under David Cameron, who appointed a cabinet in 2010 in which 62% of its members were privately educated, and 50% in 2015. However, May’s ministers attending cabinet are still nearly five times more likely to have gone to a fee-paying school compared with the general population. Although she was forced to ditch plans for new grammar schools after her disastrous general election performance, the prime minister perhaps showed the value she places on selective state education, with 24% of the cabinet coming from selective schools compared with 7% of Cameron’s 2015 team. Fewer than half – 41% – of members of her latest cabinet went to a comprehensive state school, compared with 44% when she became prime minister, and 43% in Cameron’s team. Dr Lee Elliot Major, chief executive of the Sutton Trust, said: “Theresa May made great progress in the composition of her first cabinet, so it is disappointing that yesterday’s reshuffle means that progress has reversed a little. “The prime minister’s cabinet has to reflect the society that they represent and this is a step in the wrong direction.” Karen Lee, a Labour MP, said the makeup of the cabinet was a sign that the government “does not look like the country it represents and whose actions favour a wealthy elite”. “Millionaires have been given tax cuts while the majority are worse off, the NHS we rely on has been plunged into crisis and schools and children’s services have been slashed,” she said. “Theresa May claims she wants a Britain that works for everyone but her actions tell a different story. The Tories remain the party of and for the few.” The reshuffle was billed as a shake-up to promote fresh talent and make the frontbench more diverse, but this only appears to have happened only in the lower ministerial ranks. The full cabinet remains 74% male and 96% white as there are only six women and one man from an ethnic minority background."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/david-letterman-comeback-netflix-show","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T11:40:19Z","webTitle":"David Letterman's comeback: can his Netflix show take him back to the top?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/david-letterman-comeback-netflix-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/11/david-letterman-comeback-netflix-show","fields":{"headline":"David Letterman's comeback: can his Netflix show take him back to the top?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It can hardly be said that there’s a shortage of formidable talkshow hosts in 2018. If anything, the form has undergone a renaissance thanks to Donald Trump, who’s provided for late-night television a salvo of punchlines and a new jolt of life. Those who’ve chosen to more brazenly address his presidency, like Stephen Colbert and Samantha Bee, have benefited enormously as a result, while hosts like Jimmy Fallon, who takes a more chirpy, apolitical approach, have seen their ratings dip. But ever since Colbert took over the late-night slot at CBS in 2015, there’s been a glaring void in the genre left by the departure of David Letterman. When he returns on Friday, with a new long-form talkshow on Netflix and a Gandalfian beard born of temporary retirement, that void will be filled. One way to measure the tectonic significance of Letterman’s comeback? His first guest will be none other than Barack Obama. Throughout his nearly three-year absence from television, Letterman insisted repeatedly that he didn’t miss it. But perhaps the opportunity to get back in the game by way of a streaming service convinced him he did. On My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman – a mouthful of a name – Letterman will sit down with the likes of Obama, Jay-Z, Malala Yousafzai and Tina Fey, conducting interviews and field pieces. The bite-sized first season will consist of six episodes, released monthly, and the more open-ended format should be an ideal display for Letterman’s talents, which in 30 years of late-night television never waned; he can play the irritable curmudgeon, the hard-nosed journalist and the affable jester with equal dynamism. But it remains to be seen whether Letterman can match his past success on a new, less procedural platform. He won’t be the first comic to take his talents to a streaming service: Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman have attempted similarly structured shows on Netflix and Hulu, respectively, with middling results. Handler’s eponymously named talkshow, which she launched with the express purpose of moving away from celebrity gossip and towards more socially conscious subject matters, was a mixed bag, often funny but generally pedantic. Handler’s show was cancelled late last year after two seasons; its host has resolved to become more engaged politically. Silverman’s venture had similar intentions: with I Love You, America, the comic brought her brand of urban, Jewish humor to the heartlands to find some common ground between Trump voters and the “coastal elites”. It’s a quick, compassionate show, but it’s yielded little publicity or viral clips on YouTube which, for better or worse, is about the only existing barometer to measure the success of a streaming program such as this. Though neither shows were entirely unsuccessful, they also weren’t disruptive forces. Where Jimmy Kimmel seemed to effect real change in using his show as a soapbox to discuss the Affordable Care Act, Handler and Silverman were stymied rather than liberated by the sheer volume of entertainment offered by streaming services. Each had a difficult time standing out. Letterman’s series will have a leg-up thanks to its inaugural guest; the interview will be Obama’s first talkshow appearance since Trump took office, and if anyone can coax the famously diplomatic former president into candor, Letterman would be the safest bet. Ever the raconteur, Letterman’s hour-long show will allow him to further sink his teeth into whatever he chooses to cover – recent interviews with New York magazine and the Washington Post suggest Trump is on his mind – without the clockwork constraints of network television. The conversational format should also give him space to show off that well-honed balance of sarcasm and curiosity. The move to Netflix also places Letterman in competition with longtime counterpart Jay Leno, who bowed out of late-night just a year before Letterman to start his own web series, Jay Leno’s Garage, at NBC online. Of course, Letterman never saw it as a rivalry, but their careers have undeniable parallels. Reflecting on those days when he and Leno went head-to-head in the ratings every night, Letterman told the Washington Post: “It was ‘The Late Night Wars,’ oh, ‘Jay’s winning, nobody likes me, and everybody likes Jay.’ Now I think, what was that? Who’s at war here? There’s no war any more. And I think, why was I in the war?” Even so, Garage is a far more niche foray into the genre than My Next Guest, since it’s primarily about Leno’s love of cars. It’s an imprecise bellwether for how well Letterman’s show, which has more star power and seems more broadly focused, will fare. Somewhere between both of these projects is Jerry Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, which also streams online and, as its self-explanatory title would suggest, is an amusingly relaxed half-hour low on production quality but high on charm. With Netflix in his corner, Letterman’s new series will have both. And although the platform doesn’t release viewing figures for its programs, there’s been enough hype for Letterman’s return to suggest fans will be logging on at midnight on Thursday to watch the premiere (or, at least, to see Obama). A lot has changed since Letterman last hosted The Late Show. Although he was never particularly strident when it came to politics, digging into Trump is now something of a prerequisite to having a successful talkshow. But that shouldn’t be a problem, either. Not only does one imagine he’s champing at the bit to talk about the state of the union, but Letterman’s relationship with Trump goes back three decades, having soured after Letterman pulled one of his guest’s branded ties out from behind his desk and told Trump, who seconds before had been railing against China for taking American jobs, that his ties were made – where else? – in China. The ensuing silence showed Letterman’s unique ability to combat boorishness with snark and wit. While Letterman, in a far-ranging conversation with Vulture, strayed from criticizing Jimmy Fallon’s notoriously lightweight interview with Trump, he did hint at how he’ll approach the subject on his own series: “I don’t want to criticize Jimmy Fallon,” he said, “but I can only tell you what I would have done in that situation: I would have gone to work on Trump.” And while Netflix hasn’t proven itself to be an ideal destination for talkshow hosts, talkshows have emerged as ground zero for a good presidential skewering; it’s hard to think of anyone better equipped than Letterman to make those ends meet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/09/stockport-inquiry-launched-after-woman-claims-to-have-buried-body","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T22:53:39Z","webTitle":"Police find body in Stockport after woman says she killed man","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/09/stockport-inquiry-launched-after-woman-claims-to-have-buried-body","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/09/stockport-inquiry-launched-after-woman-claims-to-have-buried-body","fields":{"headline":"Police find body in Stockport after woman says she killed man","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A body has been found after a woman went to a police station in Greater Manchester and claimed she had killed a man and buried his body in a garden.

Network Rail and the train operator, Govia Thameslink Railway, urged passengers in Sussex to plan ahead for what they described as a “once-in-a-generation” upgrade to the southern end of the line. The work, due to take place in October and in February 2019, will close the track south of Three Bridges, near Gatwick airport, to Brighton and Lewes. It is the centrepiece of a £300m upgrade programme to replace or upgrade track, drainage, power and signalling on the line, which is used by 300,000 passengers a day. Replacement buses will operate but the work is likely to add up to an hour to journeys. Network Rail defended the timing of the work, due to take place over half-term holidays when passenger numbers are lower. John Halsall, the managing director of the Network Rail south-east route, said: “This is a long-overdue upgrade to one of the most unreliable parts of the south-east’s rail network. Southern and Thameslink passengers deserve better and this work will help us deliver that for them.” He said the alternative to the two nine-day periods of closure would be 84 weekends. “Clearly, that’s not acceptable to passengers or the region’s economy – but neither is doing nothing.” Keith Jipps, GTR’s infrastructure director, said: “We’ll be ensuring there are multiple options for passengers to make their journeys, including alternative transport to other rail stations and with other train operators. However, passengers need to know that they will have significantly longer journeys over this period of time.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, has demanded free transport for passengers and refunds for season ticket holders during the work. She said: “Passengers using this line have faced years of chaos and will welcome improvements, but it’s absolutely vital that such upgrades are done in a way which minimises disruption.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/jan/16/good-to-meet-you-catherine-gillbert","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T11:59:24Z","webTitle":"Good to meet you ...

Barry Rogers, 33, and his mother Penelope John, 50, are accused of killing Betty Guy, 84, at the latter’s home in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, in 2011. Details of the alleged murder plot emerged five years later, when a former girlfriend of Rogers told police he had admitted killing his grandmother. Police arrested the former soldier and his mother in 2016 and installed listening devices in her home. John was heard telling her son that she had been arrested for murder, and Rogers allegedly replied: “But I did it.” Rogers was also allegedly heard saying: “No, honestly, you have got nothing to worry about, it’s me that’s done the act … There’s nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about. Keep our story the same.” Paul Lewis, prosecuting, claimed the exchanges showed mother and son had plotted to murder the elderly woman. “Such conversations, we submit, are not consistent with Mrs Guy simply having suffered a natural and peaceful death,” he told the jury. “It may be that in November 2011 Mrs Guy was unwell, she was certainly elderly and frail but she was not terminally ill. “We submit that what the defendants did, and whatever their motivation, was wholly unlawful and each of them is therefore guilty of murder.” Rogers, of Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, and John, of nearby St Dogmaels, deny murder and manslaughter. Lewis told the jury that mother and son had agreed to end Guy’s life. He said: “On the late evening of Sunday 6 November 2011, Penelope John summoned her son to Mrs Guy’s home to put their plan into operation. “Penelope John gave her mother a cocktail of crushed tablets and alcohol, and Barry Rogers then deliberately killed her, probably by smothering her with an object such as a cushion or pillow.” Swansea crown court heard John rang 999 and told call handlers that her mother had been suffering bowel and stomach cancer and she believed that she had died. Guy was found with “small pinpoint bruising” on the left side of her face and around her mouth but no postmortem was carried out and she was cremated. The court heard there were no records of Guy having cancer and the prosecution claimed she was not terminally ill. Rogers was living with a woman called Rhianne Morris in Frome, Somerset, in November 2011 when he got a call from his mother and was allegedly heard saying: “It’s time is it?” He drove to Guy’s home in Johnston in Pembrokeshire, and later called his partner saying his nan had “gone”, the jury heard. Lewis said: “When Barry Rogers subsequently returned to Frome he told Ms Morris that his mum had given his nan a bottle of whisky and a load of tablets.” When their relationship began to break down, Rogers allegedly said to Morris: “You want to be careful or I’ll do to you what I did to her.” The court also heard that he also said: “Socks didn’t work, but a pillow did.” The court was told that after the pair split, Rogers admitted the killing to another partner, Sandra Adams. She went to the police in November 2015 and the investigation was launched. Lewis said: “He told Ms Adams that he had drunk a glass of whisky before putting a pillow over his nan’s face. He said that his nan had been fighting him, so he stopped. “He said he had then had another glass of whisky and had put a pillow over her face a second time. He said that this time ‘she just went’.” Lewis said because Guy was cremated it was impossible for there to be conclusive medical evidence about her cause of death. When Rogers was interviewed by police, he denied being in the house when Guy died and said he arrived afterwards, the court heard. Rogers suggested collusion between the witnesses who claimed he told them he helped Guy die. In her interview, John denied she was responsible for her mother’s death and said she found her body after getting up to go to the toilet. During the conversation recorded secretly by police, Rogers said to John: “Are you starting to crack?” The pair allegedly expressed concern that there could be an incriminating text between them. Rogers said: “But it’s fucking technology like, a slip of a word here or there an’ it’s fucking, we’re in deep shit like, we’re in jail for life.” The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/09/made-in-stoke-on-trent-proud-potteries-people-scotching-brexit-capital-rep","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T18:56:59Z","webTitle":"Stokies strike back: the Potteries people scotching their 'Brexit capital' rep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/09/made-in-stoke-on-trent-proud-potteries-people-scotching-brexit-capital-rep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/09/made-in-stoke-on-trent-proud-potteries-people-scotching-brexit-capital-rep","fields":{"headline":"Stokies strike back: the Potteries people scotching their 'Brexit capital' rep","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"They say there’s one way you can always tell a Stokie: wherever they are in the world, whenever they sit down to eat the first thing they do is turn over their plate to see where it was made. It’s a story that captures both the pride and identity that people from Stoke-on-Trent have in their home town – and its history as a city that became world-famous for its ceramics. But in recent years, the story of Stoke-on-Trent has been told rather differently. It was former Ukip leader Paul Nuttall who first called it “the Brexit capital of Britain”. Nuttall was standing in what was billed as “the Brexit By-election” of Stoke Central in February last year. While much of what he said in that campaign was ridiculed or disproven, the Brexit Capital label seemed to stick. It was repeated in headlines everywhere from the Daily Express to the Financial Times, from the Sun to Politico. To many locals, it felt like a more extreme version of a story that had been written about such places for months: “left-behind”, stuck in post-industrial decline and apathy. When the Guardian made a video report from Stoke about this apathy, the position was perfectly summed up by a young man who leaned out of a council block window and shouted: “They don’t give a shit about us, I’m not voting for any of them.” That film was made by me and it captured one side of Stoke, a side many people seemed happy to see, because the film went down well. But I noticed a few comments from locals who were less complimentary. One was from Danny Flynn, head of the YMCA there. “I felt like a goldfish in a bowl and felt quite patronised by it all,” he said, adding that I should “sharpen my bloody pencil” and come back. Flynn is one of countless Stokies whose energy, pride and defiantly positive take on his city is leading a transformation in the story of Stoke. But, he says, this change is something that will have to come from within: “Rather than waiting for the government white charger to come over the horizon and sort us out, we’ve got to do for ourselves.” For me, this was the start of a journey that would take me deep into Stoke’s culture, its streets and its people, but also deep into the question of how we perceive places and tell their stories. I sharpened my bloody pencil and returned to Stoke, determined to clear my mind of preconceived ideas, film as many local people as possible, and be led by what they thought was important. This is not as simple as it sounds. Stoke-on-Trent is made up of six towns, each with their own identities, scenes and gripes. Countless stories and views abound, on everything from Brexit to how to make the perfect oatcake. There were times when I was traipsing the streets with a camera over my shoulder wondering what on Earth I was doing. I filmed a voxpop with Keasha, a single mum, who talked about children’s centre closures. She was getting confused at my erratic line of questioning, so I felt I should tell her that I didn’t really know what I was making a film about. Our encounter ended with me assuring her that I really was a Guardian journalist, and her politely declining to take any further part. A good place to begin to clarify things was Burslem, known as the Mother Town for its key role in founding the potteries. On the high street is a grand and reportedly haunted 18th-century pub called The Leopard. Inside, a familiar scene plays out, with two men telling me over their pints about how the town had declined once the jobs dried up. Indeed, the town was recently named as the place in Britain with the most boarded-up shops. “People have to stop moaning,” one man says wistfully, “pull their trousers up and get on with it.” On the other side of the bar, three women are doing exactly that. They are planning the next Burslem festival, one of several events their community group, Our Burslem, runs throughout the year to bring the town alive. June Cartwright is the group’s driving force: often just called Mother, she is a 73-year-old community champion and heavy metal fan. Outside, she shows me a mural to Motörhead frontman Lemmy, who was from Burslem. When I ask her why metal is so big in this area, she says Stoke people are “very truthful and forthright … straight talking”. As with Danny Flynn, there is a hint of good-humoured menace when she tells me about her pride in Burslem: “I hate anyone that talks it down.” People had begun to tell me that they hoped I was doing “nice, positive stories for a change”. This was not always easy. Anna Francis is an artist who bought a £1 home from the council in one of the hardest-bitten parts of Stoke, the Portland Street estate. She took me to see her project to reopen a boarded-up pub as a community centre. As she was proudly showing me around, a commotion was heard across the road: a house had been burgled, and the residents were loudly sounding off about how bad the area was: “Benefits Street’s got nothing on this,” said one. I heard Anna say to a friend, when she thought I was out of earshot, what a shame it was that I saw that, when this was supposed to be a positive piece. But I explained it only went to make her work seem all the more important and heroic. To show people doing positive things, and fighting back, I had to show what they were fighting against. And there are challenges everywhere in Stoke, none of them unique to the city: the continuing spectre of austerity, low wages, addiction, a lot of empty buildings. But Anna and many of the people I filmed shared a particular world view: that you can look at the same thing and see it in two completely different ways. “I don’t see a flat piece of land with rubble, an empty old building,” said Rob Fenton, who belongs to a group of DIY artists and entrepreneurs who are creating a new independent quarter in Hanley. “Instead I think, ‘What could go there?’” Rob, Anna and many others were inspired by – and pinning their hopes on – the big push by Stoke City Council last year to be the next UK city of culture, in 2021. They launched their bid by sending a duck (a friendly term of address in Stoke) into space. The bid was an attempt to transform perceptions of the city from the inside and the outside. “We changed the world from this city,” said deputy leader of the council Abi Brown. “What we’re doing here is saying to people, ‘Don’t you remember?’” Although the bid had its sceptics, even making the shortlist was something that massively boosted the confidence of people I spoke to. And it brought together many of the people doing things for their communities on their own. One defiant Stokie said to me: “We all know each other now, and there’s no going back.” Several people who have watched this new series, called Made in Stoke-on-Trent, asked me what happened to the duck. I believe it came down to earth several hours drive upwind from Stoke later that evening. But, metaphorically, I like to think it is still soaring. “I thought winning the city of culture would be the catalyst to accelerate Stoke into a new future,” said Danny Flynn, the snowy day after Coventry beat the town to the title last month. “But maybe the catalyst is us.” ‘Suddenly this isn’t a forgotten area’ Anna Francis was eight months pregnant when she moved into a derelict home in one of Stoke’s roughest estates. She bought it for one pound: the council had just launched the scheme in an attempt to bring young families into the community. Life wasn’t easy at first. She was met with suspicion from some of the existing residents who had seen their neighbours moved out. Her efforts to maintain a flowerbed on her street were met with “Not here, duck” and vandalised week after week. Anna persevered. As well as doing up her own home, she launched a project to reopen a derelict pub in the heart of the estate as a community centre. The process has been painfully slow, so Anna – an artist whose work focuses on the built environment, clay and community – began running clay workshops on a green that was usually populated by the area’s addicts. “We change the rhythm of what’s going on,” she says. “Suddenly it isn’t a forgotten area of the city – it’s a space where the community can come together.” Not only does clay tap into Stoke’s pottery heritage, for local young people it contrasts with the slow pace of change in the area: “If you’re working with clay,” says Anna, “the transformation is immediate.” Made in Stoke-on-Trent, an eight-part documentary series, is on the Guardian Cities website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-care-network/2018/jan/22/child-protection-redesign-changing-risks","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-22T09:43:06Z","webTitle":"'Care professionals haven't been in the shoes of exploited children'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2018/jan/22/child-protection-redesign-changing-risks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2018/jan/22/child-protection-redesign-changing-risks","fields":{"headline":"'Care professionals haven't been in the shoes of exploited children'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"More than five years since the conviction of nine men for serially sexually exploiting and abusing girls in Rochdale – and with numerous other convictions for child sexual exploitation secured across the country – it seems that attitudes to identifying and addressing this risk are starting to change. “Increasingly, we would do well to look at child sexual exploitation not in its own silo, but to [also] understand that the harms young people face often interlink,” says Dez Holmes, director of Research in Practice at Dartington Hall Trust. “When we look at the mechanisms by which children are exploited, we might well see synergies across things like criminal exploitation and gang activity, or intimate partner violence between young people.” Research in Practice was commissioned in 2015 by Wigan and Rochdale councils to review evidence around child sexual exploitation (CSE) interventions, and published a revised review last year. It revealed that some experts were starting to question the value of having a separate definition for CSE when it is unarguably a form of child sexual abuse and that some established concepts that were useful at the time of development, such as grooming, may need to be reconsidered as harmful in themselves. Both councils wanted to ensure their services to protect children at risk of CSE were rooted in best practice evidence and, where possible, prevented children coming into care. The councils are piloting new ways of working, based on the evidence review, which will inform all 10 local authorities in Greater Manchester. Gail Hopper, director of children’s services at Rochdale council, says the statutory framework within which local authorities must work does not reflect the nature of the risk faced by young people. “Government guidance is about children who are at risk within their own families,” she says. “But in the CSE context, many young people have good parents who are terrified and want to do everything possible [to help their children].” The current system “says your only option is to put a child protection plan in place that questions the parents’ ability to look after that child”, she explains. But this approach takes no account of the fact that in such situations, as in Rochdale, the risk often lies outside the home, in the environments young people spend time in and the relationships they build with people their families do not know. With money from the Department for Education Innovation Fund, Rochdale and Wigan councils asked families and children with experience of CSE how they would want to be supported. “For many years, professionals have thought we have the answers, but we’ve not been in the shoes of people who are survivors of CSE,” says Hopper. These approaches are not trying to tell young people how to stop themselves being sexually exploited, but aim to understand situations in which they could be vulnerable. Teenagers said they wanted to have time to build relationships with social workers before sharing sensitive information, so the usual deadline for completing an assessment was set aside as part of the pilot project. Today, statutory child protection plans aren’t used for children at risk of CSE in Rochdale unless they need to be. Parents felt that child protection conferences portrayed them as ineffectual; as a result, a different kind of meeting was instigated, focused on what the child and their parents wanted to change. Examining what works is important because issues have arisen nationwide with the lack of a research base for interventions to combat CSE, says Holmes. She says CSE risk-assessment toolkits are not always based on rigorous evidence, according to research led by Professor Sarah Brown of Coventry University. Holmes is also concerned that some educational materials used in schools may imply that children have a responsibility to prevent their own abuse. Meanwhile, Hackney council is using money from the Innovation Fund to embed a “contextual safeguarding” approach into its CSE work. Created by Bedfordshire University’s Dr Carlene Firmin, the concept acknowledges that as children move through adolescence, their vulnerabilities to risk are increasingly shaped by social influences rather than their families. For example, young people groomed and sexually abused within their friendship group is a priority concern, says Sarah Wright, Hackney’s director of children’s services. “Some of our very high-risk young women [are] friends with each other; they’re coming into care, they’re going missing together, they’re introducing each other to people they think of as friends, and are being exposed to things we see as exploitative that they wouldn’t necessarily think of as such,” says Wright. “Within that, [there are] young men who probably don’t recognise their behaviours as abusive ... So we started to develop responses around sexually harmful behaviour – recognising that those young men need support as well.” Hackney’s contextual safeguarding pilot is now working out how best to assess risk beyond the family, how information on young people’s lives is pulled together from different agencies, and how to evaluate potential harm in the environments teenagers spend time in. The longer-term issue will be to mainstream new CSE interventions that require cooperation from people and organisations outside the family. When a child protection system is set up to primarily address risk within the home, there are no legal mechanisms to make it work for dangers from a different source, says Firmin.The Children Act does not compel action from anyone outside a young person’s family, so Firmin is consulting on whether other legal tools could be used alongside it, or if the legislation itself needs to be amended. Changes in policy and practice around CSE must build incrementally based on evidence, rather than sweeping slates clean, suggests Holmes. She says it is important to create policy with nuance and flexibility. Holmes believes that while local authorities and charities are good at change, they need an environment in which reflection and evolution is possible. She says: “It means inspectors being able to look at what counts, rather than just counting.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

The port handled a record 2.6m lorries in 2017, according to its chief executive, Tim Waggott, with annual traffic figures for Eurotunnel, out on Thursday, expected to show a further 1.6m trucks using the rail shuttle to and from the continent. Port and freight chiefs said the figures underline the need to have a deal in place to ensure freight checks do not hold up traffic at the port. “The ease with which vehicles and their loads can pass through Dover and the French ports will be a big test of the post-Brexit arrangement,” said James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the Freight Transport Association (FTA). He called on the government to make the free flow of traffic through Dover a “top priority” for 2018. For the first time Calais port chiefs have also joined the public fight for a frictionless border. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, president-general manager of Port Boulogne Calais, said it had record traffic of 2m lorries last year. “It is essential for the Port of Calais and its hinterland that this traffic flow is maintained,” he said. The FTA and local businesses have previously warned of Brexit chaos with queues of up to 30 miles stretching back towards London if lorries have to be checked for the standard of goods. The new figures showed that Dover handles up to 17% of the UK’s entire trade in goods worth up to an estimated £122bn last year. With the town hemmed in by the famous white cliffs of Dover, more checks will cause major disruption not just to traffic, but to the supply chains for everything from food to the motor industry, business warned. Honda UK said it relied on 350 trucks a day arriving from Europe to keep its giant Swindon factory operating, with just an hour’s worth of parts being held on the production line. Nissan in Newcastle keeps just half a day’s worth of parts in its warehouses as part of a long-established just-in-time production process and the company fears any disruption to that supply chain will increase costs to manufacturing and the consumer. “With Brexit talks about to move on to trade, it is essential that all sides commit to the right solution to ensure fluidity at Dover … Jobs and livelihoods depend on it,” said Waggott. Last year the chief executive of HMRC, Jon Thompson, warned that it could take between five and seven years to get a new streamlined system to deal with imports and exports in place. The British Chambers of Commerce on Tuesday called on the government to minimise customs administration at Dover."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/09/byron-burger-chain-close-branches-restaurants","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T15:04:47Z","webTitle":"Byron burger chain unveils rescue plan that could shut almost 1 in 3 branches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/byron-burger-chain-close-branches-restaurants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/09/byron-burger-chain-close-branches-restaurants","fields":{"headline":"Byron burger chain unveils rescue plan that could shut almost 1 in 3 branches","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Trouble burger restaurant chain Byron has announced a financial rescue plan that could close up to 20 shops a decade after it first opened its doors. The company has launched a restructuring process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) as it tries to lower its rental bill and focus on a smaller number of profitable restaurants. Byron runs 67 restaurants and employs about 1,800 people across the UK. The company has identified 20 sites where it will pay reduced rent for a period of six months while it negotiates with landlords about future operations. Some are expected to close as a result. Simon Cope, the Byron chief executive, said: “Byron’s core restaurant business and brand remain strong but the market that we operate in has changed profoundly. In order to continue serving our loyal customer base, we need to make some critical and difficult changes to the size and shape of our estate.” KPMG, which is advising on the restructuring plan, said no restaurants would close on day one, and employees, suppliers and business rates will continue to be paid on time and in full. Will Wright, a restructuring partner at KPMG, said that after 10 years of growth some Byron restaurants were not meeting expectations and “with gathering economic headwinds starting to impact the sector more profoundly”, the directors had begun a strategic review. “As part of this strategic review, the directors have been successful in negotiating a financial restructuring with the company’s lenders and shareholders, which will enable new investment to come into the business,” he added. “Completion of this financial restructuring is conditional on the approval of [Tuesday’s] CVA proposal, which is designed to tackle the cost of the company’s leasehold obligations across its UK restaurant portfolio.” Under the terms of the deal, existing investor Three Hills Capital Partners becomes the majority shareholder. Current owner Hutton Collins will retain a minority stake in the business. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/09/anne-dyer-aberdeen-orkney-priests-threaten-quit-over-first-female-bishop","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T14:53:31Z","webTitle":"Aberdeen and Orkney priests threaten to quit over first female bishop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/09/anne-dyer-aberdeen-orkney-priests-threaten-quit-over-first-female-bishop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/09/anne-dyer-aberdeen-orkney-priests-threaten-quit-over-first-female-bishop","fields":{"headline":"Aberdeen and Orkney priests threaten to quit over first female bishop","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Priests in Aberdeen and Orkney are threatening to resign over the appointment of Scotland’s first female bishop, saying the move was “divisive and disrespectful”. Seven of the diocese’s 14 priests have signed an open letter protesting against the appointment in November of Anne Dyer as bishop. The letter says Dyer’s appointment “directly goes against the established wishes of the diocese on the views it would hope that our new bishop would hold and minister to us from the perspective of them”. Dyer is the first woman to be made a bishop by the Scottish Episcopal church since its general synod voted to allow female bishops almost 15 years ago. She is a supporter of same-sex marriage, which was accepted by the Scottish church last summer, in a historic move that resulted in de facto sanctions being imposed by the global Anglican communion. Aberdeen and Orkney was the only diocese in Scotland to oppose the move in consultations. Dyer officiated at a same-sex marriage in October. However, the principal objection to Dyer’s appointment among signatories of the protest letter ostensibly concerns process. In the Scottish church, bishops are elected to post. However, an electoral committee in Aberdeen and Orkney twice failed to agree on a shortlist of candidates. Under such circumstances canon law stipulates that the choice falls to bishops. The letter says the “level of disquiet” in the diocese has already resulted in the resignation of the dean and a chapter canon, and that “others are considering similar action”. John Walker, rector of the Donside churches group and a key signatory of the letter, told the Guardian: “This disagreement is not with Anne Dyer personally but the way the bishops made the appointment. The bishops said they would respect the conservative nature of our diocese.” At the time of the vote on same-sex marriage, Scottish bishops had said different views on the issue would be respected, said Walker. “Now they have chosen to appoint someone who backs same-sex marriage and indeed has already conducted one.” Alastair MacDonald, also a signatory and rector of St Drostan’s, Insch, and All Saints, Fyvie, said there were “different reasons for different people” in objecting to Dyer’s appointment. “But there is a general feeling that bishops haven’t listened to the diocese. This is probably the most conservative diocese in Scotland, and it happens to be quite united.” The letter demands a meeting between representatives of the diocese and Dyer before her consecration, and also asks that consent for the appointment be sought from the diocese electoral synod. If that is not possible, it goes on, “then we would ask that Canon Anne consider withdrawing her acceptance”. The signatories also expressed concern that Dyer “is not a car driver and this adds to the disquiet. She may have a plan as to how she will travel around the diocese, but, if so, we do not know of anyone within the diocese who has been informed of it.” In a letter responding to the protesters, Mark Strange, the bishop of Moray, Ross and Caithness and primus of the Scottish Episcopal church, said bishops “deplore that you have sought to subvert the outcome of the canonical process which led to Canon Dyer’s election”. The bishops had been unanimous in their choice and the process was in accordance with canon law, he said. “You state in your letter … that your ‘protest’ is not personally directed at Canon Dyer, and also that it does not concern arguments about women bishops or same-sex marriage. We are glad to note that and simply observe that to invite her to withdraw her acceptance of election seems entirely inconsistent with those assertions.” He said many in the diocese had expressed delight at Dyer’s selection."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/11/gorbachev-his-life-and-times-by-william-taubman-review-the-mysteries-remain","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-11T09:00:16Z","webTitle":"Gorbachev: His Life and Times by William Taubman review – the mysteries remain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/11/gorbachev-his-life-and-times-by-william-taubman-review-the-mysteries-remain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/11/gorbachev-his-life-and-times-by-william-taubman-review-the-mysteries-remain","fields":{"headline":"Gorbachev: His Life and Times by William Taubman review – the mysteries remain","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"If Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma, the same holds true for its most famous living citizen, Mikhail Gorbachev. From March 1985 to December 1991 he was under an unrelenting national and international spotlight as the Soviet Union’s leader. He wrote several autobiographical books while in power and has written more since retirement. At least a dozen associates have published memoirs in which he features prominently. Yet in spite of all this scrutiny, key questions about the man who did more than any other to change Europe and the world in the last half of the 20th century remain without clear answers. How did a secret reformist get chosen by deeply conservative elders to be their country’s next leader? Gorbachev felt his country needed fundamental change, so why did he not quickly develop a programme of political and economic action once he had secured the top job? Why did he fail to foresee the rise of nationalist unrest that eventually led to the Soviet Union’s fragmentation? Why did he consent to Germany’s reunification inside Nato without demanding anything in return, except cash to pay for Soviet troops’ rehousing? William Taubman, a professor at Amherst College in Massachusetts, who won a Pulitzer prize for his biography of Khrushchev, has done a phenomenal amount of research into Gorbachev’s career, including interviews with the man himself. He relies heavily on accounts by the closest aides, in particular the sparky diary of Anatoly Chernyaev, which reveals Gorbachev’s bewildering volatility of mood as well as his intellectual contradictions. But Taubman concludes he has to leave many questions about Gorbachev unresolved. Here is a man who confided to Chernyaev in 1987 that “we’ve made a mess of socialism: nothing is left of it”, yet took time off during crises to reread Lenin’s speeches in the conviction that he could learn lessons from 70 years earlier on how to strengthen socialism in today’s context. Or take Gorbachev’s attitude to the Communist party when its cadres became increasingly vocal in resisting change by 1990. His aides were urging him to leave the party and found a social democratic alliance to compete and take its place. “I can’t let this lousy rabid dog off the leash. If I do, all this huge structure will be turned against me,” he told them, using the foul language to which he often descended in moments of anger or despair. Gorbachev’s biggest contribution was to provide Russians with freedom of speech and a multi-party democracy. Internationally, it was not to have used force to retain control of eastern Europe when its ruling Communist parties started to lose their grip. Behind this strategy lay a kind of Russian isolationism that ran counter to decades of Soviet internationalism. One might expect such a dramatic shift to have been preceded by long debate. Yet Gorbachev and his colleagues hardly ever discussed it. On the day after the Berlin Wall fell, Gorbachev did not even call the politburo into session, although he found time to send messages to US President George Bush, Margaret Thatcher and François Mitterrand, saying the East German leaders had taken the right decision. He was equally relaxed about the fall of communism elsewhere in the region. One reason was that Gorbachev was preoccupied and overwhelmed with domestic crises within the Soviet Union. What had started as a revolution from above had become a revolution from below, with street protests and revolts breaking out all over. This provoked massive resistance from conservatives in the Soviet Communist party. Gorbachev was buffeted by pressures on all sides. Taubman’s approach to this tumultuous story is chronological and Kremlin-oriented. While this means that his fast-paced narrative leaps about, accurately reflecting Gorbachev’s tactical zigzagging, it leaves insufficient space for describing the context of daily life for Soviet citizens and the mounting disillusionment with reform that led many Russians to view Gorbachev as an agent of destruction. It also means the book lacks an explanation for basic issues. To name just a few: why did shops have such massive food shortages? How come the black market became so pervasive? What went wrong with the effort to allow the development of private enterprise and small business under the guise of co-operatives? The book jumps from crisis to crisis just as Gorbachev’s daily agenda did, but readers would have benefited from some thematic chapters looking at key topics with the advantage of scholarly hindsight, such as the role of the mass media in hastening change, or Gorbachev’s clumsy handling of Baltic nationalism, or why (a question of renewed significance since 2014) a majority of people in eastern Ukraine, and even in Crimea, voted for independence and a break from Moscow in 1991. In a volume as comprehensive as this, it may seem cavalier to query points of emphasis. But Taubman’s section on the Afghan war is unnecessarily short. Gorbachev’s internationally negotiated withdrawal of Soviet troops while ensuring that Afghanistan’s ruling group under Mohammad Najibullah remained in power for a further three years was not a humiliation but a qualified success. It brought relief to thousands of Soviet families who feared their sons would be conscripted and killed but, like other Gorbachev accomplishments, won little gratitude from Soviet citizens. The chapter on the hardliners’ coup that put Gorbachev under arrest in his Crimean villa in August 1991 gets a mere 17 pages in a very long book. Yet it includes a surprisingly large number of paragraphs of speculation on whether Gorbachev was somehow complicit and only pretended to be detained (a claim that the plotters produced in their defence once the coup had failed). As one of the few foreign Moscow-based reporters who had not left Russia on holiday that August, I had the extra good luck of flying on the official plane that brought Gorbachev the news of his liberation, all recounted in the Guardian and in my subsequent book. The coup was one of the most dramatic turning points in Gorbachev’s career and deserves more ample treatment than Taubman provides. No one who spoke to the just freed Gorbachev, as we did, and witnessed his euphoria could have doubted that he had genuinely been detained. He gave us a breathless account of how he threatened suicide when his senior ministers, the coup organisers, pressed him to resign. Important too, though not covered by Taubman, was the atmosphere on the streets of Moscow during the three days the coup lasted. Although Boris Yeltsin, the other leading reformer, resisted the coup and several thousand people surrounded his headquarters in the Russian parliament to prevent his arrest, passivity and fatalism were the dominant reaction in the rest of Moscow and in other cities. Yeltsin’s call for a general strike went unheeded. But Taubman is right to devote space to Gorbachev’s missteps on his return to Moscow and ask why the president failed to go to the parliament and thank Yeltsin and the demonstrators for resisting the coup. It is another of the many questions to which Taubman replies with the phrase: it’s hard to understand.

He had his own late literary success with the publication of two volumes of short stories and a novella, The Other Garden, which won the Whitbread first novel prize in 1987. Francis, who has died aged 93, was also the creative force behind the transcendent photojournalism of the Sunday Times Magazine in the 1960s and 70s. He commissioned the new hatch of gifted photographers – David Bailey, Terence Donovan, Brian Duffy, Tony Snowdon, Don McCullin, Eve Arnold – believing, against the orthodoxy, that the image had to come first; and matching them to writers, some of whom had never written journalism before. Chatwin arrived as an “art adviser”; Francis’s literary network enabled him to pull in writers such as Gore Vidal. He was helped by an almost unlimited budget, and the talent of David King as graphic designer and Michael Rand as art editor, who laid out spectacular edge-to-edge spreads. In 1972, for instance, McCullin had 17 pages for his Vietnam pictures, without an advertisement to be seen. The magazine’s editor, when I arrived there in the late 60s, was the jovial, bon vivant Godfrey Smith. Francis, who survived four editors, avoided power, but, according to Smith’s successor Magnus Linklater, had it mysteriously anyway, “without lifting a finger”. He spent much time playing chess and singing Broadway duets with his office neighbour, the fashion editor Meriel McCooey. At one editorial conference in Smith’s office, with the usual lobster and chablis, a writer put up an idea. Smith asked: “What do you think about that, Francis?” He replied “I don’t know. I was asleep.” His piece-killing line was: “I’m not very drawn to that.” Not everyone was drawn to Francis; although mild, and with a punctilious politeness, he was also intellectually uncompromising, and given to moments of sudden, unexpected fierceness. His own pieces, mostly interviews, were groundbreaking in style and content. Many of them were collected in The Theatre of Embarrassment (1991). He was immersed in popular culture, music and cinema – Hollywood and especially French film and the Nouvelle Vague. He interviewed many of its directors and actors, including Stéphane Audran and Jeanne Moreau. He commissioned Man Ray to photograph Catherine Deneuve. He wrote profiles of Tiny Tim and PJ Proby, revealing his subjects mostly by their idiosyncrasies of expression. He never used a tape-recorder and took few notes, writing down two or three key words only. He wanted to produce “the intensity and clear-cut shape of a good short story”. The results were often hilarious, heightened by a sense of the absurd. In the royal couturier Norman Hartnell’s “crystal palace”, as he called it, “the glass door to the splendid salon is patterned with stars: ‘We added them on because ladies used to bump their noses against the transparent glass. They did, you know, they were very silly.’” “Francis got what was happening in the 60s,” said Bailey. “But he got everything, from Bette Davis to the Krays.” Francis met the Kray brothers when they asked him to write their biography; instead he interviewed them. He became fascinated particularly by their mother, Violet, who had made her sons feel “special”. When they sprung Frank “Axeman” Mitchell from Dartmoor prison in December 1966, starting a massive manhunt, Ronnie rang Francis and said: “We’ve got Mitchell. He wants to give himself up. To you.” The mechanics of a major scoop were arranged with the Sunday Times. Instead the Krays decided to bump Mitchell off and by 1968 they were in custody. Francis was an official visitor when they were jailed the following year and travelled regularly to Parkhurst on expeditions with Mrs Kray. Francis had a talent for friendship and although he lived by himself for 40 years, latterly in a flat above a dry cleaners in the Harrow Road, north-west London, his old age was never lonely. “He was the last link,” said Hollinghurst, “to worlds which seem abruptly much more remote. Who else could have reminisced to you both about the Krays and about Henry Green and Ada Leverson?” Francis was born in London. His father, Col Guy Wyndham, who died when Francis was 16, had fought at the Relief of Ladysmith during the Second Boer war in 1900. His mother, Violet, much younger than his father, was the daughter of the novelist Ada Leverson, the loyal friend whom Oscar Wilde called “The Sphinx”. Violet’s uncle Sydney Schiff had given the dinner in Paris in 1922 at which James Joyce and Marcel Proust met for the only time; and he translated Time Regained, the last volume of A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. Through his mother, Francis developed his love of France and French culture. At Eton, he educated himself, barely taking part. His housemaster was a friend of his father, and, it seems, let him off everything, although he advised him to bicycle; Francis rode to Maidenhead, to the cinema, which led directly, he said, to his commissioning “endless, endless articles about Hollywood things” on the Sunday Times. “I found I’d actually become a kind of expert in Hollywood glamour films.”’ He also discovered Proust which, he said, changed his life with the realisation of what literary art and experiment could do. He left Eton as soon as he could, went briefly to wartime Oxford, and was called up for the army, then invalided out with TB. He wrote reviews for the Times Literary Supplement, then read scripts for the publisher André Deutsch from 1955 until 1959. There he discovered Naipaul, whose first two novels he persuaded Deutsch to publish. They became lifelong friends. He found that Rhys, whom he had thought long dead, was alive and writing what became, under Francis’s guidance, Wide Sargasso Sea. I remember her, frail and vulnerable, drinking, with Francis, the lethal combination of whisky and champagne. In 1960 he was invited by Mark Boxer, its art director, to join Queen magazine, initially as theatre critic. In 1964 he followed Boxer to the Sunday Times Magazine as a senior editor. He survived until 1980, when he was, by then gratefully, fired. Karl Miller discovered the manuscript of the short-story collection Out of the War when Francis was moving house. It had lain untouched for 30 years after having been serially turned down. It was published to reviews which expressed incredulity at the maturity of his teenage writing and the fact of their rejection. The stories describe an immobilised state of mind that Francis used in his later writing: “I think what I’ve always wanted to do in fiction is to write about that – the hours and hours and hours, the enormous proportion of life which is spent in a kind of limbo, even in people’s active years. It seems to me that isn’t sufficiently celebrated in fiction.” Encouraged, he wrote, slowly, Mrs Henderson and Other Stories (1985) and The Other Garden. Critics were universal in their praise of a talent that had emerged, perfectly formed, after 40 years of incubation. Hollinghurst describes “the innate elegance, concision, comic but startling emotional accuracy” of his writing, and “the certainty one has of being in the hands of a writer who never wastes a word or puts one wrong”. Francis’s brother Hughie and three half-siblings predeceased him. He is survived by his niece, Rachel. • Francis Guy Percy Wyndham, writer and editor, born 2 July 1924; died 28 December 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/13/saturdays-best-tv-hard-sun-spiral","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-13T06:00:50Z","webTitle":"Saturday's best TV: Hard Sun; Spiral","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/13/saturdays-best-tv-hard-sun-spiral","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/13/saturdays-best-tv-hard-sun-spiral","fields":{"headline":"Saturday's best TV: Hard Sun; Spiral","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Hard Sun 9.35pm, BBC One How Hicks (Jim Sturgess) and Renko (Agyness Deyn) are still merrily wandering around on active duty after last week’s shenanigans is anyone’s guess.

Best known for her Dreamsnatcher trilogy, Elphinstone’s latest novel is an action-packed adventure and a truly magical tale (in both senses), set in the icy north. Erkenwald is a land of mountains, forests and glaciers; it is home to polar bears, eagles, whales and wolves, as well as to the Fur, Feather and Tusk tribes. In Elphinstone’s well-orchestrated mythology, the North Star, a Sky God “carved from stardust”, breathed life into the land that still retains traces of the magic of its creation. But “darkness can come to any kingdom and so it came to Erkenwald”. The story begins after one of the lesser Sky Gods escapes from the glacier where she has been imprisoned. This evil Ice Queen gains control of the Tusk tribe, sowing discord and suspicion among the other tribes. She uses dark magic to create Winterfang Palace, a fortress made of ice, where she imprisons men, women and children, whose voices she must steal if she is to gain immortality. One of the imprisoned children is a girl named Eska. Trapped in her glass music box, she remembers nothing of her life before her enchantment. However, it becomes apparent that there is something unique about her voice that the Ice Queen is desperate to acquire. Flint is a boy from the Fur tribe, who “usually only discovered where he was going halfway through a journey, and when he arrived he was often somewhere he hadn’t intended to be”. Flint breaks into the palace to free his mother, but stumbles on Eska first. In an unplanned rescue, the girl and boy escape, pursued by the Ice Queen, who will do whatever it takes to recapture Eska. While Sky Song reworks tropes recognisable from many fairytales and modern classics, Elphinstone’s confident narration harnesses familiar material to its own purpose while creating a tale that is fresh and compelling. A dense prologue summarises Erkenwald’s creation story, which removes the need for exposition later and sets the scene ready for the main event. It’s a children’s story that ticks a lot of boxes: two brave and resourceful children, a boy and a girl, who share a common goal and need to earn each other’s trust. They must outwit a formidable enemy and in so doing will test themselves and learn valuable lessons. The theme of belonging, in particular – to a tribe, to a family – runs through the narrative. “Belonging,” says one character, “is not about knowing your tribe. It’s about trusting people whatever their tribe … There are many ways to belong.” And young readers are sure to delight in a large cast of animal characters: a baby fox who hides in Flint’s hood, the golden eagle who teaches Eska how to fish, a spider who leaves messages in its web. At the heart of this warm, imaginative tale is a sense of the magic to be found in the wilderness. As Eska learns: “You have the wild on your side and the wild doesn’t play by ordinary rules.” • Linda Buckley-Archer’s The Many Lives of John Stone is published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

You can’t call yourself a runner until you can run for longer than 90 seconds at a time. But you can’t force yourself out running when you’re not a runner. It’s a puzzler, right? That’s why I went to see Matt Roberts, a personal trainer so high-end that David Cameron was a client; that’s him you could see in the background of paparazzi shots, looking like a security detail, but actually monitoring the PM’s glute engagement. Roberts is my age and I remember him starting out, when I was at the London Evening Standard and all we talked was his abs, the Atkins diet and Zoë Ball. Anyway, 21 years pass and – wham! – he looks exactly the same and I look like his portrait in the attic, the spirit animal who’s done his ageing for him. Roberts immediately dispells this shadow of inauthenticity: he insists on everyone calling themselves a runner, because everyone was born to run. He can assess a huge amount just from running alongside me for a minute or two: how long my stride is, how harshly my heels hit the ground, what my posture’s like, how much I’m struggling at what kind of tempo. But before that, we do five minutes that is more like therapy. “When you feel you can’t go on, is it your legs that are killing you, or your lungs?” he asks. Lungs, hands down. Plainly, if I had stronger glutes, then my technique would be better and that would help. “OK, make each in breath four strides and each out breath the same.” The difference is immediate and striking: I could now run for two whole minutes at a time. Next he advises me to make my stride shorter. “You’re only accelerating if you have contact with the ground.” I was halfway round the park before I figured out what he meant; the shorter your stride, the more often your foot hits the ground, the faster you go. Within reason, obviously. Roberts is full of useful advice: almost everyone is a heel-striker, but if you aim to hit the ground with the middle of your foot, you’ll put less pressure on your patellar tendon in the long term. Keep your head up and your chest open; hunching forward is inefficient. Stamina work is all intervals (a minute fast, a minute slow); endurance work is all about just trying to run for longer without stopping. You have to do both, Roberts says, before commencing a story about Paula Radcliffe’s training regime. Unfortunately, being asked to use Paula Radcliffe as a role model of any sort exceeds every last ounce of my stamina. What I learned To improve your speed, you should be “overloading”, running at a pace that is more than you can reasonably stand, for around five minutes every two days. It’s called overloading and it’s almost unbearable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jan/09/plus-size-reinvented-curve-marks-and-spencer-range","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T17:30:06Z","webTitle":"Plus-size reinvented: 'We were told to hide, wear a sack – now we want equality'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/09/plus-size-reinvented-curve-marks-and-spencer-range","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jan/09/plus-size-reinvented-curve-marks-and-spencer-range","fields":{"headline":"Plus-size reinvented: 'We were told to hide, wear a sack – now we want equality'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Danielle Vanier is a fashion blogger. A recent post sees her in a keyhole-front leather-look jumpsuit teamed with red lipstick and matching ankle boots; on her Instagram feed she is captured in modern faux-candid selfie style, gazing out of a window in black lingerie. Vanier is 30 years old, beautiful, an ambassador for Nike, and a digital influencer with 100,000 followers. She is also – to use her preferred descriptor – fat. The aforementioned lingerie selfie is captioned “Three Cheers For Back Fat”. “I have always felt that I could have belly rolls, I could have chubby legs, and I could still look great,” she says. Vanier is a consultant to Curve, a new Marks &amp; Spencer range available in sizes 18-32, the first pieces from which go on sale today. That M&amp;S, which is already the biggest retailer in the UK plus-size market with womenswear available up to size 28, has created a separate plus-size collection is a reflection of how plus-size women are demanding the industry serve their needs with the same degree of attention to detail as women shopping for a size 10. Take sleeves. One £59 faux-leather jacket from the Curve collection has been a hit in pre-launch research, partly due to hidden stretch jersey inserts that make comfortable but shapely sleeves. “Arm circumference is one of those little details that make a difference in plus fashion,” says British plus-size blogger Lottie L’Amour. “We want clothes that accommodate our curves, and flatter our curves.” (Vanier, who is “obsessed” with the jacket, loves “not being sausaged into a sleeve.”) Curve represents a shift in the emotional tone of plus-size fashion. “When I walk into a shop, I want to feel like the brand are proud of me. I want to feel that they want me in their store, they want me to look great in their clothes,” says Vanier. The size 20 mannequins on which Curve will be displayed in store had to be specially commissioned, as mannequins are only produced in size 6-8 as a “regular” size and a size 12 as a “plus” size. They may be a signpost of how stores will look in the future, as body size diversifies. Currently, the bestselling sizes at M&amp;S are 14 and 16, with sizes 12 and 18 coming next, but the trend is for a broadening spread of sizes: as well as increased demand for the largest sizes, the store is seeing strong sales of size 6, particularly in its Autograph range. “Body positivity” is a buzz phrase in plus fashion. L’Amour (example post: “Swimsuit or Bikini? Being body positive at the beach”) believes that the “curve” label is catching on because it reflects a more upbeat self-perception. “I don’t really mind what the clothes are called, as long as I can find them,” she says, “but some women don’t like being called ‘plus’. Curve sounds more flattering.” Pre-launch research at M&amp;S pointed to Curve as the best name for the new range because “there is no fear of the term ‘curve’ – it has positive connotations”, says the store’s head buyer, Jo Hales. “I myself use the word ‘fat’ because I don’t see it as negative,” says Vanier, who trained as a textile designer. Retail is taking its time to catch up with the positive attitude of Vanier and L’Amour. “Sometimes I ask for a plus-size dress to wear in a shoot, and the biggest press sample is a size 16,” says Vanier with an eye-roll. She is frustrated, also, by the unambitious aesthetic of much plus-size fashion. “One of my favourite pieces in Curve is a sleeveless khaki trenchcoat, which I am obsessed with – you can layer it over jeans and a white T-shirt and it looks really modern. We need more of that sort of fashion.” The attention being newly lavished on the plus-sized shopper is motivated by a clear business opportunity. While the average British woman is a size 16, only 20% of money spent on womenswear is spent on plus-size fashion. The industry is banking on the notion that plus-size women will spend more money on clothes if the offer becomes more appealing. The success of 11 Honore, which translates the Net-a-Porter model into plus-size with an edit of catwalk fashion in sizes 14-24, has revealed an appetite for luxury fashion, while brands such as Elvi (typical piece: black and polka-dot lace maxi skirt, in sizes 14- 26) and Premme (home of Vanier’s keyhole jumpsuit) have brought fashion-forward attitude to the plus-size market. Curve will face strong competition on the British high street from Asos Curve and River Island Plus, which have established themselves as go-to brands for plus-size shoppers with an appetite for catwalk and streetstyle trends. Ashley Graham, who recently became the first plus-sized name to feature on Forbes’ list of highest-paid models, has evolved into an activist for body positivity. Recently, she has publicly called out Victoria’s Secret for not including any bigger models on their catwalk, and praised Italian Vogue for not retouching photos of her. The arrival of Curve at Britain’s most seminal high-street giant is a marker of how this confidence has trickled down to a high-street shopper who is no longer content to rifle through the back of the rack for a scaled-up version of clothes that the design studio conceived in a size 10. “What the plus-size customer is asking for now, as she becomes more discerning, is a range specifically for her,” says Hales. “This range is designed on a size 24 block, instead of a size 12 block, and sized up and down from there.” This has a tangible impact on design. A floral print, for instance, might look better scaled up so that it is in proportion with the expanse of fabric. “To get the perfect plus-sized jean, we have made it higher on the rise. With shirts, we have adjusted the relative size of the front pockets.” Non-cling fabrics have been used in pursuit of “a flattering silhouette, rather than a tent,” says Hales. Acknowledgement that plus-size women want a full range of styling and layering options is still a work in progress. There are still lingering assumptions about who this woman is: that she wants an under-the-radar wardrobe, instead of wanting fashion. That she doesn’t like her body and doesn’t want to spend money on it. That she doesn’t work out. A stale industry squeamishness about plus-size translates into an undercooked, underseasoned final product. “Before, we were told to hide away, wear a sack, not wear a spectacle of ourselves,” says Vanier. “But now we go shopping with our friends, and we want equality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/14/early-man-review-aardman-animations","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T15:30:30Z","webTitle":"Early Man review – Aardman claymation comedy brings Brexit to the bronze age","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/14/early-man-review-aardman-animations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/14/early-man-review-aardman-animations","fields":{"headline":"Early Man review – Aardman claymation comedy brings Brexit to the bronze age","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It might be set in the stone age but the latest claymation epic from Wallace and Gromit creators Aardman touches on two of the timeliest issues of the coming year. First, the 2018 World Cup: this is squarely a story about football, and therefore likely to find a global audience even if its sense of humour remains lovably, colloquially English. Second, this is a story concerned with Britain’s sense of history and identity. By accident or design, Aardman have made a Brexit movie! That could be an overzealous interpretation, admittedly, in a climate in which everything seems to be about Brexit, but the evidence is difficult to ignore. Early Man focuses on an insular, small-minded tribe who live in a giant crater, cut off from the outside world (the prologue identifies their location as “near Manchester”). They’re surprisingly diverse for such a small group, with varying skin colours and accents, and voices supplied by the likes of Timothy Spall, Selina Griffiths, Johnny Vegas, Gina Yashere and Richard Ayoade. Mop-topped young Dug (Eddie Redmayne), is inquisitive and smart by comparison with the rest of his tribe: why don’t they try hunting a mammoth instead of just rabbits? What are those spherical objects they’re kicking in the ancestral cave paintings? “They couldn’t draw rabbits back then,” the chief tells him, but the prologue has already revealed that this is the tribe that invented football, even if they’ve forgotten their heritage. Just as Dug starts to ponder the world outside, that world comes crashing into their hunter-gatherer idyll, in the form of a more advanced civilisation. These people have invented bronze, not to mention wheels, machines and sliced bread. With their technological edge, they easily appropriate Dug’s village and consign the tribe to work in the mines. Their pompous, greedy leader, Lord Nooth, is voiced by Tom Hiddleston in the broadest French accent this side of ’Allo ’Allo: “You ’ave no ’ome!” he tells them. The bronze agers’ city is a melting pot of continental accents and influences – a sort of European, er, union, you could say. They are in thrall to the beautiful game, and for good measure, their team colours are blue and yellow. Defiant Dug challenges his oppressors to a football match to win back their village – despite having no idea how to actually play the game. Luckily, Scandinavian-sounding Maisie Williams defects (the bronze age team is male-only) and puts Dug’s ragtag team through a few training montages, and it’s game on: David v Goliath, or perhaps Accrington Stanley v Real Madrid. Veterans of the “it all depends on the big game” sports movie will know where this is all going, but as with so much of Aardman’s work, the delight is in the details. The frame is invariably filled with sight gags, puns and playful little details, in an Asterix/Flintstones vein. Rob Brydon has fun voicing a pigeon that transmits its sender’s messages all too faithfully, and Dug has a smart, Gromit-like pig sidekick (oinked by director Nick Park himself). Some of the jokes will need carbon-dating to ascertain their age, but the good-natured humour never loses its fizz. Is the film really meant to be taken as Brexit-for-juniors commentary? If so, its allegiances are not black and white, or blue and yellow. Early Man’s “Europeans” embody some very British prejudices, on and off the pitch (diving to get a penalty – typical!), but they’re also more cultured and sophisticated. Dug and his tribe are fighting to “take back control” by reconnecting with their past, you could say. But their lack of engagement with the outside world has made them backward, and a late revelation about those ancestral cave paintings suggests identity myths are not all they’re cracked up to be. Early Man’s setting is also of a piece with Aardman’s form of painstakingly hand-crafted stop-motion animation, which is positively prehistoric compared to the flashier, computer-made family films that now dominate the box office. Aardman themselves are the little tribe fighting the giants, and putting their faith in old-fashioned storytelling and unassuming comedy. These little gap-toothed, eyes-too-close-together characters are every bit as expressive as their digital counterparts, and there’s something heartening about seeing actual human fingerprints in the clay models. Early Man does little to move things on, in evolutionary terms, but – for younger viewers especially – its straightforward storytelling and gentle humour still work a treat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14882","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T00:00:34Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,882","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14882","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14882","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,882","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/jan/10/shifting-care-closer-to-home-ease-pressure-hospitals","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T09:14:26Z","webTitle":"Shifting care closer to home will ease pressure on hospitals | Ewan King","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/jan/10/shifting-care-closer-to-home-ease-pressure-hospitals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/jan/10/shifting-care-closer-to-home-ease-pressure-hospitals","fields":{"headline":"Shifting care closer to home will ease pressure on hospitals","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"New year is associated with hope and optimism. But for the NHS, the headlines tell a different story: hospitals at full capacity. As you might expect, these articles focus on what is going wrong: headlines such as “NHS in crisis”, stories of beds in corridors and stressed-out nurses. Clearly these problems are real, but focusing only on hospitals won’t solve the problem. We need to think more broadly if we are to find lasting solutions; we must think about prevention, and how far it is embedded in local systems. For some time, health and care reforms have been about shifting care closer to home. The programme of vanguards and sustainability and transformation plans was intended to herald a greater focus on prevention and self-care to reduce pressure on hospitals. There is some evidence that these reforms are working: Hertfordshire’s prevention-focused Better Care for Care Home Residents Vanguard, for instance, led to a 45% reduction in hospital admissions and A&amp;E attendances between April 2015 and May last year. But we are not yet able to see the scale of change necessary to make a significant dent in demand across England and beyond, because of financial pressures, which make it difficult for organisations and commissioners to fund new, innovative services; inward-looking leadership teams focused on short-term goals and local evidence and solutions; a lack of integration across health and social care and housing; and outdated performance management and contracting systems. A seismic shift – at the level needed – is not straightforward to deliver. As Nesta, Shared Lives and the Social Care Institute for Excellence (Scie) argue in a new report on innovation, we know a lot about what works to support independence in ways that reduce demand for urgent care, but less about how to extend the benefits to more people. As the report concludes: “New and better ways of delivering relationship-based care are needed, and already exist, but are inconsistently implemented or poorly scaled.” So what can national policymakers and local health and care leaders do differently? First, we need to restate the case for preventive, community-based care and, as part of this, more clearly articulate how it will make a difference to people’s lives. For example, in our report we describe a place in the near future where people are supported to maintain their independence, improving their wellbeing at reduced cost to the NHS. What if you have a long-term condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; are you able to join a Breathe Easy peer support group to help you manage the condition? We also talk about North Yorkshire, where an innovation fund has been used to fund initiatives reducing isolation, preventing falls and supporting people to stay at home when they want to. Local care and support providers say this has helped them to build their networks, and they are now working in partnership with more local services. Second, we need collective local leadership focused on keeping people well and better supported at home, underpinned by a strong commitment to integrated commissioning and to changing funding flows to support more community-based care. A hospital trust chief executive recently told me that investment away from beds and A&amp;E services would support far better preventive approaches – but there has to be a system-wide strategy for all to lead and support if bed pressures arise. Third, we need to make better use of the evidence we have, making a stronger case for investment in preventive care. In Scie’s prevention library, we have a mass of evidence-based examples of community-led care and support that helps to reduce demand for hospital care. Age UK’s personalised integration approach in North Kent is a model of holistic support targeted at older people with long-term conditions. It has led to a 26% reduction in non-elective hospital admissions. Commissioners need to use these examples to argue for spending more on preventive models of care and support. Carrying on as we are is unlikely to succeed; we are firefighting in the face of growing demand in hospitals without always considering what wider changes are needed to prevent this growth. The social care green paper, to be published in the summer, provides a good opportunity for setting out plans for a more preventive, person-centred, health and care system, but there is nothing to stop leaders being more ambitious about prevention right now.

Grainger, who took charge of the UK funding body for Olympic sports last year after retiring from rowing following the Rio Games, also warned the International Olympic Committee that the public would lose faith in sport if cheats did not face harsh sanctions. “What doping steals from athletes is irreplaceable,” said Grainger, speaking from experience, having initially lost a 2006 world championship medal to a Russian crew that was subsequently banned. “And when it happens time and time again, on that scale, then you realise that maybe the punishments haven’t been serious enough in the past and things need to change.” After agreeing that the IOC’s decision to allow some Russians to compete as Olympic Athletes from Russia was “a fudge”, Grainger was asked for her likely reaction if any British competitors lost out to Russians in Pyeongchang. “You can imagine how we will feel,” she replied. “There’s a very, very strong argument that there should be no Russians there – at all. “Because when the public lose trust in a system, a sport or a country, as they have done with Russia, it reflects badly on all sport.” Meanwhile, British Olympic chiefs and UK Sport defended the £32m funding of Winter Olympic sports after targeting their best-ever performance in Pyeongchang. UK Sport has set a medal target of at least five medals – one better than in Sochi in 2014 – and says that, if all goes to plan, 10 medals were possible. However, questions were raised about the levels of funding for winter sports given that so few people take part in them in Britain. Skeleton, for instance, gets £6.5m over four years but is expected to get only one medal. UK Sport’s chief executive, Liz Nicholl, defended the funding and said the nation benefited when British athletes made the podium. “We will always focus on the medal moment to make everyone proud and to create a healthy, ambitious and active nation,” she said. “I am really confident there will be smiles on our faces as we watch through the Pyeongchang Olympics and Paralympics. And, relatively, it is a smaller amount of money compared to what we put into the summer sports.” Bill Sweeney, the chief executive of the British Olympic Association, pointed to the success of cycling to show how public attitudes have changed – and claimed the same thing could happen in winter sports. “If you had said 15 years ago that we would ever be a cycling nation, you would probably have thought no way,” he said. “But there has been a lot of investment and we have seen some amazing success inside and outside the Olympic Games. “I think that logic applies to the snow sportsIf you look at slopestyle and alpine skiing and snowboarding, I see a lot of kids going to Europe to participate in that. And winning medals makes a difference.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jan/09/salome-review-david-mcvicar-strauss-royal-opera-house","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T14:25:27Z","webTitle":"Salome review – an injection of fresh blood for chilling, gory Strauss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/09/salome-review-david-mcvicar-strauss-royal-opera-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jan/09/salome-review-david-mcvicar-strauss-royal-opera-house","fields":{"headline":"Salome review – an injection of fresh blood for chilling, gory Strauss","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Shock and revulsion don’t often endure for over a century. Since Strauss’s Salome premiered in 1905, we’ve gradually come around to all manner of once-outrageous ideas, from onstage nudity and performers who stand with their backs to the audience to voting women and same-sex marriage. Yet Salome remains to this day a thrilling, chilling piece, its eponymous antiheroine as disturbing as ever. David McVicar’s 2008 production – directed in its third revival at the Royal Opera House by Bárbara Lluch – still doesn’t take any chances. McVicar injects extra opportunities for provocation with more nakedness, more hints at sexual violence, a gorily realistic severed head, and lashings of fake blood. This is the stuff of B-movies. The production’s power, by contrast, lies in its subtler touches. For instance, in the divided spaces of Es Devlin’s austere concrete set (bare lightbulbs, dirty tiles, exposed copper pipes), which places the action in the grim behind-the-scenes of a debauched dinner party. Clad in art-deco bling, the guests are drawn to the backstairs action as enthralled onlookers, lurking silently on stage like so many creepy Aubrey Beardsley figures. Or in Andrew George’s reworking of the Dance of the Seven Veils as a dressing-up fantasy with no nudity and almost no dancing – unsettling and seedy in equal measure. But what sticks in the mind above all is McVicar’s conception of Salome as a petulant pseudo-teen. She’s a riot of overwrought pouting, wheedling, sulking and foot-stamping. The gap between her mundane histrionics and her extraordinary desires could hardly be larger. In her ROH role debut, Malin Byström was masterful. Making bold use of her voice’s many colours – exhaling and snarling as much as singing – she was almost under-powered at times, only to let rip with astonishing force in her long final monologue. Michael Volle’s Jokanaan was a genuine match for her, projecting with ease, his voice at once richly textured and hard-edged, his stage presence physically menacing. As Mr and Mrs Tetrarch, John Daszak and Michaela Schuster made a virtue of vocal bluster (Daszak’s voice in particular straining at the top) to embody decay through and through. Down in the pit, Henrik Nánási managed a slow-burn transition from orchestral sumptuousness (legato über Alles) to a terrifying climax in which bows bit ferociously at strings and the brass seethed and spat. When Strauss’s score sounds as scary as this, blood’n’gore can seem positively tame by comparison. • At Royal Opera House, London, until 30 January.

Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece. First of all, let me wish you all a Happy new year! This week’s topic was supposed to reflect the change from old to new, but much of the material nominated was more about change in general, so this week for the A-list I stuck to tracks that matched what I had in mind when setting the challenge. However, the B-list, which will be posted in the comments, is compiled from all of the nominations, so I hope you will enjoy that too. The Beatles’ Yesterday, with which we begin, reflects the topic nicely. One day the singer’s life was perfect; the next day it had changed beyond belief. In a different vein, Sabaton contemplate the truism that “When the old meets the new / It always ends the ancient ways” in their song Shiroyama, about the end of the Samurai. Changing the mood completely Paolo Nutini’s old shoes have given way to New Shoes, and it’s making him very happy! A couple of tracks now that riff on the fact that the old is replaced by new, then the new becomes old and in turn is replaced by something else. Foo Fighters’ End Over End considers, now that they are older, the things that were once new, and on how someday they will all be new again. Similarly Jethro Tull sings that it was A New Day Yesterday “but it’s an old one now”. Next, three very different new year songs. The Bottle Rockets sing about how the old year has changed to the new, but their life hasn’t really changed, in Another Brand New Year. Steeleye Span’s The King recalls the tradition of displaying a wren (real or constructed) on St Stephen’s day, when Christmas is past and the new year is coming. Finally in this section, Bing Crosby implores: Let’s Start the New Year Right. Last, two songs that absolutely nailed what I had in mind when I suggested the topic – although neither had actually occurred to me. First of all, the Buggles’ Video Killed the Radio Star is all about how changing technology leads to changing tastes (although these days it might be truer to say “Streaming killed the Radio DJ”). Finally the Eagles tell the story of the New Kid in Town, who outstays his welcome and becomes the old kid, until being replaced by another new kid.

It is my favourite thing when movie titles appear as dialogue in films, so imagine my glee when Roman Duris’s kidnapper, Cinquanta, calls up Gail and sneers down the phone in his best Italian accent: “Get it from your father-in-law, he has all the money in the world.” Based on John Pearson’s 1995 book Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J Paul Getty, the film is obsessed with the concept of wealth and its accumulation. “There’s a purity in beautiful things that I’ve never been able to find in people,” says Plummer’s Getty, whose cheapness is as much a plot point as his wealth. It doesn’t make for particularly thrilling viewing until the film’s final third, which sees the kidnappers beginning to get as annoyed as the audience is about the dragged-out ransom plotline. There’s a nasty scene of an ear being severed and a quite good car chase that get things moving, but it’s a slog to get there. Distractingly, the film was originally shot with Kevin Spacey as Getty, who was replaced by Plummer after facing allegations of sexual misconduct in late 2017. An extravagance perhaps to reshoot Getty’s scenes, though cheaper than the price Sony might have had to pay regarding the critical fallout. It’s impossible to watch without imagining Spacey in the role, or at least looking for the joins in the film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/03/domestic-violence-offenders-register-theodore-johnson-angela-best","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T16:53:46Z","webTitle":"We need a domestic violence offenders’ register.

Theodore Johnson is proof","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Why aren’t women being warned before they form relationships with dangerous men? Earlier this week, there was widespread shock when Theodore Johnson, 64, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to the murder of his former partner, Angela Best. Best had no idea, when she first met Johnson, that he already had convictions for killing his wife and another partner. If ever there was an argument for a domestic violence offenders’ register, Johnson is it. Many will wonder why he received such a light prison sentence (three years) when he was convicted of killing his wife, Yvonne Johnson, in Wolverhampton in 1981. He was convicted of manslaughter a second time in 1993 after he strangled his partner, Yvonne Bennett, at their home in north London. Two years later, after his release from a psychiatric unit, Johnson met Best and began a relationship with her in another area of London. His short sentences are clearly a cause for concern. But the really important question highlighted by the case is why the criminal justice system fails to warn future partners about the record of convicted abusers. Here we have a man, with a documented history of lethal violence towards women, who was able to move from one area of the country to another, leaving knowledge of his crimes behind him. Best had no idea of his record until she found letters revealing that he had killed a previous partner. This is a common pattern among extreme abusers, who deliberately move to a new area where they (and their crimes) are unknown. Best’s children described him as abusive and controlling, something that makes it all the more difficult for a woman to leave. Research confirms that women are most at risk of death or serious injury in the months after they leave an abusive man. Best finally left Johnson in the autumn of 2016. In December, he asked her to meet him at his flat, where he attacked her with a claw hammer and strangled her with a cord in what appears to have been a copy of his second lethal attack. Hours later, Johnson threw himself under a train at Cheshunt railway station in Hertfordshire, losing both his arms. A register for men like Johnson would go much further than Clare’s law, which allows women to ask the police whether a man has a history of abuse. Even abusive men know enough to be on their best behaviour at the beginning of a relationship, and many women feel uncomfortable about going behind the back of someone they have no reason to suspect. A register would add a “right to know” to the current “right to ask”. Like convicted sex offenders, men convicted of domestic violence would have to inform the police of their current address, making it much harder for them to drop off the radar. Crucially, they would also have to tell the police if they have formed new relationships. Officers would then have a duty to warn the women concerned about the offenders’ criminal records. The police support new legal powers on these lines and so does the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Critics say it would take up a great deal of police time at a moment when forces are already stretched, but that is an argument (which Khan and other police commissioners have already made) for ensuring they have the resources they need. The other argument against a register, which was also made against Clare’s law, is that it offers no protection against men who have managed to avoid convictions. But officers already try to avoid creating a false sense of security, pointing out that the absence of a criminal record should not be taken as a clean bill of health. Those who do get a result, even if it is unwelcome, have a piece of knowledge that could save them from death or serious injury. It is impossible to know what Best would have done if the police had been obliged to tell her, when she first met Johnson in 1995, that he was a convicted double killer. What is undeniable is that if she had been warned about his terrible history, she would have had choices – and she might still be alive now. • Joan Smith is a columnist, novelist and human rights activist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/03/us-drug-firm-offers-cure-for-blindness-at-425000-an-eye","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T18:15:23Z","webTitle":"US drug firm offers cure for blindness – at $425,000 an eye","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/03/us-drug-firm-offers-cure-for-blindness-at-425000-an-eye","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/03/us-drug-firm-offers-cure-for-blindness-at-425000-an-eye","fields":{"headline":"US drug firm offers cure for blindness – at $425,000 an eye","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A drug whose inventors claim it can cure a rare form of blindness is to be one of the most expensive medicines ever sold at $850,000 (£630,000). Luxturna is injected directly into the eye to address the root cause of visual impairment by replacing a defective gene in the retina. It is the first gene therapy to be approved for use in the US, and was given the go-ahead by the Federal Drug Administration last month. However, the price of the treatment has only just been revealed. Spark Therapeutics, the company behind the treatment, had previously claimed the treatment was worth $1m, citing the cost of a lifetime of blindness in lost earnings and wages for caregivers. But the firm said it had settled for the lower price of $850,000, or $425,000 per eye. It will also offer ways to spread the cost to health insurers, which have expressed concern about their ability to cover the expense. “We wanted to balance the value and the affordability concerns with a responsible price that would ensure access to patients,” said Spark Therapeutics’ chief executive, Jeff Marrazzo. Luxturna is one of an emerging breed of gene therapies that differ from more established medicines administered over a period of time. Such treatments involve a one-off procedure to alter defective DNA, allowing the body to repair the problem itself. They include a treatment for haemophilia and another for so-called “bubble baby” syndrome, where sufferers have to live in a sterile environment, which is to be offered on the NHS despite a £500,000 price tag. The sky-high price of some drugs – and so-called price-gouging by drug firms – became an issue in the US presidential election after Martin Shkreli, a US hedge fund entrepreneur, bought the drug Daraprim, used in the treatment of Aids and cancer, and hiked its price from $13.50 to $750. But the starting price of some new drugs has soared. Glybera, a gene therapy for a rare protein disorder, was launched in 2012 with a price tag of $1.2m. However, it was never approved in the US and was discontinued by manufacturers uniQure because of a lack of demand. Gene therapy is not alone in commanding staggering sums, particularly when it comes to treatments for rare diseases. Soliris, a drug that treats a condition called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria that attacks red blood cells, can cost up to $700,000 a year, while Elaprase, used in the treatment of Hunter syndrome, costs $500,000 a year. Luxturna could potentially become available free on the NHS in the UK after being submitted for approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A green light from the EMA is a prerequisite for approval by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the UK’s healthcare costs watchdog. In clinical trials, injections of Luxturna restored eyesight to people with severe visual impairment due to retinal dystrophy. Spark estimates that up to 2,000 people in the US suffer from the condition, with the number of sufferers rising to 6,000 when Europe and other markets where it could sell the treatment are included. The company said it had agreed bespoke deals with US insurers, which cover the cost of most US prescriptions, and they will get a refund if the drug doesn’t work as expected. Spark is also discussing a proposalfor insurers to pay for the drug in instalments over several years. The Philadelphia-based company said it would also pay transport costs not covered by insurance to help patients get access to treatment centres."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/06/gunsmoke-deadwood-why-us-turns-to-wild-west-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"From Gunsmoke to Deadwood: why the US turns to the wild west in times of crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/06/gunsmoke-deadwood-why-us-turns-to-wild-west-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/06/gunsmoke-deadwood-why-us-turns-to-wild-west-crisis","fields":{"headline":"From Gunsmoke to Deadwood: why the US turns to the wild west in times of crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Liberal America is scared.

When the United States is facing a crisis, there is no genre better suited to represent how the nation wants to see itself. “The western really tells you where the world is,” says Antoine Fuqua, director of the remake of The Magnificent Seven, which, released nearly 18 months ago, tells a fairly prescient story of where the US is currently heading. “We’re still dealing with people who are terrorising other people. We’re still dealing with people abusing other people, burning up the churches, killing people in the streets.” Quentin Tarantino, director of 2012 western Django Unchained, told Vulture before the release of The Hateful Eight back in 2015: “There’s no real film genre that better reflects the values and the problems of a given decade than the westerns made during that specific decade.” It is not hard to imagine him looking at the authoritarian chaos of Trump’s America and envisioning a bloody shoot ’em-up. All the elements are there: the egomaniacal robber baron and his band of thugs who invade the small town, pit the locals against each other and ride roughshod over the law. Indeed, in late 2016, HBO’s leisurely paced Westworld attracted a mystified but engaged audience to its vision of a future where jaded executives relieve stress by gunning down cowboys and engaging in rough sex with cyborg saloon sex workers. When the world seemed simpler, however, westerns echoed that simplicity. In 1959, there were 26 western shows on primetime US TV. America, just emerging from a recession and on the brink of war in Vietnam, was in need of uncomplicated stories of good guys triumphing against threats to civility. Shows such as Rawhide (featuring Clint Eastwood) and Gunsmoke comforted its audiences with tales of simple morality harking back to the 1930s. By the 70s, and echoed today, the ritual of eating family dinner while watching the nightly news took on a nightmarish aspect. Dispatches from Vietnam, the oil crisis, civil unrest, airline hijacks and the Tehran hostage situation combined to dent the national psyche. The broadcast networks attempted to salve those wounds with shows such as Little House on the Prairie and The Waltons – westerns scrubbed clean of gunplay that concentrated on treacly images of small-town life at the turn of the century. In 2002, with George W Bush pushing for war in Iraq, two landmark TV westerns debuted, one set in the past, the other deep into the future, both of them united by a distrust of government and the rule of law. Set in the year 2517, Joss Whedon’s sci-fi series Firefly featured a rag-tag group of civil war survivors-turned-smugglers, but only lasted 14 episodes. David Milch’s HBO series Deadwood, meanwhile, took some of the legendary figures of the old west – Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane and Wyatt Earp – and gave them Shakespearean soliloquies, taking creative liberties with their lives. Timothy Olyphant’s flinty-eyed haberdasher-turned lawman Seth Bullock is the new resident in the gold-mining settlement through whose point of view audiences were supposed to see the corrupt, blood-and-bullet-ridden town of Deadwood. However, it was soon evident that Ian McShane’s saloon owner and pimp Al Swearengen, whose every utterance was broken up with a “cunt” or a “cocksucker”, was the irritable embodiment of the town and its many sins. Conceived by Milch as a study of lawless society, Deadwood was an absorbing, at times difficult show. But the last great modern TV western was perhaps the cable series Justified, based on a short story by Elmore Leonard and taken off air in 2015. Timothy Olyphant may not have had a chance to shine among the ensemble of loquacious monologists in Deadwood, but in Justified, playing Marshal Raylan Givens, he relished the opportunity to play the deadpan, shoot-first, ask-questions-later character who returns to his crime-ridden home of Harlan County, Kentucky. Marshal Givens is described by his ex in the series pilot as “the angriest man I’ve ever known” – and, indeed, as we were reminded before and after the Trump campaign, the American heartland is filled with furious middle-aged white men clinging to their right to bear arms. Givens outdrew and out-quipped several seasons of hillbilly miscreants, but he felt their pain; a thin line separated the hero with the gun and the psycho he was shooting full of holes. In shows such as Westworld and Godless that line, you sense, is disappearing altogether. Because Americans are only getting more scared."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/03/arsenal-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T21:43:06Z","webTitle":"Arsenal 2-2 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/03/arsenal-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/03/arsenal-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal 2-2 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is that. The first half was entertaining enough, but what a second 45! On another day, with another ref, Arsenal could have had a man sent off; Chelsea may not have been awarded their penalty. But never mind the controversies. That was a rip-roaring game of football, the kind neither side deserved to lose. Magnificent fun. Chelsea stay in third; Arsenal remain in sixth. And we’ve still got two legs of the League Cup semi-final to come! 90 min +3: Chelsea should regain the lead! Morata is sent clear down the inside right. And for the third time this evening he fluffs a one on one! He smacks his shot into Cech. The rebound falls to Zappacosta, who smashes a hysterical drive onto the crossbar from 25 yards! Yes they can! Ozil slips Bellerin into space down the right. Bellerin reaches the byline and rips into the box. He crosses long with men in the middle. No matter! Because the ball’s sent into the area again. Alonso’s clearing header is weak. It drops to Bellerin, to the right of the D. One sweet half volley, and it’s creamed into the top left! 90 min: “There’s only one team in London,” trill the visiting fans. On the Arsenal bench, Arsene Wenger hangs his head. He’s not had the breaks this week. There are four added minutes. Can the Gunners give their boss some late festive cheer? 88 min: Before the corner is taken, Walcott comes on for Chambers. The set piece leads to Mustafi hitting a fierce volley from the edge of the box. It’s heading towards the top right, but clanks into Cahill’s arm. No penalty, because that arm was tucked into his body, and the defender had no time to react anyway. That would have been some goal. 87 min: A lot of space for Welbeck down the right. He’s got Sanchez free in the middle, though his team-mate is offside. He’s forced to settle for a corner. 86 min: Arsenal respond by pressing Chelsea back. Maitland-Niles nearly finds Welbeck in the centre with a cross from the left, and there’s a little blast of pinball, but eventually the reigning champions clear their lines. Willian, deep on the left, sprays a stunning pass wide right for Zappacosta, who twists the young Maitland-Niles inside and out. Zappacosta reaches the byline and slams a low cross into the centre, where Alonso clips a fine first-time shot across Cech and into the bottom left, six yards out and level with the right-hand post. A wonderful goal, and one that’s silenced the Emirates. What a turnaround this has been. 82 min: Bellerin turns on the jets to make space down the right. His cross is a tad too high for Welbeck in the centre. And then Hazard is replaced by Willian, to pantomime boos. Well, it’s still technically the festive season, after all. 80 min: Lacazette, who has run himself into the ground, is replaced by Welbeck. 78 min: Morata tears down the left again, only to be sent turf-wards by Bellerin. The referee waves play on, causing ironic cheers to ring around the stadium. It’s safe to say the home fans have been on a rolling boil since the penalty decision. Meanwhile here’s Mac Millings again: “I have one friend fewer than And We’re Off Again!’s Simon McMahon, so I sent a copy of the magnificent The Title to my Dad instead. I’d like to tell you he loved it, but I have not yet received a note of thanks, nor, indeed, the merest acknowledgement from him of its arrival. Perhaps he’s too engrossed in its marvelousness to express gratitude to his third-most disappointing child.” 76 min: Morata makes good down the left and very nearly finds Hazard in the middle. Cech smothers a fierce low cross with great skill. 75 min: Some admin: Ozil was booked while protesting the penalty award. “Wilshire really shouldn’t have been on the pitch with his dive, so I’ll give it to the Blues though that was a very soft pen,” opines Tim Penney. 73 min: Kante has a dig from the edge of the box. His shot takes a wicked deflection and only just sails wide of the left-hand post. Corner, nothing, etc., and so on. 71 min: Fabregas is replaced by Drinkwater. He gets a very generous ovation as he exits the stage. 70 min: And now Antonio Conte loses the place completely, as Morata misses another one on one, sent clean through by Fabregas. Morata drifts a little to the right, allowing Chambers to become an annoyance, then hoicks a shot, presumably meant for the top right, high and wide. Conte leaps around on the touchline, using words such as “eff” and “cee”. He really is not best pleased with his striker. 69 min: Arsene Wenger is in full Fume Mode. You can’t blame him, the week he’s had. A talking point, right there. Certainly not a great deal of contact between Hazard and Bellerin. Hazard dribbles into the Arsenal box from the left. He chips the ball past the outstretched leg of Bellerin, and goes down very easily. That’s another Wenger-bothering decision, because there didn’t appear to be much contact. Hazard certainly went down looking for it. He gets up and strokes the ball into the left-hand side of the net, Cech having gone the other way. 65 min: Arsenal look in the mood to recreate those crazy five minutes against Liverpool. Lacazette and Sanchez buzz down the inside-right channel with much intent. Sanchez claps an effort towards the bottom right, but it’s tipped round the post. The corner comes to nothing. Arsenal triangulate back and forth along the front of the Chelsea box. Suddenly the ball squirts down the inside-left channel. Wilshere strides with great purpose into the box, and absolutely larrups an unstoppable shot into the top left. Courtois is beaten at his near post, but couldn’t do anything about it, such was the ferocity of the strike. The Emirates erupts! 62 min: Arsenal are on top now, first to everything. A crisp one-two between Ozil and Lacazette sends the former clear into the box down the left, but he can’t get the ball past Courtois. Never mind, because Maitland-Niles drifts down the left and earns a corner. From which... 60 min: Arsenal go into high-press mode, and pin Chelsea back. It’s a fine period of pressure, featuring a couple of corners and a lot of heavy-metal hassling. It all ends when Ozil sweeps home from six yards, though the whistle had long gone for a block on Alonso amid a penalty-box melee. 57 min: Moses is replaced by Zappacosta. “It’s amazing to me that I have never seen that Beckenbauer free kick before,” begins Mac Millings. “In fact, I refuse to believe it possible that I can have reached 45 years of age with even being aware of its existence. Conclusion? That goal is no more real than ‘Gary Naylor’.” Bah! Busted after all these years. 55 min: And you could say the same about Wilshere. He’s already booked, and he goes over Christensen’s leg on the edge of the Chelsea box, looking for a free kick. The referee’s having none of it. Could he have shown Wilshere another yellow for a dive? There’s probably just enough ambiguity in the trick. But Arsenal could do with taking a bit more care here. On another day, with another ref, all that... 53 min: More end-to-end fun. Lacazette is one-on-one, for a split second, latching onto an Ozil slider down the inside left. He goes for the big whack, as opposed to the dink over Courtois, and the keeper wins the duel. The resulting corner leads to a Chelsea break upfield. That ends with Hazard and Morata failing to get a bouncing ball under control on the right-hand corner of the Arsenal six-yard box. Cech smothers. In the move upfield, Holding had clattered Fabregas, so he goes in the book. Given his trip on Morata a few minutes earlier, you could argue that he’s a lucky lad. 51 min: And off Arsenal go up the other end, the highly promising Maitland-Niles flashing down the left and curling high towards the far post. If only Sanchez was an inch taller. Goal kick. 50 min: Fabregas slips Hazard away down the right. Hazard enters the box and fizzes a shot towards the bottom left. Cech blocks. The ball springs to Bakayoko out on the right. He scoops inside. Alonso, coming in from the left, rises high and crashes a stunning header towards the bottom right. Cech turns it round the post. The corner comes to nothing. 49 min: Morata executes a perfect on-a-sixpence spin, and makes to sprint off down the right. He’s got a lot of grass in front of him, and so he’s cynically clipped from behind by Holding. It really should have been a yellow card, but the referee’s feeling generous. The free kick is far enough upfield to be no danger whatsoever. 47 min: Hazard goes dancing down the left but his cross into the box is nowhere near Morata. Chelsea on the front foot in the early stages of the half. And we’re off again! Chelsea are 45 minutes away from becoming the first team in the Premier League this season to string together five clean sheets. Can Arsenal, who have scored in their last 24 home matches, stop them? The visitors get the ball rolling for the second half. “Evening Scott,” begins Simon McMahon. “Flattery gets you everywhere I was once told. Happy New Year to you, you handsome devil. The story about the strips is of course told in The Title, a brilliant history of pre-Premiership English football. I can thoroughly recommend it, having bought it for myself and all my friends for Christmas. Two copies then. Some of today’s overpaid lot, on both sides of the white line, would do well to read it.” Believe it or not, I’ve not paid him a penny for that. Half-time viewing: This comes courtesy of Gary Naylor, a notoriously hard man to please. He thinks Marcos Alonso should have done better with that free kick on 38 minutes. “Why doesn’t anybody try this? Beyond the obvious reason of course?” And that’s your lot for the first half. No goals, but a highly entertaining 45 minutes of end-to-end football. 45 min: Chelsea very nearly open the scoring with a picture-book move. Ozil bursts down the middle of the park but is dispossessed by a crunching Kante tackle. The ball’s sprayed to Hazard down the inside-left channel. Hazard reaches the area and drifts across the front of it, left to right. On the right-hand edge of the D, he flicks it back to tee up Fabregas on the edge of the box. Fabregas looks to curl into the top right, but gets over-excited. That would have been something else. 43 min: Fabregas is the second player to go in the book, winning the ball in a slide tackle with Wilshere. But he takes the man out afterwards with a hefty follow-through, and that encourages the ref to flash yellow. Fabregas isn’t happy with that decision at all. 41 min: Moses and Hazard combine down the right, earning a corner in a tight space. Hazard does some more dribbling from a quickly taken short corner, and threatens to open Arsenal up. Which he half does, but he can’t find Morata by the near post. 39 min: Ozil drifts in from the left and looks to pearl a low one into the bottom right. He gives it a real smack, but it’s inches wide of the right-hand post. Courtois had it covered. Arsenal immediately come at Chelsea again, Ozil dribbling towards the byline down the left. He looks for Sanchez in the middle, but the ball clanks around in the pinball style, then is spirited away by Fabregas. 38 min: Alonso looks to whip the set piece into the top right. That’s three rugby points. That ball was never getting up and over the wall, then back down, in time. 37 min: Bellerin and Lacazette faff about on the edge of their own box. Morata leaps in to take control. He’s upended by Xhaka, on the right-hand edge of the D. Free kick in a very dangerous position. 35 min: More missed opportunities! Lacazette is close to latching onto a loose backpass to Courtois, but can’t connect. Then Fabregas floats in a cross from the left, the ball dropping over Mustafi to Bakayoko, free on the edge of the area! But he can’t bring it under control with his telescopic leg. Really not sure how this game remains goalless. But this is where we all are. 33 min: Ozil meanders down the inside-left channel and rolls a pass inside. It’s an inviting one, across the face of the Chelsea box. It could be hit by either Wilshere or Xhaka. It’s hit by neither, because they leave it to each other. Then a few semaphore shapes are thrown by the pair in frustration. 31 min: Wilshere picks up the first booking of the evening for a late slide on Fabregas in the middle of the park. It didn’t look malicious, just clumsy and very late as he entered a high-speed challenge for a loose ball that he was never going to win. He doesn’t bother arguing. 29 min: A loose pass from Chambers in the middle of the park allows Hazard to launch a dangerous attack down the inside-left channel. Hazard can’t quite get a shot away, and though Chelsea hang on to possession and knock it around awhile, that’s the danger gone. Moses is eventually caught offside out on the right wing. 27 min: Fabregas picks out another wonderful pass, drifting in from the left and slipping one down the channel for Bakayoko, who strides into the area and sends a riser towards Cech. The keeper tips over, and you know how these corners are going right now, so that’s that. 25 min: Moses is sent scampering down the right by Fabregas. He earns a corner. And it’s another wasted one. But still. This match is wonderfully open. 23 min: Lacazette, on the penalty spot with his back to goal, takes up a pass from Ozil on the left and spins, firing a stunning shot towards the bottom right. Courtois makes another world-class save at full stretch, tipping the ball round for a corner that comes to nothing. 22 min: Incidentally, just before all that Arsenal-related drama, Chelsea very nearly went ahead themselves, Moses twisting down the right and sending a ball towards the near post, Morata not too far away from connecting. Linear narratives are so 2017. 20 min: Ah, they’ve just shown the penalty shout again. Maitland-Niles went past Moses down the left, but clipped his own ankle while zipping past. A very good decision by the referee. 17 min: Maitland-Niles goes over in the Chelsea box. The crowd scream for a penalty kick. It looked like one, too, at first view, but no Arsenal player claims, so maybe not. Anyway, play is waved on, and after a bit of pinball, Sanchez whips a shot towards the bottom left from ten yards. Courtois gets fingertips to it, and what an intervention, because the ball clanks off the left-hand post, rolls all the way across to the bottom of the right-hand upright, thinks about spinning in off the woodwork, but rolls back instead and stays out. Courtois smothers on the line. How did that not go in?! Wow. 14 min: This is farcical. Moses, deep on the Chelsea right, sprays a long ball down the middle. Chambers should cut it out, but he’s having a chat with Wilshere in the centre circle! A move straight out of the famous Harry Enfield sketch, Charles Charlie Charles, all that. It’s a wonder he didn’t have a fag on. And so Morata is clear. He makes it to the box, and attempts to sidefoot past the advancing Cech and into the bottom right. He screws it well wide of the post. What a miss! That was a complete nonsense from start to end. 13 min: Hazard sashays in from the left, gliding across the front of the Arsenal area. But he can’t find room to shoot, and he can’t pick a pass. And the see-saw vibe continues, as Sanchez slips Maitland-Niles away down the left; the young man reaches the byline but his low fizzer is dealt with easily by Courtois. 11 min: This is lovely end-to-end fare. First Sanchez is found in space down the left; his looping ball into the centre is a touch too heavy to find Ozil, six yards out. Hazard then makes off down the left, enters the Arsenal area, and has a shot. Or was it a cross? Either way, it’s a corner that’s easily plucked from the sky by Cech. 9 min: Chelsea ping it around in Arsenal’s final third for what seems like an age. Suddenly Morata busies himself down the left channel and very nearly breaks clear into the area. Arsenal were mesmerised for a minute there. 7 min: Sanchez takes, looking for the top left. The ball deflects off the wall, and a rooted Courtois is relieved to see it fly wide right instead of into the top corner. It wasn’t too far away. The resulting corner is a total waste of time. Both teams have launched one decent attack, then, each following up with a nonsense of a set piece. 6 min: Ozil drops deep, picks up the ball and runs at Chelsea down the middle. He slips the ball to Lacazette on his left. The striker draws a foul from a clumsy Kante by cutting inside. A free kick in a dangerous position, 25 yards out and level with the left-hand post. 5 min: Chelsea hog the ball, stroking it around the back awhile. Arsenal haven’t really got going yet. Wilshere snaps around a few ankles. Lacazette attempts to get on the end of a long ball down the right. But otherwise, a quiet start by the hosts. 2 min: Alonso jigs down the inside-left channel. He should feed Hazard into acres on the outside, but draws a foul from Wilshere instead. Chelsea take it quickly, Hazard dribbling past a snoozing Chambers and into the Arsenal box. The ball’s hacked out for a corner. Chelsea faff around with a short one, and immediately run the ball out of play. And we’re off! Arsenal get the ball rolling, amid bedlam. Here’s Charles Antaki. “Old Moore’s Almanac for the start of 2018 gives us: ‘A once-mighty sage, enfeebled by time, will invoke hellfire on a man garbed in sombre black, and be cast out from the field of combat while his armies yield to forces of the hirsute’. Hard to fathom, as ever.” Happy new year, everyone! The teams are out! And it’s a sight for sore eyes, with both teams wearing their iconic first-choice colours. Of course, it could be Chelsea sporting white sleeves, as the novel idea was first proposed to their manager David Calderhead by Daily Mail cartoonist Tom Webster in the 1930s. But the conservative Calderhead didn’t fancy making the change, and it was Arsenal’s Herbert Chapman who ran with it instead. But we digress. It’s noisy down Ashburton Grove way, as you’d expect. We’ll be off in a minute! Antonio Conte speaks! “It is a London derby between two big teams. This type of game is always special for the players and fans. There is a good link between Azpilicueta and Morata [who have combined for six goals already this season]. Azpilicueta has a good right foot.” Arsene Wenger is asked how much of a risk he’s taking by starting with Ozil. “I don’t know, but he’s been declared fit and trained yesterday. So I hope ... I think he’s 100 percent. He gives us fluidity in our game, and final balls in our final third. We are determined. Life is not always fair [a reference to the late penalty awarded against Arsenal at West Brom] and you have to deal with it, and this is a good moment to show how we can respond.” Mesut Özil has passed his late fitness test and starts for Arsenal. He’s one of three changes to the side sent out at West Bromwich Albion on New Year’s Eve. Rob Holding and Ainsley Maitland-Niles also step up, with Alex Iwobi dropping to the bench, and Laurent Koscielny and Saed Kolasinac both injured. Chelsea make four changes to the starting line-up named against a Stoke City Representative XI last Saturday. Antonio Rudiger, Danny Drinkwater, Willian and Pedro are relegated to the bench, with Andreas Christensen, Cesc Fabregas, Tiemoue Bakayoko and star turn Eden Hazard taking their places. Arsenal: Cech, Chambers, Mustafi, Holding, Bellerin, Wilshere, Xhaka, Maitland-Niles, Ozil, Sanchez, Lacazette. Subs: Mertesacker, Ospina, Walcott, Iwobi, Welbeck, Coquelin, Elneny. Chelsea: Courtois, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Cahill, Moses, Fabregas, Kante, Bakayoko, Alonso, Hazard, Morata. Subs: Caballero, Rudiger, Drinkwater, Pedro, Zappacosta, Willian, Batshuayi. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). This was the fixture, last season, that effectively decided the title race. Not quite in the way we might have imagined when Arsenal ran out easy 3-0 winners in September 2016, of course; Chelsea’s humiliation inspired Antonio Conte to give his defence a good old shoogle, and the rest is history. But it did decide the title race. Kind of. There’ll be no similar legacy this time round. Chelsea’s title defence has been decent by any normal measure; problem is, Manchester City are setting some very abnormal standards right now. And in most years, Arsenal would still be on the fringes of the title race too. But all that’s realistically left on offer are positions two through four, and a place in next season’s Champions League. Hey, there are worse fates. Chelsea are in pretty good nick. They’ve just seen off Brighton and Stoke, scoring seven goals in their two festive fixtures without reply, and are third in the table. They can grab second spot tonight with a win, though they’d still trail City by 14 points. How they must rue those unexpected defeats against Burnley, Crystal Palace and West Ham United. Arsenal are in similarly decent shape: just the one defeat in the league since early November, and that after giving David de Gea quite the workout. So both teams will fancy their chances tonight. Arsenal because they’ve won 13 of their last 15 at home, Chelsea because they’ve won five times at the Emirates, a record no other visitor has bettered. There should be goals: Arsenal have scored in their last 24 Premier League outings here, for a start. There may be reds: there have been six sendings off in the last seven fixtures between these two clubs. And there must and shall be entertainment: this is still officially a festive game, after all. It’s third versus sixth. It’s a London derby. It’s on! Kick off: 7.45pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/09/man-like-mobeen-guz-khan-citizen-khan-on-the-buses","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T09:00:15Z","webTitle":"Man Like Mobeen's Guz Khan: 'Citizen Khan reminds me of On the Buses'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/09/man-like-mobeen-guz-khan-citizen-khan-on-the-buses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/09/man-like-mobeen-guz-khan-citizen-khan-on-the-buses","fields":{"headline":"Man Like Mobeen's Guz Khan: 'Citizen Khan reminds me of On the Buses'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the first episode of Man Like Mobeen, its three stars – Mobeen, Nate and Eight – are chatting in the street when suddenly they’re surrounded by tooled-up cops searching for a drug dealer. “That’s racial profiling,” says Mobeen, his hands aloft. As Nate runs off, the officer – wielding a pimped-up gun – asks why his friend scarpered. “If I had to guess,” says Mobeen coolly, “I’d say it’s because he’s black. I don’t know if you’ve heard of this thing called ‘history’, officer, but these kind of situations rarely work out well for the black man.” In spite of sharing the grimy social realism of People Just Do Nothing, the Brummie swagger of Peaky Blinders and the machine-gun sarcasm of Peep Show, Man Like Mobeen teems with TV firsts. Not only is it rare to see a bearded Muslim male as a protagonist on screen in general, but one plaiting his little sister’s hair is unheard of. It’s also unique in its ability to turn racial profiling into light moments of humour. The show is set in Small Heath in Birmingham, a city that needs an accurate corrective, having been scrutinised by channels such as Fox News and depicted as a hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism. “For anyone in Britain, but especially the West Mids, that media image is ludicrous,” says Guz Khan, the show’s creator and leading, titular actor. “Life in Birmingham isn’t like that.” The BBC Three show is also an antidote to a series such as Citizen Khan, Adil Ray’s divisive sitcom about a Muslim community leader. “I wasn’t a fan at all,” Khan says of the show. “It reminds me of On the Buses.” The sexist and racist 1970s British sitcom he refers to was full of badly drawn characters and plots. Yet, in spite of its problematic scripts, for Khan’s parents it was a sign of recognition. “When my mum and dad first came over to this country, they were just happy to see somebody of colour on TV. It didn’t matter who they were or how one-dimensional they were,” says Khan. “[They were] like, ‘I’m really happy. The National Front is running around outside, but there’s someone who looks like me on TV.’” In the present day, however, comedy should have moved on. “I just think 30 or 40 years on when you have characters playing those same stereotypes, something’s wrong. Like, ‘Look how stupid we all are, laugh at us rather than laugh with us’ is regressive.” Two years ago Khan was a secondary school humanities teacher in his native Coventry when he started making YouTube videos as Mobeen. One video rubbished Fox News’s aforementioned take on Birmingham. Another video went viral when Khan called for Jurassic World to be boycotted because a shortened version of the pachycephalosaurus dinosaur (“pachy”) sounded like a racial slur. Throughout these videos Mobeen emerged as a flawed, opinionated, big-bearded Brummie care worker; a (potentially) former dealer who eats his meals with his mates while sitting on a sofa in the front garden and a surrogate parent to his little sister Aqsa. Steve Coogan’s Baby Cow production company soon picked up on these videos and invited him to make a BBC comedy short. Khan then got a radio gig on BBC Asian Network and appeared on Comedy Central’s Drunk History and Channel 5’s mockumentary Borderline. He has also branched into standup. “In retrospect, I realise I prepared for it with four years’ teaching,” he says. “Those kids were the most difficult audience to perform to, and it put me in good stead for grabbing a microphone.” Another thing helped: when he was five, his big sister introduced him to Eddie Murphy’s Raw. “I used to be mesmerised by how this dude in leather clothing used these accents and could have a whole room busting up.” While Khan obviously hopes the four episodes of Man Like Mobeen, co-written with Ant and Dec’s jungle monologue writer Andy Milligan, prove successful, his main critics are a little closer to home. On New Year’s Eve, his performance on Live at the Apollo was screened on BBC Two – a gig he took his wife and sister to back in September. “Afterwards everyone was like, ‘That was sick’, except them,” he says. “They said, ‘Yeah, it was alright, innit.’ Then I had to drive them home for two and a half hours while they discussed other comedians’ jokes on the night.” His mother, too, rains on her son’s parade. “If you told my old dear now, ‘Your son’s an actor,’ she’d be like, ‘Don’t mug us off, mate. He’s not an actor.’ I told her the other day what I was doing, and she’s like, ‘You think you’re famous? You’re a muppet. Get a job.

The ex-journalist and free schools advocate was appointed to the board of the Office for Students (OfS) by the education secretary, Justine Greening, earlier this week and immediately faced claims he was under-qualified. Since then further questions have been raised about his suitability after a string of lewd comments he has made in the past about women, working class people and eugenics were brought to light. Young, who appeared on the US TV series Top Chef with Padma Lakshmi, referred repeatedly to the size of her breasts on Twitter. He made similar comments about other women, including the television presenter Claudia Winkleman and a Labour MP. After sustained criticism over the comments, tens of thousands of tweets disappeared from Young’s account on Wednesday. Young had told the Guardian on Tuesday he had tweeted more than 56,000 times; by Wednesday afternoon, fewer than 8,500 remained. A job specification drawn up by the government said ministers expected board members to display “high standards of ... personal conduct”, and required “openness” and “transparency”. Responding to questions about Young’s past comments on Wednesday, a DfE spokeswoman said he had already “expressed his regrets”. “Public appointments, including to the OfS, are made in line with the code of governance for public appointments,” she said. Young refused to answer questions when contacted by the Guardian on Wednesday but has previously acknowledged posting “sophomoric” and “politically incorrect” tweets. In a post on Facebook on Wednesday, he said: “I think it would be a shame if people who have said controversial things in the past, or who hold heterodox opinions, are prohibited from serving on public bodies.” According to the job specification, when making appointments to the board, Greening is legally obliged to consider the importance of whether or not the applicants had previously worked in higher education. The DfE had claimed that Young held teaching posts at Harvard and Cambridge universities, but he has acknowledged that he has never had a job in academia. He carried out undergraduate supervision during his time as a student, as is usual for postgraduates. On Wednesday, the DfE said that in considering people for the board it was “interested in hearing from applicants who have knowledge of or experience in one or more areas, including promoting the experience of students, understanding of the needs of consumers, and market regulation and competition across all sectors, not limited to higher education. “This is reflected in the diverse experience of the board, which includes the managing director of a leading employer, the chief executive of a global law firm and a current university student.” Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, told the Guardian she planned to question both the prime minister and the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, about the appointment. She said Labour would write a series of letters to senior figures and hoped to find a way to secure a parliamentary debate on the issue, forcing ministers to defend Young’s previous comments. Jess Phillips, the MP who chairs the women’s parliamentary Labour party, said: “How would Theresa May feel and look when inevitably every ill thought out word about poor people, women, lesbians and people without education is read out to her in parliament? It is not a good look.” The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said there had been a “ridiculous outcry” over the appointment and he believed Young would “bring independence, rigour and caustic wit” to the OfS. “Ideal man for job,” Johnson tweeted. In response to Johnson, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, tweeted: “Quite right too - how many of Toby Young’s critics have worked night and day to provide great state schools for children of every background?” The Conservative MP, Margot James, said Young was “worthy of his appointment”, but that it was a “mistake for him to belittle sexist comments by labelling them ‘politically incorrect’, a term frequently used to dismiss unacceptable comments about, and behaviour towards, women and minorities”. According to the DfE, appointments to the board were expected to be made for an initial period of up to five years, with an option for this to be extended by ministers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/jan/10/the-last-ballad-wiley-cash-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T14:59:16Z","webTitle":"The Last Ballad by Wiley Cash review – murder in the shadow of the mills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/10/the-last-ballad-wiley-cash-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jan/10/the-last-ballad-wiley-cash-review","fields":{"headline":"The Last Ballad by Wiley Cash review – murder in the shadow of the mills","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the late summer of 1929, Ella May Wiggins, a labour organiser, single mother and songwriter of note, was shot dead while preparing to lead a union meeting near the cotton mill town of Gastonia, North Carolina. While Wiggins’ short life and tragic death – she was killed a few days before what would have been her 29th birthday – have been written about before, in his fine new novel Wiley Cash breathes fresh life into the subject while also offering insight into a particularly fraught moment in US history. The Last Ballad is simultaneously the evocation of an exemplary individual and the portrait of an era. Cash is crisply effective in his description of Ella May’s harsh daily experience in a cotton mill where poverty wages are exchanged for relentless labour that routinely steals fingers and wrecks lives. “Machines rattled and whirred in a deafening hum around the clock, stopping only for maintenance or repairs, when some small-handed woman or child would be brought in to stand on a box or a ladder and close his or her eyes before reaching deep into the gears in order to investigate what had gone wrong.” We follow Ella May from quiet humiliation in the office of the mill owner, who threatens to fire her for missing a shift to care for her sick daughter, to the grave of a young son lost to whooping cough, to her decision to join the union that she will eventually lead but first inspire by performing songs such as “The Mill Mother’s Lament”: “We leave our homes in the morning, / We kiss our children goodbye. / While we slave for the bosses, / Our children scream and cry …” If the actual Ella May Wiggins may today be more widely remembered as the creator of poignant ballads – her work was later covered by Pete Seeger – Cash accords necessary weight to her commitment to civil rights and social justice. Indeed, her fierce devotion to the workers she lives and works alongside is a central pillar of the story. Ella May’s friend, Violet, joins her and an African-American organiser, Hampton Haywood, in going door-to-door in local black communities to convince sceptical residents that they should join a labour movement whose adherents are every bit as racist as the society at large. Cash calls on a diverse cast of characters to illuminate the broader social aspect of the story, and the chapters devoted to Hampton are among the most illuminating. Born in the south and now based in the north, where he works on the railroad as one of the celebrated African-American Pullman porters, Hampton has been radicalised first by the socialists and now the communists. His return to the south at enormous personal risk to help in the effort to bring black people who were suffering into the labour movement is vividly described. “He should have remembered that this wasn’t Harlem, where a girl like Sophia could speak to you on the street, invite you to meetings, address you by your first name, call you brother. This was the south, after all, where buckshot blew through doors and lives were abandoned in the night and lost for ever.” Hampton’s brief but indelible odyssey is a worthy counterpart to Ella May’s, and Cash might have powerfully built his novel from an interplay of their two voices, but the other characters have their part to play. And it’s here where, at moments, and despite the larger rewards of the approach, Cash’s sure hand slips a little. For if the procession of characters whose lives intersect with Ella May’s – including a drunken, racist deputy and a war-damaged mill owner, his wife and their daughter – advances the story and lets us see different aspects of the labour movement’s struggle, a few too many coincidences are slipped into the mix. Claire, the mill-owner’s daughter, doesn’t just chance to ride on a train where Hampton is working, they sit down together and have a meaningful chat – and this is immediately after she has run into Ella May, who is protesting in Washington, DC. The important friendship Claire’s mother, Kate, subsequently strikes up with Ella May is nicely handled, and the last-minute, late-night aid Claire’s sad, staid father provides to Hampton is plausible, but a plot-serving confession that leads a tertiary character to the site of Ella May’s death is much less so. This sort of thing is a pity, because Cash’s tapestry of lives that intersect and inform each other is in the main elegantly and movingly woven. A novel built on and around murder, racism and violence could have made for an unrelentingly sombre read, and there is no doubt that The Last Ballad is intense, but Cash is careful to infuse it with the sense of hope inherent in a movement that eventually brought change not just to North Carolina but to an entire nation. “The Mill Mother’s Lament” ends with the lines: “But understand, dear workers, / Our union they do fear. / Let’s stand together, workers, / And have a union here.” The sky is blue on the day Ella May is shot, and she dies with her eyes open. • Laird Hunt’s The Evening Road is published by Chatto &amp; Windus.

Streets in Mumbai were deserted on Wednesday as hundreds of Dalit protesters blocked roads and train lines and attacked buses, forcing transport delays and the closure of schools and shops in the financial hub. Roadblocks, arson and the death of a teenager were reported in towns elsewhere in the state where Dalits, formerly called untouchables, were protesting against the alleged disruption of a memorial event by Hindu nationalist groups. An estimated 300,000 Dalits had gathered in the Maharashtra village of Bhima Koregaon on Monday to celebrate the 1818 victory of the British East India Company over the Peshwas, a faction of the Maratha empire that ruled much of the subcontinent before the British. Hundreds of Dalits were involved in the battle on the side of the British, forming part of battalion of 900 soldiers that repelled Peshwa forces numbering 20,000 by some estimates. The Dalits, who occupy the lowest place in the Hindu caste system and have suffered thousands of years of exclusion and extreme poverty, sided with the British in response to mistreatment by high-caste Peshwa rulers. Today the battle is regarded as a historical moment of self-assertion by members of the community. The 200th anniversary memorial on Monday turned violent when Dalit activists allege members of two Hindu nationalist groups attacked processions near an obelisk installed by the British to commemorate the battle. One man died and dozens of cars were burned in clashes between the two groups. At least 100 Dalits were reportedly arrested in the protests that followed on Tuesday, which quickly spread to Mumbai and drew national media attention. On Wednesday, outside Chembur railway station, a centre for the protests, one activist said police had been trying to shut down demonstrations in a “brutal” fashion. “They attacked us with lathis [clubs],” the young man identifying himself as Sumit said. “I have a mark here on my back from last night.” There were reports of journalists being attacked and vocal anger towards the media, whom one protester accused of ignoring violence against Dalits and being “sold to politicians”. “Our women and small children were attacked in Bhima Koregaon and in Mumbai,” said the demonstrator, Rajesh. “Why don’t they talk about that?” Fleets of protesters on motorbikes were also seen roaming the empty streets of Mumbai shouting “Jai Bhim”, a Dalit protest slogan. Order began to return to the city by early evening on Wednesday after a key Dalit leader, Prakash Ambedkar, called for an end to the protests. The Maharashtra chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has asked for a judicial inquiry into Monday’s violence. Caste was officially abolished by the Indian constitution in 1950 but remains deeply embedded in social customs and still shapes the lives of most Hindus.

Wrestling with the oddly contemporary contradictions of frontier mythology, it’s a tough but tender tale of blood and dust, populated by characters who express themselves most eloquently through gestures rather than words, accompanied by a superb Max Richter score that wrings mournful song from troubled landscapes. In New Mexico, 1892, the remote homestead of Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike) is besieged by Comanche raiders who burn her house and massacre her husband and children. Meanwhile, Captain Joseph J Blocker (Christian Bale) captures and torments an Apache family, rounding them up like cattle for imprisonment at the isolated Fort Berringer. “We are all prisoners,” says Blocker, who has “a war bag of reasons” for hating “savages”, and a brutal reputation for claiming “more scalps than Sitting Bull himself”. But these territorial wars are ending, and the close-to-retirement captain is ordered to escort his dying nemesis, Cheyenne chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi), home to the Valley of the Bears in Montana. En route they pick up the traumatised Rosalee, who is terrified by the sight of Yellow Hawk’s chained family, but whose sympathies shift as the mismatched group encounters Comanche raiders and vicious fur-trappers. Adapted from a manuscript by the late Donald E Stewart, best known for his screenwriting work on Costa-Gavras’s Missing, Hostiles lives up to its deliberately ambiguous title. As the opening DH Lawrence quote makes clear, “the essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer”, a thesis borne out by the litany of killings that follows, leaving friend and foe alike hanged, beaten, butchered and buried. Meanwhile, Blocker and his world-weary comrade, Master Sergeant Thomas Metz (Rory Cochrane), long for the lost simplicity of bygone battles, when spilled guts and righteous retribution were the stuff of the “good days”. Writer/director Cooper, who previously worked with Bale on the rustbelt elegy Out of the Furnace, cites parallels between “the maltreatment we afforded Native Americans” in the mythologised past and “what’s happening in America today with race and culture”. Yet the bleak thrust of Hostiles more specifically recalls the existential guilt of Unforgiven, in which Clint Eastwood’s William Munny famously opines: “It’s a hell of a thing, killing a man.” Those words hang like dark clouds over this revisionist American odyssey, which also looks back toward such classic texts as John Ford’s The Searchers, Eastwood’s The Outlaw Josey Wales, even Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch. Within this economy of violence, there are atrocities on every side – an uncomfortable equivalence that seems designed to provoke thorny debate rather than offer palatable answers. An accomplished ensemble cast breathes life into the film’s moral quandaries, with Studi the standout as a cancer-ridden warrior on his final journey. With his leonine features and regal gait, Studi’s stoical Yellow Hawk offers an imposing counterpoint to Bale’s embittered Blocker, quietly drawing our attention away from the captain’s invasive angst towards a more profound sense of indigenous pathos and loss. In a lesser actor’s hands, Yellow Hawk could have become little more than a cipher to prick this white man’s conscience. Yet Studi makes him the centre of the drama, commanding the screen with captivating gravitas. Japanese cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi captures the harsh beauty of landscapes that shift from jagged rocks and perilous ravines to verdant valleys beneath glowing skies. When the rains come, you can feel the deluge seeping into your bones, clinging like wet mud. A sinewy sound design enhances the visuals, nowhere more so than during a raid played out under cover of canvas, leaving us to hear (rather than see) the unfolding carnage. Most impressive, however, is Richter’s brooding score, which seems to seep from the landscape itself as it moves inexorably from grief and torment toward a state of grace. Brilliantly, the German-born British composer employs Turkish musician Görkem Şen’s yaybahar – an extraordinary acoustic instrument that uses springs, strings and membranes – to create abstract soundscapes that Richter then orchestrates and manipulates with otherworldly precision. Cellos and violins lend voice to a recurrent silent-scream visual motif, while individual themes subtly suggest each character’s connection to (or alienation from) these desert lands. Meanwhile, Ryan Bingham, who co-wrote Crazy Heart’s Oscar-winning song The Weary Kind, contributes the broken-winged ballad How Shall a Sparrow Fly, its mandolin accompaniment echoing through the trees like a lonely ghost in search of home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2018/jan/03/send-us-a-tip-on-wellbeing-breaks-the-world-over-and-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T13:27:59Z","webTitle":"Send us a tip on wellbeing breaks the world over – and win a £200 hotel voucher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/03/send-us-a-tip-on-wellbeing-breaks-the-world-over-and-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/jan/03/send-us-a-tip-on-wellbeing-breaks-the-world-over-and-win-a-200-hotel-voucher","fields":{"headline":"Send us a tip on wellbeing breaks the world over – and win a £200 hotel voucher","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It may have been a yoga trip to India, a wild swimming holiday in Greece, a spa weekend in Norfolk or a bootcamp in Spain, we want to hear about it – particularly if it was really good value.

Preston, widely regarded as one of the finest journalists of his generation, joined the Guardian in 1963 and was editor between 1975 and 1995, overseeing some of the most dramatic moments in the newspaper’s history. Over two decades as editor he was at the forefront of newspaper innovation, transforming the Guardian into a genuine national force with an international reputation, and instigating a radical and much admired redesign that helped the newspaper fight back against the launch of the Independent and a brutal price war. Preston also came up with the concept, now commonplace but at the time revolutionary, of a secondary daily features supplement with the launch of G2. He continued to work for the Guardian and Observer as a columnist after standing down as editor. Preston’s final column on press and broadcasting was published on New Year’s Eve. Katharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian and Observer, said Preston was a “brilliant editor” of the newspaper as well as a “generous and supportive ex-editor”. She said: “His tenure was full of innovation, from launching the groundbreaking and much-imitated G2 to instigating the fabulous Hillman redesign to publishing on the web unusually early, in 1994. “Since I became editor-in-chief of the Guardian and the Observer in 2015, Peter has been a kind and unobtrusively supportive friend, providing advice and insights and the kind of ballast that could only come from someone who’d been there and done it. “His last email to me was to praise the Guardian’s membership figures and ended with the comment ‘hope you’re in good heart’. He will be missed by everyone at the Guardian.” Alan Rusbridger, who served as Preston’s deputy and succeeded him as editor in 1995, said the Guardian owed him an immense debt. “Peter embodied all the best virtues of the paper he edited with such distinction for so long,” Rusbridger said. “He combined great integrity, a stubborn toughness and a decent humanity with real strategic vision. The paper owes him an immense debt. “Peter preferred to be an outsider. He was not one to join clubs. He didn’t seek the company of politicians. He was gritty, dogged – and brave. He led from the front. “He was also a great innovator. Peter transformed the idea of features journalism in the Guardian. His dramatic remaking of the paper in 1988 was as bold a stroke of radical design as anyone had seen. He was always curious and impatient to know ‘what next?’ “Finally, he was a great internationalist. To the end he worked tirelessly for the protection of reporters and editors around the world and towards the education of journalists in Eastern Europe and Africa. He will be sorely missed.” John Mulholland, editor of the Observer, said Preston had been a “loyal friend” to the newspaper as well as its media columnist for more than 20 years. “He was a frequent visitor to our offices and invariably offered wise counsel, often laced with a mischievous sense of humour,” he said. “He was a delight to spend time with. We greatly valued his writing, his enormous warmth, and his unmatched journalistic judgement.” One of Preston’s first acts as editor of the Guardian was to help move the newspaper into modern London offices in Farringdon Road in 1976, which included moving its printing floor in less than 48 hours. This relocation provided a new base from which Preston and the Guardian were able to cover the increasingly polarised political climate of the late 1970s and early 1980s. A radical redesign of the Guardian in 1988 ensured the newspaper enjoyed a new period of success despite the launch of the Independent in 1986 and a price war among broadsheets instigated by the Times. The circulation of the Guardian hit record levels under Preston, at one stage clearing 500,000 copies a day. Michael White, former political editor of the Guardian and who worked with Preston, said: “At first glance Peter Preston was an improbable Fleet Street editor. He wasn’t charismatic and never raised his voice, he was taciturn and soft-spoken, often elliptical, both in conversation and his writing. He chewed the ends of biros. “But beneath the outward diffidence lay a powerful determination and nimble intelligence which he deployed constantly to refresh the Guardian through two tough decades, Quick and clever, with a warm, mischievous sense of humour, Peter loved print and never lost faith in the future of newspapers.” The success of the Guardian under Preston was underpinned by agenda-setting stories, some of which led to the Conservative government under John Major becoming engulfed by sleaze scandals. The Guardian sparked the cash-for-questions affair in 1994 when it alleged that then-MPs Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith had been paid to ask questions on behalf of Mohamed Al-Fayed. Hamilton launch a libel action against the Guardian but eventually dropped his cases in a major victory for the newspaper. One incident that occurred during his editorship that Preston expressed regrets over was the jailing of Sarah Tisdall, a Foreign Office clerk, in 1983. Tisdall was jailed for leaking details to the Guardian about the movement of cruise missiles. The newspaper initially won a legal battle against the government about revealing its source but when the decision was overturned the Guardian handed over the relevant documents. Preston was born in 1938 in Leicestershire. His father died from polio when Preston was a child and then he caught the disease too. He survived and went on to win a place at the University of Oxford, where he edited the Cherwell, the student newspaper. After graduating, Preston joined the Liverpool Daily Post as a trainee before being hired by the Manchester Guardian in 1963 at the age of 25. Preston started as the newspaper was undergoing its transformative move from Manchester to London, with editor Alastair Hetherington moving to the capital in 1964. Preston worked as a reporter, foreign correspondent, features editor and night editor. He became editor in 1975 at the age of just 37 after Hetherington announced he would stand down. Preston was chosen over his friend John Cole by a committee set up by the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian. Preston and Cole remained friends until Cole died in 2013. Alongside his successful career as a journalist, Preston wrote two novels, Bess and 51st State."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-care-network/social-life-blog/2018/jan/16/social-work-leaders-must-stop-hiding-and-give-our-profession-a-voice","type":"article","sectionId":"social-care-network","sectionName":"Social Care Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T09:12:12Z","webTitle":"Social work leaders must stop hiding and give our profession a voice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2018/jan/16/social-work-leaders-must-stop-hiding-and-give-our-profession-a-voice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2018/jan/16/social-work-leaders-must-stop-hiding-and-give-our-profession-a-voice","fields":{"headline":"Social work leaders must stop hiding and give our profession a voice","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Social work leaders must learn to engage with the public and the media if we are to raise public awareness of the issues facing the profession. Social workers are fully aware of the issues: funding shortages, a reliance on expensive locum staff and a workforce propped up by newly qualified social workers. But does the public know this? I am doubtful it does. Blogs and articles are published regularly by social workers, but it is unlikely they are read by many outside the social work bubble. So what do we do? I believe our leaders need to stand up and make their voices heard within the media and by those who matter – the people we support. There should be no reason why directors, senior managers and social workers do not seek interviews with local news programmes. Equally, where is the national voice of social work? I wonder how much time England’s chief social worker for children and families, Isabelle Trowler, spends engaging with people outside of social work or the government? I’ve struggled to find an interview she has given recently to a major news outlet. Does no one want to interview or listen to us? Or are we failing to maximise every opportunity for our voice to be heard? I believe it is the latter. We have much to learn from our colleagues in health. Time and again, they have successfully raised the national profile of the issues facing the NHS. The chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens, is regularly in the media, speaking about a number of matters, including how Brexit might affect the health service. The row over junior doctors’ pay in 2016 attracted considerable news coverage and encouraging public support. The British Medical Association was highly vocal and organised strike action, and the issue received regular scrutiny in parliament. More recently, discussions around the government’s plans to review NHS pay made headlines and a representative from the Royal College of Nursing was interviewed on BBC News at Six. Why is this not the same for social work? Why are the British Association of Social Workers and our chief social worker not advocating for us in a similar fashion? It is abundantly clear to the public that the health service is underfunded. Children’s services are also drastically underfunded, but the public does not know about our plight. And I do not believe the problem is that people are more concerned about the health service than they are about children. How many people outside the social care sector were aware of strike action by social workers at Kirklees council in West Yorkshire? Some of my colleagues knew nothing about it. The strike did not make the national news and received only local or trade coverage. Social work leaders are not visible to the public and there is a lack of national dialogue about funding for children’s services departments. I fear this approach is harmful to the profession. Our leaders must stop hiding and stand up and be heard.
