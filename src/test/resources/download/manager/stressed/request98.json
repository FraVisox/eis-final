Britain and other nations, such as the US, Canada and Japan, have ageing populations with life expectancies of 100, which could lead to the biggest pensions crisis in world history. “The anticipated increase in longevity and resulting ageing populations is the financial equivalent of climate change,” said Michael Drexler, WEF’s head of financial and infrastructure systems. In short, people in the UK would keep working until they’re 70, because the state would not be able to provide adequate pensions. So now, questions must be asked, not least, if people pay their taxes, why wouldn’t the state be able to provide pensions? What’s being prioritised instead? Moreover, what kind of work would older people be realistically doing and what would happen when they couldn’t work? Retirement in the classic sense seems to be changing; the solid job followed by the solid retirement is being phased out, sometimes in a positive way. There are people who might wish to retire from what they’re doing now, but only to start up another scheme. But it’s not all about groovy seniors opening seafood restaurants or writing crime novels. At the lower end of the financial scale, there are plenty of people who already have a daily struggle to make ends meet, can’t wait to see the back of work, but don’t see how they’d cope financially. For them, there’s little hope of sepia-tinted, “autumn of life” adventures. Let’s concentrate on those kinds of people – what are the ramifications of higher retirement ages for them? In Britain, relatively young people, even actual young people, are in work that neither fulfils them, nor pays them sufficiently, never mind allowing them to save, buy a property or start a pension. Instead, many UK workers are prey to a gig economy that exploits and rejects their labour as it sees fit. How would this situation change as people get older, except for the worse? While some companies make a point of hiring older people, appreciating their reliability and experience, this isn’t happening across the board. Even those who worked in decent jobs in their youth would presumably find these increasingly closed to them and have to accept inferior, less stable work. While modifying your expectations as you age is one thing, this savage fall off the employment cliff is quite another. Nor does longevity necessarily equal fitness, especially as we’re regularly informed that obesity and other lifestyle factors are taking a significant toll on the nation’s health. Indeed, while older people might be alive and breathing, would they be fit to work? If they have health problems, as a significant number of people do as they age, what would happen then? To answer that, you just have to look at what happens to people of all ages who are not fit to work right now – how, under the present state of Tory welfare, even the disabled have been rebranded as cunning skivers working the system. From here, it’s not such a short leap to see how a person’s 60s and 70s could go from the Golden Years to the Skiving Years. How older people could be rebranded as a new breed of Silver Slackers embezzling benefits by, say, sneakily suffering a stroke. If you were really paranoid, by 2050, you could see a certain type of government abandoning retirement ages/pensions altogether, transforming it all into one big, silver-themed benefits/dementia tax – a sort of Cocoon crossed with The Hunger Games-type deal. I can almost hear the dramatic voiceover: “Previous ageing generations only had sudoku to keep them mentally agile… ” While what the WEF said was instructive, perhaps the point should be made that it’s not that people particularly fear the retirement age being raised – they fear everything else falling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/may/27/wasps-v-exeter-chiefs-premiership-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T16:18:38Z","webTitle":"Wasps 20-23 Exeter – Chiefs crowned Premiership champions – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/may/27/wasps-v-exeter-chiefs-premiership-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/may/27/wasps-v-exeter-chiefs-premiership-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Wasps 20-23 Exeter – Chiefs crowned Premiership champions – as it happened","bodyText":"So, Exeter Chiefs are champions! There is confetti and champagne, a few selfies and plenty of ecstatic supporters. The Exeter players take it in turns to hold the trophy aloft, before coming together for pictures and other frolics which will surely last long into the night. Then comes a rousing Tomahawk Chop. Thank you very much for joining me for this classic. Have a good evening. Bye! The party is well underway for Exeter Chiefs, who are about to collect their Premiership winners’ medals. They are slowly gathering on a stage, erected on the Twickenham pitch, ready to lift the glistening trophy stood in front of them. It is anguish for Wasps, who can only look on thinking ‘what if’. Dai Young has his Wasps team in a huge huddle, doubtless praising their efforts as opposed to pinpointing what went wrong. That was helluva game for the neutral, and that is some ending to the season for Chiefs. For Wasps, it is “agony”, says Joe Launchbury. “We came up short right at the end,” he says. “It is going to hurt a lot but I am sure we can learn from it. We were within a minute of winning the game.” A mammoth effort from all involved, including yourselves. “It is unbelievable, I cannot even put it into words to be honest,” says Gareth Steenson, who looks absolutely absorbed in the occasion. “It is going to be an interesting three or four days down in Devon. What tension? “I have had the worst week of nerves, if you ask my wife, she has been looking at me like I have two heads,” Steenson says. Exeter’s Rob Baxter is in tears pitchside. Don Armand is full of every emotion too. “We believed in ourselves, we believed we could finish stronger but credit to Wasps because 90 seconds was the difference between winning and losing that game.” Exeter are overjoyed, Wasps are on the floor. Rob Baxter’s side have won this game in extra-time, with a last-gasp penalty. What an ending to this season! Exeter Chiefs are Premiership champions! 99 min Exeter are just looking to run the clock down. Whitten is tackled by Cipriani but Nowell collects. Seconds to go at Twickenham ... Cool as a cucumber. 97 min Mullan pulls down Thomas Francis in the Exeter scrum and he is penalised. Gareth Steenson steps up to convert from 27m out ... 97 min Penalty to Exeter Chiefs! 97 min Exeter Chiefs’ chief executive, Tony Rowe, does not know whether to laugh or cry. He smiles straight down the camera, as the referee resets things for another Exeter scrum. 96 min “I can’t see that has been grounded, it’s held up,” JP Doyle is told. Exeter look a little upset in the dugout but there are no big protests. So, we have another scrum 6m or so from the Wasps’ line. 96 min JP Doyle goes to the television match official, with Exeter confident they have themselves a try through McIntyre ... 95 min Exeter rattle through the 21st and 22nd phases, with Waldron pushing his team closer and closer. Johnson and Simpson make two big tackles but Waldron is still in there with the ball. 94 min Parling crashes into Johnson, who again rebuffs his advances. Campagnaro is bullied away from moving forwards by Launchbury. Exeter press again with Nowell going around the houses to move 7m away from the Wasps’ line. 92 min Yeandle throws in from the line-out, with Waldron collecting in the middle. The players seem to be, understandably, taking more and more time to get back on their feet after each ruck breaks down. Exeter look bright still, though, with Nowell and Woodburn dancing into pockets of space in the Wasps defence. 91 min Doyle gets the second period underway. Are we heading to a penalty shootout? A catalogue of errors to close the first 10 minutes of extra time, with the ball eventually bouncing off Daly before JP Doyle blows his whistle. 89 min A peach of a kick by Cipriani sees Wasps move downfield, within 6m of Chief’s line, with Launchbury and co coming up for Johnson’s line-out. Chiefs seize upon his low, flat delivery but Wasps just about get away with it. The ball eventually falls to Wade and Le Roux but they make a mess of it. 87 min Woodburn appears to still have plenty left in the tank, dodging away from a couple of Wasps challenges before being pulled to the floor. Campagnaro and Nowell link up nicely but Wasps get the line-out. You sense Christian Wade’s pace, if he can dig deep here, could yet prove pivotal. 85 min Wasps win a penalty, with Nathan Hughes hurting himself in the process. Chiefs were closing in the 5m line but Hughes’ turnover allows Wasps to end the Exeter siege and kick out of their 22. 84 min Exeter have a lineout in a fanciful area down the left flank. Parling gathers it, before Whitten picks it up. He runs into Cipriani before Waldron then has a go himself. Chiefs are enjoying plenty of the ball. 83 min Matt Mullan looks as though he could come back on here, with Marty Moore grounded with seemingly a shoulder injury. Both teams have a little more downtime as a result, with Moore sat up receiving treatment on the field. 82 min Myell knocks it on, Hughes played him in with something of a hospital pass. There simply is no margin for error here now. Chiefs have a scrum on the halfway. After Cipraini’s kick gets us started, Wasps have an early line-out inside the Chiefs half, with Ashley Johnson doing the honours. The two teams hold a quick and hopefully inspirational huddle. We will have two 10-minute halves. And if that does not separate them, then there will be a kicking competition. Sounds good, right? Well then, we will have another 20 minutes of action at Twickenham to separate these two. That was easy. We are heading towards extra-time ... 79 min Wasps concede a penalty, with Hughes penalised for dangling those hands into the ruck. It is a head in hands moment for Dai Young. Exeter were 90 seconds away from defeat last Saturday against Saracens ... 78 min Daly’s boot clears from the scrum. Exeter, relentless, drive forward again. A late, late penalty for Exeter would send this match into extra-time. 76 min Chiefs have been hammering at the door but Wasps have no intentions of letting them in. A crucial scrum for Wasps, after Campagnaro loses the ball within seconds of arriving. Phil Blake, the Wasps defensive coach, is ecstatic up in the stands. 75 min Slade gets caught by Johnson’s fresh pair of legs at halfway. Woodburn then breaks away, but Simpson, the Wasps scrum-half, gets in the way to block. Another change for the Chiefs, with Campagnaro replacing Devoto. Less than five minutes to go at Twickenham. 74 min Nowell gifts the ball away to Hughes at the crucial moment, with Gopperth clattering into the fly-half at the decisive moment. Exeter are not giving up here, with Steenson driving forward from deep but others are beginning to look a little leggy. 73 min Wasps come away with the ball, with Guy Thompson snaffling it away from Whitten. That was a heroic bit of defending. Simpson launches a clearing kick, which is gobbled up by Slade before Exeter pour forward once again. 72 min And after all that, we have another scrum 5m from the line. Can Wasps shove Exeter out again, as Haskell did superbly then. Plenty of nail-biting to come in the final stages here. 71 min The scrum finally comes, but Haskell prevents Waldron from nicking the ball from the scrum. The Chiefs pile forward once more through Parling ... 69 min A cauldron of noise is rolling around all three tiers of Twickenham, with so much riding on this scrum. JP Doyle orders another. 68 min A scrum it is ... 67 min Exeter are 5m from the line. After 34 phases, Exeter win a penalty. Do they take the simple three points or go to the scrum. There is a degree of inevitability here either way you would think. 66 min Exeter bear down on the Wasps 22, with Devoto stepping inside with Whitten providing a helping hand. Steenson then attempts to burst through on the blindside, with Woodburn accelerating to within 10m of the try-line. A spirited route one drive forward ends with another ruck. 65 min A couple more personnel changes: Guy Thompson and Ashley Johnson replace Thomas Young and Tommy Taylor. Steenson kicks it over and he closes the gap to three points at Twickenham. 62 min Parling loses the ball but Wasps seize on the ball illegally. Their director of rugby, Dai Young, has been chatting about his team’s progress. “We have got ourselves back in front but this game is far from over,” he says. “We seem to have slowed down in the last couple of phases but we need to make Exeter work.” 60 min A forward pass by Wasps gifts Exeter Chiefs a scrum at halfway. Meanwhile, Sam Simmonds comes on for Dave Dennis. Chudley is on for Dennis too. Plenty of changes and there could be more: Marty Moore looks in a bit of trouble, but he stays on – for now at least. 59 min This game is getting pretty tetchy now. You get the sense that the next score could make or break this one. Both teams look frightened to make the wrong move. 58 min Another knock on against Exeter, this time Whitten is the guilty party. The television camera pans to Eddie Jones, who will be back tomorrow at Twickenham for when England host Barbarians. 57 min Geoff Parling is caught in two minds and concedes a knock on. Wasps, meanwhile, make a triple-change of their own, with Joe Simpson replacing Robson for his 150th Premiership appearance. Simon McIntyre and Kearnan Myall enter in place of Mullan and Symons. 56 min Henry Slade catches but that it is about it, he is yet to really make any impact on this game. It’s one-way traffic at the moment, with Wasps 25 minutes away from another Premiership title. Woodburn crashes into an airborne Gopperth, and the New Zealander converts his kick. Wasps are beginning to grind through the gears a little, and Exeter have frozen since that Daly try at the start of this half. Meanwhile, Horstmann is replaced by Mitch Lees for Exeter. 51 min Cipriani gambles, going long to his right but it pays-off, with Wasps finding their rhythm going forward with a beautiful sweeping move. That all came at breakneck speed. Gopperth stays grounded: he looks fatigued by that run and dummy, after good work by Wade to bring Wasps close to the Exeter 22. 50 min Front-row movements for Exeter. Ben Moon, Cowan-Dickie and Williams replaced by Yeandle, Rimmer and Francis. All change, all change. 49 min Fine interplay between Cipriani, Robson, Wade and Daly. It is the sort of lightning attacking move Exeter will have had nightmares about. Ultimately it comes to nothing but Gopperth seizes back the ball on halfway. 48 min Exeter win a penalty but Henry Slade’s kick goes straight out, the wrong side of the flag. A penny for Saracens’ thoughts. Rob Baxter looks anxious up in the gods of Twickenham. 46 min On comes Henry Slade in place of Phil Dollman, who leaves the field gingerly. Meanwhile, Wasps are in the groove with Le Roux storming forward but Exeter put in the hard yards to get back at them but they could do with steadying themselves here. 45 min Not the start Exeter had in mind. Waldron thunders into the Wasps pack, while Dollman appears to be in trouble, limping around the field. Hughes creates this, making the hit before surging forward, bouncing off a trio of white shirts before Wade chips over the top, the bounce falls kindly for Daly and over the line. Wasps are more than just back in this now. Gopperth, just about, converts too, in off the right post. 42 min Horstmann drives into a ruck before Jack Nowell takes over ahead of Townsend. Waldron then has Launchbury and Young for company. Then the ball is moved from the left-to-right, it is all very nice, with Parling attempting to find a route through. Nathan Hughes, though, stops all of that. Exeter kick downfield, but Wasps come straight back at them through Josh Bassett. The second half of action is imminent. Wasps will no doubt want to start this second period as they finished the first. As for Exeter, they will essentially just want more of the same. An exhilarating first 40 or so minutes at Twickenham. An inside break allows Jimmy Gopperth to drive forward and under the posts after a neat spell by Wasps. He converts, too, to send Wasps down the tunnel with a bounce. Cipriani had led another move before eventually running into Ollie Devoto, who has been everywhere so far in this one. Wasps suddenly come alive before the interval. 38 min Wasps have a free-kick after Ian Whitten is pulled up for going over the top of the shoulder on Joe Launchbury. Another frenetic break by Wasps in this fast-paced affair. Taylor with the line-out but Wasps get it wrong, allowing Nowell and Townsend to turn it over. 36 min Steenson and Elliot Daly interchange kicks before the Wasps centre kicks straight out. The pain on the face of Dai Young, high up in the stands at Twickenham, says it all. Wasps have been extremely wasteful in possession at times. 35 min Wasps’ Phil Swainston fails the HIA, with Marty Moore hoping now to play the rest of this relentless match. 34 min Nowell goes chasing after the ball is punted forwards by Stu Townsend as Exeter look to break. Bassett has the legs to match him but Wasps, all of sudden, lose 60m. Steenson then pours forwards, as does Woodburn, before Wasps earn a penalty through Bassett. 33 min Wasps still have the ball, but they cannot find a way through past Exeter’s white wall ... 31 min Wasps are little unlucky, with Daly playing a neat kick out to Bassett but it bounces awkwardly and high. It’s a Wasps line-out after Exeter intercept on the verge of the try-line. Hughes, Haskell and Cipriani all look to try and find a response. 30 min Wasps have it all to do then. Exeter have been absolutely rampant at times. Once everybody vacates a ruck, Nathan Hughes bursts through again, a one-man band on a mission. He has had a brilliant half an hour in the centre, but Luke Cowan-Dickie – somehow – turns it over before Launchbury gets involved. Wasps earn a scrum. A second HIA of the afternoon, with Moore replacing Swainston for Wasps after a clash with Devoto. From the scrum, Exeter break through Steenson and then Devoto, who sidesteps towards the line. He cannot take it over but Dollman can, who runs off celebrating his first try of this campaign, before Steenson converts. No bother. 26 min Exeter’s scrum overwhelms Wasps, with Swainston and co at a loss to prevent another driving line-out. Ben Moon is a real colossus for the Chiefs, and might he just be one of the most under-rated cogs in Rob Baxter’s team? 25 min Guy Thompson welcomes Nathan Hughes back on. He looks all ready to go again. Hughes has made eight crashing tackles already in this clash. 24 min Wasps are readying Nathan Hughes again on the touchline it seems, assuming he has passed his head assessment. He certainly picked up a few bruises in those opening stages. Meanwhile, Daly tries to wriggle away from the Chiefs defence but he loses the ball in the process, as he is suffocated out by Jack Nowell. 22 min “Things like this are a little bit frustrating,” Rob Baxter says, as his Exeter side are penalised from the scrum. Wasps seek a way forward through Launchbury and then Haskell but Parling is there to hound him out. Whitten then dives into to steal the ball away himself. What can they do with the ball? 21 min Robson’s pass is intercepted by Harry Williams before Whitten’s movement forward forces Jimmy Gopperth into a knock-on. That looked like nerves to me. Exeter earn a free-kick, while Tommy Taylor is momentarily down with Ali James the Wasps physio. The New Zealander converts after Whitten strayed offside. Meanwhile, Nathan Hughes is off and Thompson comes on to replace him. If that is a permanent move then he’ll be a big loss. 16 min Wasps look to hit back, but Cipriani is blocked by Horstmann. Hughes again looks to drive his team on with a huge carry, with Willie Le Roux finding space on the left, Josh Bassett then takes over, with a hint of a forward pass, but he continues before Steenson stops him before the cavalry arrive to snuff out the threat. Exeter get a penalty after Wasps’ collapsed scrum. Exeter’s driving line-out, from Luke Cowan-Dickie looks to cause danger and Jack Nowell runs through a big hole on the inside to skip away from his outside number for the first try of the afternoon. Gareth Steenson kicks to ensure Exeter get their noses in front. 10 min Exeter get themselves into a great area, with Woodburn driving into space, fending Yarde but Wasps defensively do well, with Launchbury slowing up the next phase of possession. 9 min Possession stats so far read as Exeter 65% and Wasps only 35%. Exeter look to breakthrough via Horstmann but it is that man Nathan Hughes again who makes a huge hit in the middle of the field. Exeter, though, go again, with Woodburn flying forward. 8 min Wasps build from a solid scrum, sweeping from right-to-left with Daly, but Josh Bassett cannot quite get hold of the ball after flooding down the left channel. 7 min Woodburn looks to Steenson but Hughes turns it over, and suddenly it looks as though they may counter. Cipriani apologises after failing to drive forward with any real incision. Hughes is proving a real nuisance against Steenson – crashing into the fly-half. 5 min Wasps have been under the kosh to begin with but Exeter’s scrum is moving so Dai Young’s side win a free-kick themselves. The lineout sees Cowan-Dickie intercept before Woodburn takes it on. Exeter have made a bustling start at Twickenham. 4 min The first line-out comes from Luke Cowan-Dickie, with Waldron attempting to breakout but Wasps crowd him out. The first driving lineout results in another once in quick succession. Great work by Wasps, though, with Nathan Hughes rolling in to stop Townsend from digging the ball out. 2 min Elliot Daly slips past Steenson’s challenge, and Launchbury almost gets away but the offload results in a scrum. The Exeter scrum really is a thing to behold, but this time the referee penalises Phil Swainston. And JP Doyle blows the whistle to get the 2017 Premiership final underway at Twickenham, with Danny Cipriani kicking downfield from the off. The teams are out on the pitch, bypassing the Premiership trophy as they go. There are pitch-side pyrotechnics and a thumping soundtrack to boot. More than 82,000 fans inside Twickenham are ratcheting up the noise levels. We are just a minute’s silence away from kick-off now. We are just a few minutes away from kick-off. Twickenham is absolutely teeming, with supporters – some drenched in dodgy fancy dress – waving flags, beer cups and more. Who will be celebrating in around a hour and a half’s time? Another splendid occasion for Rob Baxter, the Exeter head coach, who 21 years ago was part of the Chiefs side crowned Division 4 champions. He says his team, unbeaten in 16 Premiership matches, must lean on the experience from their defeat by Saracens last year. “Getting to a final last year was great, and we have got to use that. We probably looked at Saracens a little bit too much last time. The battle is not necessarily trying to stop the opposition but being the best you can.” Danny Cipriani is geeing up the troops on the Twickenham turf. James Haskell too is playing the role of Mr Motivator. In a VT, Haskell says the 29-year-old “has always had the X-Factor about him”. There’s also talk of a trip to Las Vegas years ago, and Cipriani’s antics at a pool party. Back to the rugby now, promise. “It is going to be a good final, a good contest,” says Cipriani. Time for some pre-match chit chat. “We are a team that if we play well, we keep hold of the ball and do not give away too may turnovers,” Wasps’ Elliot Daly says. “We are going to keep to what we do, keep to our structures and if we lose then it will be to a better team on the day.” As for Exeter, Jack Nowell says: “This is where we want to play and we do want to stay in our shells like we did a bit last year. We pride ourselves on our work-rate.” Flanker Dom Armand adds, “we have been through it once already, it is still quite fresh in our mind from last year”, referencing Saracens’ 28-20 win at Twickenham last May. What a weekend it is – and could be – for the city of Exeter, with Paul Tisdale’s side in London tomorrow too, for their very own showpiece event. So, a few quick-fire stats and facts to get us started then. All four of Wasps’ past Premiership triumphs (2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008) have come after finishing second in the league. This season, they finished first. Exeter have not won at Twickenham in six previous visits. But victory for the Chiefs would equal Leicester’s Premiership record of 17 matches unbeaten. And the man in the middle this afternoon, JP Doyle, the 37-year-old Dubliner, trained to be a secondary school teacher down the road at St Mary’s University. Wasps: Le Roux; Wade, Daly, Gopperth, Bassett; Cipriani, Robson; Mullan, Taylor, Swainston, Launchbury (capt), Symons, Haskell, Young, Hughes Replacements: Johnson, McIntyre, Moore, Myall, Thompson, Simpson, Leiua, Halai Exeter Chiefs: Dollman; Nowell, Whitten, Devoto, Woodburn; Steenson (capt), Townsend; Moon, Cowan-Dickie, Williams, Dennis, Parling, Horstmann, Armand, Waldrom. Replacements: Yeandle, Rimmer, Francis, Lees, S Simmonds, Chudley, Slade, Campagnaro Referee: JP Doyle (Ireland) You have been warned. “Never leave early when it comes to our matches,” the Wasps scrum-half, Joe Simpson, said this week before what promises to be a tantalising Premiership final against Exeter Chiefs at Twickenham. A sell-out crowd of more than 82,000 will watch some of the world’s best players do battle. This is the rugby showpiece, the main event, the plat du jour, the pièce de résistance. Got it? This match-up will see two of the country’s most attack-minded, free-scoring teams come together, with both coming through their respective semi-finals with flying colours – just. Exeter left it stupidly late to bypass Saracens 18-16 at Sandy Park last weekend before Wasps were even more last-minute, with Josh Bassett doing the business in the final seconds against Leicester. Wasps have strength in depth – even without hamstrung Kurtley Beale – especially going forward, with Christian Wade, Danny Cipriani and Elliot Daly all more than capable of inflicting damage and winning points on their own. “The final is new territory for this group of players, but really exciting territory,” Wasps’ director of rugby, Dai Young, said. “But, as much as we are going to enjoy the day, we want more than that.” Exeter, too, have talent in abundance, with Henry Slade coming to the fore again of late. “We’re actually probably a stronger group going into the final than we were last week, which is always nice,” said Chiefs’ head coach, Rob Baxter. In terms of team news, Willie Le Roux switches to full-back for Wasps while Bassett will start on the wing. Exeter, meanwhile, make once change from their semi-final win, with Olly Woodburn replacing Chiefs’ top try-scorer, James Short, on the wing.

Tourism brings both money and a more positive international image for Iran, says Zamani, 36, a theology student, who is keen to ensure that visitors who might once have been alarmed by his clerical turban and robes feel welcome in his city. “I think the moment they set foot in Iran [foreigners] find it totally different from what they expect, and their minds are changed by the people when visitors talk to us,” he said, as he took a short break between explaining marriage and circumcision traditions to a group of Italians and discussing millenarian religious beliefs with a man from the Netherlands. Iran’s reformist president, Hassan Rouhani, staked his government and reputation on opening Iran to the world, sealing a nuclear deal that ended sanctions and courting foreign investment in its wake. Rouhani was re-elected for a second term in a landslide victory last weekend, a sweeping endorsement of his policy from the Iranian people. And for many Iranians the growing flood of foreigners armed with guidebooks and selfie sticks is one of the most visible signs of change and re-engagement. “Isfahan lives by tourists,” said Masood Mohamedian, a former lorry driver who this year gambled all his savings on opening a small cafe serving traditional snacks just off the main square. “I am 100% happy with Rouhani as president.” Tourism to Iran might seem like a hard sell. The initial problem is the country’s reputation, tied up inextricably for many in the west with dramatic television images of the US embassy hostage crisis from 1979-81, and the fatwa issued in 1989 against Salman Rushdie for his book The Satanic Verses. More recently, the crackdown that followed disputed 2009 elections, and arrests of figures such as Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, have done little to soften that image. And the country’s conservative religious and social rules, which visitors must observe along with citizens, might deter some westerners. There is little public nightlife, no alcohol, men and women cannot kiss or embrace in public, and women in particular must observe a relatively strict dress code, wearing a headscarf and covering their arms and legs. But tens of thousands of people have decided that Iran’s attractions far outweigh those constraints. And Iran has tried to encourage them by easing restrictions on travel. Europeans from countries including France, Italy and Germany, who account for the majority of western tourists, can now get visas on arrival in Tehran, and at the main sites they mingle with sightseers from China, Japan and elsewhere. “When the sanctions were lifted, I decided to come as soon as possible,” said Simonetta Marfoglia, an Italian tourist who was halfway through a two-week trip. “I had read a lot of Iranian poetry, and I am very interested in the history of the region. I am really very happy to be visiting: the people are wonderful, there is great hospitality, and it’s very friendly.” The country boasts an extraordinarily rich cultural heritage, from the ruins of ancient Persepolis to Isfahan and other historic cities, such as Kashan, Tabriz and Shiraz. Food-lovers can feast on dishes from a sophisticated cuisine that is winning increasing recognition in the west, with dishes such as fesenjan, a rich, tart and sweet chicken stew thick with walnuts and pomegranate molasses. There are also bazaars packed with carpets and handicrafts for shoppers, a thriving contemporary arts scene and spectacular natural beauty ranging from beaches to stark deserts and snow-capped mountains. . Together these factors have fuelled a dramatic rise in western tourists to Iran, although the majority of its two million visitors are still religious pilgrims visiting its major shrines. Isfahan, the jewel in Iran’s heritage crown and more a destination for tourists than pilgrims, counted just over 5,000 visitors a month in 2013, when Rouhani came to power. By spring 2017 that number had risen to 85,000 in a single month, the newspaper Isfahan Today reported. The surge in visitors has been so dramatic that some nights in high season every single hotel room in the city is taken, according to the receptionist at the newly built Zenderood Hotel. Foreign hotel chains are eyeing the market enthusiastically, particularly since some of the biggest American players are still in effect barred. US sanctions have stayed in place after the nuclear-linked bans were lifted, leaving the field clear for European and other groups. Dubai-based Rotana Hotels is the latest firm to unveil plans for a new hotel in Isfahan, following the likes of the French chain Accor. Spanish heritage hotel company Paradores is also looking at opportunities in the country, whose famous hotels include a former caravanserai that housed traders bringing lucrative goods to market in the 16th century. The biggest challenge to Iran’s goal of increasing tourist numbers tenfold within the decade may be the pace of change they represent, in a country where Rouhani’s conservative rival still managed to garner 16 million votes in the election. “I am unhappy about their cultural impact, because of their customs,” grumbled Mohammed Paknahad, a shopkeeper in Isfahan’s bazaar, who said tourists rarely bought his handicrafts. “Some of the women don’t cover their bodies properly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/may/27/brazil-wild-amazon-faces-destruction-farmers-loggers-sierra-ricardo-franco-park","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T23:05:41Z","webTitle":"Wild Amazon faces destruction as Brazil’s farmers and loggers target national park\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/27/brazil-wild-amazon-faces-destruction-farmers-loggers-sierra-ricardo-franco-park","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/may/27/brazil-wild-amazon-faces-destruction-farmers-loggers-sierra-ricardo-franco-park","fields":{"headline":"Wild Amazon faces destruction as Brazil’s farmers and loggers target national park\r\n","bodyText":"To understand why the Brazilian government is deliberately losing the battle against deforestation, you need only retrace the bootmarks of the Edwardian explorer Percy Fawcett along the Amazonian border with Bolivia. During a failed attempt to cross a spectacular tabletop plateau here in 1906, the adventurer nearly died on the first of his many trips to South America. Back then, the area was so far from human habitation, the foliage so dense and the terrain so steep that Fawcett and his party came close to starvation. He returned home with tales of a towering, inaccessible mesa teeming with wildlife and irrigated by secret waterfalls and crystalline rivers. By some accounts, this was one of the stories that inspired his friend Arthur Conan Doyle to write The Lost World about a fictional plateau jutting high above the jungle that served as a sanctuary for species long since extinct elsewhere. In their wildest fantasies, however, neither Fawcett nor Conan Doyle are likely to have imagined the modern reality of that plateau, which can no longer be certain of protection from geography, the law or Brazil’s international commitments. Today, orange dirt roads, cut into the forest by illegal loggers, lead you to the north-western flank of the elevated hilltop. Now called the Serra Ricardo Franco state park, this is nominally a conservation area set up with support from the World Bank. Instead of forest, however, you find swaths of land invaded by farmers, stripped of trees, and turned over to pasture for 240,000 cows. There are even private airfields inside the park’s boundaries, which exist on maps only. Far from being an isolated area where a wanderer might starve, this is now – despite its dubious legal status – one of the world’s great centres of food production. In recent months, it has also emerged as a symbol of the resurgent influence of a landowning class in Brazil who, even more than in the US under Donald Trump, are cashing in on the destruction of the wild. Locals say a member of President Michel Temer’s cabinet – chief of staff Eliseu Padilha – owns ranches here on hillsides stripped of forest in a supposedly protected park. The municipal ombudsmen told the Observer the cattle raised here are then sold – in contravention of pledges to prosecutors and international consumers – to JBS, the world’s biggest meat-packing company, which is at the centre of a huge bribery scandal. These allegations are denied by farmers but there is no doubt the government is easing controls as it opens up more land for ranches, dams, roads and soy fields to meet the growing appetite of China. Last year, Brazil reported an alarming 29% increase of deforestation, raising doubts that the country will be able to meet its global commitments to reduce carbon emissions. Rather than an aberration, this appears to mark a return to historical norms for a country that has been built on 500 years of land seizures that were later legalised by the politicians who benefited from them. The concurrent erosion of legal authority and natural habitat can be seen in many Brazilian states: the newest soy frontiers of Maranhão, Tocantins and Bahia; the hydropower heartland of Pará and the wild west mining and logging regions of Rondônia and Acre. But it is in Mato Grosso that the political forces behind deforestation – associated with corruption, violence, weak regulation and deliberate obfuscation of land ownership – reveal themselves most clearly. The 158,000-hectare Serra Ricardo Franco state park sits at the intersection of three great biomes; the Amazon rainforest, the Cerrado tropical savanna and the Pantanal wetlands. Its western neighbour, separated only by the narrow Rio Verde, is Bolivia’s dense Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, which covers an area five times larger. Together, they make up one of the world’s biggest and most biodiverse ecological reserves. To the east are the light green plains of Mato Grosso – a state bigger than the combined area of the UK and France – which was named after the once thick bushland that has now mostly been cleared for soy fields and cattle ranches. The plan to establish a park in this geologically and biologically important landscape was agreed amid the giddy optimism of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, which was hailed as a breakthrough for international cooperation on the environment. Ricardo Franco was one of nine conservation areas promised by the Mato Grosso government in return for a $205m loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The primary source of funds was the World Bank, which noted at the time that the money was to be used for vehicles, staff training and salaries, office construction and research. The envisaged Ricardo Franco park was supposed to cover 400,000 hectares. The reality was very different. After several years of studies, the park that was eventually established in 1997 was less than half the expected size. At least 20,000 hectares of it had already been cleared by farmers who were supposed to be compensated and removed. This never happened. Nor could the Observer find evidence of fences ever being erected, or administrative centres built either in the park nor the nearest town of Vila Bela da Santíssima Trindade. The only signs and boundary markers are for fazendas (plantations). Although the park is supposed to be publicly owned and used only for ecotourism or scientific research, many areas could only be accessed after paying an entrance fee or requesting a key from the owner of the farm occupying the property. A quarter of the land has been cleared over the past four decades, but there are still areas of immense natural beauty and biodiversity that have changed little since Fawcett’s time. Over two half-days, the Observer spotted an armadillo, spider monkeys, capuchins, otters, fish leaping a waterfall, clouds of butterflies, and a hand-sized spider that was slowly succumbing to the sting of a giant vespa wasp. Local guides report sightings of panthers, pumas, anaconda, pink dolphins and six-metre long alligators. Trails now lead up to the previously undisturbed heights, but they are rarely used. The 5km hiking route to the 248-metre high Jatoba waterfall was deserted, as were the sapphire waters of the Agua Azul canyon. It was not, however, well maintained. Rubbish and used toilet paper littered one area. Another clearing was scarred with the charred remains of a barbecue (likely to be prohibited as a fire hazard in a well-run conservation area). On the banks of the Rio Verde, fishing lines were tangled on the rocks despite signs declaring “Strictly no fishing or hunting”. But it is undoubtedly the 20,000 to 39,000 hectares of farmland (the size is disputed) that has had the biggest environmental impact. “What is happening in the park is very sad,” said a local biologist, who asked for her name to be withheld because she fears repercussions. “This area is very important. There are species here not found anywhere else. But it’s degrading year by year.” Ranchers inside the park disagree. Ademir Talini, the manager of the Fazenda de Serra, boasts of boosting production of soy and beef on what he claims is the third most fertile land in the world. “Our municipality has the biggest abattoir in Brazil, the best beef comes from here and farms here contribute greatly to GDP,” he says. He then points toward the nearby border with Bolivia. “Over there is the biggest conservation area in the world. So what difference does 39,000 hectares make?” He points out that many of the farms preceded the creation of the park – a refrain echoed by other ranchers. “The state government created a virtual park to get money,” said Donizete dos Reis Lima, who owns the farm next to the border. “Nobody here is against the park. I want a future for my children. But let’s have a decent park. If we go, who is going to pay us compensation.” The issue is not black and white. The burly farmer says he is the legal owner of the land, having arrived in the area long before it was a park. But he also recounts how he opened up the roads to the region as part of his work as a logger. The area he cleared was later “regularised” by the land agency (Incra). Then, as now, this process often involved corruption and collusion with the authorities. Elísio Ferreira de Souza, a retired municipal employee, recalls the illegal origins of land clearances in the 1970s. “It was done with the connivance of local politicians and only later legalised,” he says. Regiane Soares de Aguiar, the public prosecutor who has filed multiple lawsuits against the farmers, agrees. “All of the land was cleared illegally,” she says. “Even the landowners that were there before the creation of the park would not have had permission to deforest the land.” Satellite data shows the problem has since worsened, she said, as more farmers moved inside the park, bringing more cattle that needed more pasture. This illegal activity has done spectacular damage to forest and water sources. According to the prosecutor, JBS should share the blame because the meat company has bought livestock from inside the park despite a pledge – to public prosecutors, foreign buyers and environmental NGOs – not to source cattle from illegally cleared land. To get around this, it briefly launders the animals at untainted farms outside the park before taking them to the slaughter. In a statement to the Observer, JBS said it had blocked sales from farms inside the park after being requested to do so by the prosecutors’ office. The company said it used data from satellites, the environment agency, ministry of labour and other sources to monitor its 70,000 cattle suppliers. The results, it said, were independently audited. “Since 2013, more than 99.9% of direct suppliers located purchases of cattle in the Amazon region comply with the Public Commitment of Livestock and agreements signed with federal prosecutors,” it noted. But cattle laundering is rife. Regulation is a challenge at the best of times. Even when the authorities impose a penalty for forest clearances or other violations, very few fines are ever paid. “I penalise them, but they challenge me in the courts and justice is so slow,” says Laerte Marques, from the State Secretariat for the Environment (Sema). “It has been very difficult. There is pressure from all sides. On one side there is the public prosecutor, on the other are the farmers.” The landowners have launched a campaign for the park to be abolished. Prosecutors, however, have urged the conservation area be administered on a more formal footing. Last month, they appeared to have won a victory when the Mato Grosso government announced a two-year study to determine the status of the park and what should become of its farms. But there are fears this will simply shrink the boundaries and allow the farms to be excluded. “Powerful landowners are trying to use this opportunity to reduce the limits of the park,” said Aguiar. “That would only benefit those who cleared forest. But there is a lot of economic power behind them,” she warned. Near the entrance of the Paredon 1 Fazenda is an overgrown airstrip and a dirt road that cuts through the state park to fields of cattle grazing among tree stumps on an otherwise bare hillside overlooking the Bolivian forest. This is one of several farms in the park owned directly or indirectly by Eliseu Padilha, the chief of staff. Locals in Vila Bela say he is an intimidating presence. He is not the only one. Several of Brazil’s richest businessmen as well as local politicians own land inside the park. The forces lined up against conservation have deep roots. The post-colonial history of Brazil is, to a large extent, the history of deforestation. Following the arrival of European ships, settlers carved out roads into the jungle in search of gold. Since then, massive fortunes have been made by the clearance of forest, initially for coffee and rubber plantations and more recently for cattle and soy. Landowners happily backed the 1964-85 military dictatorship, which ensured that campaigners for indigenous rights and agrarian reform did not get in the way of farm and ranch expansions. The return of democracy initially made little difference. The first president under the new constitution was José Sarney, an old-school coronel who ruled the northern state of Maranhão as if it were his personal fiefdom. Deforestation surged to new peaks at the turn of the 21st century. The first time the problem came close to being brought under control was during the initial Workers party administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-06). His environment minister at the time, Marina Silva, put in place tougher penalties and a monitoring system that used satellites in the sky and rangers on the ground to identify farmers who burned or cut down forests. This resulted in an impressive slowdown that lasted nearly a decade, winning kudos from the international community and putting Brazil in an influential position in global climate talks. But the effectiveness of this system weakened under Lula’s Workers party successor as president Dilma Rousseff, who was much closer to the ruralista lobby than her predecessor. She had little choice. Increased demand for soy and beef, particularly from China, had made agriculture the main driver for economic growth and a political force to be reckoned with. With 200 seats, the bancada ruralista had become the most powerful caucus in Congress. To placate them, Rousseff approved a relaxation of the “Forest Code”, which was the main legal tool against tree felling. It was a disaster for the Amazon. Before that change in 2012, deforestation rates had been creeping down. After it, rates increased by 75%, according to Paulo Barreto, a senior researcher at Imazon, an independent monitoring organisation. He said this put at risk the commitments Brazil had made in international climate talks to reduce annual clearance to 3,800 square kilometres per year by 2020. “At one point, we were on the right path. But last year, 8,000 square kilometres were cleared, double the goal for 2020,” he points out. Two-thirds of Brazil’s carbon emissions come from this source. Meanwhile, beef and soy barons have strengthened their grip on power. After last year’s impeachment of Rousseff, her replacement, Michel Temer, appointed several ruralistas to his cabinet and moved to dismantle and dilute the institutions and laws that slowed forest clearance. His pick as agriculture minister is Blairo Maggi, the owner of the country’s biggest soy producer, Amaggi Group, and a former governor of Mato Grosso, who supported moves to abolish the Ricardo Franco park. The justice minister, Osmar Serraglio, is at the forefront of the beef lobby, which was his main campaign donor, and a fierce opponent of indigenous land demarcation (the most effective method of forest protection). Under his watch, the National Indian Foundation (Funai) has seen its finances and personnel gutted. The foundation’s president, António Costa, was sacked earlier this year. In a parting speech, he described Serraglio as a dictator. “He is the minister of one cause: agro-business,” he warned. The counterbalance ought to be the environment ministry, which is headed by José Sarney Filho, the son of the top landowner in Maranhão state. Although his ideals are widely praised by conservationists, his ability to act has been neutered. Last year, the environment budget was cut by 51% (compared to a 31% reduction of the Environmental Protection Agency in the US under Trump). In March, the minister’s weak position was apparent when he issued a grovelling public apology to JBS after inspectors embargoed two meat-processing factories that were alleged to have bought tens of thousands of cattle from illegally deforested areas of the Amazon. Rather than assess the rights and wrongs of the case, the minister said the action was badly timed because it could hurt a major exporter that was already bogged down in scandal. Almost every week, there is a new roll back of forest protections. Last Tuesday, the Senate approved a bill that slashed protected areas in the Amazon by 597,000 hectares (about four times the area of Greater London). The previous week, the lower house of Congress paved the way for the legalisation of land that had been illegally occupied by grileiro – a move that is likely to encourage more seizures and forest clearance. Environmental licensing requirements for agriculture have been emasculated. Temer’s unhealthily close ties to the agriculture lobby may yet, however, come to be his undoing. Earlier this month, the attorney-general formally accused the president and his aides of accepting bribes and colluding with top executives from JBS to buy the silence of witnesses in a corruption scandal. Temer has denied all wrongdoing. The evidence was provided in a plea-bargain by the owners of the beef company, which is reportedly looking for a clean bill of legal health so that it can relocate its headquarters to the US. If so, its links to Padilha and the cattle raised inside Ricardo Franco and numerous other conservation areas also deserves more scrutiny, as does the process for deciding whether farms will be excluded from the soon-to-be regularised park. Foreign adventurers and Brazilian bandeirantes helped to pave the way for this development, even if their intention was to escape fazendas and cities alike. As Fawcett said: “Deep down inside me a tiny voice was calling. At first scarcely audible, it persisted until I could no longer ignore it. It was the voice of the wild places, and I knew that it was now part of me forever.” With each day that passes, that voice is becoming harder to hear. World Cup mascot is now at risk as forests disappear The tatu-bola armadillo, the mascot for the 2014 World Cup, is now a symbol for a very different phenomenon in Brazil: the growing impact of deforestation on biodiversity. The small armoured mammal was chosen to represent the tournament because it rolls up into the shape of a football when threatened, but its ability to protect itself has been undermined by a loss of habitat that is also devastating thousands of other species. Late last year, the International Union for Conservation of Nature raised the alarm by reclassifying the creature – also known as the three-banded armadillo – from “vulnerable” to “at risk of extinction”. This has prompted the group that led the campaign for its selection as a mascot to launch a crowdfunding drive last month to raise $500,000 to save the animal. Samuel Portela, co-ordinator of protected areas at the Caatinga Association, estimates the tatu-bola population has declined by 30% in the past decade due to deforestation and hunting.“It is fundamental that steps be taken towards the conservation of this species and its habitat, because under the present conditions, the tatu-bola could be extinct in 50 years,” he said. The animal is mainly found in the northeastern Brazil in the caatinga (an indigenous term for white – or desert – forest) and cerrado tropical savannas. Even more than the Amazon, these two ecosystems have been diminished by the expansion of farmland. Scientists warn that many other animals face similar or worse threats and the risks are rising along with the pace of land clearance in Brazil, the world’s most biodiverse nation. Last year, the government reported a 29% increase in deforestation – the sharpest rise in more than a decade. Forest clearing in Brazil has already condemned at least 20 species of birds, 10 species of mammals and eight of amphibians to regional extinction. Scientists estimate this is just a fifth of those that will die out due to habitat loss. Among the most endangered are giant otters and bare-faced tamarins. A 2015 study predicted half of the 15,000 tree species in the Amazon could be lost if current rates of deforestation continue. According to the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, the tatu-bola faces a particularly hard struggle to recover its population because of the animal’s low metabolic rate, small litter size, prolonged parental care and long gestation periods.

One of them is Labour’s Jonathan Reynolds, who first became MP for Stalybridge and Hyde in 2010. He posted a picture of his new wrist tattoo on Facebook along with a link to a JustGiving page which aims to raise £50,000 for the attack’s victims. The clean-living father of four is not an obvious rebel and his post concluded: “Now I’m just waiting for the phone call from me mam. You’re never too old to have your mum tell you off …” Only 13 minutes later, his mum Judith popped up on Facebook. “OMG this is your mother!!! I hate tattoos but under the circumstances totally support you.” Phew. Reynolds, 36, will be glad not to be sent to his room without his tea. • Talking of bees, Ukip launched its manifesto (no, stay with me). In April, its leader, Paul Nuttall, said he wanted a ban on full veils because it was important to see people’s faces. When questioned, he clarified that the ban would not apply to “big hats at all”. Beekeepers are also in the clear – there’s a picture of one on page 52 of the Ukip manifesto. • Stunt of the week: someone at Scottish Labour thought it was a good idea for leader Kezia Dugdale to challenge an SNP Stig (presumably played by a luckless intern) to a go-kart race. The party’s Twitter account posted the pictures of a triumphant Dugdale waving her helmet in the air with the caption: “Labour is in pole position to beat the SNP.” The party’s 2015 result was more of a motorway pile-up. • The conventional wisdom about manifestos is that no one pays them any attention. Unfortunately for the Tories, that doesn’t seem to be true. Their pledge to make older people pay for social care seems to have got through – in a bad way. A YouGov survey found that it was the policy voters most remembered. (For Labour, most people noticed the end of tuition fees.) On 15 May, only a fifth of people agreed with the statement that the Conservatives “have lots of policies but they don’t seem well-thought-through”. By 23 May, that figure had risen to a third. • Ukip was clearly stung – see what I did there – by criticism that its burqa ban unfairly singled out Muslims. The manifesto said the party was motivated by pure altruism, because “clothing that … prevents intake of essential vitamin D from sunlight is not liberating”. Sounds legit. • Theresa May told the Telegraph that her fantasy dinner party would include garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, travel writer Wilfred Thesiger and crime writer Agatha Christie. The last could get a real page-turner out of the internal Tory bickering over its stuttering campaign. It could be called A Manifesto Is Announced.

My interest had been stirred by news coverage of certain moral-political dilemmas facing the then home secretary Alan Johnson, who seemed to me an honest man trying to do a near-impossible job. Reading up on previous incumbents, I was struck by Douglas Hurd’s lament of being confronted daily by “wickedness of all kinds”. David Blunkett, a bit less fire-and-brimstone, remembered “the most intractable problems”. I did wonder – idly at first, then avidly – what it would mean to wake up to that job ever day. Back in 2009, the Labour government was plainly running out of road, as governments do, and another Conservative era was clearly on the horizon. So I decided to set my novel in a sort of parallel universe: a 2010 where the Tories had an outright majority, and I invented a home secretary called David Blaylock. In fiction, you’re obliged to make things tough for your protagonist, so I gave Blaylock a constituency in the north east, usually an embattled Fort Apache for a Tory. I made him an ex-soldier, whose approach to problem-solving has been shaped in the British army; and a divorcee, whose volatile temper has plagued both his work and family lives. The novel actually opens in Bosnia in 1993, Blaylock wearing the blue helmet of a UN peacekeeper, trying to act honourably in the thick of a moral quagmire. Cut to 17 years later, and we find him in a navy blue suit at the Home Office, trying to do something similar. On first publication, I was very pleased that The Knives was commended by various reviewers who knew politics particularly well. Alan Johnson picked it as his book of the year and I had fun, too, when Amber Rudd tweeted me her approval. While researching the book, I interviewed ex-cabinet ministers, MPs, special advisers and civil servants, all under the Chatham House Rule. That research went right up to 2015 and, remarkably, Theresa May endured as home secretary right through those years until finally getting her promotion. When The Knives came out, the Evening Standard suggested I was an “expert on the new prime minister”. Certainly, I’d been doing her job in my dreams for five years. But now, after the self-defeating outcome of her snap election, the knives are out for May: a useful reminder that all political careers end in failure, with the only question being at what hour, and in what circumstances, the bell will toll. Several issues that beset May at the Home Office – inter alia, antipathy to immigration, alienation in England’s regions, revived English nationalism and the threat of “domestic extremism” in various forms – are now in her bailiwick as prime minister. These issues clearly had some effect on why England made its choice in last year’s referendum. David Blaylock has his fictional constituency on Teesside, where all areas voted to leave the EU by more than 60%. The Knives may be a made-up story, but I hope it contains something truthful about how we got to where we are today. Extract Heading back to the Home Office from Downing Street Blaylock felt stiff from his cramped seat at the Cabinet table; and irked, too, by some of what he had heard there. It was ‘a Tory government’, yes, but by a gnat’s whisker and no more, propped up by deals cut with Ulstermen, and it was silly to pretend such a thin mandate permitted high ideological posturing from commanding heights. The party was comforted and emboldened overmuch by Labour having elected a new leader from its most pharisaical, wind-bagging tradition. Still, the odds of the Prime Minister losing the next election to such a figure could not be discounted. The pollsters said he was not seen as ‘popular in the country’, nor as ‘tough and no-nonsense’, nor even as ‘basically decent’ – much less ‘the choice of a new generation’. But the job, if thankless, had been keenly sought, and to Blaylock’s mind there was no use moaning about it. More about the book Richard T Kelly’s The Knives is a welcome and overdue break from the past – the best novel about modern politics I have read in years. His hero, David Blaycock, is a home secretary in a Conservative government. In the first of the many contemporary taboos he breaks with gusto, Kelly does not show Tories as collectively wicked but as varied individuals. He fills the cabinet with an honourable prime minister; an efficient chancellor; a shallow and scheming business secretary; and Blaycock himself, a working-class Conservative from the north-east of England, who appears to be an honest man determined to make the Home Office work. – Nick Cohen, the Guardian Buy the book The Knives by Richard T Kelly is published by Faber at £8.99 and is available from the Guardian bookshop for £7.64"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/28/the-very-culture-of-drugs-is-addictive","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T23:05:41Z","webTitle":"The very culture of drugs is addictive | Barbara Ellen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/28/the-very-culture-of-drugs-is-addictive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/28/the-very-culture-of-drugs-is-addictive","fields":{"headline":"The very culture of drugs is addictive","bodyText":"A Canadian study suggests that people who think that they only use cocaine “recreationally” could be in danger of becoming addicted more easily than previously thought. After taking cocaine, participants underwent a PET scan while watching people with whom they had used the drug taking more cocaine. Just watching fellow participants take cocaine led to craving and a dopamine release in the dorsal striatum, which could lead to dependency. Certain hard partying reprobates may right now be thinking: “How do I get on to a study like that?” More seriously, drug addiction is a grim, complex and sometimes fatal business and, as the study points out, it would be beneficial to catch it early. Presumably, other factors must be taken into account: how the drug was taken, how often and whether someone has an addictive personality. Something more than dopamine release has to explain why some people taking a hard drug such as cocaine end up addicted, while others don’t. As for visual triggers, in my experience, this wouldn’t have to be people taking drugs right in front of you. Triggers could be swirling around in a variety of youth, musical and hedonistic subcultures. I observed first hand how people could talk themselves into, say, becoming heroin addicts, even before they had laid eyes on the drug itself. Sometimes, the gateway was not so much a softer drug, or the people around them, as much as the mythology surrounding the class A drug itself, a mythology that, for whatever reason, certain people are particularly interested in buying into.

The Spaniard wants a win at the Brickyard to take him a step closer to claiming motor racing’s triple crown but Indy is such a formidable challenge just making it to the finish on his first attempt would be an achievement. One of his team-mates is also making his Indy 500 debut but for Britain’s Jack Harvey just taking to the track alongside his childhood hero is the stuff of dreams. Alonso has dominated the headlines around Indy this year and ducking out of Sunday’s Monaco Grand Prix to race with the Andretti team, heartily tired of his uncompetitive McLaren, was a PR masterstroke. Already a winner at Monaco, Alonso has made clear his desire to add Indy and Le Mans to the tally and match Graham Hill, the only driver to have won all three. Alonso’s decision to switch series was unusual enough to garner huge attention. For Alonso’s rookie test at the Brickyard, more than two million fans tuned in to watch the live streaming, keenly aware of the task facing Alonso and Harvey. Dismissing the 500 miles of super speedway as simply turning left for 200 laps is a nonsense. Anyone who finally gets to swig from the bottle of milk and take the pace car home will have truly earned it. Sébastien Bourdais, a former F1 driver and now a multiple Champ Car champion, knows his way round an oval but he crashed in qualifying and sustained multiple fractures. The cars run through the turns with entry speeds of over 230mph with as little downforce as possible. It is a dangerous combination. Across the 2.5-mile lap the characteristics of the corners, all with the same degree of banking and of the same length, differ widely. On entry to the first one cannot see through the corner and the rear end moves around. At two, unprotected by stands, the wind plays a role in affecting the delicate balance required. On the outside of all of them is the wall, which is close enough to make drivers hold their breath when it comes up close. Alonso has taken to Indy cars well, while acknowledging the challenge. “It’s the only place where you are here for two weeks, at a four-corner circuit, and you never repeat two laps in exactly the same conditions, in the same wind, the same traffic,” he said. “Every lap you are out there, you need to keep learning.” He was quick in practice, had a shot at pole but for a mechanical problem and starts from fifth on the grid on Sunday. And as the rookie Alexander Rossi proved last year, anyone can win this race if still in the mix come the final 50 laps. Alonso faces a tough field: there are seven previous winners on Sunday’s grid. Among the field is the 24-year-old Harvey, who has made his debut at Indianapolis with less fanfare, but it has been an equally special experience. “I’ve always been aware of it because it’s one of the biggest races in the world,” he says. “What I didn’t understand was what it represented to people in America, the history, the prestige. It gave me goosebumps, it’s extra special. When they say it’s the greatest spectacle in racing I feel like it is. If you win the race, you’re part of history; its significance is contagious. You want to be part of it.” Harvey’s journey to the race is familiar. Moving through karting and single-seaters, he raced and beat the current Formula One driver Carlos Sainz Jr in three different categories before the money ran out in his endeavours to reach F1. A switch to the US followed and in 2014 and 2015 he was runner-up in the Indy Lights championship. Finding backing continued to be a problem and so he leapt at the chance for a one-off drive this year at Indy with Andretti. Sharing a garage with Alonso was more than he could have hoped for. “He really was a childhood hero of mine,” he says. “I remember cheering for him. Being able to be his team-mate and something of an equal in a similar situation in that it is both of our first 500s is incredibly special for me.” Harvey, too, was reminded of the risks with a crash in practice and is conservative in his targets, aiming to take the best rookie spot (a task that would require him to finish higher than Alonso at the very least) but he knows that being in the mix is all important. “Absolutely I can win,” he says. “If everything falls your way, you can win the race. Alexander showed last year that anything is possible if you are still running at the end.” Harvey will start from 27th on the 32-car grid, from where everything is up for grabs at the Brickyard. “Everybody has the opportunity to win and everybody hopes it might happen to them,” he says. “If it comes my way I will take it.” That is a commitment that one can guarantee is strongly shared by his childhood hero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/may/27/britons-risk-sunburn-skin-damage","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T10:06:18Z","webTitle":"Sunscreen label confusion putting Britons at risk, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/27/britons-risk-sunburn-skin-damage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/may/27/britons-risk-sunburn-skin-damage","fields":{"headline":"Sunscreen label confusion putting Britons at risk, say experts","bodyText":"Britons are putting themselves at risk of sunburn and long-lasting skin damage by failing to understand the “dual protection” labelling on sunscreen products, research has warned. As the UK this week enjoyed an early heatwave, six out of 10 people polled said they were unaware that the SPF – Sun Protection Factor – rating displayed on labels does not alone guarantee protection from potential sun damage. A total of 2,000 UK adults were questioned for the study, which was published on Friday by health and beauty chain, Superdrug. Suncreams are designed to protect skin from UVA and UVB radiation, which may increase the risk of developing skin cancer. SPF indicates the amount of protection offered against UVB, which is the main cause of sunburn. Protection from harmful UVA rays, however, is indicated by a separate star rating of between zero and five. UVAs are short-wave rays that penetrate the skin deeply, even on an overcast day, and are considered to be the biggest cause of skin cancer. UVA rays also exacerbate the carcinogenic effects of UVB rays and are increasingly seen as a cause of skin cancer on their own, which is why it is highly important that a sun lotion contains both SPF and a high rating. The research revealed that 75% of Britons are not looking for both SPF and the top five-star protection when buying their sun care. And 61% said SPF was the most important factor for them when buying suncare products, unaware that SPF does not protect the skin from UVA rays. Nearly half (44%) of consumers admitted they don’t know what SPF means; one in 10 thought the SPF number equates to the minutes they could stay in the sun safely. In fact, it is a measure of a sunscreen’s ability to prevent UVB from damaging skin. So if a person whose unprotected skin starts turning pink in 20 minutes, using an SPF15 sunscreen theoretically prevents burning 15 times longer, about five hours. “The most misunderstood factor when buying suncare [products] is that people think that SPF equals everything, but while choosing the right SPF is important it only protects against UVB rays and not the long-lasting damage resulting from UVA rays” said Simon Comins, Superdrug commercial director. Superdrug is one of a number of companies to have repackaged their suncare range to make protection levels clearer and easier to understand. The move follows calls by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) for manufacturers to introduce simpler labelling after it warned that ignorance could be putting people at greater risk of skin damage and even cancer. “We know that it’s the damage that is done to skin when you’re under 18 that affects your chances of developing skin cancer as an adult, so it’s really important to help children and teens get the sun-safe habit early on” said Dr Pixie Mckenna, resident GP on TV show Embarrassing Bodies. “There are some simple steps everyone should take to enjoy the sun, protect their skin and avoid the pain and shame of the lobster look.” Rates of malignant melanoma (skin cancer) have been steadily rising in the UK since the mid-1970s and, according to the British Association of Dermatologists, more than 100,000 new cases of skin cancer are now diagnosed annually. The increase may be partly due to better awareness and early detection as well as changes in diagnostic criteria, the RPS said, but it is also linked to more holidays being taken abroad and sunbed use. “As the summer holiday season approaches, anyone choosing and applying a sunscreen should be confident that it will help protect them from the sun’s rays” said Richard Headland, editor of Which? “Sunscreens are a key part of sun safety so it’s important to pick a product you can rely on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/28/donald-trump-is-the-worlds-worst-tourist-but-at-least-he-makes-brits-abroad-look-better","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T14:00:11Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump is the world’s worst tourist – but at least he makes Brits abroad look better | Stuart Heritage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/28/donald-trump-is-the-worlds-worst-tourist-but-at-least-he-makes-brits-abroad-look-better","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/28/donald-trump-is-the-worlds-worst-tourist-but-at-least-he-makes-brits-abroad-look-better","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump is the world’s worst tourist – but at least he makes Brits abroad look better","bodyText":"Of all the things that Brexit has ruined – up to and including the ability to make civil conversation with your dad – foreign travel has to sting the most. Get an aeroplane anywhere and you’ll understand what I mean. Almost overnight, the predominant national stereotype around the world has become the Self-Sabotaging Brit. Unless you happen to go somewhere brimming with expats, all British holidaymakers this summer can be expected to be treated with outright pity. We’ll be met with sad glances and bewilderment in lobbies and cafes, seen as the morons who willingly flung themselves into a threshing machine thanks to a displaced sense of global importance. We’ve become the village idiots of the world, seen as doltish and shortsighted and proud, and nobody can quite understand why the hell we’ve done this to ourselves. It’s an awful situation to be in, because it upsets the natural order of things. We’re the ones who are meant to sneer at foreign tourists; coming over here with their garish backpacks and eating at all the wrong restaurants and becoming baffled to the point of tears by our strictly upheld escalator etiquette. We’re supposed to look at them, being ferried between designer outlet villages like cattle, and feel an overwhelming sense of superiority. After all, we’re Britain. At one point we probably owned wherever it is they’re from, plus we won Eurovision 20 years ago. Our entitlement is spectacularly well-earned. But, oh no, instead we’ve got to spend our richly deserved two weeks off work forlornly attempting to justify Brexit to a group of strangers who won’t stop acting like they’ve just discovered an on-the-run lobotomy patient. It’s a tragedy – and, worse, a self-inflicted one – but at least we might have just stumbled across an out. That out, needless to say, is Donald Trump. Trump’s Big Foreign Trip has been hilarious. He has been the very picture of a bad tourist gone feral. He’s the worst person you’ve ever met abroad. Everything Trump has done since leaving the comfort of the US has been astonishing, almost as if the Russians have paid him to create a bonk-headed one-man library of gifs designed to denigrate all travelling Americans. With every breath of his trip, Trump has managed to carve out an image of a terrified old man several leagues out of his depth. He goes to Saudi Arabia, and ends up palming a glowing orb like a bewildered ITV daytime game show contestant. He goes to Italy, and ends up experiencing a papal visit so excruciating that it came off like the pilot of an unmade sitcom entitled The Pope and The Dope. He goes to Belgium, and barges Montenegro’s president out of the way so brazenly that the only logical explanation is that he somehow mistook the occasion for a beauty queen molestation contest with a prize of unlimited ketchup-drenched steaks. Best of all, whenever he attempts to lurch into any sort of publicly affectionate display with his own wife, she furiously bats his hands away as if they are made of bees. If you can magically bring yourself to forget that you’re watching the most powerful man in the world, it has been terrific. And it has given us a common bond with rest of the world. Now, instead of trying to explain Nigel Farage to the people we meet on holiday, we can deflect all the unwanted attention with Trump. “You think we’re bad?” we can ask. “Well, get a load of this git.” It’s a boon for us when we need it the most. However, the danger is that Trump will reflect badly on American tourists. All countries have their stereotypes, whether it’s football hooliganism or a readiness to deploy beach towels on sunloungers too eagerly. Americans have only just crawled out from underneath a stereotype that has long persisted. There’s a mention of them in A Room with a View – “Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?” “Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog” – and the theme has continued through everything from EuroTrip to Team America. American tourists, the legend goes, are brash and arrogant. The truth is, you could dump a truckload of tourists of any nationality – yes, including mine – into the middle of a city, and they would all look preposterously out of place. All tourists are bad. Even you. However, there is something especially bad about Trump. His casual readjustment after shoving that poor Montenegrin. His alligator-wrestle of a handshake. His obnoxious, unearned swagger. Donald Trump is the world’s worst tourist, and the fact that he happens to be American is colossally unfortunate. But one man does not represent an entire country, and we would do well to remember that, just as I’ll remember it on holiday whenever anyone tries to bring up Boris Johnson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/26/hillary-clinton-wellesley-trump-nixon","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T17:33:21Z","webTitle":"Hillary Clinton returns to Wellesley and rips Trump with Nixon comparison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/26/hillary-clinton-wellesley-trump-nixon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/26/hillary-clinton-wellesley-trump-nixon","fields":{"headline":"Hillary Clinton returns to Wellesley and rips Trump with Nixon comparison","bodyText":"Taking the stage nearly 50 years ago at Wellesley, the liberal arts college famed for its activism, student body president Hillary Rodham turned to address roughly 400 of her female peers. As the first ever student to speak at the school’s commencement, or graduation ceremony, she faced a daunting task in addressing the prevailing climate of 1969. In a tumultuous period marked by the Vietnam war and social justice movements, Rodham was poised to discuss how her generation could effect change. But in a spur-of-the-moment decision, she first took on the influential Republican senator who spoke before her. Her speech introduced the future Hillary Clinton to the national stage. On Friday, Clinton returned to the place where it all began, six months after her defeat in the 2016 presidential election in what has similarly emerged as a watershed moment in American politics. The presidency of Donald Trump has been marked by scandals, confidence in institutions remains at a low and a steady stream of protests have drawn thousands to the streets of major cities across the country. And Clinton was keen to draw the two eras together when she made a veiled comparison between Trump and Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace after Watergate. The Wellesley students erupted into cheers at the sight of Clinton walking with the procession in cap and gown. And upon taking her place behind the lectern, Clinton was quick to identify the parallels between the moment of her speech 48 years ago and the environment today. There remained “urgent questions,” she noted, about discrimination against women, people of color, religious minorities, and immigrants. She twisted the knife in to Trump, without once mentioning the president by name, by comparing him to Nixon, who had recently won the 1968 election when Clinton made her original Wellesley speech. “We were furious about the past presidential election,” Clinton said, “of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with impeachment for his obstruction of justice.” The students relished this bold and freewheeling Clinton, who likened Trump’s leadership to authoritarian rule, and warned them they were graduating amid a “full-fledged assault on truth and reason”. “Leaders willing to exploit fears and skepticism have tools at their disposal that were unimaginable when I was graduating,” Clinton warned. “When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society.” The students hung on her every word, nodding along, some through tears, and meeting Clinton’s indictment of the Trump era with cheers that rung of defiance. Nearly five decades have passed since Clinton cemented, on that very same stage, her place as the face of a class dubbed as the “rebels in white gloves”. Clinton, although a political science major and active in student government, was not seen as a rabble-rouser. But in 1969 she addressed her peers amid mounting tensions at the height of Vietnam, a war that was roundly unpopular among the younger Americans who filled campuses like Wellesley, then, as now, a women’s college, and streets across the country with demonstrations. Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy had been assassinated against the backdrop of civil rights marches, and the rise of feminism had prompted women to demand equal roles in society. And so when Senator Edward Brooke, a moderate Republican, devoted much of his speech to discouraging protest in favor of incremental change, Clinton insisted his message be met with a rebuttal. “Part of the problem with just empathy with professed goals is that empathy doesn’t do us anything,” she said then. “We’ve had lots of empathy; we’ve had lots of sympathy. But we feel that for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible. And the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible.” What followed was a prolonged standing ovation from Clinton’s classmates, even as their parents scowled at the brazen young woman who had the audacity to take on a US senator. To Clinton’s classmates, there was a poignant symbolism to her speech, which they said spoke for a generation of women unafraid to challenge their leaders. “We, many of us who had wiped teargas from our eyes, were appalled by Senator Brooke’s remarks,” Connie Hoenk Shapiro, a graduate of 1969, said. “Fortunately, so was Hillary.” Clinton was no radical, said Shapiro, and her speech was not intended to be so. Clinton’s approach to crafting her prepared remarks was characteristic of the studious and methodical approach to policy she adopted over her political career. Shapiro, who lived next to Clinton for two years, said Clinton spent the weeks prior to the speech soliciting ideas from her classmates about the issues they wanted her to address. Clinton sat in her room on the eve of commencement crafting a speech while surrounded by the countless pieces of paper she had been handed by her peers. “She was always very much of a consensus-builder,” said Suzanne Salomon, another friend of Clinton’s of the 1969 graduating class. “She just captured people’s imagination. We were mildly rebellious at the time. And Hillary’s speech symbolized or brought to the fore the longings and desire among many of us to make changes in the world for the better.” Clinton’s 1969 speech was not simply a clarion call for the youth, but also an exhortation to the women before her to break down the barriers imposed by a male-dominated society. The Wellesley attended by Clinton and her class was, after all, bound by rules imposed upon women that to the class of 2017 might sound like ancient history. It was only 50 years ago that the women of Wellesley were subject to curfews and required to keep open the doors of their dormitories when men were granted permission to visit. “Our attitudes are easily understood having grown up, having come to consciousness, in the first five years of this decade – years dominated by men with dreams, men in the civil rights movement, the peace corps, the space program,” Clinton told her graduating class. “So we arrived at Wellesley and we found, as all of us have found, that there was a gap between expectation and realities. “But it wasn’t a discouraging gap and it didn’t turn us into cynical, bitter old women at the age of 18,” she advised. “It just inspired us to do something about that gap.” Clinton’s doomed presidential campaign was, in many respects, a casualty of that very same gap nearly five decades later. A female president had eluded the United States over its 240-year history, and at the onset of the 2016 election it looked as though Clinton were primed for the moment. Unlike eight years earlier, when her dream of reaching the White House was quashed by a relatively unknown senator named Barack Obama, this time the roadmap looked far clearer. Clinton’s popularity soared when she concluded her tenure as secretary of state, and there was no match for the depth of her experience in public office on either side of the aisle in a crowded field of prospective contenders. But then she officially became a candidate, and the familiar labels were attached to her public persona. Interactions with voters were dogged by questions of her “likeability”, and whether or not she was out of touch with the lives of everyday Americans. The rollout of policy proposals, on a steady weekly basis, was often overshadowed by an emphasis on how each move fit into her perception as a calculating politician. And then there were the emails. Clinton’s use of a private email server while heading the state department came to light a month before she launched her campaign, but it would go on to loom over her in the form of an oppressively constant fixation with whether she was trustworthy or honest enough to sit in the Oval Office. “Trust, to my recollection, hasn’t really come up very much in major political campaigns,” said Salomon. “And yet I heard so many people say, ‘I just don’t trust Hillary.’ And I’m wondering if part of that was that maybe women are not to be trusted as much as men.” Clinton routinely polled low on the question of trustworthiness, even as her opponent Donald Trump made brazenly false statements on a near daily basis. A report released this week on the role of gender in the 2016 election by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University found a double standard in relation to the notion of honesty and ethics, among other areas. “Research on gender stereotypes reveals that voters may be less likely to expect honesty and ethical behavior from men than from women,” the report stated. “As a result, it is entirely possible that women candidates might be held to higher standards than men when it comes to honesty and ethics in their pasts and on the campaign trail.” The report attributed this double standard to seeking to understand how Clinton’s indiscretions were viewed differently from Trump’s, and why Trump honed in on the nickname “Crooked Hillary” while relishing in “lock her up” chants at his rallies. “These tactics not only undermined Clinton’s credibility,” the author concluded, “but knocked her off the pedestal upon which stereotypes of feminine virtue place women.” Kelly Dittmar, the report’s author, said the perceptions of both qualifications and likability uniquely intertwined for women in a way they were not for men. “We vote for men we don’t like because we view them as qualified, but we are far less likely to view women as qualified if we don’t find them likable,” Dittmar said. “It’s hard to say this hasn’t been a factor in perceptions of Hillary Clinton – in 2016 and before.” Few moments captured the dissonance as strongly, and as fatefully, as when then-FBI director James Comey wrote in a 28 October letter to Congress that his agency was examining new emails related to the previous investigation into Clinton’s private server. A media frenzy ensued, even as little was known about the substance of the new emails, which turned out to be either duplicates or personal. By contrast, three weeks earlier a leaked 2005 Access Hollywood tape revealed Trump bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent. More than a dozen women went on to accuse him of sexual assault. He denied the claims. In a scathing op-ed, titled ‘If Hillary Clinton Groped Men’, Nicholas Kristoff asked readers to imagine if Clinton had been guilty of each one of Trump’s offenses. Sitting with Kristoff for her first public interview since the election in April, Clinton acknowledged to the New York Times columnist that “misogyny played a role” in her defeat. The quote kicked off a familiar cycle, with critics swiftly concluding she was playing the woman card and absconding blame yet again. “I think there were a lot of people, and surprisingly a number of women, who either were uncomfortable with, or in fact threatened, by the notion of a strong woman becoming president of the United States,” said Salomon. On Friday in Massachusetts, Clinton, was more unencumbered than ever before in assessing her treatment in the election. She needled Trump, subtly but repeatedly, for perpetuating an environment dominated by “alternative facts” where even the size of crowds was in dispute. She dwelled for a moment on the fake news phenomenon that disproportionately targeted her candidacy, mocking the conspiracy theory that a pizza parlor was the center of a child sex ring organized by her and her associates. With a hint of sarcasm, she told the women before her they may too be mocked for their “elite” education by those seeking to silence them. “In the years to come, there will be trolls galore – online and in person,” she said, before recalling one of Trump’s more infamous attacks against her on the presidential debate stage: “They may even call you a nasty woman.” For many of the 2017 graduates, Clinton’s presence was almost therapeutic. “As a community, we were stunned by the election results,” said Caroline Bechtel, who majored in political science and Middle Eastern studies. “I think this moment, Hillary being on campus, was a chance to collectively reflect upon that and to get motivated and energized to move forward and not give up.” Clinton, she added, was a role model “for her successes and also for her failures”. “It’s the way with which she’s moved forward after this election that is really inspiring to me,” Bechtel said. “We need to push for change and reach out to parts of the country that feel left behind.” For all her references to the attacks she encountered as a candidate, at the heart of Clinton’s message was another rallying cry to the young women embarking on their next chapter. Recalling her address to women and young girls on the morning after the election, Clinton implored them not to be discouraged by her loss but to in fact view it as a source of motivation. “If you feel powerless, don’t. Don’t let anyone tell you your voice doesn’t matter,” she said. “You didn’t create these circumstances, but you have the power to change them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/may/27/rocknrolls-dodgiest-deals-review-sharon-osbourne-ozzy-bbc4","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T06:00:20Z","webTitle":"Rock’n’roll’s Dodgiest Deals review – Sharon Osbourne shames the suits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/27/rocknrolls-dodgiest-deals-review-sharon-osbourne-ozzy-bbc4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/27/rocknrolls-dodgiest-deals-review-sharon-osbourne-ozzy-bbc4","fields":{"headline":"Rock’n’roll’s Dodgiest Deals review – Sharon Osbourne shames the suits","bodyText":"A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-wop-bam-ripped-off.

Every stool she encounters is there to be slipped off, every sushi restaurant conveyor belt there to get trapped in. Hers is a world where, when life hands you lemons, you drop them all on the floor, slip over the stray one that rolls away and rip your trousers as you fall. Yet, the awkward, hapless BBC character that became beloved by millions is not the same woman as Hart is off-screen. Far from falling flat on her face at every turn, the comedian has slowly conquered much of British culture, moving from radio to television comedy and drama, A-list Hollywood film – and now the West End stage. Previews began this week on the musical Annie, which sees Hart fulfil a lifetime dream of appearing in the West End. She plays the alcoholic, sexually repressed caretaker of the orphanage, Miss Hannigan – a favoured activity in Hart’s childhood was to perform every role in Annie to an invisible crowd of thousands. Even for those who have never watched her sitcom, which ran on the BBC between 2009 and 2015 and has a legion of loyal fans including Jimmy Carr and Russell Brand, Hart has become such a fixture of British culture that she is instantly recognisable to most. Nikolai Foster, director of Annie, said he had been aware of the importance of star casting in a West End production to draw in crowds, and said Hart was “someone we had in mind for a long time. It was a risk in some ways but Miranda felt like somebody fresh, who has a contemporary edge, but understands the history and heritage that she’s tapping into.” Yet Foster said while Hart had been overjoyed to be offered the part, she did not accept immediately. Instead she asked to spend time with the singing coach and choreographer to make sure she felt she could do the musical comedy justice. “It’s very rare you work with people like this, who are so hardworking, so diligent, so professional,” said Foster. “The first thing she said before we took the discussions any further was ‘I need to have singing lessons, I need to work with the choreographer, I need to find out if I can actually do this.’ “It took a process of months for her to feel confident that she knew she could do this justice. It wasn’t about me or the producers convincing her, it was about her being able to feel herself that she could deliver it to the high standards that she sets herself.” Hart had brought in improvised moments to the production, said Foster, but was equally very “disciplined and ruthless” about sticking to the script. “She feels like a complete natural on stage,” he added. “I am sure this is just the beginning of her theatre career.” Miranda the introvert in daily life v Miranda the extrovert on stage has been a theme throughout her life. Born in Torquay in 1972, she grew up in the Hampshire market town of Petersfield with younger sister Alice. It was an affluent upbringing (there are numerous baronesses, earls and dukes in her lineage and she is the fourth cousin, twice removed, of Diana, Princess of Wales) and her father, Captain David Hart Dyke, was a Royal Navy officer. He served in the Falklands war and was the commanding officer of the HMS Coventry, which was struck by the Argentinians. He survived but was missing for several days and emerged with bad burns. Hart was 10 at the time but has said her mother sheltered her from the media foray, admitting “the impact it had on me was minimal”. Her taste in comedy was also shaped by what she watched growing up. She came to idolise the camp silliness of Morecambe and Wise and the slapstick humour of Fawlty Towers, Are You Being Served? and the Carry On films. “I wasn’t aware I craved the laughter but I wanted to be on stage,” said Hart. “I just love silliness and I find life quite boring. I don’t want the responsibility of being an adult – I want to be making fun and lightness out of things. Being told ‘don’t be silly’ as a child really pissed me off, so I thought: ‘OK, I’ll be silly for a living then’.” When she was 11, her father was sent to the US for work and she was sent off to Downe House, an all-girls boarding school. She wanted to study stage management at university but at the encouragement of her parents ended up on a politics course at Bristol polytechnic, earning a 2:1. Hart admits she was very shy, even in her twenties, and after university she returned to live with her parents, plagued by agoraphobia, anxiety and panic attacks. She worked in various temping jobs, including as a PA for Comic Relief, but at 26 she finally confessed to her desire to become a comedian. She began to hone the semi-autobiographical character of Miranda at Edinburgh festival fringe shows. The flyer of her 2005 Edinburgh show boasts a now-familiar description: “Miranda doesn’t fit in! She was born into an upper-class background, she’s 6 ft 1, she finds it hard to feel feminine.” Her breakthrough came in 2008 when she did a reading of a Miranda script at the BBC. Jennifer Saunders happened to be in the audience and found it hysterical. It was subsequently commissioned into its first incarnation, on radio as Miranda Hart’s Joke Shop – a name she initially disputed. Dawn Ellis, who produced the show on Radio 2 in 2009, recalled working on the series, which had the same premise of the TV spin-off, based around an accident-prone Miranda who has blown her inheritance on a joke shop, which she runs with her friend Stevie. The project was close to Hart’s heart (it had been 15 years in the making) and Ellis recalls how anxious the comedian was. “Miranda had a really clear idea of what she wanted to do with it, it was clear this was a passion project for her,” said Ellis. “She was quite nervous and anxious to begin with and she wanted to be involved at every stage. It was good fun, it was hard work but I won’t lie, she was a bit nervous. But she’s so good when she gets on stage in front of audience there’s no stopping her, she’s fantastic with the audience.” The distinctions between Hart’s TV alter-ego and Hart herself were always clear, said Ellis. “Her characteristics are very much heightened in the show, she was never as bouncy or as potty as on the show. Miranda is a homebody I would say, she loves the dogs, she loves home comforts. She’s quite unassuming in real life and extremely self-deprecating, and I don’t get the sense that’s changed much at all, even now.” The series would prove life-changing for Hart and by 2010 – at age 37 and a good 11 years after she ventured into comedy – she had gathered not so much a cult following as a nationwide fanbase. However, her style of comedy is not appreciated by everyone and has been castigated for being unsophisticated and unashamedly middle class, often alongside comedians such as Michael McIntyre. Yet for every sniffy critic there is an effusive fan, praising her fusion of old-fashioned warm humour with a leading lady for the post-Bridget Jones era, and all with a pleasing lack of American TV sheen. Hart once addressed the accusations of hers being a comedy “about posh people” with the retort: “This character is completely classless really. She happens to be from Surrey but her goals and her fears and her problems could happen to anybody.” For Ellis, much of Hart’s appeal “lies in that she’s this ordinary, relatable person who is not afraid to share those embarrassing moments that we all have. She’s bold in her performance with things she’d be mortified if they happened in real life, she channels it all into the character.” While the first series of Miranda had been made for TV at a leisurely pace, the second one was more rushed in an attempt to maintain the momentum. In 2012, Hart landed her first serious role in the popular BBC drama Call the Midwife, playing Camilla Fortescue-Cholmondeley-Browne – known as Nurse Chummy – an upper-class viceroy’s daughter who is a bit out of place. It landed her a best supporting actress Bafta nomination and she would juggle her sitcom with the drama for three years. 2015 was also the year she landed her first Hollywood role in the comedy Spy, having caught the eye of Melissa McCarthy, who described Hart as “one of the funniest people I’ve ever met”. Hart’s life continues to be a mix of the ordinary, living in Chiswick, west London, with her beloved shih-tzu, Peggy, while also sidling down red carpets with Jason Statham and Jude Law. She is also not entirely lacking in edge – while she has a visceral hatred of clubbing, she also has two tattoos: “One which I regret majorly, on my upper arm, and one I still quite like, on my right ankle – a dove and a heart.” In almost every interview over the past five years, Hart has been open about her West End ambitions and her Miranda co-stars recall her speaking, even six years ago, about one day playing Miss Hannigan in Annie, replacing the imaginary audience of her childhood with a living, breathing one. “When I was a teenager I used to want to be famous – I thought it would justify my whole existence,” Hart recently admitted. “I imagined that if I was famous, when I tripped up in the street, people would just think, ‘Bless her, she’s famous, that’s fine.” Potted profile Born: 14 December 1972 Age: 44 Career: Aged 26 she started bringing her semi-autobiographical shows to the Edinburgh fringe. Miranda became one of the most popular BBC sitcoms, winning several Bafta nominations. She got her Hollywood break in 2015 in Spy. High point: Playing Miss Hannigan in the West End production of Annie, a childhood dream. Low point: After leaving university Hart struggled with depression and agoraphobia. She also spent years trying to get her comedy character Miranda off the ground but was ignored until 2008. She says: “You can play the big fool and hopefully people like you for it and then go: ‘Thank God I’m not as bad as her’.” They say: “She can’t not be funny: everything about her – her expressions, her mannerisms, her pauses, even her silences – are funny. It is an unlearnable and rare quality” – Arabella Weir"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/30/sidney-blumenthal-abraham-lincoln-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"'Not the path of Lincoln': Sidney Blumenthal turns his sights on Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/30/sidney-blumenthal-abraham-lincoln-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/30/sidney-blumenthal-abraham-lincoln-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"'Not the path of Lincoln': Sidney Blumenthal turns his sights on Trump","bodyText":"“In the beginning, it’s a life,” says Sidney Blumenthal. “And times.” For the first 129 pages of Wrestling With His Angel, the second of four volumes on Abraham Lincoln that won strong reviews last year, the times threaten to overwhelm the life. Between 1849 and 1856, as the country reels over slavery, Lincoln isn’t part of the dance. Out of Congress after one term, he is lawyering in courthouses across Illinois. But he is watching, closely, as the figures twirl and spin. Everything and everyone in Blumenthal’s rich study of 19th-century political life acts upon the man who became the 16th president in 1861. By the end of the book, two years before his Senate race against Stephen A Douglas, he is ready to act himself. Wrestling With His Angel covers years crucial to the making of Lincoln but relatively unknown to the reading public. “Everyone thinks they know Lincoln,” Blumenthal says. “But what I didn’t know and what I tried to present as best I could is how Lincoln thought, not to impose some artificial construct on him, or attribute to him some determinism, or even, as some of his contemporaries did, a sense of destiny. Even when someone may feel they have a sense of destiny, that’s simply a factor in how they behave. And it can be an illusion as well.” And with that, the 45th president looms over the conversation. Prompted to do so, Blumenthal refers mostly to “He Who Shall Not Be Named”. Fascination, however, trumps caution. The other key figure in the book is Douglas, the “Little Giant” of Illinois, pilot of the Compromise of 1850, author of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, architect and benefactor of the Illinois Central Railroad, and Lincoln’s opponent in the debates of 1858 and the 1860 presidential race. In conversation, Blumenthal picks out his sentences: careful, considered, perhaps slightly distracted by thoughts of his third volume, being rewritten to take Lincoln to Gettysburg, in the middle-distance of 1863. “Douglas actually could perform legislative miracles,” he says. “He is the one who managed the passage of the compromise of 1850, not [the Kentucky senator] Henry Clay, who physically and politically collapsed in a failed effort to do it. Douglas understood political men’s motives, understood a lifetime in politics in Illinois and Washington, in a way that Donald Trump never will. Compared to the Little Giant in history, Trump will always be little.” And here we are, to employ the kind of slightly hard-boiled stylistic flourish that crops up in Blumenthal’s writing, in Trumpworld. Surrounded by the political caricatures of the Palm restaurant in Washington DC, under the gaze of a shirtless George HW Bush astride an elephant, it all feels a little surreal. Talk of impeachment is gathering. Blumenthal has been there, as a presidential adviser under the fierce spotlight of proceedings against Bill Clinton, the whole thing documented exhaustively elsewhere: in his own book, The Clinton Wars, in solemn histories and in slashing attacks from the right. Notoriety lingers. Last time we met, with Hillary Clinton running for the Democratic nomination, Blumenthal had come fresh from the torture chambers of cable TV, where he fielded more questions about Benghazi than Lincoln. He was fine with that. “I’m a political person,” he said. “It’s the political season. The Clintons are on stage.” Now, like Hillary, like Lincoln, he’s offstage. But he’s observing and mounting sallies of his own that, in the case of an essay in the London Review of Books that took for real some fake political ads about Trump’s father, can sometimes come back to bite. Any lingering guilt an interviewer might have about discussing Trump in an interview about Lincoln, though, is scotched by the title of the third chapter of Wrestling With His Angel, an evisceration of the woeful 13th president, Millard Fillmore: The Art of the Deal. “Trump will provide a basis for revisionism of many presidents,” Blumenthal says of the kind of lists that usually put Lincoln on the podium with George Washington and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. “Those at the bottom will rise up from where they sit in historians’ estimation. Warren G Harding appears to be a much more serious and earnest figure.” He reaches for George W Bush’s now infamous inauguration day whisper, which he calls “the single most succinct and fitting remark to date about Trump”. “Some day, some historian will write a book entitled: Some Weird Shit: A History of the Trump Administration.” Blumenthal’s Lincoln Toward the end of volume two, Lincoln begins to climb from obscurity. In conversation, Blumenthal cites a speech given on 4 October 1854 at the State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, as division quickened towards secession. “He says many things in that speech,” Blumenthal says, “but one of the things is that the spread of slavery deprives the US of our ‘just influence in the world’. He means that by our example of fighting for democracy in the US, we should be providing an example to the Europeans and those in the west struggling for democracy as well, against reactionary forces. “He is not making rhetorical points. He means it. And that is what he meant when he talked, later, about the United States as the ‘last best hope of Earth’. It was not some grandiose triumphal expression of so-called American exceptionalism. He meant that the US should be the leading liberal party in the west. Those are the words he uses. That is how we exercise our just influence on the world.” Lincoln’s words might be seen as father to the idea of the “indispensable nation”, a phrase coined by Blumenthal and the historian James Chace and used under Bill Clinton in the era of third way internationalism and by Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail last year. Blumenthal, who has been fascinated and formed by Lincoln since his Chicago childhood, smiles warily. “It would be,” he says, again picking his words with care. “And it would also be the sense of liberal internationalism that has been rejected by He Who Shall Not Be Named. These struggles return. We can learn a lot about where we’ve been, and, as Lincoln said, ‘whither we are going’. And what is not the American path of Lincoln.” The current occupant of the White House has invoked “the great Abe Lincoln”, even as he completes his hijack of what remains of the party Lincoln helped to found. Earlier this month, Trump caused widespread hilarity by suggesting Andrew Jackson, the seventh president who died in 1845, could have stopped the civil war, which began in 1861. Such public declarations of affinity with Jackson, the populist, lead Blumenthal to perform a surgical dismemberment. “It’s always a mistake,” he says, “a fundamental error, to attribute even rudimentary knowledge to Trump. And to assume that he is extrapolating from something that might be even a fragment of history. There is nothing there. And nothing comes from nothing. “He has been told by Stephen Bannon that he is in the mould of Andrew Jackson, which is an absurdity. Because despite the glaringly obvious differences – I don’t recall Trump being the general who won the battle of New Orleans, or having been a senator – he’s precisely the sort of person Jackson would have loved to pull down: a privileged blowhard heir who wants to privilege the privileged. “That’s not what Jacksonianism was about. And knowing nothing, it’s hard to blame Trump for his pseudohistory. But the Jacksonian persuasion, as one historian called it, a large part of it went into the creation of the Republican party and aligned with Lincoln.” There is Francis P Blair, he of the house across from the White House; Montgomery Blair, his son, a member of Lincoln’s cabinet; John C Frémont, the first Republican nominee for president; Thomas Hart Benton, the colossus of Congress, the “man who was Missouri”. All of them were vehemently opposed to John C Calhoun, beaten back by Jackson in the nullification crisis of 1832 but stoker of the southern fire that eventually fueled secession and from which Bannon appears to draw destructive inspiration. “There is another Jacksonian tradition,” Blumenthal adds, sliding in the knife. “The tradition of Roger Taney, who was in Jackson’s kitchen cabinet and who became the supreme court justice who issued the Dred Scott decision that said black men had no rights that any white was bound to respect. Maybe he means that Jacksonian tradition.” Like volume one, A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel contains fascinating portraits of other historical figures. There is the little-remembered William Walker, a soldier of fortune who invaded Nicaragua and Mexico with the aim of founding an empire for slavery, then met his end in Honduras. There is also Jefferson Davis, not yet president of the Confederacy, “Dick Cheney before Dick Cheney” in his power over President Pierce, in private stricken near-blind by venereal disease. A little before the day we meet, New Orleans has taken down a statue of Davis. The city’s decision to remove its monuments to the Confederacy and white supremacy has provoked protest and praise. Blumenthal’s final volume will consider Lincoln’s legacy in the Reconstruction era and how it was dismantled by a resurgent, racist south that concentrated on the removal of basic rights, most potently the vote. In 2013, the US supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The issue lives. “Voter suppression has its roots in the war against Reconstruction by white terrorist organisations like the Ku Klux Klan and the White League of New Orleans,” Blumenthal says. “Voter suppression was a factor in the election of 2016 and even today, He Who Shall Not Be Named has appointed a commission to look into so-called voter fraud, which is of course an Orwellian title given to an effort to sustain and advance voter suppression. To that extent, in that effort at least, the civil war is still going on.” So is Blumenthal’s monumental life of Lincoln. In volume two, there is a brief description of a forgotten event that points to his subject’s death. In Pennsylvania in 1851, a Maryland slave owner who had come north to catch four runaways was shot and killed in a confrontation with a group of free African Americans and abolitionist whites. One of the runaway slaves, William Parker, was helped to freedom in Canada by Frederick Douglass, another man whose death date Trump muddled. The slave owner’s name was Edward Gorsuch. Blumenthal is not aware of any relation to Trump’s supreme court justice, the ultra-conservative Neil Gorsuch. He is certain, though, of the identity of the young actor to whom Edward Gorsuch was something of a surrogate father. His name was John Wilkes Booth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/may/27/sandbanks-and-salcombe-top-uk-seaside-property-league","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T06:01:20Z","webTitle":"Sandbanks and Salcombe top UK seaside property league","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/may/27/sandbanks-and-salcombe-top-uk-seaside-property-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/may/27/sandbanks-and-salcombe-top-uk-seaside-property-league","fields":{"headline":"Sandbanks and Salcombe top UK seaside property league","bodyText":"Sandbanks in Dorset, Britain’s Mayfair-on-Sea, has once again emerged as the most expensive seaside town in the country. Home to former Premier League managers and millionaire businessmen, the average price of a home on the glitzy peninsula is now just more than £664,000. Next in price is the sailing hotspot of Salcombe, further along the south coast in Devon, where a house will set you back £618,000. The data from mortgage lender Halifax showed, however, that the price of a sea view still lags behind the wider UK housing market. House prices in Britain’s seaside towns have jumped by a quarter over the past decade to an average of £227,000 compared with £181,000 in 2007. At a wider national level, however, prices have risen 30% to £266,000. Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said coastal towns within commuting distance of London had benefited from the boom in house prices in the south-east. “Over the past decade, house prices in the south-east – especially coastal towns within commutable distance to London, have shown strong growth and have become Britain’s most expensive seaside towns,” he said. The bank said that outside southern England, the most expensive seaside areas are the Scottish golfing towns of North Berwick (£314,000) and St Andrews (£300,000). Halifax said that Scottish seaside towns recorded the largest percentage growth. Prices in Fraserburgh, near Aberdeen, almost doubled to more than £136,000 in 2016. “The strongest performing coastal towns in terms of growth have been north of the border in Scotland, where property prices on the Aberdeenshire coastline have been helped by the oil industry more than the sunshine,” Ellis said. The residents of the well-heeled Suffolk town of Aldeburgh have enjoyed the greatest real price increase – up from £316,000 in 2007 to £527,000 in 2017. Newbiggin-by-the-Sea in Northumberland, which was forced to rebuild its beach in 2007 with 500,00 tonnes of imported sand, is named as England’s cheapest seaside town – at £76,000."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/may/26/abedi-mosque-leaders-offer-themselves-for-police-questioning","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T18:30:15Z","webTitle":"Abedi mosque leaders offer themselves for police questioning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/26/abedi-mosque-leaders-offer-themselves-for-police-questioning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/may/26/abedi-mosque-leaders-offer-themselves-for-police-questioning","fields":{"headline":"Abedi mosque leaders offer themselves for police questioning","bodyText":"Senior figures from a mosque attended by the Manchester Arena bomber, Salman Abedi, have voluntarily gone to the police to offer themselves for questioning. The Didsbury mosque’s chair of trustees, Mohammad El Khayat, said he and other prominent members of the congregation presented themselves at a local police station to answer questions and invite any investigation. Giving a sermon at Friday prayers, El Khayat strongly condemned the attack and said the mosque had nothing to hide. He said many of the people who worshipped at the centre had been welcomed into Britain and the congregation had always tried to give back to the community. Two police officers attended the prayers and Sgt Allan Dean, who is based at west Didsbury, briefly addressed the congregation to reassure them that the mosque would be protected. Threats and hate mail have been sent to the mosque since it emerged that Abedi and other members of his family were attendees. During Friday prayers police community support officers patrolled outside, where a police mobile video unit is posted with a camera pointing at the front door. It is understood the mosque is not being investigated and has not been searched. Several hundred men were in the main hall for Friday prayers, fewer than usual because of the attention the mosque had received. El Khayat said the Libyan community in Manchester was “well-educated, kind, generous, always willing to help”. Abedi, he said, could never represent the community or its values. “We strongly continue to condemn the horrendous crime that was committed,” he said. “We were stunned, shocked that such an atrocity should happen here on our doorstep.” He said Britain was a hospitable country which had provided Muslim people with shelter, safety, education and health. “Our mission was always to repay these favours, be positive and useful members of society.” There has been some criticism of the mosque’s refusal to answer questions about Abedi. The Guardian has learned that Abedi’s father, Ramadan, used to call worshippers to prayer at the mosque because he had an excellent voice. One of the imams, Mohammed Saeed, has told the Guardian how Abedi attended the mosque regularly and once looked at him “with hate” after he gave a sermon criticising Islamic State and the militia group Ansar al-Sharia in Libya. Saeed reported his concerns about associates of Abedi to the police. El Khayat told worshippers the media interest in the mosque had been overwhelming and senior figures had not wanted to comment for fear of being misinterpreted. He said that if they had suspicions about anyone, the police would be the first to know. “We have had positive and good relations with them.” El Khayat said the mosque would continue to invite in people of all religions, and none. “This incident made us as determined as ever to stand by our values and openness, to continue with our efforts in building bridges.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/28/floods-bring-rush-hour-chaos-bangkok-thailand","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T20:30:06Z","webTitle":"Floods bring rush hour chaos to Bangkok","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/28/floods-bring-rush-hour-chaos-bangkok-thailand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/28/floods-bring-rush-hour-chaos-bangkok-thailand","fields":{"headline":"Floods bring rush hour chaos to Bangkok","bodyText":"The city of Bangkok has been inundated after a massive low pressure system encompassing North, Central and East Thailand produced heavy rainfall and widespread flooding last Thursday morning.

It now turns out she was acting on insider information. Only she knew just how mediocre she really was and that her mediocrity would be inevitably found out. Only she knew that she was planning to release a totally uncosted manifesto with policies that would have to be ditched before the election even took place. Only she knew that she was strong and stable enough to turn a 24 point lead in the polls into a mere five. With Tory candidates hastily erasing the Supreme Leader from their campaign leaflets and Labour candidates having to backtrack a little on their promise that it was OK for people to vote for them as there was no chance of them winning the election, Corbyn chose to resume campaigning after the Manchester bombing with a speech in central London on national security. Many Labour supporters secretly feared the worst, wishing instead that Corbyn had followed the Conservative example of doing nothing for the day. That way, at least, nothing much could go wrong. Security hasn’t always been the Labour leader’s strongest suit and the potential for generating the wrong kind of headlines was obvious. With everything moving in his favour, why take the security risk? It felt a bit like the captain of the Titanic making it safely into New York, only to head back out in search of icebergs because the voyage had been too dull. Not for the first time, Corbyn rather confounded his critics. After an impromptu minute’s silence for the Manchester victims that was observed by everyone apart from some of the photographers that swarmed around him, Corbyn began by condemning the atrocious violence that had taken so many young lives. He praised the police, firefighters, paramedics, doctors and nurses for the work they had done under such demanding circumstances and said the emergency services would get all the resources they needed under a Labour government. It was the one of very few point-scoring digs at the Conservatives in the entire speech as, for the most part, he chose to rise above party politics. He didn’t seek to blame anyone but the bomber for the Manchester attack, only to try to provide a context for it and ended with the hope that the final two weeks of the election campaign could be conducted without name-calling or playing party politics. That was dashed within minutes when the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, took to the airwaves to condemn him for a speech he hadn’t made. Corbyn left without taking any questions. There would be more than enough of them from Andrew Neil later in the evening. Unusually, Neil lobbed Corbyn a gentle loosener to start with by sounding incredulous that the Labour leader was making a link between terrorism and British foreign policy. Corbyn couldn’t believe his luck and used the opportunity to point out that he wasn’t alone in thinking this. Boris Johnson, two heads of MI5 and the foreign affairs select committee had come to pretty much the same conclusion. Who was he to disagree with such collective wisdom? Ten minutes in, Neil finally realised the interview was in danger of being backed into a cul-de-sac and moved on to Corbyn’s support for the IRA. “I didn’t support the IRA,” Corbyn replied, slightly disingenuously. All he had ever wanted was an end to the armed struggle in Northern Ireland along with a cup of tea with Sinn Féin in the House of Commons. Once the interview turned to domestic policy, Corbyn relaxed and became more like Mr Zen. The home stretch really was the home stretch. People liked his manifesto because it offered hope and whatever it cost – they argued over the exact sums – it had to be a price worth paying to make sure everyone had decent homes and schools and a health service that worked. “Why should the people trust you?” Neil said. “Loads of your own MPs don’t.” Or didn’t when he was miles behind in the polls.

On the day Theresa May triggered article 50, government officials asked the European commission to weaken or drop elements of its flagship energy efficiency law. Green campaigners warned that the efforts to undermine the energy efficiency directive were a sign the Conservatives would dilute or abolish European energy and climate policies after the UK leaves the EU. In the past, the UK has publicly welcomed the targets, which end in 2020, as an important driver for reducing consumer bills and reliance on energy imports. The European commission wants a binding target of improving energy efficiency 30% by 2030, compared with business-as-usual. But documents obtained by Greenpeace, dated 29 March, show the UK urging the commission to lower the goal to 27% and make it non-binding on the EU’s 28 members. A more recent version, dated 22 May and seen by the Guardian, shows the UK has maintained its stance. Hannah Martin, the head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said: “The government is trying to lock the rest of the EU into weaker energy policies, just as we are leaving. The message ministers seem to be sending is that Brexit could trigger a race to the bottom and be used as cover for getting rid of key environmental safeguards.” The UK is also pushing to drop an obligation on suppliers – including the big six of British Gas, EDF, E.ON, Npower, SSE and ScottishPower – to cut the amount of energy they sell during the next decade. Under the commission’s plan, energy companies would have to achieve energy savings of 1.5% a year until 2030, using energy efficiency measures. The UK called for the target to be abolished or, failing that, it should no longer be legally binding. The directive was important for giving companies the long-term certainty to plan their investments, one business group said. “Seeking to reduce the level of ambition in the directive is entirely counter-productive both environmentally and economically, and completely undermines the UK’s aspirations to maintain a leadership position on climate change,” said John Alker, policy director at the UK Green Building Council. Roland Joebstl, of the European Environmental Bureau, a network of environmental groups, said the UK’s lobbying could “crash” the European energy efficiency industry and jeopardise jobs. David Symons, environmental director at consultancy WSP, said: “It’s surprising that the government is lobbying against a measure that is expected to deliver €70bn of additional gross domestic product and 400,000 jobs across Europe by 2030.” One expert warned the move could push up household energy bills. Joanne Wade, the chief executive of the UK-based Association for the Conservation of Energy, said: “At an EU level, we need a binding target for energy efficiency, to make sure that there is not an over-emphasis on supply-side options which could result in higher energy bills for consumers.” However, the industry body that represents the big six and other energy suppliers welcomed the stance taken by the UK. “Market-based measures, rather than binding obligations, should be used to drive energy efficiency investment,” said Lawrence Slade, the chief executive of Energy UK. The EU has said it committed to putting “energy efficiency first” as part of its action on climate change. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU’s climate chief, has said he was “particularly proud” of the 2030 target. The Conservative party’s manifesto pledged to improve the energy efficiency of Britain’s draughty housing stock It said it would establish an energy-saving scheme for big industrial companies, because “an energy-efficient business is a more competitive business”. A government spokesman said: “Any future decisions on energy efficiency policy would be a matter for the next government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/26/trump-travel-ban-status-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T14:50:44Z","webTitle":"Trump's travel ban is a test for the US supreme court – and the country | Amir Ali","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/26/trump-travel-ban-status-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/26/trump-travel-ban-status-supreme-court","fields":{"headline":"Trump's travel ban is a test for the US supreme court – and the country","bodyText":"The US supreme court will soon decide whether to repeat one of the most shameful moments in American history. On Thursday, 10 judges on the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit voted to uphold a lower court’s order blocking President Trump’s Executive Order No 13780, which would have banned people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. The court correctly concluded that the order was inspired by animus against people of the Muslim faith, in violation of the establishment clause. In a powerful concurring opinion, Judge James A Wynn expressed hope that we have “matured from the lessons learned by past experiences”, referring to now condemned supreme court decisions in Dred Scott – which held that African Americans could not be US citizens – and Korematsu v United States, which upheld executive proclamations requiring the internment of Japanese Americans during the second world war. The government has pledged to seek review of the fourth circuit’s decision in the supreme court, which will almost certainly take the case. One of the decisions Wynn referred to, Korematsu, has become a focal point of the legal challenge to Trump’s order. Like Trump’s order, Korematsu arose from an expressed desire to protect the country by singling out a group based on race – one could not easily tell the difference between the good Japanese Americans and the “disloyal” ones, so they must all be detained. The federal government, as it has in the case of Trump’s order, argued that the power to detain in times of war was within the president’s broad national security powers. In what is now viewed as one of the worst supreme court decisions in history, Justice Hugo Black upheld the discriminatory detention, reasoning implausibly that it was motivated by security, not discrimination. In the legal community, the Korematsu decision has become known as “anti-canon” – an example of reviled decision-making. Yet it is surprisingly difficult to come up with a moral distinction between Korematsu and Trump’s order. Several civil rights organizations – including the MacArthur Justice Center and the Fred T Korematsu Center (dedicated to the man who challenged the Japanese American detention program during the second world war) – have filed legal briefs arguing that the government is attempting to repeat history. In both federal courts of appeal that heard oral argument earlier this month, judges pointedly asked the acting solicitor general, Jeffrey B Wall, how this case was any different from Korematsu. The problem – one that should be concerning to all Americans – is that neither the federal government nor the judges who have defended Trump’s order have offered an acceptable answer. The three judges who dissented in yesterday’s decision were notably silent about this invidious elephant in the room. Moreover, the obvious low point in Wall’s argument in defense of Trump’s order has been his inability to draw a meaningful distinction from Korematsu. He answered confidently that he would never have defended the ban in Korematsu – as he has to – but, when pressed, revealed that he had not read the orders at issue in Korematsu and was unable to provide a clear distinction. To be sure, there are distinctions. For instance, the order in Korematsu discriminated against people who were already in the country, while Trump’s order would discriminate only at the time people attempt to enter. Also, one of the orders in Korematsu actually said the words “Japanese American”, while Trump’s order avoids the word “Muslim”. But these distinctions have nothing to do with why we are ashamed of Korematsu. They are new examples of the formalistic distinctions that gave the justices in Korematsu the comfort to do wrong. The late justice Antonin Scalia believed that Korematsu was wrongly decided, but warned: “You are kidding yourself if you think the same thing will not happen again.” His former colleagues, along with the justice who replaced him, will soon decide whether to create the historical blemish of our time. • This article was amended on 26 May 2017 to correct the description of Dred Scott, and to correct the spelling of his first name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2017/may/26/mls-texas-derby-houston-dynamo-fc-dallas","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-26T14:27:18Z","webTitle":"Does MLS have a Texas problem?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/26/mls-texas-derby-houston-dynamo-fc-dallas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/may/26/mls-texas-derby-houston-dynamo-fc-dallas","fields":{"headline":"Does MLS have a Texas problem?","bodyText":"Whoever coined the phrase “demographics are not destiny” could have been referring to Major League Soccer in Texas just as easily as talking about politics. Simple population figures would imply that two of the league’s biggest clubs are facing off in the Texas Derby on Sunday, with the right to fire a cannon awarded to the team with the season’s best head-to-head record - provided they have secured the appropriate paperwork from safety-conscious city authorities, that is. More than seven million people live in the Dallas metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in the nation. Houston is fifth, with nearly seven million. Yet FC Dallas are one of the least-watched teams in MLS and Houston’s crowds are on the slide. Going into the weekend, the rivals sat second and third in the Western Conference standings, with the Dynamo owning the best home record in MLS: played seven, won six, drawn one. Under their new head coach, Wilmer Cabrera, Houston offer a direct, fast-paced style and are liable to score – and concede – often. The Mexican forward and designated player, Erick “Cubo” Torres, has nine goals, making him the league’s second-highest scorer so far this season. The average crowd, though, is 17,653: a modest figure, especially given the MLS habit of declaring tickets distributed rather than actual attendance. After a boost when they moved from a crumbling university football venue to a smart downtown soccer-specific home in 2012, Houston’s average crowd is roughly back to where it was before they left, while other teams have overtaken them. In their last season at Robertson Stadium they ranked ninth in attendance; in their first season at BBVA Compass Stadium, fourth; last season, fourteenth; currently, fifteenth out of 22 teams. The capacity of Dallas’ Toyota Stadium has been limited to about 16,000 since last year because of construction, but in 2015 the side only drew an average of 15,981 fans – third-worst in MLS. And that year, just as in 2016, Dallas had the best regular-season record in MLS. So what is going on? Like the Chicago Fire, who beat them 2-1 on Thursday in front of 12,584, Oscar Pareja’s side are not helped by the location of their stadium. It is in the distant suburb of Frisco, 29 miles from downtown and a journey that can take well over an hour when traffic is heavy. Houston’s home appears ideally located to entice supporters from all corners of the city, but the Dynamo have not reached the playoffs since 2013. “Houston is very much a fairweather fan mentality when it comes to all of [the city’s] local sports teams,” said James Hromadka of the Texian Army fan group. He has attended every Dynamo road game against Dallas and will be at Toyota Stadium on Sunday. “When you have a winning team, people show up.” Manny Gutierrez, one of the leaders of another group, El Battalon, said that there was a sense that ownership was resting on its laurels in previous years and a discouraging lack of effort on the field, though matters are improving. (A representative of one of Dallas’ main supporters groups declined to comment for this article; another group did not respond to a comment request.) Still, much smaller places – Salt Lake City, Portland, Kansas City and Vancouver, to name a handful – attract as many or more MLS fans, even though Texas’s status as a major sporting hub is not in dispute and crowds for international and overseas club fixtures are often impressive, with Manchester United set to face Manchester City in Houston on 20 July, two days before north Texas hosts a Concacaf Gold Cup semi-final. “Not to take anything away from Portland but aside from the [NBA’s] Blazers there’s really not a whole lot else. There’s a team that’s got decades of history that precede MLS,” Gutierrez said. “Houston gets absolutely saturated with Latin American clubs that come here. These are the teams of our fathers, the teams of the countries that many of the people that live in this city, where they come from. And there’s this loyalty to that brand, loyalty to the club that they grew up with. We’re surrounded by a lot of clubs and fans that look at us as outsiders, the new guy, kind of thrown into a market where there was a lot of established fan groups.” The Dynamo started play in 2006 after then-owners AEG relocated the San Jose Earthquakes to Houston and won MLS Cup in their first two seasons. “We came at a very weird transitionary period in the league [four years] after contracting a couple of teams [in Florida], moving a team that had a lot of history in its market but couldn’t seem to keep that team around,” Gutierrez said. Dallas are an original MLS franchise, kicking off in 1996 as the Dallas Burn, but have never lifted the MLS Cup and reached the final only once. “It’s not an easy market,” MLS commissioner Don Garber told the Dallas Morning News last year. “It’s less important to me where they sit in relation to other clubs. We’re able to look at their metrics and see that they’re moving in the right direction. All indicators are moving in the right direction, although other teams in the league are moving a bit faster. But over time they will start winning some championships so that they can have a legacy of success on the field that hopefully can translate into success off the field.” Houston lost 4-1 to Atlanta United last week in front of nearly 45,000 fans in Georgia z- and the newcomers have not even moved into their new stadium yet. As Steve Davis wrote in FourFourTwo in February, the newer teams are generally enjoying better crowds than the more venerable franchises as they join a league with a growing buzz that has learnt from mistakes it made in its early years. They enter from a higher floor, usually with bigger and better stadiums, with a cachet and media attention that was denied to older clubs that – with Sporting Kansas City a notable exception – have struggled to enhance or transform initial impressions. “The teams that are coming into the league today and over the last couple of years have a distinct advantage over some of the teams that have been in existence from day one simply because soccer has grown so much in popularity over the last decade that they’re riding this wave of popularity for the game, and coming in to the league with a very clean, fresh image for the sport and for the league,” said Chris Canetti, the Dynamo president. “As soccer continues to grow in this country and continues to evolve, these newer expansion teams in my opinion have some advantages in their opportunity to succeed right off the bat.” Canetti said that local television viewing figures for Dynamo games are up 200% now that they are on a more accessible channel. Growth is not always fully definable by raw numbers – Hromadka also measures the Dynamo’s progress in the number of orange bumper stickers he spots on cars around town, and how often he steps into a bar that’s showing soccer. In the beginning, he said, “People were like, ‘Oh, we have a team, I didn’t know that.’ So you had that for the first few years. Now, when I go to an Astros [MLB] game I actually see people wearing Dynamo jerseys and hats … It is part of the city’s consciousness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/may/30/teenagers-sleep-quality-and-mental-health-at-risk-over-late-night-mobile-phone-use","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T05:10:39Z","webTitle":"Teenagers' sleep quality and mental health at risk over late-night mobile phone use","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/30/teenagers-sleep-quality-and-mental-health-at-risk-over-late-night-mobile-phone-use","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/30/teenagers-sleep-quality-and-mental-health-at-risk-over-late-night-mobile-phone-use","fields":{"headline":"Teenagers' sleep quality and mental health at risk over late-night mobile phone use","bodyText":"Teenagers’ late-night mobile phone use is harming their sleep and potentially their mental health, say researchers who advised that “physical boundaries” be set over use of such devices in the bedroom. A longitudinal study of 1,101 Australian high school students aged between 13 and 16 found poor-quality sleep associated with late-night texting or calling was linked to a decline in mental health, such as depressed moods and declines in self-esteem and coping ability. Lead researcher, Lynette Vernon of Murdoch University in Perth, said her findings were evidence of the need for curfews for teenagers to be established around use of devices in their bedrooms. Adolescents who used their phones as alarms should replace them with clocks in order to maintain “physical boundaries”, she said. Researchers examined teenagers’ mobile phone use and their subsequent changes in wellbeing over four years of high school from 2010 to 2013, and found increasingly unencumbered access led to increases in psychosocial maladjustment. Vernon said mobile phones had become entrenched in young people’s lives, and many did not have their use restricted. She pointed to international research that found about 80% of the young had access to a mobile phone. The former high school teacher said she had observed her own pupils coming into the classroom tired. “I noticed it was affecting their performance – that was a few years back, too.” Though the link between late-night phone use and sleep, and between sleep and wellbeing, had been established in previous research, this was the first study to assess all three together, she said. “It’s important to have the research to translate to parents and teachers, who probably haven’t experienced to the same extent what kids are doing. “If you’re finding your son or daughter is more moody and not coping at school, you often put that down to adolescence – but it could be as simple as them not sleeping at night.” The study specified sending and receiving messages and/or phone calls, so did not distinguish between mobile phones and smartphones or social media. Students in Year 8 who reported higher levels of night-time mobile phone use also reported higher levels of depressed mood and externalising behaviour and lower self-esteem when surveyed one year later. Few teenagers indicated that they never used their phone after lights out, and on average, younger teenagers’ healthy mobile phone habits became more problematic as they advanced through high school. “The outcomes of not coping – lower self-esteem, feeling moody, externalising behaviours and less self-regulation, aggressive and delinquent behaviours – the levels increase as sleep problems increased.” Teenagers who reported “constantly texting into the night” said when surveyed a year later, the problem had worsened. “It’s escalating – they’re highly invested in it ... Some kids are staying up until 3am.” The study, Mobile Phones in the Bedroom: Trajectories of Sleep Habits and Subsequent Adolescent Psychosocial Development, was published in the Society for Research in Child Development on Tuesday. Teenagers need eight to 10 hours of sleep for healthy development, Vernon said. Phones disrupted sleep in two ways, with the bright light from screens disrupting natural circadian rhythms, and messages received before sleep spiking “cognitive and emotional arousal”, said Vernon. Education was the best prevention, Vernon said, and it was most effective if it began before children were given their first mobile phone. “As a mother of teenage kids, I think you’ve got to negotiate, and negotiate early.” Parents could also set a good example by demonstrating good habits around phone use themselves. “Back when they’re aged seven to 10, you have to role model – you put your phone in a basket at night, it doesn’t go into your bedroom, it becomes normalised in the household and you have a much easier job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/may/29/treasury-did-not-model-australian-budgets-impact-on-women-officials-admit","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T08:48:35Z","webTitle":"Treasury did not model Australian budget's impact on women, officials admit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/29/treasury-did-not-model-australian-budgets-impact-on-women-officials-admit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/may/29/treasury-did-not-model-australian-budgets-impact-on-women-officials-admit","fields":{"headline":"Treasury did not model Australian budget's impact on women, officials admit","bodyText":"Treasury officials have admitted they did not model the impact of the 2017-18 budget on different Australian households. Michael Brennan, the deputy secretary of Treasury’s fiscal group, says he also doesn’t think Treasury has begun work on Australia’s G20 commitment, from 2014, to analyse the tax system to see what impact it is having on women. A week ago the National Foundation for Australian Women, in a new analysis, found the combined impact of the Turnbull government’s budget measures could hit women earning below-average wages with effective marginal tax rates of 100%. It showed the combination of an increase in the Medicare levy, the freezing of family tax benefit rates, and earlier repayment requirements for student loans “are particularly harsh for women”. The report, Gender Lens on the Budget, pointed out that women were overrepresented at lower-income levels and changes to government benefits and increases in taxes had a disproportionate effect on women. Brennan told Senate estimates hearings on Monday he was not aware of the Office for Women, which is housed inside the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, asking Treasury officials to consider the impact of 2017 budget measures on effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs). “It is something we do look at from time to time, looking through the income scale with particular household cameos, where effective marginal tax rates might be particularly high, but I’m not aware that we’ve done anything for this particular budget,” he said. Effective marginal tax rates are the proportion of an additional dollar of earnings that is lost to both income tax and the reduction of mean-tested government payments. During its G20 presidency in 2014, Australia undertook to reduce the gender gap in workforce participation by 25% by 2025. The former Abbott government said it would support Australia’s commitment to boost women’s workforce participation by delivering more affordable and flexible childcare, supporting businesses to create more flexible workplaces, and examining the tax and transfer system and its impact on women. Brennan said: “It’s not under way, that I’m aware of, within the Treasury.” The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, then interjected to say Treasury would take the question on notice. “Because as outstanding as Mr Brennan is, he may not be aware of every last bit that is happening within the Treasury, so we might just take that on notice to see if we can further add to that answer, having gone through it,” Cormann said. Labor senator Jenny McAllister later criticised the government for not focusing more on the gender pay gap and female participation. “First we had a minister for women who was unable to answer basic questions about what role, if any, the Office for Women played in the budget process,” she told Guardian Australia. “Today we learn that no one was asked to calculate the real effect of this budget on Australian women. “Like the rest of their government, Ministers Michaelia Cash and Cormann don’t seem to know or care how this government’s policies affect women,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/may/30/liberals-wont-accept-indigenous-recognition-model-institute-of-public-affairs-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T18:30:33Z","webTitle":"Liberals won't accept Indigenous recognition model, Institute of Public Affairs warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/30/liberals-wont-accept-indigenous-recognition-model-institute-of-public-affairs-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/may/30/liberals-wont-accept-indigenous-recognition-model-institute-of-public-affairs-warns","fields":{"headline":"Liberals won't accept Indigenous recognition model, Institute of Public Affairs warns","bodyText":"A constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice in parliament is “unlikely to ever be accepted by the majority in the Liberal party”, the Institute of Public Affairs executive director has warned. John Roskam, the head of the influential libertarian thinktank, rejected the proposal put forward by the Referendum Council at a meeting of more than 250 community leaders at Uluru, labelling it an attempt to “enshrine racial division in the constitution”. Conservative Coalition MPs including Craig Kelly and George Christensen have lined up to criticise the proposal, but it was supported by MP Julian Leeser, suggesting the issue will be highly divisive in the party room. In a statement on Friday the Uluru conference said Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were the sovereign first peoples of Australia and a significant practical change was needed, not a symbolic reform. In addition to the proposed Indigenous voice in parliament, it called for a commission that would lead to a treaty. In 2015 the IPA campaigned against constitutional recognition, arguing instead that all references to race should be removed from the constitution to assert the principle of equality. On Monday Roskam told Guardian Australia parliament represented all Australians and the suggestion of a separate Indigenous voice was “just as offensive as to give people a special say due to their religion, or gender or anything else”. “In reality, all policy decisions are Indigenous policy decisions, because Indigenous Australians are Australians.” Roskam said that the “moral force [of the Indigenous body] would be very significant, in effect making it difficult to override it”, describing it as an “effective veto” on matters of policy such as the Northern Territory intervention. On the proposed treaty, Roskam argued it was impossible for the crown – representing all Australians – to make an agreement with a subset of Australians, the Indigenous nations. “The idea of a treaty is radical identity politics. In any case a country cannot have a treaty with itself.” He said the point of the 1967 referendum, in which Australia resolved to count Indigenous people in the census, was “to make us all the same” but the recognition proposal would do the opposite. “All parties should focus on what unites Australians and brings us together. These proposals are unlikely to ever be accepted by the majority of the Liberal party.” The IPA is highly influential in the Coalition, leading campaigns against superannuation reform that resulted in major changes to the government’s election policy and forcing reform of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act back on to the agenda. On Monday Ken Wyatt, the commonwealth’s first Indigenous minister, told ABC AM he was “extremely confident” the Uluru talks would lead to a referendum on recognition next year. Wyatt said scare campaigns had the potential to derail the process and advocated an awareness program “that informs all Australians of the intent behind the set of words – what it means – and that it’s not in enshrining special privileges”. “But it is in fact recognising the reality that Aboriginal and Torres Islander people lived on this continent long before settlement, and that Australia’s history should be reflected in that statement within the constitution.” Leeser, a Sydney Liberal MP and constitutional conservative, welcomed the Indigenous delegates’ strong rejection of earlier proposals for purely symbolic recognition or anti-discrimination reforms which he characterised as a “one-clause bill of rights.” Leeser said the government should consider a representative body if it did not have voting rights or a right of veto. He said the Liberal party traditionally had been opposed to a treaty but a “settlement” could be contemplated. The conservative Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly said the Indigenous body in parliament would be “very divisive in the community” and many in the Coalition party room would be “very reluctant” to pursue the full recommendations agreed at Uluru. He said there were now a number of Indigenous MPs and they were a strong voice for their community. Influential backbench MP George Christensen told Sky News it was “dangerous” to give “one group special privileges that no other group in the country has”. Christensen said he would vote against the proposal in both the lower house and in any referendum, saying recognition was “segregating us”. He said the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which was abolished by the Howard government, was “a demonstrable failure ... [that] elevated one section of our society to a special basis where there were special policies in place for them”. Christensen said that government should work for practical outcomes for Indigenous Australians, such as jobs, health and education rather than the “academic, elitist” issue of recognition. Cape York Institute senior policy adviser, Shireen Morris, said the proposal was not about dividing Australians but “creating a fairer relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Australian government”. Morris said parliament “already makes Indigenous-specific laws” and could do so without the race power, as it had done for the Northern Territory intervention. “All this proposal says is: of course Indigenous should have a fair say and a fair voice in policies that affect them.” Morris said the objection to the crown making a treaty “with itself” were philosophical but in practice the government enters agreements all the time, including native title agreements.

If the MCU brand of action screenwriting leaves a little to be desired, however, the films have provided viewers with an increasingly daring palette of production and costume design, the likes of which have not been seen since Hollywood’s golden age of screen fantasy (and which makes hapless competitor DC’s dreary movies look like they’ve been created by a photocopier in dire need of a toner top-up). With the latest of those films, the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok, filmed on the Gold Coast, it’s fitting that the largest ever exhibition of Marvel cinematic ephemera should open this weekend at Brisbane’s Gallery of Modern Art. Marvel: Creating The Cinematic Universe, which comprises more than 500 costumes, props, and concept and keyframe artworks, is presented on a lavish scale befitting the scope of the MCU. An entire side of the gallery had to be removed to bring in the bewildering Asgardian throne room set from Thor: Ragnarok. Arranged in three thematic “chapters”, the exhibition explores the journey from comic book pages, via extensive pre-production development and a mind-boggling amount of post-production tinkering, to the screen. Australian Cinematheque associate curator Amanda Slack-Smith has thoughtfully curated the exhibition in such a way that recognises the commercial stature of the franchises but focuses more keenly on the work of the designers and artists involved in their creation. There are only occasional glimpses of the stars themselves, in film excerpts or keyframe art, which allows the costumes, props and sets to speak for themselves. It might be “about” Marvel blockbusters, but this is an art and design exhibition first and foremost, and those with an interest in costume design will be particularly rewarded. The up-close access to the many screen used costumes is a delight, particularly those dreamed up by Alexandra Byrne for Thor (2011), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Doctor Strange (2016); Frigga and Odin’s ceremonial garb from Thor could have walked right off the Met Ball red carpet. The detail of the costumes is also a sly rebuttal to the common criticism that MCU films are “nothing but CGI”. Though the average gallery-goer will not share my enthusiasm for discovering that the “lace” that hems Lady Sif’s battle skirt from Thor: The Dark World is in fact fine chain maille, the exhibition is a dream come true for local cosplayers. The accompanying didactic panels helpfully list the materials used in the costumes’ creation, which will likely clear up many long-running arguments about whether, say, a poly-cotton blend is worthy of he who wields Mjölnir. There’s a heavy focus on Captain America and Iron Man, and my interest in the latter has worn thin enough that I moved quickly through the entire second “chapter” on the three films devoted to him, but there is plenty here to delight even those who have cooled on “Cap” and Tony. The Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy films emerge as the most visually creative, from a beautiful maquette of Groot (complete with moss and twigs for light references) and The Collector’s demented deep-space Euro-trash costume, to the psychedelic swords and Hulk’s bedroom created for Thor: Ragnarok. In the latter’s case, that’s thanks to the enduring influence of Jack Kirby, as director Taika Waititi notes in his introduction for the accompanying exhibition publication. The spirit of Kirby is present throughout the exhibition. The legendary artist – who revitalised Stan Lee’s struggling imprint in the 1960s and created and co-created innumerable Marvel characters, from Ant-Man to Zuras – became a crusader for creators’ rights when his requests for intellectual property and copyright acknowledgement were met with increasing hostility from the company. That Marvel made billions from his work while, after his death in 1994, his estate fought for recognition of his intellectual property (they eventually settled in 2014) is bittersweet. Given Kirby’s fraught history with Marvel, it’s heartening that the exhibition begins with a panel from Amazing Fantasy #15: Spider-Man’s debut (Kirby pencilled Spidey’s first appearance, handing it over to Steve Ditko to redraw), a nod to the key role he played in the invention of the Marvel pantheon that populates today’s multiplexes. It’s especially moving to hear the artists and designers speak in awed tones about Kirby’s visionary work. Thor: Ragnarok, in particular, draws heavily upon Kirby’s wild, colourful imagery, something production designer Dan Hennah and conceptual design director Ra Vincent are at pains to communicate in behind-the-scenes interviews. The as-yet-unreleased sequel looks set to be the most visually exciting Marvel film yet, if the props and set pieces on display here are any indication. Whatever comic creator and mystical curmudgeon Alan Moore might think about the reign of comic book movies, there can be no denying the MCU’s impact on the pop cultural realm. Marvel: Creating the Cinematic Universe could be read as an attempt to portray the MCU’s megalithic presence as more cinematically innovative than culturally reductive, but as a tribute to the transportive power of costume and production design, the exhibition soars."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/29/schapelle-corby-and-cassie-sainsbury-are-being-punished-for-their-looks","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T07:03:12Z","webTitle":"Schapelle Corby and Cassie Sainsbury: it's not about drugs, it's about misogyny | Van Badham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/29/schapelle-corby-and-cassie-sainsbury-are-being-punished-for-their-looks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/may/29/schapelle-corby-and-cassie-sainsbury-are-being-punished-for-their-looks","fields":{"headline":"Schapelle Corby and Cassie Sainsbury: it's not about drugs, it's about misogyny","bodyText":"Scientists agree that the human brain is still in development well into its 20s, and the poor judgment of young people has a biological basis. Yet there’s a cruel streak of social piety that viciously condemns the young for making decisions as badly as young people do. I’ve often thought it’s informed by resentment at what’s perceived by the older, the burdened and the compromised to be the broader opportunities available to those young enough to remain largely uncommitted. This was, at least, my working theory last week, at the time 60 Minutes decided to feed on Cassandra Sainsbury. She’s the 22-year-old arrested in Colombia, facing charges for allegedly trying to smuggle 5.8kg of cocaine out of Bogotá in boxes of headphones. 60 Minutes didn’t use its platform to remind viewers that the more you isolate young people from the wisdom of altruistic elders, the worse their decisions become. The program instead went for a bloodthirsty personal attack on Sainsbury, parading around unreliable sources as well dangerous, demonising stereotypes associating sex workers with criminals. It won its ratings time slot – good for 60 Minutes, if not for Sainsbury, sex workers, young people or anyone else watching the program. Turns out I vastly underestimated tabloid-TV relish for viciousness when I was tut-tutting the cruel sensationalism of 60 Minutes last week. The convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has returned to Australia, having served jail time and supervised release in Indonesia after 4.2kg of cannabis was found plastic-wrapped in her her bodyboard bag back in 2004, when she was 27. The media’s furious pursuit of Corby has demanded military-grade security, double-booked flights and even one reporter giving live updates – I am not joking, this actually happened – while harnessed into the back of a ute, tailing Corby as she went to meet her parole officers. As Australians, we should know by now there’s a national standard for anything going too far, and that’s Karl Stefanovic staging an intervention. We are indeed in a very dangerous new media realm when 60 Minutes tactics seem subtle in comparison. Watching the treatment of Sainsbury that escalated so quickly for Corby, I’m forced to conclude it’s not mere envy of youth that drives these stories. Whatever the outcome of her sentence, in public terms it’s Corby’s tragedy that she remained so photogenic throughout her incarceration. One struggles, beyond the tragic Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, to remember the names of the rest of the Bali Nine – the eldest of whom was only 29 at the time of their arrest, the youngest barely 18. A gross awareness is unavoidable that in both Sainsbury and Corby’s cases, someone’s decided that these young women are sexy in a way that mass markets understand, and both should now be appropriately crucified for it. How else to explain sex worker allegation – other than it’s got the word “sex” in it. Would she be the subject of a 60 Minutes “special investigation” if she looked like the author of this article? As it turns out, a study at the University of Maryland determined as long ago as 1975 that people meted out out harsher punishments to women perceived to be trading on their looks – like, perhaps, charming their way through airport security – to get away with crime. The impossible, oft-repeated advice that women should “be sexy, but no too sexy” rings in the ears like an alarm when presented with media narratives of young women at the mercy of their own poor decisions. Centuries of mythology from the Greeks to the Christian bible and Qur’an insist that beautiful women are a trick to lure men to ruination, and you don’t need to go as far as an MRA Reddit thread to understand how deeply these myths maintain their psychocultural hold on so many. How satisfying it must be to watch personal disaster brought upon something you have been culturally convinced to believe will wreak disaster on you. A ratings winner. How convenient, too, to focus on ancient tropes of woman-hating, and women as agents of something nefarious, rather than confront the scale of nefariousness in which so many Australians are complicit and in which these women are pawns. Because while we fixate on Corby or Sainsbury, we’re not teasing out the details of how cannabis can be both illegal and yet so normalised there’s a market of Australians who’ll risk the jail time of others to enjoy it on holiday. We’re not examining the Australian appetite for an exotic, pricey product like cocaine – so valuable and in demand that mules risk double-decade prison sentences to deliver it. Tabloid television isn’t pursuing a special investigation of culpability of current recreational drug users – or the complicity of tough-on-drugs, prohibitionist laws that criminalise those who serve the supply of others’ kicking back, out-of-hours good time. Australia now has the highest rate of recreational drug use in the world, with 40% of Australians admitting to use of illicit drugs. Within the prime-time audiences feasting on the misadventures of Sainsbury and Corby are large cohorts likely to have sampled their other wares. These statistically significant propositions, of course, apply to those producing the news coverage as well. So let’s make sure we don’t kid ourselves that any of this sensationalism results from popular repulsion against reefer madness, or pious judgments towards wicked cocaine. It’s those who can get away with their own sins and errors, punishing the women who can’t. It’s young women in trouble, far from home and in jail, while wiser adults will indulge their pleasures, tangible and vicarious, with much safer calculations of the risks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/31/inquest-into-davey-brownes-death-raises-serious-questions-for-boxing-in-nsw","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-30T22:34:02Z","webTitle":"Inquest into Davey Browne's death raises serious questions for boxing in NSW","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/31/inquest-into-davey-brownes-death-raises-serious-questions-for-boxing-in-nsw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/31/inquest-into-davey-brownes-death-raises-serious-questions-for-boxing-in-nsw","fields":{"headline":"Inquest into Davey Browne's death raises serious questions for boxing in NSW","bodyText":"A coronial inquest into the death of a New South Wales boxer has raised serious questions about duty of care, regulatory effectiveness and athlete safety in the sport. Davey Browne Jr, 28, was winning on points when he was knocked out by Filipino Carlo Magali in the 12th round of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) Pan Pacific super featherweight title fight on 11 September 2015. He died three days later from an acute subdural haematoma, or severe bleeding on the brain. A neurosurgeon, Brian Owler, who reviewed footage of the fight told the inquest it was “very likely” Browne was suffering from concussion before he was knocked out. Five people had the authority to intervene in the match that night at Ingleburn RSL, in western Sydney, but none of those questioned during the inquest about their ability to recognise the signs and symptoms of concussion said they had received specific training in the matter as part of their official roles in the sport. The ringside doctor told the inquest that though he had been medically trained, it was about 30 years ago. Much of the week-long inquest focused on questions over whether the fight should have been stopped and the duty of the ringside doctor or other officials to intervene. It also highlighted systemic confusion about the sport’s rules, and a lack of mandatory training for ringside doctors, coaches and Combat Sports Authority-appointed inspectors in how to recognise serious head injuries, and how to confidently and effectively intervene to stop a fight. CCTV footage from the night shows Browne wobbling and unsteady on his feet after a knockdown and a subsequent series of hard blows in the 11th round. Browne’s wife, Amy Lavelle, and his mother-in-law Heather Lavelle – an intensive care nurse who attended to Browne after the knockout – who both witnessed the event, said Browne did not seem himself during this part of the fight, with Amy Lavelle describing a “sinking feeling” in that round. Browne’s trainer, Todd Makelim, and cornermen Tommy Browne and Glen Smith also told the deputy state coroner Teresa O’Sullivan that they believed Browne had sustained a significant injury to his hand in the earlier rounds of the fight, but did not bring it to the attention of the doctor, referee or the combat sports inspectors present. Owler, a clinical neurosurgeon at Westmead hospital, told the coroner’s court that he believed, on the basis of the footage, that Browne sustained a concussion in round 11, due to his unsteady and wide gait, and a “paucity of movements” before the knockout in round 12. But Dr Lawrence Noonan, who had been the ringside doctor on that night, told the inquest that he had been reluctant to move from his seat during the fight due to the speed at which it was moving, and he believed Browne was “fit enough to give it a go”, despite not performing any medical assessments on Browne during the fight itself. When asked why fights had ringside doctors in attendance, Noonan said it was “an historical position” that he believed had only been defined by the Combat Sports Authority in the last three years, and that he could not recall “any specific rules that govern the requirements, responsibilities or performance of a medical practitioner”.Referee Charlie Lucas was asked whether he ought to have applied a discretionary standing eight count to Browne in round 11, when the boxer fell back against the ropes but did not fall over just as the bell rang to end the round. “It was a split second decision that I had to make,” Lucas said. He also said he believed Browne to be “recovering sufficiently” between rounds 11 and 12. A standing eight count is controversial in professional fights, as it qualifies as a knockdown and affects the boxers’ scorecards accordingly, the inquest heard. Referee Lucas said that due to its discretionary nature, the standing eight count can be seen to advantage one fighter over another. It appears in some boxing associations’ rules and not others and is not used in all fights. But counsel assisting the coroner Kristina Stern, SC, highlighted the possibility that participants of boxing contests could be confused about which rules applied in any contest, including to the contest on 11 September 2015, due to the variety of rules. While the IBF had sanctioned the fight, the NSW Office of Sport identified that the rules of the professional boxing association, the Australian National Boxing Federation (ANBF), applied due to it being a regional fight and not a world title. The inquest was told the ANBF’s website states its rules do not apply in NSW, and a representative from the ANBF said the Combat Sports Authority (CSA) rules were in force that night. In evidence, referee Charlie Lucas said he had believed CSA rules to apply during the fight, but was later informed that ANBF rules applied. Anne Gripper, the executive director of sport and recreation at the NSW Office of Sport, said on Thursday in evidence to the inquest that the combat sports rules were never intended to replace the rules of all combat sports but rather to “raise standards where required and fill in gaps where required”. Stern, however, queried whether the plethora of rules and the discrepancies between them argued in favour of having a single set of rules to govern boxing in NSW. Neither of the combat sports inspectors on duty that evening intervened to stop the fight. Round 11 was also shown to have gone over time, and during those extra seconds, Browne received further heavy blows. In the break between round 11 and 12, Browne’s corner recognised that their fighter was impaired to the extent that they engaged in a number of stall tactics, including pouring water onto the canvas and loosening tape on Browne’s glove, which would have required additional time between rounds to rectify. However, Browne’s brother Tommy, who was in his corner that night along with trainer Todd Makelim, also said that they were “pretty caught up” in the fight, and that the “panic” they felt was more about how to get Davey through the final round. “There was one round to go, it was a title fight … we didn’t really think too much about how he was feeling,” Tommy Browne told the inquiry. Browne was an exceptional boxer, trained by his father in the sport from the age of nine or 10, and had a professional record of 22 wins, one loss and one draw. The event in September 2015 was organised primarily by his father and brother, and, had he won, would have significantly advanced Browne’s opportunities in the sport. Browne’s father, David Browne Sr, told the coroner: “The referee should definitely have stopped the fight.” Speaking of the relationship between the cornermen, the referee, the doctor and the timekeeper, Browne Sr said: “If they all were paying a little bit more attention to what their duties were, we certainly wouldn’t be sitting here today talking of Davey.” In his statement, he described Davey as “a really good kid and my best friend”. “There was plenty of opportunity to see how bad he was,” Lavelle said. “There was just sign after sign that he wasn’t in a good state and none of it got acted on or acknowledged.” Browne and Lavelle have two young sons, Rocklyn and Flynn. In a heartfelt and moving statement at the close of the inquest, Lavelle told the court about how difficult she and her young family had found Browne’s loss, and how betrayed she felt by the officials who had been at that fight. “David was a great role model and ambassador for such a brutal sport, anyone close to him would agree that he had a heart of gold,” Lavelle said. “The very sport he dedicated so much of himself to turned its back on him and left him for dead.” In her submission to the coroner, Stern called for recommendations around the clarification of the rules, including consideration of a single set of rules for boxing in NSW, along with further training for referees, trainers, and doctors about their roles and duties in boxing contests. The coroner will hand down her findings on 22 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2017/jun/02/australia-look-to-exorcise-demons-of-four-years-ago-with-champions-trophy-win","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-01T20:00:04Z","webTitle":"Australia look to exorcise demons of four years ago with Champions Trophy win | Geoff Lemon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/02/australia-look-to-exorcise-demons-of-four-years-ago-with-champions-trophy-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/jun/02/australia-look-to-exorcise-demons-of-four-years-ago-with-champions-trophy-win","fields":{"headline":"Australia look to exorcise demons of four years ago with Champions Trophy win","bodyText":"Whatever happens in this year’s Champions Trophy, the Australian one-day team is doomed to a double existence. The current robust industrial dispute between administrators and players is as much about the philosophy of employment as the terms, but either way it will be seen to spill into the playing arena. Any underperformance will be blamed on distraction by political conflict, while any brilliant innings or bag of wickets will be taken as a symbol of defiance, a marker laid down about the worth of players. Sure, the stakes are substantial: this 50-over tournament between the game’s top eight teams begins on the first day of June, and by the last day of that month Australia’s elite international and domestic cricketers could be out of contract and effectively forced to strike. At issue is Cricket Australia’s demand to restructure their pay model. But realistically once the tournament begins Australia’s cricketers will slot into the mode they most naturally occupy, trying to win a series, and the only difference will be the subject of the questions they’re asked in the post-match press conference. As far as parallel stories go, there’s also the one comparing the current day to one quadrennial cycle ago. Where the 2013 Australians went to India to be humiliated across four Tests, today’s lot fought across the same number of games to a creditable last-gasp defeat. Those 2013 Australians went on to be a shambles at a Champions Trophy in England: David Warner threw a fist of drunken knuckles at Joe Root, a nobody named Adam Voges who’d never worn a baggy green glued the struggling batting together, and the team was knocked from the tournament at the group stages. This year Warner is a teetotal spiritualist, Voges has immovably rolled out a banana lounge on the Test average list next to Bradman, and it’s hard to see Australia going gently into any kind of night. A win here could consolidate the exorcism of that failed era. There is also a sense of unfinished business: Australia might have won the World Cup five times, but the Champions Trophy only twice. Which to be fair is a bit like Manchester United lamenting that they haven’t won enough Europa Leagues, but it’s still a record that most involved would feel better for correcting. Where the 50-over format can be an endless bat-fest, what excites about Australia is the bowling. For the first time we could see a line-up of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Patrick Cummins and James Pattinson, all operating at over 140 kilometres per hour, three of them potentially above 150. The first two are at the peak of their powers in all forms, the latter pair remain on injury comebacks, but if this gets them all clicking then cricket could be in for an extraordinary couple of years. Starc is the central star: left-arm devastating, hitting his first hundred ODI wickets last year from fewer games than any bowler in history. He takes half his wickets by hitting the stumps or the pads, and has a by-now unnerving knack of getting one in the first over of a game. He’s too fast, too accurate, and in a game where batsmen have to manufacture scoring shots, swings the ball too much. Starc’s preferred partner at the crease is Hazlewood, coming off a monster of a home summer. His accuracy is second to none, and experience should have him better able to harness it than on the 2015 Ashes tour, where he said English pitches had him thinking of miracle balls ahead of discipline. His strength relies on restriction: he has gone for under four runs per over in 10 of his 34 ODI innings, and has only gone above five runs per over in 13 of them. Cummins brings pure pace, as seen in his bouncer attack on a placid Ranchi pitch during his comeback Test in March, while also having the tricks learned during the long years when Twenty20 cricket was all his body could stand. Pattinson has speed and swing when his own corporeal assembly contrives to support them. Three of these four bowlers have a well documented ability to smash long balls with the bat, while Hazlewood is at least famous for sticking scorelessly around during long partnerships. Very useful batting too comes from John Hastings, the forgotten extra, a man Kevin Pietersen once nominated as the best death bowler he’d seen. Parsimonious with his late-innings yorkers and mid-innings ability to slow scoring on most surfaces, Hastings is back to the place where he kicked off his surprise international career in 2015, grabbed out of Durham’s county side when the touring Australians needed reinforcements. He may struggle for a spot, but won’t let anyone down if given one. Then there’s Adam Zampa, who bowls crooked and talks straight, firing down leg-breaks in between political arguments online. He was another surprise inclusion who has greatly impressed during his 18 months in the side: while he doesn’t turn the ball prodigiously, his speed variations and accuracy make him had to read. The resulting ability to undo players who try to attack him is what makes him such an effective force. Australia is not short of batting power: Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Finch and Chris Lynn could be New Year’s Eve as far as fireworks go, while Travis Head has done everything asked of him in a young career, Marcus Stoinis played one of the all- time great ODI knocks in his second game in Auckland a couple of months ago, Warner has made six ODI hundreds in his last 11 starts, and Steve Smith in India affirmed his current status as the best batsman in the world. But, as with Cinderella, the ball is where all will be lost or won. There is a likelihood of at least some bowler-friendly conditions in between the flat tracks of current style. England, bear in mind, just collapsed to 20 for 6 at Lord’s in a pre-tournament game against South Africa. Australia’s components together should be enough to undo even the most daunting batting line-ups. Unless, of course, they’re distracted. But with a once-in- a-generation fast bowling attack coming together after so long, why would you spend match day thinking about anything else?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/may/29/fernando-alonso-indianapolis-500-debut-mclaren-honda","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T09:00:21Z","webTitle":"Fernando Alonso's Indy 500 debut was superb but his engine let him down again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/may/29/fernando-alonso-indianapolis-500-debut-mclaren-honda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/may/29/fernando-alonso-indianapolis-500-debut-mclaren-honda","fields":{"headline":"Fernando Alonso's Indy 500 debut was superb but his engine let him down again","bodyText":"More than a few questioned Fernando Alonso’s decision to skip the Monaco Grand Prix for the Indianapolis 500 when the double Formula One champion announced plans to try for the second leg of motor sport’s triple crown last month. But when that day finally came on Sunday, it was clear that he had made the right choice – even after finishing 24th in a race won by Japan’s Takuma Sato. “If we put aside the last 20 laps, which were a massive disappointment,” said McLaren-Honda team boss Zak Brown, “if we reflect back on the past month, it was outstanding. Fernando didn’t put a wheel wrong. [He] showed what a world class world champion he is today.” Really, Alonso’s decision was validated well before the green flag flew at the Brickyard, in the day’s Monaco results— another scoreless disappointment for McLaren-Honda. Not even the return of Jenson Button, who was coaxed out of retirement to substitute in for Alonso, could spare the team a familiar fate. “I didn’t miss Monaco,” Alonso told reporters after his drive on Sunday. There was no reason to. Early on, Alonso’s Andretti Autosport car seemed to provide the escape from his Formula One woes that he had hoped. After starting on the second row, in fifth, and dropping to ninth in a fuel mapping miscommunication, Alonso charged past 2016 race winner Alexander Rossi for the lead. He passed cars at will, from any line on the track he chose, and executed with precision in the pits. Overall he led 27 laps, the third most of any driver on Sunday afternoon. “It was nice to have this competitive feeling, even leading the Indy 500, you know,” Alonso said. “I was passing, watching the tower, saw the 29 [his car’s number] on top of it. I was thinking at that moment if Zak or someone from the team was taking a picture because I want that picture at home.” Alonso also caught his share of luck on an afternoon that saw almost a third of the pack crash out of contention. By far the most frightening incident happened on lap 53, when British driver Jay Howard bounced off the turn two barrier and down into the nosecone of pole sitter Scott Dixon. His car pirouetted through the air, bounced side-first off the opposite barrier and punched a massive hole in the inside safety fencing; the breathless affair halted the race for 19 minutes. (Amazingly, both drivers walked away from the crash unharmed.) Three more pile-ups followed, the last involving five cars. Michael Andretti, Alonso’s team owner, had no explanation for the rash of impacts other than hard, intense racing. Few challengers could match Alonso’s aggressiveness. Through lap 130, he seemed for all the world like the upset favorite. But then that momentum was undercut when his team-mate Ryan Hunter-Reay blew an engine and forced a pair of restarts that dropped Alonso as far down as 10th. Then as he charged back to the front, Alonso saw his own engine give out. His afternoon done, Alonso climbed out of his car and slipped off his racing gloves — a sight all too familiar to regular Formula One watchers. (And perhaps a moment foretold a week earlier, when his engine was sending out smoke signals after qualifying). But instead of the usual grumbling, Alonso was greeted with cheers and high-fives. He spent the rest of the race rooting for Sato, his Andretti team-mate and former F1 cohort. “We’ve been sharing the last two weeks all the meetings in the morning, the meetings in the afternoon,” he said of his Andretti routine. “Takuma was a lot of help, coming from F1. The last two laps I was on my knees really pushing for Sato. I was extremely happy for the final result.” What’s more, Alonso’s effort brought its own sense of satisfaction, to say nothing of a mark to improve upon. Just before adjourning his post-race news conference, he raised a carton of milk to the reporters who have dutifully chronicled his exploits over the last two weeks, riffing on Indy’s time worn Victory Circle tradition. “I didn’t win,” he joked. “But I will drink a little milk.” Doubtless his thirst won’t be truly quenched until he conquers this place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/may/29/the-snap-may-corbyn-jeremy-paxman-separately","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T05:35:16Z","webTitle":"The Snap: May and Corbyn take on Jeremy Paxman – separately","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/29/the-snap-may-corbyn-jeremy-paxman-separately","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/may/29/the-snap-may-corbyn-jeremy-paxman-separately","fields":{"headline":"The Snap: May and Corbyn take on Jeremy Paxman – separately","bodyText":"What’s happening? It’s a bank holiday across the UK today, in a week where politics will begin to look more like normal in the wake of last Monday’s terror attack in Manchester. More like normal because the personal attacks have resumed. But an uncomfortable new normal, where the point-scoring happens against a background that really, pressingly matters. So expect more to follow from Sunday’s spats over security. Jeremy Corbyn faces fresh pressure after reports that, in October 2014, less than a year before he became Labour leader, he attended a ceremony to honour Palestinians killed by Israeli forces, including Atef Bseiso, a terrorist believed to have planned the 1972 Munich massacre. Meanwhile, Diane Abbott – who writes today in the Guardian about what she describes as government failures on security – claimed she had left her 1980s views on the Northern Ireland conflict behind with her then afro: The hairstyle has gone and some of the views have gone. We have all moved on. Labour, and others, will be keen to move on today, with the Times reporting that temporary exclusion orders, a legal power introduced in 2015 to prevent British extremists who leave to fight with Isis from returning to the UK, have been employed just once. Home secretary Amber Rudd insisted on Sunday: “We have started to use them.” She did not give numbers. Today also sees the Conservatives attempting a reboot of their campaign: with less than a fortnight to go, they’d prefer to be talking about leadership and Brexit. The Liberal Democrats would, too, with Tim Farron telling the Guardian that putting the pro-EU case at the heart of his party’s campaign had been “the right thing to do”, even if the electorate comes round to the idea only after 9 June. What won’t be happening on 9 June, though, says Farron, is coalition talks: No deals, no pacts with anyone … We think people should know when they vote Lib Dem that they are not doing it as a proxy for anybody else. Will that stop the Conservatives creaking out the “coalition of chaos” line again? (Pause here for an arched eyebrow.) Nicola Sturgeon told Andrew Neil in a BBC interview on Sunday night that the SNP would seek to be part of a progressive, anti-Tory alliance in the event of a hung parliament. But with a fairly hefty caveat: The reality of this election, even with a narrowing of the polls, is that we’re going to face a Tory government. What we won’t hear in the Conservative reboot is what that absolutely-not-made-up-at-the-last-minute cap on social care costs will be. After Theresa May very definitely did not u-turn after the “dementia tax” backlash, insisting “nothing has changed”, the key detail of where the cap will be set won’t be ascertained until after 8 June, even though they really, truly had thought about it before publishing the manifesto, which didn’t mention it. Expect the question to pop up this evening, when the two candidates for PM are interviewed, first by a studio audience, then by Jeremy Paxman, for Sky News and Channel 4. Separately, of course: May has refused to debate the Labour leader head-to-head, for reasons they also can’t tell us about. At a glance: Tories pledge new law over domestic violence directed at children. Somerset: where fed-up farmers are ditching the Tories. Zoe Williams: Never has British politics felt so wild and unpredictable. Merkel: EU cannot completely rely on US and Britain any more. BBC: Tories accused of ‘sleight of hand’ on grammar schools data. Poll position A slew of Sunday polls confirms precisely what any partisan wants to hear and also the opposite. An Observer/Opinium poll pares the Tory lead from 13 points to 10 since last week; YouGov for the Sunday Times squeezes it to seven points (43% v 36%); a Sunday Telegraph/ORB poll puts it at just six (44% v 38%). Alternatively, ICM for the Sun propels the Conservatives back to a 14-point lead (46% v 32%); and Comres puts it at 12 (46% v 34%), though that’s a drop from 18 a fortnight earlier. For what this all might mean, keep reading … Diary Jeremy Corbyn is still in Scotland this morning, along with the bulk of the reassuringly regular political action: Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie hunkers into a DeLorean in South Queensferry; Scottish Labour’s sole incumbent, Ian Murray, paints pottery in Edinburgh; Nicola Sturgeon and Angus Robertson take tea in Lossiemouth; and the Scottish Greens show off their delayed manifesto at 10.30am in Glasgow. At the same time in London, the UK Green party launches its disability manifesto. At lunchtime, a protest against fox hunting wends its way from Cavendish Square to Downing Street. But it’s a night in front of the telly (and the live blog) for the main action: Tim and Rosie Farron on the One Show sofa on BBC1 at 7pm; Paul Nuttall gets the Andrew Neil treatment straight after that; then it’s over to Sky News and Channel 4 for their Jeremy Corbyn v Theresa May non-showdown, mediated by Faisal Islam and Jeremy Paxman. That’s from 8.30pm. Read these Matt Singh, in the Financial Times, assesses why those polls are forking so wildly: It is obvious that understanding the intentions of voters requires an understanding of who those voters are. What is less obvious is that most people are not reliable predictors of their own probability of making it to the polls … Polls, including YouGov, that show narrower Conservative leads are those that assign probabilities of voting based wholly or primarily on a respondent’s self-reported likelihood of casting a ballot, meaning that young people make up a far bigger proportion of the likely vote than they have historically. Those showing wider Conservative leads, such as ComRes and ICM, model turnout based on historical figures for demographic groups. This would have improved accuracy in most previous elections, but risks coming unstuck if behaviour changes markedly. In the Scotsman, Dani Garavelli visits East Dunbartonshire, where Lib Dem Jo Swinson is hoping to win back the seat she lost to the SNP’s John Nicolson in the 2015 wipeout: Two years on, she hopes her pro-UK, pro-European stance will go down well in a constituency where 61% of voters opted to stay in the UK and 71% to stay in the EU. She is urging former supporters to return to the fold and overturn Nicolson’s 2,167 majority… Old friends Jan Galloway and Celia Clegg, who voted to leave the EU, are united in their opposition to the SNP and a second indyref, but have chosen different ways of expressing it. Galloway, who likes Theresa May, will probably vote for Swinson, because she works hard for the constituency and has a better chance of winning, while Clegg, who likes Ruth Davidson, will put her cross beside Tory candidate Sheila Mechan. ‘It might be a lost vote,’ she concedes, ‘but you have to go with your heart as well as your head.’ Revelation of the day The two sides in this evening’s TV showdown couldn’t decide in which order May and Corbyn should face Paxman, so the issue was decided by a coin toss “at a neutral territory”. I am not making this up. But the momentum was with Corbyn and he’ll go in to bat first. To further avoid cross-party contamination, the two leaders will have separate green rooms and aren’t expected to cross paths on their way to and from the interrogation chair.

Perhaps it is because of the latest round of redundancies at News Corp and Fairfax here in Australia. Whatever the reason, the debate about what’s happening to journalism has broken out of the newsroom and entered the broader civic conversation. We have an Australian Senate inquiry into public interest journalism. The prevalence of “fake news” has highlighted the importance of its opposite – what good journalists do. But does journalism really matter? Do we really need to worry that journalists are losing their jobs, or will society simply adjust the way in which it satisfies its information needs? The importance of journalism in democracy is asserted as a truism by journalists, media proprietors and politicians. Yet empirical evidence on how journalism affects the operations of democracy, and civic society more generally, is thin. For the past two years a research project based at the centre for advancing journalism at the University of Melbourne has been trying to build that evidence. We have been finding out how and why journalism matters – and the implications of a decline in society’s journalism capacity. Our work has taken us to Moree, on the black soil plains of New South Wales, to look at how remote and regional communities understand themselves through media – and how that is changing. We have been to Broadmeadows, a disadvantaged suburb on the outskirts of Melbourne, and to Newcastle, where the investigative work of Joanne McCarthy was a decisive factor in then prime minister Julia Gillard’s decision to appoint the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. We have examined the undervalued, non-glamorous work of court reporting, and its relationship to justice. We have interviewed dozens of journalists, judges, police officers, civic leaders and community members, and pored over circulation and reach figures. As a result, we can say a few things about how and why journalism matters, and how this is changing. It’s not hard to understand why assessing the impact of journalism is complicated and hard. As one of our research team likes to remind us, not everything important can be measured. Journalism is really a number of different kinds of activity, and it is nearly always operating in a complex web of causation. It’s not often that a clear line can be drawn between a particular news report and a social outcome. There are always other factors to consider. Attempts to measure impact, largely conducted by journalists and media outlets, have foundered on these difficulties. It is possible to measure how many people saw a piece of news content, but this is not all we mean by impact. If the item is a piece of light entertainment, quickly forgotten, then the fact that it was seen by many hardly matters. On the other hand, a long-form piece of investigative journalism might be read by very few people, but if they have the power to make decisions and changes, then the impact may be very great – for example, a royal commission. There isn’t room here to describe everything about our methodology, but after much thought and talk, we defined three different kinds of impact. Relational – how other institutions such as governments, NGOs and businesses respond to journalism. Engagement – action taken by individuals as a result of journalism – assessed on a sliding scale from sharing or discussing with others through to protest, letter writing and campaigning Reach – both raw audience numbers, and the different groups within the audience, from general public through to leaders and the powerful. With this in mind, we examined five different kinds of journalistic activity: investigative, campaigning, journalism that reports on public institutions such as courts and parliaments and local councils, reportage and commentary and opinion. Finally, we chose sites and types of journalistic activity for our case studies – from the courts of Melbourne to the beaches of Byron Bay, taking in urban, city fringe and remote and rural areas. So what did we find? The evidence suggests that, so far at least, it is not investigative journalism that is most at risk. Old media has safeguarded it, and new entrants to the media game are investing in it. Rather, it is what was once called the “journal of record” functions – the continuous and non-glamorous work of covering parliaments, courts and local governments – that has been hollowed out. A matter of justice In the courts of Victoria, the reduction in the numbers and the experience levels of reporters means that some areas of law are barely covered at all. Every day thousands of magistrates make decisions that go unreported even in local media. The police worry that this has an impact on deterrence. Even here, getting precise numbers is difficult. The courts only recently began to register court reporters, and in any case sometimes reporters are in court for one case only, who come from other specialities, such as business or environment, and therefore are not on the registers. Thirty years ago, the Age had a court reporting team including two senior reporters – one each for the supreme and county court, and a team of two to three more junior reporters covering the magistrates courts. More were brought in for particular stories or when things were busy. Today the equivalent team that fluctuates in number day to day but peaks at three. The reporters run from building to building, trying to cover it all – and they are also responsible for more general crime reporting outside the courts. Journalists, lawyers and judges lamented the departure of experience. In the past few years experienced court reporters who were part of the informal community that builds up around the courts have left. These journalists used to play an informal training role for younger talent coming through. Now, that doesn’t happen, and the legal community notices the difference. We estimated that at least a combined 90 years of court reporting experience has left the profession in Melbourne in the last three years. Important civil cases are rarely reported, and criminal cases are reported by journalists who pop in and out of court, spread thin and always struggling to catch up. Increasingly these reporters depend on media specialists employed by the courts themselves – which helps, but potentially undermines their independence. The courts have stepped up, taking more trouble to provide transcripts, judgments and other information to reporters who sometimes never actually step in to the courtroom, but are obliged to file news reports in any case. Judges watch the behaviour of journalists in court closely. They take small things, such as whether a reporter understands how to enter and leave the court room, as measures of how experienced the reporters are. And because they feel that less experienced reporters may not understood the rules of court reporting, judges are more likely to issue suppression orders if they are concerned about the impact of publicity. Poor reporting, they say, has in recent times lead to more cases being aborted due to prejudicial publicity. The impact of court reporting is cumulative, and institutions of the law are responding to its decline. Take out the journalists and over time you alter the way justice operates. The impact of campaign journalism We examined campaigning journalism, taking as our examples the Herald Sun’s Take a Stand Campaign on domestic violence – part of the lead up to the Victorian royal commission on violence against women – and a much earlier example from the 1960s, the War on 1034 road-safety campaign by the Melbourne Herald, which created the political climate in which the Victorian government was able to make compulsory wearing of seatbelts and random breath tests to counter drink-driving. In both these cases, the campaigns were a crucial part of a picture that included long-term work by social activists, politicians and others – but it was when the media amplified the work and the issues involved that decisive action resulted. Then there was the investigative journalism of McCarthy of the Newcastle Herald. One of then prime minister Julia Gillard’s last actions in office was to ring McCarthy to tell her that her work had been crucial to the decision to set up a royal commission. McCarthy started with what she described as a “boring as batshit” story idea about why enrolments in Catholic schools were falling. Months of work and many interviews later, she began to publish stories that rocked the town, the church and eventually the nation. One of our interview subjects, a leathery faced survivor of sexual abuse in the Salvation Army, described what McCarthy had done. The effect, he said, was to give him a voice, to empower others to come forward, and to exert accountability on the institutions involved. “I’ve had the biggest boss from the Salvos now emailing me … This is all forced on them because the journos kept up the story. If the journos hadn’t kept up the story, he wouldn’t have given a bugger about me.” Quite. Sadly, since we did our Newcastle field work, the Newcastle Herald has lost two thirds of its staff. With them, the community has lost the skills, subtle social licence and professional understandings that allow a McCarthy to dig, interview and examine. Local news and shoe leather There are other stories of deficit. In Moree, the local newspaper the Moree Champion and the local radio stations are vital to the area. The city based media rarely reports on Moree, and when it does it is nearly always negative. Yet the radio station has only one journalist, and he has no formal training. He joined the station six years ago from the spare parts industry. There are three journalists at the Moree Champion where there used to be four only a few years ago, and six years before that, and a staff of more than 30 printers and production workers have long gone. Today, behind the front section of the newspaper’s premises stands a cavernous room, now dark and dusty and containing a single flatbed press in need of restoration. The paper is printed far away and trucked in. At the shire council it has been noticed that reporters don’t sit through the full council meetings any more, but come only when there is something on the agenda that interests them. Instead of detailed court reports of former times, the paper now publishes only a list of people convicted of offences, and the penalty. Yet asked to imagine what civic life would be like without the local media, many of the people we interviewed either found it impossible to do so, or stated that they would have no means of knowing what was going on in their community. The local media were part of the way Moree knew and defined itself. They were a source of a sense of place and identity. Local media is still as important as ever in this remote area, and new media has made little or no impact on its role. The disadvantaged outer Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows has two local newspapers, but reductions in reporters mean that they rarely leave the office – which is far away in another suburb. Broadmeadows community worker Jaime de Loma Osorio said traditional media were unable to report local news as comprehensively as they once did because of syndication and cutbacks. “Who is filling that vacuum? Nobody here. Well, that’s my perception. It would be really good to have alternative voices providing really good information.” Local reporters have become news takers rather than news makers. Community groups and even the local police were trying to fill the gap by setting up blogs and using Facebook. Some of these social media outlets have become part of the news ecology. Broadmeadows police Sergeant Ivan Petrunic sees community benefits in sharing content for crime detection and prevention. For example, the local paper published “Street Watch”, which was based on the popular news items from the police Facebook page EyeWatch. There are green shoots here. The internet allows people to use podcasts, vodcasts, forum boards, Facebook pages, and Instagram to tell their own stories. This empowers community organisations, but it is a niche activity with a limited audience. It doesn’t fill all the gaps in reporting that have resulted from the exodus of traditional local media. News releases are printed verbatim. The journalists were, once again, largely dependent on the institutions they were covering for giving them the news. While the basic news about crime can be taken from a Facebook page, there is very little traditional, independent, shoe-leather reporting in Broadmeadows. If there was a problem with the local police force, reporters stationed in an office suburbs away are unlikely to stumble across it as they might once have done if they were rubbing shoulders on the high street of the suburb they were covering. The new news ecology There are some good news stories. At the same time that the internet has undermined the business model for traditional journalism, it has also lowered the barriers to entry to the media business. In the last few years we have seen new entrants to the news media, including local versions of international brands, taking advantage of the cost efficiencies of web-only publishing. They include this outlet, Guardian Australia, the Daily Mail, HuffPost (in partnership with Fairfax), Buzzfeed and now the New York Times. But all of these have tiny editorial staff numbers, and as a result, tight specialities. None are reporting state parliaments and the courts in the old-fashioned, comprehensive fashion. On the other hand, new voices can be heard. Our research identified 150 Indigenous-controlled news sources including legacy print and broadcast media but also including a flourishing network of new and social media outlets. Some of these serve particular communities, others are issues or personality based. Together, they are breaking news and distributing original content. One of the best known, IndigenousX, has partnered with Guardian Australia. Meanwhile its founder, Luke Pearson, has recently been hired by the ABC, largely thanks to the profile he has gained on social media. This increase in voice for a neglected segment of Australian society is a shift in the ecology of news media in Australia. We continue to study what impact it might have on policy and public debates. More generally, our evidence suggests that citizen journalism will continue to be part of the mix, and is increasingly powerful and important – but it is not enough. It works best as an adjunct to professional journalism, rather than on its own. Few citizens have the skills, time and commitment to dispassionately report issues in which they are not personally invested. Hardly any have the time and dedication to report parliament, local government and the courts. Citizen journalism is largely about the commentary and opinion function of journalism, and that is important – but not enough. Without facts, opinion is hollow and commentary impotent. So what can we say in conclusion? As is so often the way with academic work, nothing simple. Journalism matters in different ways and in different contexts. It is part of the glue of our society, part of the way we define ourselves and sort ourselves out. It matters both because of the long-term cumulative effect of the activity – the presence of reporters in court and local government for example – and because of particular acts of campaigning and revelation. According to best estimates by our colleagues at the New Beats Project – a study of journalists who have been made redundant – mainstream media has lost 3,000 journalists over the last five years. This is a large and worrying change in the way our society operates. Our team believes we need to understand it better, and rapidly build the evidence base that might guide what must surely be a well-considered and determined public response. • The Civic Impact of Journalism research team is: Associate Prof Margaret Simons, Prof Helen Sullivan, Emeritus Prof Rodney Tiffen, Dr Denis Muller, Dr Andrea Carson, Jack Latimore and Jennifer Martin.

The 23-year-old, who has been followed by some of Europe’s biggest clubs this season, admitted on Sunday night that Benfica’s cup final victory over Vitoria was “probably my last game” for the club. The Brazilian, who is renowned for his footballing skills, possesses one of the longest kicks in the game – he once scored from his own box in his youth career – fits Pep Guardiola’s mould for a keeper and is expected in Manchester for a medical this week. “I still don’t know but this was probably my last game for Benfica,” he said, after the 2-1 defeat of Vitoria. Ederson’s fee would represent a world record for a goalkeeper, eclipsing the £32.6m paid by Juventus to Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001. City may have to overcome some complications with third-party ownership as his former club Rio Ave still own 50 per cent of the goalkeeper’s economic rights. Benfica possess the other half. It also means Benfica are holding out for a large transfer fee. Several outstanding displays in the Champions League this season have bolstered Ederson’s reputation. He has been called up to the Brazil squad but has not yet made his international debut. He won a Portuguese league and cup double this season and the club are expecting his departure, with the coach Rui Vitória saying: “If Ederson leaves, he leaves with the gratitude of Benfica.” City have struggled for consistency between the posts with Claudio Bravo, signed from Barcelona last summer, enduring a difficult season while Willy Caballero has left after his contract came to an end. Ederson’s arrival would cast further doubt on the prospects of England’s No1 Joe Hart, who has spent the season on loan at Torino and is expected to be sold in the summer. The signing would also represent a blow for City’s Manchester rivals United, should David de Gea make his move to Real Madrid, with José Mourinho an admirer of the goalkeeper. Mourinho has been linked with Ederson and if, as expected, De Gea departs for Spain in the coming months, he will need a new No1 at Old Trafford, although he may decide he can begin the campaign with Sergio Romero. United have also been linked with the Atlético Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak, should De Gea make his move to the Spanish capital. City have begun the post-season period ambitiously and last week completed the £43m signing of Monaco’s Bernardo Silva. Jesús Navas, Gaël Clichy and Bacary Sagna departed last week in addition to Caballero and Pablo Zabaleta, while Newcastle United have been linked with their out-of-favour centre-half Eliaquim Mangala. Rafael Benítez is reportedly keen on the defender but he will have to battle with his former club Valencia for his services. The newly promoted club are ready to pay a £15m asking price for the 26-year-old who cost the club £32m when he moved from Porto in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/28/portland-knife-attack-free-speech-rally--sunday","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T19:46:05Z","webTitle":"Portland knife attack: tension high as 'free speech rally' set for weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/28/portland-knife-attack-free-speech-rally--sunday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/28/portland-knife-attack-free-speech-rally--sunday","fields":{"headline":"Portland knife attack: tension high as 'free speech rally' set for weekend","bodyText":"The racially charged double murder that shocked Portland, Oregon, has increased tensions in a city already prey to a marked increase in political street clashes this year. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Rick Best, 53, were fatally stabbed on a city train after intervening when a suspected white supremacist began yelling “hate speech” at two women who police believe to be Muslim. Another man was injured. The accused, 35-year-old Jeremy Christian, is due to appear in court on Monday. On Sunday, after a candlelit vigil and strong words from the city’s mayor the night before, “alt-right” organizers refused to back away from a planned “free speech rally” in downtown Portland on Sunday 4 June. In turn, self-described “anti-fascist” activists committed to opposing them. Joey Gibson, a YouTube personality and self-described “libertarian” behind the Patriot Prayer group, organized a 29 April rally in the city at which Christian was filmed giving fascist salutes and yelling racial slurs, and where counter-protesters claim he approached them armed with a baseball bat. Gibson, who is promoting the “free speech” event next Sunday, told the Guardian: “We are going to continue with our rally. There is no way that we will stop. It is even more important that we come out with a strong message of love.” Gibson has organized rallies this year in Portland and just over the Columbia River in Vancouver, Washington, where he lives. Most have involved confrontational postures against antifascists, such as those made by Christian in footage from the 29 April event. Some have become violent. Alongside racist and misogynist commentary, posts on Christian’s Facebook page expressed deep animus for “antifa” activists. Gibson, however, has denied any connection with Christian, and has posted video he says shows Christian being ejected from his rally because of his bizarre behavior. “Jeremy Christian has nothing to do with us,” Gibson said. “He’s not even a Trump supporter. He showed up at our march out of nowhere. None of us knew who he was. None of us had ever seen him. Folks from antifa and liberals in Portland have used pictures of him at the rally, trying to paint the picture that we’re all white supremacists.” Gibson said he was not racist: “I believe in God, and I believe God sees us all as equal. To say someone is lower than someone else because of the color of their skin is insane to me.” Asked about his recent support for a protest against sharia law, he said: “I completely stand against sharia law because it goes against everything I believe in. Muslims are the biggest victims of sharia law. I believe in a woman’s right to be her own person. I also believe in LGBT rights, too.” Asked about the “alt-right” label, which has been applied to a range of far-rightwing groups and individuals who have risen to national prominence, he said: “What is the ‘alt-right’? I don’t really know. I’m Joey Gibson. Even with Trump, I support him, but there are things I don’t agree with. We either go towards freedom, or we go towards tyranny.” ‘He definitely marched with them’ Rose City Antifa is a long-standing antifascist group in Portland, a major organizer of opposition to Gibson’s rallies. A spokesman who gave only a first name, David, said Gibson’s disavowals of Christian rang hollow. “He definitely marched with them,” he said. “When you have an event like this you can say, ‘These people are with us, these people aren’t with us,’ as much as you want. But these are the people who turned out to the event.” The spokesman said Portland’s reputation as a liberal city masked long-term political realities. “The sad, unfortunate fact is that Portland does have a long history of white supremacist activity,” he said, mentioning the 1988 murder of an Ethiopian immigrant, Mulugeta Seraw. “There have been white skinheads and militia groups centred on Portland. These people have never gone away, but recently they have been comfortable coming out and showing their true colours.” The spokesman pointed to an article on the Rose City Antifa website which identified a number of white supremacists who attended the 29 April event. “[Christian] may have been the most brazen and visible white supremacist, but he was certainly not the only one,” he said. “At previous rallies, we’ve seen KKK members, members of the group Identity Europa and other unaffiliated white supremacists. There was another person at the 29 April rally who had a swastika pin on their backpack who was allowed to stay. They simply made that person remove the pin.” The spokesman said the presence of such people, and escalating violence at the rallies, undermined Gibson’s claim that his events were intended solely to promote free speech. “It doesn’t matter what the purpose of a rally is,” he said, “it matters what happens at that rally. How do the organizers of that rally conduct themselves? Who comes to join that rally and what’s the effect of them coming together?” Gibson said he expected a tough reception next Sunday. “There will be more hatred, opposition, anger,” he said. “Because here are people running around irresponsibly saying Jeremy Christian was part of our group.” Antifascist leaders had come under pressure, he said, since the Department of Homeland Security described anti-Trump protests in the city involving “black bloc” anarchists as “domestic terrorist violence”. “I guarantee right now, there is going to be at least one kid arrested in downtown Portland who gets arrested because he believed the lie,” Gibson said. Rose City Antifa is in turn determined to organize a “popular turnout” next Sunday. At the candlelight vigil on Saturday evening, flyers co-sponsored by the group were circulated. The group’s spokesman said: “The thing that they’re going to discover is that Portlanders are tired of this. They’re tired of this circus. They’re tired of the excuses [Gibson] gives for throwing these rallies. People are tired of seeing white supremacists together in their streets. “I think there’s going to be a very large turnout indeed.” If such predictions prove true, next Sunday could see a continuation of political confrontations in the city which started around one major national event: the election of President Donald Trump."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/may/29/coalition-trails-labor-in-13th-consecutive-newspoll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T22:18:01Z","webTitle":"Coalition trails Labor in 13th consecutive Newspoll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/29/coalition-trails-labor-in-13th-consecutive-newspoll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/may/29/coalition-trails-labor-in-13th-consecutive-newspoll","fields":{"headline":"Coalition trails Labor in 13th consecutive Newspoll","bodyText":"The Turnbull government’s “Labor-lite” budget has failed to convince voters to return to the Coalition fold, with the government trailing Labor 47%-53% in two-party preferred terms in the latest Newspoll.

This hidden scandal, that takes place every day in homes across Britain, must be tackled head on,” said May. “And we must respond to the devastating and lifelong impact that domestic abuse has on children, who carry the effects into adulthood.” She argued that the Conservatives had delivered “real steps towards tackling domestic violence” over seven years, but wanted to go further. The Tory manifesto promised to support victims to leave abusive partners and to review the funding for refuges. However, the Labour party has analysed domestic violence rates since 2009, with an increase in violence against women perpetrated by their acquaintances. There has been a levelling off of violence against women by strangers and a fall in violence against men. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, said the intention of the commissioner was to raise standards everywhere over how police forces deal with domestic violence. “We’re building on an established model of having a commissioner who can then oversee the existing legislation and good practice generally in our efforts to combat domestic violence,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “You can see where in some areas there is under-reporting of domestic violence,” she said. “Her Majesty’s inspector of constabulary did a review and found it was very patchy in different parts of the country.“So we want to have a commission which will have responsibility for having oversight over that, ensuring that the efforts we put in place do deliver throughout the country.” Rudd said the hope was the commissioner would be as effective as the equivalent role combating slavery, set up by May when she was home secretary. She rejected the idea that police would see it as another burdensome layer of bureaucracy. She said: “I don’t hear that at all. My experience of talking to police and crime commissioners, and to police officers, is that they do want to address it.” Sarah Champion, the shadow women’s minister, has campaigned against the loss of 17% of specialist refuges for domestic violence victims in England since 2010. Diana Barran, the chief executive of the charity Safe Lives, welcomed the decision to appoint a domestic violence and abuse commissioner. “We need a practical and visible commissioner who can work with specialist services, local commissioners, policy makers and crucially with survivors,” she said. “The commissioner needs to have both the legitimacy and resources to drive forward change.” She said only one in five survivors contacted the police, so any future response must go beyond the criminal justice system “and ensure that survivors and their children can live safely at home and rebuild their lives”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/29/widnes-vikings-super-league-rfl-franchise-relocation","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"Widnes Vikings face move out of rugby league heartland if club is sold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/29/widnes-vikings-super-league-rfl-franchise-relocation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/29/widnes-vikings-super-league-rfl-franchise-relocation","fields":{"headline":"Widnes Vikings face move out of rugby league heartland if club is sold","bodyText":"Widnes Vikings have rejected approaches from a number of investors in non-heartlands areas as they receive interest in their Super League franchise from prospective buyers hoping to make them the first top-flight club to take advantage of a relaxation in the rules surrounding relocation. The Guardian revealed in March how the Rugby Football League had become increasingly receptive to Super League sides holding talks with potential bidders about selling up and moving elsewhere. In recent weeks the Vikings have received offers from several parties away from the sport’s traditional territories. Vikings officials declined to comment but it is understood the club, despite sitting bottom of the Super League table, have been identified as one of the more desirable franchises to obtain. Even with offers rejected by the club’s board, potential investors remain interested in Widnes should their stance change in the coming weeks. The club operate with a relatively small fanbase – fewer than 4,000 home fans attended their most recent home fixture, the defeat to Hull FC – and they have limited fixed assets, given they are only tenants in their current Select Security Stadium home. That has made them increasingly desirable in the eyes of some investors as a potential purchase. The approaches were understood to have been rejected because the club’s board remains committed to the town, which has had a rugby league presence ever since the sport’s formation in 1895. Vikings officials have also been heartened that, despite looking likely to face a battle in the Qualifiers this season to preserve their Super League status, a number of the club’s academy products have graduated to the first team in 2017. Fifteen of the first-team squad are homegrown, with the Vikings’ junior production line regarded as one of the best. In the sport’s annual accreditation scheme, Widnes were graded outstanding by the RFL in 2016, with similar recognition expected this year. However, the club have faced significant commercial pressures off the field. Last year, Widnes finished in their highest ever Super League position of seventh, but the club’s chief executive, James Rule, revealed at the start of this year that while they attracted new members they also lost around £150,000 worth of membership due to 2016 season ticket holders not renewing their commitment. Rule also recently appealed directly to stay-away supporters ahead of the club’s home game with Leeds on Bank Holiday Monday. He said: “At a time when we have faced an unprecedented number of injuries to our first team and struggled to find form, it can be tempting to stay away. I understand that, but in reality any reductions in our income restricts our ability to recruit both this year and next.” • This article was amended on 29 May to correct the location of Widnes’ stadium, which is in Halton, Cheshire"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/may/29/sydney-writers-festival-2017-roundup-six-things-we-learned","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T07:34:42Z","webTitle":"Sydney writers' festival 2017 roundup: six things we learned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/29/sydney-writers-festival-2017-roundup-six-things-we-learned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/may/29/sydney-writers-festival-2017-roundup-six-things-we-learned","fields":{"headline":"Sydney writers' festival 2017 roundup: six things we learned","bodyText":"The hypothesis of Hitler’s drug habits Just when we thought we knew everything there is to know about the second world war, along comes novelist Norman Ohler, whose nonfiction book Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich, on the Nazi regime and substance abuse, has radically reframed some of our understanding of historical events. For example: a crucial meeting between Hitler and Mussolini about the course of the war could have had a different outcome had a high Hitler not jabbered nonstop for hours. Ohler’s hypothesis: Hitler was on heavy-duty stimulants that made him like a coked-up bore at a party. The Italian dictator couldn’t get a word in edgeways. Maybe the war would have taken a different turn if he’d had a chance to speak. Ohler also contends that the blitzkrieg would not have been possible without the German soldiers being supplied with crystal meth, which was being pumped out at a rapid rate by German pharmaceutical factories. The drugs kept the soldiers awake for days and removed their fear; their opponents had superior firepower, but it was the German army that won. – BD You can write about whatever you want, so long as you think hard In his controversial conversation with Radio National’s Michael Cathcart on Saturday, Man Booker prize winner Paul Beatty spoke of a white male student he taught at Columbia University who submitted a paper he said he “always knew I was going to get”: a story about a black man raping a white woman. “I thought, ‘Oh jeez, it’s going to be a long class tomorrow.’” Sure enough, when the student read the story aloud, his classmates eviscerated him: “The class is just yelling at him – ‘You can’t do this! You can’t do this!’” Eventually, Beatty stopped their shouting with a question: “Can you, this amorphous you, can you write a story about a black guy raping a white woman?” The class conceded that yes, that story could be written. “So I said, ‘Well, now talk to him.’” This approach changed everything. “Their critique of the paper was so good after that. Because it was about, ‘How are you portraying the women?’ ‘How are you portraying this guy?’ ‘What are all of these cues that you’re using?’ It wasn’t about this [event], but it was about how he shaped it,” Beatty said. “You get to go where you want to go, you get to step on any landmines you want to step on, but you just need to be considerate,” Beatty said. “I can’t tell him as a writer what he can or can’t say, but I can ask him to be considerate.” US author Brit Bennett took a similar view, speaking on the Nasty Women panel on Saturday night: “There are kind of two really entrenched camps. There’s one side that says you should never write outside of your identity or lived experience because that’s appropriation; and there’s this other side that says cultural appropriation is just PC bullshit, you can write whatever you want,” she said. “I find both those camps very reductive, and I think this dichotomy presents a false choice. On one hand I reject the idea that my imagination and empathy are so limited that I’m incapable of writing outside my own perspective. But at the same time it takes a hell of a lot of work to begin to understand another cultural experience.” She said the cultural appropriation debate is “mostly a problem of bad writing, lazy writing ... You have to push past the easy image, which is to say: do the work of writing, of imagining, of always reaching for more complexity, not less ... But we also have to acknowledge when we fall short, when we get something wrong, because that’s also the work of being human: being willing to face what you don’t understand.” – SH Refuge is a ‘Janus-faced concept’ As author Susan Faludi began her final address on the topic of Refuge – the theme of the festival – it was not unexpected that she would address the refugee crisis. As she said, “The concept of refuge has become the urgent issue of the age”. The UN had counted 65.3 million forcibly displaced people in the world by the end of 2015, she told us; if they were citizens of a separate nation, that country would be the 21st largest in the world. There were audible intakes of breath as she brought to life the horrifying details of those displaced people, but it was when she asked the audience to consider the dual nature of refuge, and the unlikely parallels between those who seek refuge and those who refuse to allow them in, that the audience sat up. “The refuge that refugees seek is only a refuge because it is defended, exclusionary. In that regard, the immigrant and the xenophobe are odd kindred spirits; they both believe in a place that is shielded from the world’s mayhem. Which raises some fundamental questions: is refuge what we seek or what we defend? ... Is it naive to think there is any refuge to run to? Are we not all refugees?” To illustrate her point, Faludi shifted to discussing her father (and the subject of her recent book In the Darkroom), who was born in Hungary and persecuted throughout the second world war, before fleeing to Copenhagen, Brazil and lastly the United States. “If ever someone sought refuge, it was my father,” she said. Unable to corral his demons, her father turned to violence against his wife and his child. Faludi would become estranged from her father for more than 25 years, each seeing the other as the cause of the breakdown. Her father moved back to Hungary in the 90s, and in 2004, Faludi received an email stating that he had undergone gender reassignment surgery. Over the next decade the two spent time together going over their history, and eventually reached an accord – and peace. “[She] owned the history she had denied, and I came to understand some of the extenuating circumstances behind my father’s violent behaviour. “In a funny way, whatever accommodation we reached depended on giving up the idea of refuge as a place to seek or a place to defend,” she said. “Only when we let each other in and shouldered responsibility for each other’s distrust and animosity could we find sanctuary.” Faludi’s deeply personal experience taught her something that could be applied to the current global crisis. “That refuge isn’t something to be encircled and patrolled; that the xenophobe who builds fortifications around his refuge has already stripped it of the title; that the very idea of refuge demands an intense negotiation between self-inspection and forgiveness, between facing your own history honestly and seeing yourself in the other. [Refuge] is a place not of safety but of atonement. True refuge comes from the understanding that there can be no refuge from that reckoning.” – AS We need a more diverse pool of reviewers in Australia This will come as no surprise to anyone who reads the arts pages, but Australia is severely lacking when it comes to the diversity of our criticism culture. “We have a huge problem in this country when it comes to who’s reviewing,” the Indigenous writer Ellen Van Neerven said on Friday. “You can quite comfortably say that the majority of review culture is white Australian men.” When Van Neerven is asked to review works, they tended to be from other Indigenous artists. “We don’t very often get asked to comment on different topics that are not political,” she explained. And that process itself was “a bit of a headfuck. You’re like, who am I writing for?” She continued: “You automatically kind of feel like you need to mould yourself into something that you’re not – because that white gaze is such a strong current. At the same time you feel a lot of responsibility to educate – how much detailing do you have to do? Because there is such a basic level of understanding about some issues.” She said when it came to criticism of Indigenous works, there was “such a low standard”. “Sometimes you kind of think, ‘Is it good enough just to have a review in the paper or a review online? Can we just take that?’ ... How do we educate and how do we create a more healthy review culture? I think we need to create a more healthy country first, to be honest.” – SH Facts are in the eye of the beholder – until they’re not Immigration is an area filled with facts, but all too often we see them being distorted by those with agendas. In her talk on Thursday, the Guardian US’s data editor Mona Chalabi walked us through how data can be manipulated by those who want us to see the world in a particular way. Her talk set out how to spot the facts used to draw false inferences, and the ways that data is used and misused on a daily basis to talk about one of the defining issues of our generation. An added takeaway was that facts and figures don’t need to be boring bar graphs; this kind of thinking is too often designed to a induce a false sense of verisimilitude, according to Chalabi. Facts can be visualised in all kinds of ways, as her Instagram account shows. – PF Audience questions are almost uniformly bad – unless they’re not When a writers’ festival event is opened up to questions from the audience, a minority make their way to the nearest mic and the rest collectively hold their breath: will it be question, or will it be a self-involved stream-of-consciousness statement that the author will try gamely to engage with, as though trying to organise an octopus in front of a crowd of hundreds? I have been to very few events where questions from the audience have contributed to my enjoyment or understanding of a speaker, and the Friday night session with US author Chris Kraus was no different. Her 1997 novel I Love Dick has an ardent cult following, and its fans packed out the audience at the Rosalyn Packer Theatre. You’d think there’d be no shortage of fans wanting to pick her brains over her unique, enormously influential novel or the real-life events that informed it. As it was, the first question directed at Kraus was in response to the reading she gave from her 2006 novel Torpor, and was essentially as follows: “I read Torpor many years ago and don’t remember it being so ironic. It’s very ironic, isn’t it?” When Kraus said she hoped it was intended as a compliment – and the MC had explained that Kraus’ hearing precluded easy back-and-forth – the speaker doubled down: “I’m not sure!” The second question was very long and hard to reproduce here but the thrust of it was that Kraus, in explaining her use of the Kierkegaardian remove in I Love Dick – that the perspective that comes with age was necessary to represent the experience of adolescent infatuation – had sounded “dismissive” of younger women. When Kraus politely responded to the question, the audience member argued back. A Twitter search after the event revealed many raised eyebrows. Third time’s a charm, and the final question came from an informed, polite young woman who had read and understood the book, asked a specific query relating to her and Kraus’ shared knowledge of art criticism, and thanked her for her response and returned to her seat. The harrowing experience of the preceding seven minutes (nearly 8% of Kraus’ total time on stage) was just enough for me to dare to hope for a better way, in future festivals. The movement will be hashtagged: #NotAllAudienceQuestions. – EH"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2017/may/28/cannes-2017-awards-palme-dor-the-square-loveless-peter-bradshaw","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T20:06:20Z","webTitle":"Cannes 2017 awards: visceral power overlooked in favour of bourgeois absurdity | Peter Bradshaw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/may/28/cannes-2017-awards-palme-dor-the-square-loveless-peter-bradshaw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2017/may/28/cannes-2017-awards-palme-dor-the-square-loveless-peter-bradshaw","fields":{"headline":"Cannes 2017 awards: visceral power overlooked in favour of bourgeois vanity","bodyText":"The results are in, and Pedro Almodóvar’s Cannes jury has delivered a prize list which is not as off the wall as it has been in the past. However, there is one à quoi pensaient-ils? moment. Diane Kruger was awarded best actress for a self-conscious and borderline-preposterous turn as a hand-wringing avenger in the disappointing and shallow TV-movie-style drama about neo-Nazi terrorism called In the Fade, from Fatih Akin. That really was a film to forget, with a very misjudged ending which appeared to think it had split the difference between choosing violence and non-violence. However, the Palme d’Or has gone to Ruben Östlund’s The Square, which is a reasonable choice, although I didn’t think it was the best in competition. It is a long film about an ambitious art gallery director who suffers a kind of suppressed breakdown when his phone is stolen and subtly displaces his malaise out into the “community” of the gallery itself, with its curators, sponsors, artists and visitors. It is a stylishly made, visually striking film with something of Ballard, stuffed with disquieting mood-swings and brilliantly composed set-pieces, culminating in the bizarre and terrifying sequence when a performance artist pretending to be an ape is brought on to amuse an art gallery’s wealthy patrons at a fancy black-tie dinner and he goes … well … ape. This character was superbly played by the American actor and movement-coach Terry Notary and I have a very lively suspicion that Mr Notary swung it for Östlund’s The Square. It is a real talking point in a film full of talking points, with black comic quirks and showstoppers that could appeal to a jury of many languages, backgrounds, sensibilities. Something for everyone. All jury decisions are compromises of course, and I suspect that The Square is the one film that they could all agree that they liked, and I further suspect it was a unanimous second choice with everyone disagreeing on the top dog. But it is a very good film, with a marvellous performance from an actor I had never noticed before: Claes Bang, as the preening museum chief. (He was in The Bridge.) Robin Campillo’s outstanding film 120 Beats per Minute gets the Grand Prix; this is the one prediction I got right. It is one of the very best films at Cannes: a defiant, passionate, heartwrenching and in its way euphoric movie about the ACT UP movement in Paris in the late 80s and early 90s, campaigning aggressively for the complacent political establishment and bland careerists of Big Pharma to do something about Aids research. It is a film whose emotional force builds progressively through the film; appropriately, its heartbeat maintains a steady, accumulative intensity. The largely unknown cast were all superb. It’s a film I can’t wait to see again when it is released in the UK. On now to my personal disappointment – although of course I am delighted that it came away with something. Andrei Zvyagintsev’s Loveless is the film I was tipping for the Palme, a film with the clarity and consistency of a diamond. As things turned out, it got the jury prize, an award which is sort of like the bronze to the Grand Prix’s silver. This film is a kind of desolate spiritual crime-procedural about a divorcing Russian couple who have to work together when their 12-year-old son goes missing. It is a trauma whose aspects and implications are opened up in a masterly composition of scenes and Zvyagintsev brilliantly shines a light on what he sees as the condition of modern Russia, with its materialism and aspirational heartlessness – and indeed lovelessness. It is an outstanding film in the “domestic” vein of his 2011 drama Elena, without the obvious Dostoyevskian grandeur of his previous film Leviathan. But still magnificently powerful. And talking of Dostoyevsky, I was disappointed to see that no prizes were given to Sergei Loznitsa’s A Gentle Creature (loosely inspired by a Dostoyevsky short story), perhaps because there is an unacknowledged convention that there can be no more than one harrowing Russian-themed film on the prize list. Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here is a stunning crime drama that the director has hyper-evolved into a nightmarish portrait of someone’s private emotional agony. Many were hoping that Ramsay would get the Palme and so become only the second woman director to do so. As it was, her film got best actor for Joaquin Phoenix, and shared the screenplay prize with Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou for their The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Phoenix puts his heart on his sleeve and displays an extravagantly wrecked physique and raddled, bearded face to the world, playing an ex-soldier now employed by a private security firm to do dirty, deniable work for wealthy people. He is employed by an ambitious politician to rescue his teenage daughter from a trafficking ring, and things go terribly wrong. It is a very striking performance from Phoenix, although I can’t help thinking that in terms of pure acting technique there were other, bolder contenders. Robert Pattinson gave what I have to admit is a very charismatic performance in a film I was agnostic about: the Safdie brothers’ bank-robbery picture Good Time. And Ben Stiller was genuinely excellent in Noah Baumbach’s comedy The Meyerowitz Stories, which itself had a shot at best screenplay. Ramsay’s film is well written, and everyone at film school gets told that screenplay is not about writing lines of Algonquin dialogue, but constructing and melding the form of a movie. The mood arc created by Ramsay is outstanding. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a film which also had its swirling mood music: an intriguing, unnerving film which I very much liked, although in pure screenplay terms, its ending was a little strained. Sofia Coppola gets the director’s prize for The Beguiled: a prize which I had tipped for the great Michael Haneke; he had presented a film which had me gripped from the outset, but which most other critics had dismissed as a greatest-hits parody of all his favourite themes. Coppola is an outstanding director whose Marie Antoinette I remember being a great event at Cannes back in 2006 and whose The Bling Ring in 2013 rather brilliantly intuited the modern infatuation with social-media celebrity. The Beguiled is a revival of a steamy, gamey emotional drama set during the American civil war which Don Siegel filmed in considerably more explicit terms back in 1971. Coppola’s re-evaluation of the material makes it less outrageous, although to call it subtler isn’t exactly right. It has some very melodramatic moments and great comic flourishes and it is a highly enjoyable, watchable Hollywood picture – the single mainstream Hollywood picture in competition, in fact – and all its successes are the result of a sure directorial hand. Coppola is a very distinctive director who is occasionally subject to condescension; she was not my choice for this prize, and I think Ramsay came out ahead. But she delivered a very pleasurable film. So this started out as a Cannes which was all about the refugee crisis, and sadly none of the films honoured really reflected that: the festival bestowed its highest honour on an elegant dissection of haute bourgeois absurdity and vanity, and overlooked the more visceral power of Zvyagintsev, Ramsay and indeed Loznitsa. But this is a good list, a launching pad for a clutch of excellent films."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/28/takuma-sato-indy-500-fernando-alonso-race-report-indycar","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T20:04:33Z","webTitle":"Takuma Sato wins Indy 500 as engine failure ends Fernando Alonso's race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/28/takuma-sato-indy-500-fernando-alonso-race-report-indycar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/28/takuma-sato-indy-500-fernando-alonso-race-report-indycar","fields":{"headline":"Takuma Sato wins Indy 500 as engine failure ends Fernando Alonso's race","bodyText":"Takuma Sato has won the 101st running of the Indianapolis 500 after a dramatic race at the famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The 40-year-old Japanese driver came through in the last few laps of the race to take victory over Hélio Castroneves in second. Sato, a former Formula One driver, had only won one IndyCar race previously since joining the series in 2010. He had come close to winning the race in 2012, however, when he crashed out on the final lap as he battled Dario Franchitti for the lead. This time he held his nerve to give Andretti Autosport its third victory in four years at the Brickyard and shouted “Awesome!” into his radio as his win was confirmed. Ed Jones, Max Chilton and Tony Kanaan finished third, fourth and fifth respectively. Much of the pre-race attention had been on Fernando Alonso, the two-time Formula One world champion who was competing as a 35-year-old rookie at the Indy 500. He held the lead several times before his engine blew with fewer than 25 laps of the 200-lap race to go. Up to that point the Spaniard had driven brilliantly, and was given an ovation by the fans as his day ended. “I felt the noise, the engine friction, I backed off and saw the smoke. It’s a shame, I thought we deserved to finish the race and experience the end. Who knows which position we could be,” he said. “I mean the whole day has been a very nice experience. The racing was fun, it was nice. I think the performance was good, we were leading the race. It was a nice surprise to be with the best in oval racing and be competitive. Obviously I feel competitive, If I come back, it will be easier the second time. One of the best experiences of my career.” Meanwhile, Alonso’s boss at McLaren, Zak Brown, left the possibility of a return for the Spaniard next year open. ‘We have to get through tonight,” Brown said, “but yeah, I’d like to see him back [at the Indy 500 next year] ... But our goal is to win the Monaco [F1 Grand Prix] next year with Fernando in the car.” The race was hit by drama early on when pole sitter Scott Dixon and Jay Howard were involved in a huge crash that tore Dixon’s car in half. The New Zealander’s car collided with Howard’s after the Briton had slid into the outside wall and rebounded back into traffic. Debris was strewn across the circuit and the race had to be stopped while the track was cleared. Both men walked away unharmed. “I’m OK, I was just a little beaten up there. I’m bummed for the team, man,” said Dixon. “We were starting to make some progress, we were a little light on the downforce. I’m just glad everybody is OK.” And on the crash itself: “It’s just a wild ride and you have to hold on and believe in the safety progress that we’ve made over the last many years.” The caution flag came out again when Conor Daly smashed into the wall on Turn 3 and Buddy Lazier, the winner of the 1996 Indy 500, was taken to hospital with chest discomfort after a hard crash shortly afterwards. The race was then stopped with 17 laps to go after a huge collision involving Oriol Servia, James Hinchcliffe, James Davison and Will Power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/may/28/tom-curry-stands-out-pragmatic-england-win-barbarians-eddie-jones","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T17:36:46Z","webTitle":"Tom Curry stands out in pragmatic England’s win over Barbarians | Gerard Meagher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/may/28/tom-curry-stands-out-pragmatic-england-win-barbarians-eddie-jones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/may/28/tom-curry-stands-out-pragmatic-england-win-barbarians-eddie-jones","fields":{"headline":"Tom Curry stands out in pragmatic England’s win over Barbarians","bodyText":"Considering that Eddie Jones has admitted to feeling “filthy” for more than a month after England’s defeat by Ireland, this stilted if spirited victory can at least be viewed as the start of the cleansing process. It was not the grand unveiling to the second phase of his master plan – eight uncapped starters and a feisty Barbarians side made sure it was never going to be – but winning is an addictive habit for Jones and he will care little that there was barely a sparkle in an exhibition match that tends to offer the promise of fireworks. He will be pleased, too, with how the 18-year-old Tom Curry acquitted himself, even if the man of the match award was a touch generous, after coming on during the first half; less so that Sam Underhill followed Alex Lozowski off with a shoulder injury. Other plus points for Jones include Nathan Earle, lively on the wing as and when he saw the ball, and the abrasive edge that Ellis Genge brings up front. But the overriding positive for England was how a side so inexperienced went about their tasks with such professionalism. There can be no doubting it was not particularly pretty, but it was effective and though it came only 24 hours after a sun-drenched Twickenham bore witness to the most thrilling Premiership final in recent memory, the Lord Mayor had long since packed up and gone home. England’s pragmatism went against the grain of the Barbarians’ tradition and while the amateur ideals of the invitational side are increasingly an anachronism, the relish with which Jones’s side stuck to their task was not exactly what the 51,636-strong crowd was hoping for. Perhaps it should not be surprising. England had a squad with 277 caps between them but 246 of those belong to five players. The Barbarians by contrast had 812 and even two members of their side – Alex Goode and Steffon Armitage – had more England caps than 17 of their opponents combined. So it was left to George Ford, the most accomplished of England’s senior quintet on the day, to steer his side home. As was the case in this end-of-season fixture last year, his goalkicking provoked boos from the crowd but whereas it was his inaccuracy that was the problem then, the issue here was the pragmatic choice to go for goal. While Ford, co-captain with Chris Robshaw, stood out with his authority, it was inevitably the eight uncapped starters that came under the microscope. Jones is mining for gold this summer, sifting through a sizeable group of youngsters and hoping to hit the jackpot with one or two. Catching the coach’s eye however, is far harder when seeing so little of the ball – after 12 minutes the Barbarians had enjoyed 88% of possession – but Earle managed to shine the brightest. He is tall, quick, took his first-half try well and might have had a hat-trick had his handling not let him down. Earle began the season in New Zealand, on loan at Canterbury, but he is likely to finish it with a first cap in Argentina. He made way eight minutes before the end to rapturous applause and he fits the mould of what Jones is looking for. In a word, that is size and what he would not give for a player who blends explosive power, pace and dainty footwork like the Barbarians’ Timoci Nagusa – a Fijian flyer just shy of 16 stone. Linking well with Goode, Nagusa made a fool of Robshaw as he took the long way round down the right-hand touchline. It brought the crowd to their feet but subsequent moments like that were all too few. When Adam Ashley-Cooper finished off a well-worked try in the left-hand corner, the spectators on that side of the pitch were far more interested in a marriage proposal in front of them. Cue the inevitable Mexican waves, the renditions of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot and the odd faint echo of the Tomahawk Chop – clearly a few Exeter fans had decided to make a weekend of it. It is that period however, between Ashley-Cooper’s try and the decisive score from Nick Isiekwe that will please Jones and his coaches most. England had luck on their side – Jeremy Thrush had a try disallowed – but they did not wilt in the face of some sustained pressure.

Blowback theory is most definitely relevant. It is not confined to “blam[ing] Islamist terrorism directly on western expeditionary warfare”, as Mason incorrectly states. Islamic State germinated in the scorched earth left behind when we removed the regime of Saddam Hussein. If we had not invaded Iraq, the organisation that is now attacking us would not exist. That is blowback. The plan proclaimed to stabilise Libya, after the overthrow of Gaddafi, was never going to work. There were realistic alternatives, put forward at the time, to bombing on the side of the rebels – such as setting up UN safe areas – but they were ignored. Nato turned a blind eye to shipments of weapons bound for Misrata, with the result that one big Gaddafi turned into lots of little Gaddafis. That is what has brought about the ungovernable space in Libya which Isis has exploited. That is blowback. Now Trump has loosened the rules of engagement for US bombing, with the result that 50 civilians in Syria were killed in the week before the attack on Westminster, and 200 in Iraq the week before that – both in raids targeting Isis, with UK involvement and support. Unlike in Manchester, the Westminster attacker apparently had no organisational links with Isis – but that does not mean there is not an indirect connection. That, too, is blowback. Violence begets violence. Jeremy Corbyn is right, we need to find alternatives. Associate Professor Jake Lynch Chair, Department of Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Sydney • Isn’t it time Theresa May was asked difficult questions about her role as home secretary when in 2011 the Home Office apparently lifted police control orders on scores of suspected Libyan terrorists living in Britain, so they could go and fight against the Libyan government of Colonel Gaddafi? These terrorists were known to belong to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Organisation, an al-Qaida affiliate. These terrorists may even have been trained by the SAS. After Gaddafi was overthrown, how many of these terrorists did the Home Office allow back into Britain? Mark Holt Liverpool • Paul Mason cites the September 2016 foreign affairs committee report on the intervention in Libya. In reality the FAC report, quoting Libyan experts Professor George Joffe and Alison Pargeter, concluded: “Despite his rhetoric, the proposition that Muammar Gaddafi would have ordered the massacre of civilians in Benghazi was not supported by the available evidence.” Ian Sinclair London • Andy Burnham is wrong when he says: “9/11 happened before any interventions overseas” (Report, 27 May). The 9/11 attackers in 2001 came mostly from Saudi Arabia because the holy places had been “desecrated” (in their eyes) by the stationing of US (“infidel”) troops there since the Iraq crisis of 1990-91. The Iraq crisis was the first large foreign intervention in the Arab peninsula since independence and added to the region’s instability. The Islamist ideology of al-Qaida, forged by the Saudi-financed mujahideen in the proxy Nato war against communist Afghanistan and its Soviet ally, spread and became more hardline in the years after the creation of the 1990 coalition to throw Iraq out of Kuwait and the subsequent 1991 Gulf war. Ian Bourne London • The point Jeremy Corbyn is making is not that terrorism is the direct outcome of British involvement in foreign wars – which is what Theresa May is asserting and your editorial (27 May) appears to support. But that these military interventions have led to the creation of “huge ungoverned spaces” within which Isis has been able to establish itself and spread its poison to potential supporters. Kevin McGrath Harlow, Essex • The overriding memory that comes to mind about the atrocity in Manchester are the cheers for Hilary Benn’s speech as the vote was passed for military action in Syria. There are no excuses for the violence we have witnessed, but when will we learn that the only way to combat this violence is through peace efforts and not retaliation? Our politicians must begin to search for a peaceful solution for all of these battles we have involved ourselves in. Jeremy Corbyn is right to bring up this question now; and our representatives and the public need to consider this question and our future actions now. Mike Swanwick Nottingham • Why does Jonathan Freedland (It’s a delusion to think this is all about our foreign policy, 27 May) rail so strenuously against a simplistic proposition of his own invention? No one is putting forward such an argument. The actual delusion actively being promoted today is that the current state of affairs has nothing to do with our foreign policy. To expose that delusion, of course, would be to support the grown-up stance taken by Jeremy Corbyn. Perhaps that answers my initial question. Julian Edge Manchester • Besides being an excellent analysis of the links between terrorism and foreign policy, Jonathan Freedland’s opinion piece contained a eloquent imagining of how the losses in the Manchester bombing are affecting their families. This was outstanding writing: simple and moving when much journalism attempting to address these issues has been well-meaning but portentous.

But we need to frame the foreign policy question more broadly and ask whether this is all about the legacy of our colonialism. When the British invaded Iraq in 2003, Sadiq, who worked for the Iraqi Antiquities Services, remarked: “It first began in 1920. I often wonder how they would feel if we had been bombing them in England every now and again from one generation to the next, if we changed their governments when it suited us. They say that their imperial era is over now. It does not feel that way.” This colonial legacy explains many things about where we are now: the exclusion of citizens of former colonies and their descendants from the category of “the British people”, as Salman Rushdie observed in 1982; the loyalty test of “British values” too often used, as Sayeeda Warsi argues in The Enemy Within, to demonstrate that British Muslims don’t match up and don’t belong; the bluster of Boris Johnson before the referendum, “We used to run the biggest empire the world has ever seen. Are we really unable to do trade deals?” This combination of British arrogance and what Stuart Hall called “an entrenched and defensive understanding of Englishness” goes a long way to explaining Brexit. The vain idea that we are negotiating Brexit with “Empire 2.0” behind our backs when, in truth, having an empire deprived us of negotiating skills because we could always send in the gunboats. Rather than defend foreign policy disasters, we need to think hard about how to move from being a colonial society to a postcolonial one.

Michael Chertoff, who served under George W Bush from 2005 to 2009, said that agents or allies of the Pyongyang regime were the most likely suspects for the hacking of the health service’s administration system in the UK and state infrastructures across the globe this month. Chertoff, an expert in global cybercrime and terrorism, was speaking at an international conference on terrorism and security in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, this weekend. “The issue with North Korea is this – they don’t participate for the most part in the global financial/commercial system,” he told the Guardian. “So how do they support their regime? Well they do that basically by committing crime on a global scale whether it’s smuggling counterfeit goods, drugs, human trafficking or theft, this is literally, practically a criminal state. And so it would not surprise me that they would attempt to make money by being engaging in ransomware and extortion.” Cybersecurity experts have also linked North Korea to the hacks, with top firms Kaspersky and Symantec both saying that technical details in the WannaCry code resembled a previous hack that was linked to Pyongyang. Chertoff said it was “far more likely” that the North Koreans were involved in the ransomware attack than the Russians. “I don’t think the Russians generally as a state are particularly in cyber-attacks to make money because they have their own economy. The North Koreans don’t really have much legitimate trade and so this is the kind of thing they would use.” The co-author of the US Patriot Act, which was enacted to enhance security in the US after 9/11, said criminal groups operating online made themselves available to states such as North Korea. He pointed out that North Korean agents were accused of being behind the major online theft of millions of dollars from the Bank of Bangladesh about a year ago. “I can’t tell you exactly about how they operated in relation to the British ransomware incident but, on past experience, there is something about the tools that were used that for me call it as a North Korean operation because, in the past, the North Koreans used the same kind of tools in other cyber-attacks.” At the Globsec thinktank summit in Bratislava, Chertoff said it was inevitable that there would be further mass ransomware attacks on the UK and other western states. “You are going to see the scale and breadth of the attacks increasing. There is no question in my mind that they are going to increase.” The hackers, he said, were beginning to attack devices that were online as part of the so-called Internet of Things, such as refrigerators and thermostats. “They attacked these things because they had minimal security behind them. They were easy targets. I think we may see more mass attacks of this kind.” Chertoff added that while Isis and previously al-Qaida had limited the use of the internet to spreading propaganda, distributing execution videos and radicalising people online, he expected Islamist terror groups would be investigating if they could use cyber-attacks and online sabotage to disrupt states’ infrastructures. “When the likes of Isis observes what happened to British Airways this weekend even due to a random thing like a power outage they must be saying to themselves, imagine the disruption or even destruction we could cause if we were able to launch cyber-attacks to bring down companies or even countries’ computer and data systems. I am sure they will try and it may be where the next form of warfare from them takes place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/may/28/fringe-politics-the-changing-hair-and-opinions-of-ministers-abbott-rudd","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T19:15:01Z","webTitle":"Fringe politics: the changing hair – and opinions – of ministers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/28/fringe-politics-the-changing-hair-and-opinions-of-ministers-abbott-rudd","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/may/28/fringe-politics-the-changing-hair-and-opinions-of-ministers-abbott-rudd","fields":{"headline":"Fringe politics: the changing hair – and opinions – of ministers","bodyText":"The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, was questioned on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday about comments she made on the IRA in the 80s. Her response was that, like her hairdos, her opinions had changed over the years. She said: “I had an afro. It was 34 years ago. The hairstyle has gone and some of the views have gone. We have all moved on.” Amber Rudd, the home secretary, who appeared on the show after Abbott, responded by saying: “I’ve changed my hairstyle a few times in 34 years too. But I’ve not changed my view on how to keep the public safe.” Abbot has previously spoken about her cropped afro, which she sported for much of her 20s, saying it was a political statement. By the late 1980s, she had switched to braids, however, just because she thought “they looked great”. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn sported curlier, longer hair than his current do in the 1980s. His beard was also much fuller. Very few photographs of the younger Amber Rudd exist online, but it’s safe to say her hairstyle has become glossier and less flyaway, and she seems to have mastered highlights. Earlier shots show her with hair tucked behind her ears and a dodgy fringe. At university in the 80s, prime minister Theresa May had a bob which was lacquered backwards on her wedding day, presumably to accommodate her veil. By 1992, however, it was much shorter and styled to stick straight up, with a thin wet-look gel fringe completing the yuppie power-woman look. Philip Hammond, chancellor of the exchequer, has probably had one of the biggest transformations, hair-wise. As a teenager in the 70s, he sported long, straight locks and was a a “leftwing goth” according to TV presenter Richard Madeley, who went to school with him. By the 80s, he had lopped off his long hair and become a Tory."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/28/the-trump-handshake-how-world-leaders-are-fighting-back","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T16:53:03Z","webTitle":"The Trump handshake: how world leaders are fighting back | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/28/the-trump-handshake-how-world-leaders-are-fighting-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/28/the-trump-handshake-how-world-leaders-are-fighting-back","fields":{"headline":"The Trump handshake: how world leaders are fighting back","bodyText":"They say the handshake originated as a gesture designed to prove that both participants were unarmed. But Donald Trump has rewritten that rule along with all the others. In the hands of the US president, the handshake is a weapon. And now, thanks to the newly elected president of France, we have confirmation that the rest of the world’s leaders are fighting back. Emmanuel Macron’s admission that his white-knuckle clinch with Trump – in which the two men appeared to be engaged in a squeezing duel that saw the US president break off first – was “not innocent” is hardly a surprise. His thinking was plain to see, as he crushed Trump’s hand until the latter’s fingers seemed to quiver for mercy. No less apparent was the French leader’s swerve to avoid shaking hands with Trump when meeting his Nato partners, pointedly preferring to greet Angela Merkel first. Macron had clearly clocked the way the US leader uses body language as a form of warfare – and resolved to fight him in kind. For Trump, the handshake is less a gesture of peace than a declaration of superiority. Note the grip he gave his supreme court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, yanking the judge towards him as if he were a pet dog on a leash. Trump made a similar show of alpha male supremacy with Shinzo Abe, clasping and tugging at Abe’s hand for a full 18 seconds – and prompting a memorable eye-roll from the Japanese leader. James Comey, then director of the FBI, was on the receiving end of a similar attempt to demonstrate ownership. “You work for me,” Trump seemed to signal as he pulled in Comey with that signature tug and an attempted hug. It has since emerged that the move appalled Comey, who had sought to hide in the curtains rather than be subject to such a display. All of this is quite a shift in the art of the political handshake. Before Trump, any controversy over the gesture usually centred on whether it would happen or not, and whether it would be in public or private: think of Gerry Adams and Tony Blair. Only rarely was the manner of the handshake a point of contention. In September 1993, Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin won plaudits at home for the visible reluctance of his handshake with the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat: he had made the move, but also shown his discomfort. Trump has upended all that, withholding handshakes from America’s friends – he ignored Merkel’s requests to press palms during a White House photo op – but showing physical warmth to assorted dictators and adversaries of the US, from Egypt’s President Sisi to Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Still, Trump’s fellow world leaders have been swift to learn the new rules. Canada’s Justin Trudeau went for a pre-emptive grip of the Trump forearm, making any Gorsuch-style yank impossible, while Macron fought alpha male fire with fire. Thanks to Trump, what was once a gesture to indicate being without weapon has triggered a new unarmed race."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/may/28/gary-cahill-offside-maddest-rule-alexis-sanchez-chelsea-arsenal-cup-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T23:01:09Z","webTitle":"Gary Cahill rues ‘crazy’ offside rule in wake of Chelsea’s FA Cup final defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/28/gary-cahill-offside-maddest-rule-alexis-sanchez-chelsea-arsenal-cup-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/may/28/gary-cahill-offside-maddest-rule-alexis-sanchez-chelsea-arsenal-cup-final","fields":{"headline":"Gary Cahill rues ‘crazy’ offside rule in wake of Chelsea’s FA Cup final defeat","bodyText":"Gary Cahill has described the current interpretation of the offside rule as “the maddest rule I have ever seen” as the Chelsea defender struggled to come to terms with the decision to award Alexis Sánchez’s opening goal in Saturday’s FA Cup final. Chelsea were also perplexed that the referee, Anthony Taylor, did not penalise the Arsenal forward for handball in the buildup. After that Aaron Ramsey’s initial movement towards the ball from an offside position prompted the assistant referee, Gary Beswick, to raise his flag. Yet while Ramsey’s presence may have been a distraction, the fact he did not touch the ball, directly interfere with an opponent or ensure his side gained an unfair advantage through his position meant Taylor eventually allowed the fifth-minute goal. “That offside rule is a crazy rule,” said Cahill, who did admit Chelsea had been badly off the pace from the outset. “You can look to go to the ball and veer off and then you’re not offside. It is the maddest rule I have ever seen. If he is not there, and it does not affect things, then maybe Thibaut [Courtois] comes out and grabs the ball. But there’s also the handball. If he touches the ball with his hands in a natural position down by his side, I’d understand that [being allowed]. But when you have both hands above your face, you’re not telling me that is a natural position. It was incredible, to be honest. I spoke to him [the referee] at half-time and he was adamant he kneed the ball through. We saw it differently.” Taylor had visited Chelsea’s Cobham training ground earlier this season to explain to the players what would be considered handball. “He told us a player’s hands should always be in a natural position,” said Courtois. “If he has his hands next to him and the ball hits him on the arm, he can’t do anything about it. But here he actually does a volleyball block. It’s one of the best blocks I’ve seen. “And then there’s the offside, where Ramsey is clearly bothering me. If he’s not there, I can run out and get the ball before Alexis does. But because he’s standing there, I stop thinking he is going to collect it and shoot. As does the defence. He clearly interrupts the game for me and is taking part in active play. “But, to be honest, Arsenal were just better than us. We can’t hide behind the first goal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/may/28/brendan-rodgers-celtic-european-progress-treble-scottish-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T23:01:09Z","webTitle":"Brendan Rodgers targets European progress after Celtic’s domestic treble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/28/brendan-rodgers-celtic-european-progress-treble-scottish-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/may/28/brendan-rodgers-celtic-european-progress-treble-scottish-cup","fields":{"headline":"Brendan Rodgers targets European progress after Celtic’s domestic treble","bodyText":"No sooner had Celtic completed their domestic treble by defeating Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup final than discussion moved towards what exactly Brendan Rodgers can do next. Celtic are believed to be keen on four players – a centre-back, midfielder, winger and striker – as they plan for the new campaign. Rodgers, who has seen his career rejuvenated in Glasgow, presided over a Celtic team that did not lose a domestic game all season; Saturday’s 2-1 triumph at Hampden, where Tom Rogic scored an injury-time winner, proved their toughest test. Rodgers speaks routinely about continuing improvement, with European football surely the true barometer of that. As the dust settled on Saturday’s win, Celtic’s manager warned competing with the Champions League’s elite is still a formidable challenge. “You have to be careful and recognise where we are,” Rodgers said. “We’re 10 times behind budget-wise. You have to be realistic. “We want to qualify, first and foremost. That will always be a challenge. Then we have to try and see what we can do. The gauge for us is to measure calmly once we’ve qualified. We would like to be in Europe for the second part of the season, whatever competition that’s in, and that’s a huge, huge ask for a club like ourselves.” Some will smile at Rodgers’ raising of finance, given that Celtic’s spending power dwarfs that of every other club in Scotland. Still, there can be no doubt the former Liverpool manager has raised standards considerably since moving north last summer. Rodgers reflected on the most mentally draining season of his career. “That’s what it’s like as a manager at clubs like Liverpool and Celtic, where the expectations are huge and you have to win,” he added. “I want to impose a way of playing and working which doesn’t just happen with a click of the fingers. So, yes, it’s the pressure which is always there. You just manage it and cope with it. But then there is a part of you which has to press the reset button.” Rodgers is pragmatic regarding the retaining of key players. “Football is about two things for players – game time and money,” he said. “So I’m not going to give all the fruity answers or nice answers. No, what we can do is create an environment that is fantastic for them to be in. If they decide to move, it’s OK. We’ll fight to keep them but if they don’t want to stay, we’ll find someone else. No problem, someone else will come in and play and hopefully do well for us.” Speculation continues to surround the Aberdeen manager, Derek McInnes, who is among the contenders to succeed David Moyes at Sunderland. Aberdeen’s wait for the Scottish Cup – they last won it in 1990 – goes on. “I’ve said it often enough, I love working here,” McInnes said after a game in which Jonny Hayes gave his side a brief early lead. “I think it’s a brilliant club. I feel at home here. It would take something special for me to want to leave.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/may/28/blackpool-exeter-city-league-two-play-off-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T16:12:17Z","webTitle":"Blackpool’s Mark Cullen sinks Exeter City in League Two play-off final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/28/blackpool-exeter-city-league-two-play-off-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/may/28/blackpool-exeter-city-league-two-play-off-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Blackpool’s Mark Cullen sinks Exeter City in League Two play-off final","bodyText":"Blackpool bounced back to League One at the first time of asking with victory over Exeter City in the League Two play-off final at Wembley, with Mark Cullen poking home the winner midway through the second half to spark joyous scenes in the Tangerine half of the stadium. Well, a corner of it anyway. That so few Blackpool fans – only just over 5,000 – were here to witness what should have been a celebratory occasion is testament to the depth of resentment against the Oyston family’s ownership of the club. This result will prompt mixed feelings for those on the Fylde coast who fear a victory for the team is a victory for the regime. On their last trip to the national stadium, for the Championship play-off final in 2012, more than 30,000 Blackpool fans were in attendance. Two years earlier around 37,000 made the trip south to see Ian Holloway’s side reach the Premier League. This time around one end of Wembley cut a sorry sight, with little more than a third of the bottom tier occupied. The Blackpool Supporters’ Trust’s boycott that has been in effect at Bloomfield Road all season made for a startling sight in the grander surrounds of Wembley. “It’s shame because it would have been great to have more here,” said the Blackpool manager, Gary Bowyer, who knows something about unpopular owners from his time working under the Venky’s regime at Blackburn Rovers. “But on the first day that I walked into the club I said that we couldn’t control it. I was used to that situation at Blackburn, where fans were unhappy with the owners, so I used the experience from that time and just concentrated on what we can affect, which is the football.” Other than League One football, what the future holds for Blackpool remains unclear, though the next chapter is likely to be written this summer when the club president, Valeri Belokon, and the Oystons take their multimillion-pound legal battle to the high court. No end to the conflict is in sight, though, and the boycotts seem certain to continue at Bloomfield Road next season. Though off the field the club is riven with division, the same could not be said for those on the pitch. Having lost their captain, Tom Aldred, to injury midway through the first half and seen Exeter dominate before the break, a spell of pressure that resulted in David Wheeler cancelling out Brad Potts’s early opening goal, Bowyer’s side rallied to be the better side in the second period and Cullen’s winner was by no means undeserved. “It’s unbelievable,” said Bowyer. “It’s an amazing feeling and it’ll stay with the players for a long, long time.” While Blackpool’s joy was tempered by their ownership issues, in the despair of defeat Exeter’s supporters could take solace from the fact that their club is in the hands of the fans and has been since 2003. They can also look forward to next season with optimism, having enjoyed a remarkable resurgence since the autumn. “I’ve lost here before and won here before so I know both sides of the coin,” said the manager, Paul Tisdale, whose injury-plagued side were bottom of the Football League in mid-November. “When you lose you feel a little bit cold to emotion. Immediately your mind turns to next season and what you need to do. It hurts but you don’t have that release of emotion that you get when you win. We’ll have a couple of weeks to let it settle, then start getting ready for next year.” Both these sides were on the right end of 6-5 aggregate scorelines in the semi-finals (and both were the beneficiaries of 95th-minute winners), so goals were to be expected and those in tangerine who did buck the boycott saw their side take the lead after a mere 130 seconds. Cullen beautifully created it with a fine touch and a smart pass inside, and the onrushing Potts swept the ball past Christy Pym in the Exeter goal. Exeter responded in calm, controlled fashion and were almost back on terms within 10 minutes, only for Sam Slocombe brilliantly to deny Ollie Watkins. Instead they had to wait for the equaliser, which eventually came five minutes before the break. Craig Woodman’s quick free-kick from deep caught out the Blackpool defence, by now shorn of the injured Aldred, and Wheeler cleverly lobbed the stranded Slocombe. City had dominated the first half but the interval broke their momentum. They had barely escaped their own half in 20 second-half minutes when Potts stormed into the penalty area and scuffed his shot across goal. Pym’s faint touch was enough to divert the ball into the path of Cullen, who poked home with little more than his studs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/may/28/man-shot-bangor-supermarket-car-park-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T18:12:46Z","webTitle":"Man shot in front of his son in Northern Ireland supermarket car park","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/man-shot-bangor-supermarket-car-park-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/man-shot-bangor-supermarket-car-park-northern-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Man shot in front of his son in Northern Ireland supermarket car park","bodyText":"A man who was shot in a supermarket car park in Northern Ireland has died from his injuries, police confirmed. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said the victim of the fatal shooting was a 35-year-old man who died on Sunday evening in hospital. The incident happened in front of shoppers outside Sainsbury’s store in Bangor, Co Down, on Sunday afternoon. It is understood the victim was shot four times after he had just got out of a car. There were reports children were in the car when it pulled up in the car park. One of the children who witnessed the shooting was the dead man’s three-year-old son. Shoppers said someone performed CPR on the wounded man as he lay on the ground. DS Keith Wilson said: “Detectives have now launched a murder investigation and I would ask anyone who may have witnessed this incident or anyone who has any information to contact police on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 870 28/05/17. “Alternatively, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.” Alan Chambers, Ulster Unionist assembly member for North Down, tweeted from the area: A major security operation was launched around the area, with the PSNI setting up a cordon blocking access to the car park. The PSNI helicopter also flew above the scene of the shooting earlier. It is understood that the victim was targeted due to an internal feud inside a unit of the Ulster Defence Association. The feuding centres on the UDA’s so-called South East Antrim Brigade which has already claimed one life so far this year. However, Sunday’s murder was the first time the power struggle based around control of the UDA unit’s criminal empire moved beyond the South East Antrim area and into another part of Northern Ireland. Stephen Farry, assembly member for the cross-community Alliance party, said the killing had “sent shockwaves” through Bangor. Farry said: “This was a brutal incident, made all the more reckless and shocking by the fact it took place in a busy supermarket car park on a Sunday afternoon. Shoppers going about their regular business could have easily been on the end of this attack. “My thoughts are with the loved ones of the man shot dead. There can never be any excuse for carrying out such an act, which has left a man dead and a family mourning. “Violence has no place in our society and those who carried out this attack must be taken off the streets. I would urge anyone with information on it to contact police immediately.” Steven Agnew, the Green MLA for North Down, lives about two miles from the scene of the shooting. “I have heard reports of anything from four to six shots having been fired and I’ve heard from police reports that a man is injured. We would wish him well,” he said. “It’s very shocking that this took place in broad daylight on a busy shopping day with children and families present. A large number of people will have been shocked by this incident.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/live/2017/may/28/cannes-2017-palme-dor-winners-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T19:22:24Z","webTitle":"Cannes 2017: Ruben Östlund's The Square wins the Palme d'Or – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/live/2017/may/28/cannes-2017-palme-dor-winners-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/live/2017/may/28/cannes-2017-palme-dor-winners-live","fields":{"headline":"Cannes 2017: Ruben Östlund's The Square wins the Palme d'Or – as it happened","bodyText":"Right, Cannes is over bar the shouting so I’m off. Head over to Guardian film shortly for Peter Bradshaw’s take on this year’s winners and for a gallery of the best red-carpet action. And congratulations to Mr Östlund and The Square. Au revoir! Netflix hogged many of the headlines at Cannes, but left the Croisette empty-handed, with neither Okja or The Meyerowitz Stories picking up a major award. That perhaps unsurprising, given that Pedro Almodovar was very critical of the streaming giant at the festival’s opening press conference. It will be interesting to see whether Netflix bothers turning up next year; Cannes have changed the rules for 2018 onward, meaning that a film has to have a release in French cinemas for competition, and Netflix are enormously resistant to French theatrical releases. Here’s a bit more info on the spat: Another element to consider in regard to The Square’s win: Elisabeth Moss is having one hell of a year. She’s currently starring in The Handmaid’s Tale (starting right now on Channel 4!), and has another series of Top of the Lake coming out later this year. I got to watch some of the latter at Cannes this week, and loved it: As for Will Smith, he “absolutely loves” Jupiter’s Moon, Kornél Mundruczó’s fantastical allegory about a refugee who can fly. “I thought it was fantastic. I will watch it again and again.” “Sometimes democracy sucks”, he adds when someone asks why it didn’t win a prize. Pedro gets emotional while talking about 120 Beats Per Minute and the importance of LGBT filmmaking, and gets a round of applause in response. “I can’t love it more”, he says of the film. I suspect it was his choice for the Palme. Here’s the Guardian’s news story on The Square’s surprise victory: I think it was a pretty great choice for the Palme, on reflection. Daring, unsettling and irreverent, which is a quality that you can’t really attribute to the past couple of winners. “A couple of black folks won’t hurt things next year”, adds Will Smith. He’s completely right – this was a lineup almost entirely lacking in minority voices. Jessica Chastain says that it was “disturbing” to see how female characters were depicted in the films in the Official Selection. She says that we need female storytellers to create more authentic female characters. In a recent interview with the Guardian Chastain lamented the lack not only of female directors in the industry, but of female critics. The jury is asked whether the process was easy or not. “It was relatively easy. I was just trying to get Pedro to stop offering me sexual favours for my vote,” says Will Smith, who is clearly trying to out-Sutherland Sutherland here. The Jury press conference is just about to get underway. We’ll hear from all eight jury members, plus president Pedro Almodovar. Last year’s Jury press conference was notable for a deeply odd performance from Donald Sutherland. I’m hoping for similar here, ideally from Will Smith. The failure of Lynne Ramsay or Sofia Coppola to win the top prize means that Jane Campion remains the only female director to win the Palme in the 70 years of the festival. Campion addressed the issue in an interview with Vulture earlier this week, and let’s just say she didn’t mince her words: “Too long! Twenty-four years! And before that, there was no one. It’s insane. And I’m really annoyed that the director-ess from Toni Erdmann didn’t win last time. I thought, ‘Finally, a buddy’. No. No! There’s no more guys winning. That’s it. It’s just going to be women winning from now on.” Here’s what Twitter’s great and good are saying about The Square on Twitter. General consensus seems to be that it was a decent enough choice for the top prize, but could have done with a bit of a trim (it is rather long at two hours and 20 minutes): Here’s what Peter Bradshaw made of The Square: Östlund may have been inspired by Roy Andersson or maybe Lars Von Trier. There is a drop of Buñuel there too – but Östlund’s own signature is plain. This is high wire cinema. Ruben Östlund’s acerbic satire of the art world wins the big prize. It’s a gloriously odd and very funny film, but I must admit I didn’t see it winning the Palme. The Square!!!! Kidman, who has appeared in no less than three films and a TV show in Cannes, has already headed home, so Will Smith is jokingly accepting the award on his behalf. Oh, no she’s pre-recorded a message, on what looks like a cameraphone. She’s gutted not to be there, etc etc A 70th Anniversary Jury Prize has been invented on the fly. It’s won by... Nicole Kidman. Which film is going to win the Palme then? I’ve genuinely no idea at this stage. Might Haneke get a record-breaking fourth Palme for Happy End? Could Sergei Loznitsa’s widely admired A Gentle Creature steal it? 120 Beats Per Minute! Widely tipped to win the Palme, but has to be satisfied with second prize. Sofia Coppola for the Beguiled! Some surprising groans at that news in the press room. If Best Actress was seen as an underwhelming race this year, Best Actor was formidably competitive. It’s difficult to quibble with Joaquin’s performance, though I would have loved to have seen Robert Pattinson rewarded for his intense turn in Good Time. Joaquin’s wearing what look suspiciously like Converse trainers. He didn’t get the Cannes heels memo, clearly. Joaquin Phoenix wins for You Were Never Really Here! Irene Jacob and Paolo Sorrentino hand out the best actress gong, which goes to... Diane Kruger for her performance in Fatih Akin’s In the Fade! Not a particularly well-received film amongst the critics, but she was the best thing about it. Andrey Zvyagintsev wins the Jury Prize for Loveless. It’s not the one he wanted, or that many were expecting for the film. Richly deserved award for Lynne Ramsay, and particularly impressive given that she was still editing the film right up to the first press screening on Friday! “We have our first surprise of the night”, announces Pedro. Best screenplay is a joint award for A Killing of a Sacred Deer and Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here. Crikey, they don’t mess about at Cannes, do they? We’re already onto the main Competition awards. Pedro has just introduced the other jury members in a slightly X-Factor-y manner. They’re reclining on a sofa area that looks vaguely like the VIP section of a Swansea nightclub. Next up, the Short Film award, hosted by Uma Thurman and Cristian Mungiu. Qiu Yang’s A Gentle Night wins the gong, which causes the Chinese members of the Cannes press room to whoop heartily. “Fucking amazing,” is Qiu’s own response. The Camera d’Or award for best debut film goes to Léonor Sérraille’s Jeune Femme (Montparnasse Bienvenue). Monica Bellucci is delivering the opening speech. At the moment she’s just reeling off a very long list of Cannes favourite directors and actors over its 70 years. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw has dusted off his crystal ball/glowing Saudi Arabian orb and has made some predictions for tonight’s awards. He’s gone for Loveless for the Palme, though that was before all the red carpet rumours started swirling. The Cannes red carpet is predictably swarming with famous folk, all looking as glamorous as you’d expect. We’ve just got a glimpse of this year’s Cannes Jury, which is headed up by 2017 president Pedro Almodóvar. Joining him are a motley crew of actors, directors, screenwriters and the impossible-to-categorise ball of enthusiasm known as Will Smith. Smith just gave his verdict on this year’s selection. “Spectacular,” he said, before legging it to avoid having to talk to the incredibly annoying Canal+ red carpet interviewer man for a second longer. But what about this year’s competitors? Usually you can make some fairly solid assumptions about who’s won what by looking at the attendees and no-shows on the red carpet. So far we’ve seen Lynne Ramsay and co for her bruising thriller You Were Never Really Here, and the cast of 120 Beats per Minute, but my colleague Andrew Pulver has pointed out that there doesn’t seem to have been any sign of Andrey Zvyagintsev and the cast of Loveless, which might suggest that the film has been snubbed. Juicy rumour alert: It’s not just the Palme that will be handed out this eve, of course. There’s also a host of slightly-less-important-but-still-pretty-significant awards to be doled out beforehand, including Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, the Jury Prize and the Grand Prix. Let’s not forget the gongs that have already been given out. In the Un Certain Regard section of the festival, Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof’s A Man of Integrity won the top prize, April’s Daughter by Spanish filmmaker Michel Franco won the Jury prize, Mathieu Amalric’s Barbara won the evocatively titled Prize for the Best Poetic Narrative, Jasmine Trinca took home Best Actress for her turn in Sergio Castellitto’s Fortunata and Taylor Sheridan won Best Director for Wind River. The Fipresci (the International Federation of Film Critics) prizes have also been doled out, with 120 Beats per Minute nabbing Best Film. The same film, perhaps unsurprisingly, also took home the Queer Palm. And let’s not forget the most prestigious award of the lot: the Palm Dog. That went to Bruno, the lovably dishevelled poodle from Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected). Well done all. After a fortnight of fun, films and al fresco dining, the 70th Cannes film festival is winding down, though not before we find out which of the 19 films in the Official Competition will be strolling off into the sunset with the Palme d’Or. It looks a wide-open race, lacking an out-and-out favourite. Perhaps the most critically acclaimed of this year’s selection is the austere Russian drama Loveless, directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev. A devastating tale of a young boy’s disappearance amid a bruising divorce, the film was awarded a full five stars by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw, who also has tipped it to win the Palme. Zvyagintsev’s last film Leviathan was tipped for the top award in 2014, but in the end only took home Best Screenplay, so there might be a sense that the director is due the big gong this time around. Also considered a favourite is Robin Campillo’s 120 Beats per Minute, which has received widespread acclaim for its portrait of the Aids-awareness direct-action group Act Up. It’s a sharply told yet affecting work, and given the fact that socially conscious fare has dominated the Palme in the last two years – Jacques Audiard’s Dheepan, and Ken Loach’s I, Daniel Blake – it certainly shouldn’t be ruled out. Finally, for those after a dark horse, Sofia Coppola’s The Beguiled looks an intriguing option. It’s a wonderfully mordant Southern Gothic melodrama, with great performances from Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell and Kirsten Dunst. Only one female director has won the Palme in Cannes history - Jane Campion for the Piano – so it might feel like time to finally redress that imbalance. The ceremony begins at 7.15pm local time (6.15pm BST)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/28/england-barbarians-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T16:29:26Z","webTitle":"Nathan Earle gets inexperienced England started in win over Barbarians","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/28/england-barbarians-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/28/england-barbarians-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Nathan Earle gets inexperienced England started in win over Barbarians","bodyText":"Eddie Jones said before the game that the days of matches involving the Barbarians being swashbuckling, thrill-a-minute affairs that owed more to the Harlem Globetrotters than William Webb Ellis were long gone and his inexperienced side, that contained eight uncapped players and sported only five who had started a Test, showed why in a triumph of organisation over daring. The Barbarians tried to move the ball from everywhere from the kick-off, but foundered against a defence built on aggressive line speed and smothering to prevent off-loads. Light rain added to their difficulty in getting the ball wide and mistakes abounded. Long before the end of the first half, the match deteriorated into a stop-start affair that was blighted by the whistle. Even teams as weakened as England are so well drilled and prepared that a team playing its first match together and indulging in off-the-cuff rugby is vulnerable no matter its pedigree and experience. It made for lean end-of-season fare, 28 penalties further stemming what was a trickle rather than a flow. Not that England’s head coach would have been bothered given the way his players remained faithful to the gameplan, marshalled by the co-captains George Ford and Chris Robshaw who, along with Mike Brown at full-back, made timely interventions. The England player who stood out was the Saracens wing Nathan Earle, not least because of his searing pace that made his opposite number and cap centurion Adam Ashley-Cooper look a lumbering front rower in comparison. Earle scored England’s first try after 13 minutes after exchanging passes with Sam James and, typical of a player from his club, was also prominent in defence. Close behind him was the 18-year-old flanker Tom Curry, who started on the bench in place of his injured twin brother, Ben. He entered the field on 36 minutes after Sam Underhill, who is seen as England’s long-term solution at openside wing forward, suffered a shoulder injury, as the centre Alex Lozowski had 20 minutes before. Underhill made one thumping tackle but was trampled over by the centre Yann David, at times too intent on making a big hit, like an early model Courtney Lawes. Curry focused more on the breakdown and it was his turnover of the former South Africa centre Frans Steyn after 67 minutes that sealed victory. Steyn is no lightweight but he was dumped to the ground and ruthlessly dispossessed by Curry for Ford to combine with Charlie Ewels to create a try for Nick Isiekwe, the third Saracens second row to play for England this year. It put the home side, who by then had survived on 35 % of possession, 23-7 ahead and out of sight. Four of England’s lineup had started 17 Premiership matches between them this season, Earle, Isiekwe, the prop Will Collier and the hooker Jack Singleton, Worcester’s third choice in the position who, apart from a few lineout overthrows, did not suffer in comparison to his more decorated opposite number, Richard Hibbard. It was a typical performance by a Jones side, all hustle and bustle, waiting for opportunities where the Barbarians, while looking to secure quick ball from the breakdown, often attacked for the sake of it. The invitation side started by winding the clock back to the beginning of 1973 when Phil Bennett, in difficulties near his own goalline, started the move that led to the game’s most celebrated try while playing for the Barbarians against New Zealand. Alex Goode played the role of Bennett, under pressure from Earle near his own line and desperately trying to find an escape route. He somehow found one and the ball was moved right to the Fiji wing Timoci Nagusa who set off on one of the those galloping runs his countrymen are renowned for, all legs and arms with defenders bouncing off him. As he was finally being hauled down, Nagusa flicked the ball out of the back of his hand and suddenly the Barbarians were in England’s 22 with a scrum-half, as in 1973, heading for the tryline. However, unlike Gareth Edwards, Kahn Fotuali’i did not hug the touchline but decided to cut infield where he was mown down by Brown and England then managed to scramble back to kill the attack. The Barbarians were never as threatening again. They scored two tries, the first through Ashley-Cooper after England’s line speed for once failed them and Robbie Fruean managed to stay upright in the tackle after a set-piece move and offload to Goode while the second row Joe Tekori, who had earlier been unluckily denied a try on review, was on hand to support a surge by the former France captain Thierry Dusautoir in what, if he does not take part in the Barbarians’ match in Ulster on Wednesday, will have been the final appearance of his 16-year senior career. Danny Care, by then playing on the wing, scored England’s third try with the final move of the match. Ford’s three penalties either side of the break had kept England comfortably ahead and as fatigue kicked in, the Barbarians conceded even more penalties. England’s squad gather this week to prepare for the two-Test tour of Argentina, leaving for Buenos Aires on Saturday. Jones said he expected Lozowski and Underhill to be fit by the time of departure and the Sale wing Denny Solomona, who was ruled out of the match against the Barbarians because of a foot injury, will join up on Monday. “The injuries are not too serious and they should be right to tour,” said Jones. “We will see how Denny is after he has a run with us. I was really pleased with the way the young guys applied themselves against a Barbarians team that had more than 40 caps a man. We had to play smart to win and we did that. Some of them had not played much Premiership rugby, but they prepared well and gave it everything.” England Brown; Earle (Wigglesworth, 72), James, Lozowski (Haley, 15), May; Ford, Care; Genge (Harrison, 68), Singleton (McGuigan, 61), Collier (Ford-Robinson, 64), Ewels, Isiekwe (Spencer, 68), Robshaw, Underhill (T Curry, 36), Beaumont (Wilson, 47).

Like her stablemate Churchill on Saturday, she was following up on an authoritative success in the Newmarket equivalent three weeks ago and, also like him, she is now an even-money favourite for a Royal Ascot race next month – in her case, the Coronation Stakes. O’Brien has enjoyed so many such victories that even dedicated racing fans can hardly be expected to be thrilled by each one, especially when he wins yet another Irish Classic and when the winner is unbackably short, as Winter was at odds of 8-13. But the significance of this particular achievement should not be missed. The Irish Guineas have been staged for almost 100 years. In all that time, no trainer has ever managed to win both of them and both of the English Guineas in the same year; not Vincent O’Brien, not Sir Henry Cecil, not Sir Michael Stoute or Harry Wragg or Paddy Prendergast. While O’Brien is certainly provided with excellent material by his Coolmore employers, it would be rash in the extreme to imagine many other trainers would do just as well in the same situation. In the case of Winter, this is a horse who won only once from three starts for a different trainer last year. She is now only the third filly to complete the Newmarket/Curragh double. As ever, O’Brien responded to compliments and congratulations by praising the many folk at his Ballydoyle stable who contribute to each horse’s continued health and wellbeing. It fell to Ryan Moore, the winning jockey in both of this weekend’s Classics, to attempt an assessment of O’Brien’s merit. “Aidan is an absolute pleasure for me to work with,” Moore said. “From the first time I rode for him, he’s just made it very easy for me. These horses, he turns them out magnificently every time, they continually hold their form so well, right through the year, and the way he gets horses back, they recover from their races, they always look so well. He’s got a great feel for a horse, he sees things from a different direction. They’re prepared so meticulously. He’s very special.” The big question now is whether this team can sustain their fine form as far as next weekend, for the Oaks and the Derby at Epsom. Moore said no discussions had yet taken place about which of O’Brien’s six Derby entrants he will ride but it will be a major surprise if he does not end up on the well-fancied Cliffs Of Moher and indeed the vibes from Ballydoyle, such as they are, point in that direction. Perhaps when Moore is confirmed for the ride on Thursday, it will push Cliffs Of Moher past Cracksman at the top of the Derby betting. It seems the question of which is O’Brien’s next best chance is more up in the air, with Venice Beach the obvious one but Capri apparently still in the discussion. For his part, O’Brien would say no more than that he had “six very strong possibles” for the Derby, as well as “two very strong possibles”, Rhododendron and Alluringly, for the Oaks. Highland Reel and Idaho will run for him in the Coronation Cup but US Army Ranger will probably be found a different target. Meanwhile, O’Brien’s mentor in years gone by, Jim Bolger, was evidently furious about interference suffered by his Bean Feasa during the 1,000 Guineas. She was squeezed against the inside rail in a concertina effect caused by Pat Smullen on Rehana. Both horses finished unplaced and Smullen got a one-day ban. “It was very obviously dangerous riding … disgraceful riding,” Bolger said. “The filly is fine but it could have been otherwise. There’s no excuse for that sort of carry-on.” The other Group One on this card, the Tattersalls Gold Cup, was won by the Wiltshire-based Roger Charlton with Decorated Knight. Charlton once said that having any runner at The Curragh felt like entering the lion’s den, an oblique reference to O’Brien’s domination here, but the Englishman has now won this race three times in five years. Charlton thinks of Decorated Knight as a horse who really prefers a sound surface, so he was less than delighted, while at Goodwood on Saturday, to find his phone buzzing with a steady stream of pictures showing the effects of an inch of rain in Kildare. But the track took it well and was probably no worse than good to soft on this day. There is also a feeling that Decorated Knight, the winner of five of his last seven starts, has been underestimated. But he has done enough to earn a stallion’s career now, so there is no need for Charlton to scout around for winnable Group Ones in the US or elsewhere. The horse’s next target is the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot. “He just keeps on improving,” Charlton said. “If Minding had turned up, it would have been a different story but he won with his ears pricked, he was pulling up in front and then Somehow came to him and he picked up again. You can’t do more than that.” It is to be hoped Decorated Knight has a happier season than last year, when he was sidelined from July by a long cut to a foreleg sustained in a freak accident while stabled at Chicago for the Arlington Million. Some time after 4am, he got out of his box and had free run of the Arlington barn, possibly injuring himself by tripping over a metal fan. Security staff were in the area but could not work out how the horse came to be loose.

Theresa Marteau, director of the behaviour and health research unit at Cambridge University, said her team had looked at 18th-century wine glasses at the Ashmolean museum in Oxford, 19th-century wine glasses owned by Buckingham Palace, and more recent glasses in John Lewis catalogues and the evidence was clear: they had got bigger. “There has been a gradual increase in capacity from 65ml to 450ml,” she told Hay festival. “The key period was the 1990s.” Size matters because the bigger the glass the more we are inclined to consume, she said. Her team carried out a six-week experiment in a Cambridge wine bar where 175ml of wine was sold in three different sized glasses at different times. Sales in the biggest glasses rose 14%, with no difference in the other two. Plates and dishes are also getting bigger, which may be one of the reasons 65% of the UK population is overweight or obese. Marteau described an experiment where two sets of people sat at a dinner table eating soup. One couple had a bottomless soup bowl that was gradually filled up from below while the others had a standard bowl. The first couple ate twice as much but felt as full as the ones who ate from the normal soup bowl. Smaller plates and dishes would have an effect on public health, Marteau said. “If we made sizes smaller for all food tableware, for every occasion we encounter food the effects of size would be to reduce how much we consume by up to 16% in adults per day.” Marteau’s team looks at why information about the risks of smoking, drinking, eating and not doing enough exercise does not seem to change our unhealthy behaviour. Sometimes it was as simple as the message, she said. A warning that the ice is thin and you may die is more offputting than a message that the sofa you are sitting on could be a killer. Our environment also has a strong influence on behaviour, whether that is how safe streets are to go for walks on, or how big the products are with a slice of white bread increasing in size by 11% in 20 years in the UK. Marteau said she was not at Hay plugging a book; all of the research carried out by her team is available free online.

It is remembered as one of the most important meetings in recent political history: the two candidates for leadership of the Labour party sitting down in a north London restaurant to put aside their differences and sort things out. But what really happened? Balls, one of Brown’s key lieutenants, told Hay festival that the meeting followed lots of discussions in advance, but “the fact that I was there means that Gordon wasn’t fully committed to the process”. It was a Mediterranean restaurant not to the taste of Brown. “Gordon was appalled by the menu. Honestly he turned to me and said [adopting Brown’s voice], ‘what is polenta?’” Balls decided he should let the two men get on with it. “As I left I said, ‘I have to go.’ Tony was sitting there nervously with his starter, thinking ‘what the hell is Ed Balls doing here at my absolutely key vital dinner?’ I said [to Brown], ‘I’ll see you back at the Atrium when you’re done,’ and he said, ‘steak and chips.’ It obviously shows he wasn’t fully committed to the meal.” Blair and Brown did come to an arrangement, said Balls. Not about how long Blair would be leader but how Brown would be the “driver” for social and economic policies in any Labour government. Brown was devastated that he did not succeed John Smith - who died unexpectedly in May 1994 - but he got over it, said Balls. “It was a big shock to him ... but also Gordon is a realist. He accepted quite quickly that it was not going to be him and the question was, what was the arrangement, how would they work together and that was all to be sorted out at the Granita restaurant.” Balls conceded there were rocky moments between the two men but that could be a good thing. If there had been more “grit” in the relationship between David Cameron and his chancellor George Osborne there may not have been a referendum to leave the EU, said Balls. Balls was involved in Labour politics for more than 20 years before losing his parliamentary seat in 2015. It was personally devastating although perhaps not quite as bad as some friends and colleagues imagined. After the vote he went to his agent’s house in Morley. “They were all saying, ‘you had a good innings, you made a good contribution, people are really going to miss you.’ I had to say, ‘I am not dead.’” It got worse when someone brought in a tray with 30 glasses and a bottle of Harveys Bristol Cream to raise a glass for the demise of Balls. Balls made a comeback on reality TV, as something of a dad-dancer on series 14 of Strictly Come Dancing, being finally voted out in week 10. He revealed to Hay that it was his wife, fellow Labour politician Yvette Cooper, who said he had to go on in order to lose weight, and that the BBC had refused to allow him to have a plunging neckline. Balls is out of Westminster with no plans to return. “It was quite a surprise for a former politician to become a reality TV star and embarrass his children. It is obviously more shocking to see a former reality TV star become president of the United States.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/may/28/donald-trump-paris-climate-deal-g7","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T14:50:17Z","webTitle":"Trump plan on Paris climate deal unclear after G7 pressure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/28/donald-trump-paris-climate-deal-g7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/may/28/donald-trump-paris-climate-deal-g7","fields":{"headline":"Trump plan on Paris climate deal unclear after G7 pressure","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s intentions regarding US participation in the Paris climate deal remained unknown on Sunday, as one report cited “confidants” saying the president had made up his mind to pull out while a senior cabinet figure said he was “quite certain the president is wide open on this issue”. Trump said in a tweet on Saturday: “I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!” The message was published as Trump left Sicily after the G7 summit. Leaders of the other G7 nations – Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan – issued a communique confirming their support for the climate deal, which was reached with contributions from Barack Obama in 2015 and signed the following year. A report from the Axios news outlet, however, cited “three sources with direct knowledge” as saying Trump had told confidants including the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, that he plannned to pull the US out of the deal. In an interview broadcast on CBS’s Face the Nation, meanwhile, defense secretary James Mattis said the White House had “obviously got a discussion going on about our policy in this regard”. He added: “And I was sitting in on some of the discussions in Brussels, by the way, where climate change came up, and the president was open, he was curious about why others were in the position they were in … and I’m quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.” Mattis said that as defense secretary, such negotiations were “not inside my portfolio”, but added: “Obviously we deal with the aspects of a warming climate in the Department of Defense, and to us, that’s just another one of the many factors we deal with which we call the physical environment.” The White House did not immediately respond to media requests for comment. On Sunday morning, however, the president offered comment of his own, via Twitter, that might have been aimed at the anonymous sources cited in the Axios report. “It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media,” the president wrote. “Whenever you see the words ‘sources say’ in the fake news media, and they don’t mention names it is very possible that those sources don’t exsist [sic] but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!” A source who had been in contact with people involved in the decision told Reuters that meetings were planned with chief executives of energy companies and big corporations and others about the climate agreement, ahead of Trump’s expected announcement. It was unclear whether those meetings would still take place. In Sicily, Trump, who has called global warming a hoax created by the Chinese and who campaigned on a promise to pull out of the Paris deal, came under concerted pressure from the other leaders to honour the agreement. “The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very dissatisfying,” the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told reporters. “There are no indications whether the United States will stay in the Paris agreement or not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/may/28/goodwill-shines-amid-manchesters-tragedy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T17:50:47Z","webTitle":"Goodwill shines amid Manchester’s tragedy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/goodwill-shines-amid-manchesters-tragedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/may/28/goodwill-shines-amid-manchesters-tragedy","fields":{"headline":"Goodwill shines amid Manchester’s tragedy","bodyText":"On behalf of the city of Manchester, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those around the country and indeed the world who have stood in solidarity with us in the aftermath of the sickening terrorist attack on Manchester Arena. This has been one of the darkest weeks in the city’s history. But the outpouring of goodwill, messages of support, offers of help and not least the generosity of donations to the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund set up to help those affected by the atrocity has helped shine a positive light. From the largest donation, such as the amazing £1m pledged jointly by Manchester City and Manchester United football clubs, to the smallest gestures of kindness, Manchester has not been alone. We have been touched by thousands of heartfelt messages of condolence from across the globe, the vast majority from everyday citizens, and the mass of floral tributes left by those touched by the tragedy. Local government colleagues across Greater Manchester have lent us staff and other support as we have worked hard with public sector colleagues to help the city through this terrible time. The people of Manchester themselves have shown remarkable spirit: people of all backgrounds coming together to show their determination not to allow those who seek to sow fear and division to win. Our business community too have conducted themselves immaculately, putting the emphasis on community as well as showing their support for the city. Our thoughts remain very much with the victims of this sickening attack but Manchester as a city is showing resilience and moving forwards. We owe it to those who lost their lives.

Residents described their houses shaking and hearing a loud blast as officers forced their way into the semi-detached property in Searby Road in the Gorton area of Manchester at about 7pm on Sunday. Abedi was listed at the property along with his older brother, Ismail, who was arrested shortly after the terror attack on Monday and remains in police custody. Teresa McDowell, a resident of the area, said: “We heard this really loud explosion and then the police were everywhere. We’ve never seen anything like it before. We had no idea what was going on. The bang was so loud that my daughter who lives a 15-minute walk away also heard it.” Another resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said a Libyan man who had lived in the house for about a decade had been arrested. He said: “It was the Libyan lad and they put him in the back of the police van. They did the door with an explosion and then they all went in and we saw them getting him out. I’m not sure what his name is but he’d lived here for a long time.” Earlier, screams and a blast were heard as armed police raided another property elsewhere in Manchester. Residents reported hearing explosions near Quantock Close and Selworth Road in the Moss Side area shortly before 2pm on Sunday. Dogs were seen at the scene and police closed off roads in the area. The street was cordoned off and shouts could be heard at about 3pm as a man was held on the ground at gunpoint before being put in a police van. Neighbours said the family in the raided house were Libyan. Another address in Rusholme was raided on Sunday evening but no arrests were made. The police activity continued in the early hours of Monday when a 23-year-old man was arrested in Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex, on “suspicion of offences contrary to the terrorism act”, Greater Manchester police said, bringing to 14 the number in custody related to the Manchester attack inquiry. There were also raids on addresses in Whalley Range and Chester but no arrests. The raids came six days after the attack at Manchester Arena carried out by Salman Abedi, which killed 22 people and injured dozens more. Fifteen people have now been arrested in connection with the investigation, two of whom have since been released without charge. Thirteen men remain in custody for questioning. Shortly after the raid on the house in Moss Side, a note could be seen pinned to the door saying the occupants had nothing to do with last Monday’s bombing. Shortly after the raid in Moss Side, police released a statement saying they had also arrested a 25-year-old man in the Old Trafford area on suspicion of offences contrary to the Terrorism Act. Stephen Cawley, who lives on the Moss Side street where the raid took place, said his neighbours’ children had been taken away by the police. Two brothers, believed to be aged about 19 and 15, were taken from the Sadigh household while the eldest son, aged 24, was forced to the ground and had a gun pointed to his head, neighbours said. All were later released. One resident said they heard one of the boys complaining about “police brutality” before walking down the street. The family later posted a notice on their damaged front door. It read: It read: “This is what the police has caused and we have nothing to do with what happened in the bombing attack.” The teenagers’ parents were being spoken to by police in a car parked on the road. The whereabouts of their two youngest siblings, a boy and a girl, were not known. Cawley said the family had lived in the house for about a decade. He described the father as a handyman and said the family were “no trouble”. He said: “Me and my wife were sat in the kitchen and we heard what sounded like a bomb going off. It frightened the life out of us. It was so scary. Just such a loud bang and then there was the army and police everywhere and dogs. “It was the eldest lad who had the gun pointed at his head because he was resisting – but then they let him go. The other two have been taken in and the mum and dad are sat in a car opposite. “We’re not allowed to leave the house. My grandchildren were meant to be coming round for Sunday dinner but we’ve been told to cancel everything and stay inside.” One of the boys who is suspected of being arrested, changed his Facebook profile picture to include the message: “#PrayforManchester We are with you!” on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said: “During the search, three men were arrested on suspicion of offences contrary to the terrorism act but were soon after de-arrested.” Images posted on social media showed armed officers in Moss Side amid reports of an explosion. Police would not comment on whether a controlled blast was used to gain entrance to the property, a tactic used on previous raids. One resident wrote on Twitter: “There was an explosion about half an hour ago on Selworthy Road, Moss Side. There is armed police and dogs surrounding the area.” As the huge counter-terror operation continued, the NHS said 54 people injured in the attack were still being treated in eight hospitals, with 19 receiving critical care. A total of 116 people required hospital care, police previously said. The latest police operation came just hours after the home secretary said members of bomber Abedi’s terror network could still be at large. Amber Rudd said parts of the suicide attacker’s circle were “potentially” unaccounted for, despite optimism that a previous wave of arrests had quelled further threats. On Saturday night, police issued CCTV stills of Abedi, wearing glasses and casual clothes, in a plea for information about his movements between 18 May and the attack. Hours after he was captured on camera, the 22-year-old was dead, having attacked a concert by American singer Ariana Grande attended predominantly by young girls. The huge police response that followed involved raids in several cities as counter-terror efforts focused on cornering his suspected criminal ring. The Guardian understands investigators believe Abedi had help in storing the materials, buying the chemicals to make the homemade explosive and obtaining bolts and screws that were wrapped around the device. The metal shrapnel was particularly deadly, with the force of the explosion causing a spray of lethal projectiles in the foyer of the Manchester Arena. It is also believed that Abedi had assistance in designing the device and that it is unlikely he merely got instructions from the internet. He was involved in building the device and may have had help in this, or may have built it wholly on his own at a rented flat in Granby Street, in Manchester city centre. The pursuit of members of the wider network that helped Abedi continues. Investigators believe they have the main players in custody and have accounted for all the known materials used to make the explosive device. At other addresses, “dual use” items – those with everyday as well as dangerous applications – such as wire-strippers have been found. The hunt continues for suspected less important conspirators as soldiers deployed on the streets prepare to return to barracks after the UK’s terror threat level was reduced from critical to severe. Mark Rowley, Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, said on Saturday: “We are getting a greater understanding of the preparation of the bomb. There will be more searches but the greater clarity and progress has led JTAC [Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre], the independent body which assesses threat, to the judgment that an attack is no longer imminent.” Those in custody are Abedi’s family members, friends, people with Libyan heritage and others. Criminal charges are expected against some of those detained."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/may/28/sebastian-vettel-wins-monaco-f1-gp-lewis-hamilton","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T14:00:07Z","webTitle":"Sebastian Vettel wins Monaco F1 GP to extend lead over Lewis Hamilton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/28/sebastian-vettel-wins-monaco-f1-gp-lewis-hamilton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/may/28/sebastian-vettel-wins-monaco-f1-gp-lewis-hamilton","fields":{"headline":"Sebastian Vettel wins Monaco F1 GP to extend lead over Lewis Hamilton","bodyText":"The stony demeanour said it all for Kimi Raikkonen by the close of the Monaco Grand Prix and, while the Ice Man is renowned for giving nothing away in public, that he was not happy at how his race had panned out was clear. That he was beaten into second by his team-mate Sebastian Vettel was plainly to the German’s advantage in his battle for the Formula One world championship with Lewis Hamilton. That conflict is positively heating up but the suggestion that Ferrari manipulated the strategy to ensure the result suggests a potential cold war within the team. Passing is always virtually impossible on Monte Carlo’s streets, the more so with this season’s wider cars, and pit tactics were likely to decide the race. Hamilton was already out of the equation, starting from 13th, from which he recovered well to score six points for his seventh place. With the Ferraris one and two off the start line and Raikkonen taking the lead into Sainte-Dévote he looked comfortable out in front and in position to have the priority on strategy. With track position all important at Monaco, that would usually entail staying out as long as possible. Ferrari pulled him in earlier than his team-mate, however, and he emerged into traffic. Vettel stayed out and put in some very strong laps in clean air on his older ultrasoft rubber and it was enough to take the lead from the Finn through his stop. The German’s take on the events was that it had not been arranged by his team. “From the team point of view there was no plan of any team orders or anything,” he said. “When Kimi stopped I was just going flat out as fast as I could. I was surprised when I came out ahead. It worked well for me to stay out longer. We’re racing, we get on well but I can understand that Kimi’s not entirely happy today. He drove well in the first stint and then got the message to go in. You do the pit stop and then you push. Obviously it’s a bad surprise when somebody comes out ahead. I’ll take it, there’s no reason to lie or anything. I’m very happy about it today but I can understand he’s upset.” The win puts Vettel 25 points clear of Hamilton in the championship after the Mercedes driver, having struggled putting his tyres into their temperature operating window all weekend, had to accept damage limitation as his role here. He and his team-mate Valtteri Bottas remain free to race and Ferrari have said the same applies to their drivers but Hamilton claimed this proved they were now favouring Vettel. “It’s clear to me that Ferrari have chosen their No1 driver,” he said. “They are pushing everything to make sure Sebastian will maximise all his weekends. In strategy that just doesn’t happen. For the leading car it’s very hard for him to get jumped by the second car unless the team decide to favour the other car – so that is very clear.” Raikkonen, who has not won a race since the 2013 Australian Grand Prix when he was with Lotus, looked to be more than aware this was a chance that had been manoeuvred out of his hands. “I got the bad end of the story today,” he said. “I mean it’s still second place but obviously it doesn’t count for a lot in my books at least.” Nor was he forthcoming on what rationale the team had for pulling him in when they did, with the data that would have shown there was a risk he would emerge among slower cars. “I don’t know,” he said when asked about the timing. “Obviously I have just finished the race. I have no idea. Obviously they have reasons for whatever we did. It doesn’t matter here or any other race. It’s not up to me to answer that.” It had not been an inspiring race and Monaco, so often a procession, is likely to remain so in the future with this season’s cars bringing passing all but to a close on the street circuit. Yet it was a huge result for Ferrari and not just in giving their man an entire race win lead in the title race. The Scuderia had not won here since Michael Schumacher took the flag in 2001, a gap the team had longed to fill. It was also the first time they have managed a one-two lock-out since the German Grand Prix in 2010, though that was perhaps not a race they will want to bring to the forefront of people’s memories too soon. That one-two was secured when the team ordered Felipe Massa to move over for Fernando Alonso, to widespread disapproval, and the incident ultimately led to the ban on team orders being revoked since it was impossible to police. The result here was not so clearly manipulated and as yet it cannot be proved definitively that they are favouring Vettel. In mitigation Raikkonen’s times were slightly dropping when they called him in. Equally Toto Wolff, the Mercedes director of motorsport, believed the strategy being in Vettel’s favour had been unexpected. “They deserved to win, they had the quickest car out there,” he said. “It wasn’t clear how the tyre would perform, they needed to pit one of their drivers and put them on the supersoft and, as it panned out, the supersoft was not quick enough. Sebastian was able to pull out some stunning laps and that gave him the advantage. I don’t think they saw that coming. It was the right result for the team and the championship but I don’t think it was orchestrated.” Behind them Hamilton had stayed out of trouble, going long before his stop to claim seventh, in the circumstances a relatively positive result. But he has dropped well behind Vettel in the title fight and this is the second race in which he has been unable to make the tyres work, something he acknowledged could not continue. “Of course I can’t afford another weekend like this, of course not,” he said. “The Ferraris are quick and seem to work everywhere, so these next 14 races are going to be very, very difficult. They have arguably the strongest car all year, like our car last year where it worked everywhere. This car is not working at every place we go to. The more races we do the more we learn and the stronger we get.” Hamilton and the team badly need a robust response before the next round in Canada on Sunday week if Ferrari are not to ensure Vettel extends his lead further."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/may/29/labour-heartland-voters-turning-blue-blair-post-industrial-corbyn-fourth-way","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-29T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"Can Labour win back its heartlands?

Not by turning blue","bodyText":"It’s only now we are beginning to realise how much the world changed in 2016. The UK voted for Brexit, the US elected Trump, Marine Le Pen emerged as a serious contender for the Elysée. Less obvious at the time was that a swath of former Labour voters in the north and Midlands, who had voted for Ukip in recent elections, began an unexpected journey into the Tory fold. A few weeks ago marked the 20th anniversary of Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide. It is hard to avoid the sense that an era has ended: an era defined as much by Blair as by any other figure. It began with the election of Bill Clinton in 1992. Clinton, then Blair, proposed a “third way” politics, neither right nor left. It maintained the core Thatcherite commitment to privatisation, low taxes, high profits, weak unions, competition, individualism and a deregulated financial sector. But it jettisoned the Victorian social morality and lightly coded racism of Thatcher, Reagan and the rest of the “new right”. The third way embraced feminism, anti-racism and gay rights, provided they didn’t challenge the economic status quo. Instead of socialism and democracy, it offered everyone the chance to compete in the labour market. Above all, the third way celebrated globalisation as the great engine of economic growth and progress towards a truly cosmopolitan culture. Cosmopolitan culture is not a bad idea. It implies a liberal, tolerant, non-exclusive attitude. Historically, this is a mindset typical of merchants, financiers, artists and intellectuals. But cosmopolitanism has also been embraced by radical workers, infused with the internationalist spirit of communism, and by the urban poor in places where multiculturalism has been a fact of daily life for generations. I think cosmopolitanism was a key reason why the New Labour coalition held together for as long as it did. There were always Labour voters in cities, in the more militant unions, in university towns and in the public sector, who would have preferred a more radical programme. But we knew from the bitter experience of the 1980s that there were not enough of us to win an election, at least in a country whose media was so skewed to the right. And after 18 years of Tory rule, we were relieved to have a government that at least encouraged an open, tolerant, sexually liberal and multi-ethnic culture to thrive. At the same time, as much as we resented the Iraq war and the private finance initiative, many of us were being offered a lifestyle that even our parents couldn’t have dreamed of. So we were acquiescent, even if never quite reconciled, to the New Labour agenda. But there were others, in the north and the Midlands, in small towns and post-industrial regions, who had a very different experience. They too belonged to social groups who had traditionally voted Labour. But the third way did not offer them the consolations that it offered those of us in the cities and professional classes. Instead it offered them an experience of permanent decline. Accepting globalisation as a fact of life, New Labour made no effort to bring back industrial jobs. When migrants came from eastern Europe, looking for work, many citizens of the post-industrial towns experienced this as a threat to their already precarious livelihoods, rather than as an opportunity for cultural enrichment. The alienation of provincial and post-industrial working-class voters, which has now reached a crisis point, particularly in the Midlands, did not begin with Corbyn, but with Blair, who was elected in 1997 on a historically low turnout. Between 1997 and 2010, Labour lost millions more working-class voters. But how have so many of them ended up going Tory? With memories of Thatcherism still strong, many “traditional” working-class voters were never going to vote Tory in the 1990s or early 2000s. During that time, many voted for nobody or flirted with the BNP. They were never going to vote for David Cameron, who espoused just the same mixture of neoliberal and cosmopolitan values as New Labour – the values now being championed by George Osborne as a newspaper editor. Many of these voters went to Ukip after 2010. But after voting for Brexit last year, many of them now appear ready to vote for a Conservative party which seems to have rejected cosmopolitan culture altogether. Does this mean that Labour has no choice but to reject its cosmopolitan legacy? This is the claim made by advocates of the “blue Labour” agenda, who think that only by rejecting internationalism, multiculturalism and social liberalism can Labour ever win back support. The trouble with this view is that the small towns and former mining regions are not Labour’s only heartlands. Labour is just as dependent on its supporters in the multicultural cities. And if it went back to Blairism, as others advocate, it is not clear who would be willing to support Labour now. The leave-voting heartlands would certainly not vote for Blair’s brand of Europhile neoliberalism. Is there another way? There could be. I don’t think the voters of the north and Midlands are congenitally xenophobic. But they want a vision of the future in which there is something for them: good jobs above all. Their rejection of cosmopolitan culture is primarily motivated by the fact that they have come to associate it with decades of de-industrialisation. A clear vision of an alternative future – and a break with 40 years of stagnation and decline – could yet win them over. Whether Labour can offer that remains to be seen, but the party’s improved poll showing, on the back of its first decisively social democratic manifesto for 30 years, suggests it is beginning to do just that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/may/28/coptic-christians-accuse-egypt-government","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-28T11:10:41Z","webTitle":"Coptic Christians accuse Egyptian government of failing to protect them","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/28/coptic-christians-accuse-egypt-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/may/28/coptic-christians-accuse-egypt-government","fields":{"headline":"Coptic Christians accuse Egyptian government of failing to protect them","bodyText":"Egypt’s Coptic Christians have accused the government of failing to protect them in the wake of an attack claimed by Islamic State on a bus convoy that killed at least 29 people and injured about 20 more. Relatives of some of those killed said the attack, which occurred after a group of gunmen stopped a convoy headed for the Saint Samuel monastery close to the southern Egyptian town of Minya, undermines the state of emergency in Egypt declared after a previous attack in April. Videos of the attack began to surfaced on social media networks on Sunday, two days after 29 were killed in the attack on a desert road south of the capital. Isis claimed responsibility for the attack on Friday. It was the fourth attack against Christians in Egypt since December to be claimed by the IS. The string of attacks have killed more than 100 and injured scores. One survivor, a small boy who seemed to be about six, said his mother pushed him under her seat and covered him with a bag. A young woman speaking from her hospital bed said the assailants ordered the women to surrender their jewelry and money before they opened fire, killing the men first and then some of the women. The woman said the gunmen were masked and wore military uniforms. Kirollos Mahrous, 19, and his 25-year-old cousin Guirguis Mahrous were two of those killed in Friday’s attack, as they travelled to the monastery for work. Guirguis, his friend Mina Adel said, was due to be married in the coming weeks. Adel later provided pictures showing a smiling and suited Guirguis next to his fiancee, and then one of injuries that killed him – with a large bullet hole under his left ear. “He tried to join the police force after he finished high school,” said Adel, “but he was turned down, because he’s Christian.” “The state of emergency isn’t making anything better, it’s as if it’s not there,” said Eid Fares Ishak, another cousin of Guirguis and Kirollos. “The government is supposed to take more precautions and be more firm in case of such attacks, like doing an immediate search following the attack and not waiting for hours like they did.” Egypt’s government previously vowed to boost security and protect its Christian citizens after suicide bombings struck two churches on Palm Sunday, leaving at least 45 dead. But many of Egypt’s Christians, who at roughly 10% of the population represent the country’s largest religious minority, say that the nationwide state of emergency imposed on 10 April has done little to protect them. Friday’s attack in Minya was the fourth of its kind since December, when a suicide bomber targeted St Mark’s Coptic Cathedral in Cairo, leaving at least 29 dead. In February, when claiming responsibility for the December attack, Isis named Christians in Egypt as “our first target and favourite prey”. Pope Francis led a prayer on Sunday for the victims of the Minya attack, saying that they were killed in “another act of ferocious violence” after having refused to renounce their Christian faith. The pope recently met Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi during a trip to Egypt intended to promote interfaith dialogue. “It’s all talk and no action,” said Adel, criticising the Egyptian government’s response to the growing number of attacks on Christians. “Even this state of emergency: they announced it to calm public opinion, but it’s not really helping. Even the priests, bishops and parliament members don’t have the same respect from people any more – now no one takes their ‘soothing’ words seriously. We’re fed up. Plus, the government isn’t doing anything extra, in fact it’s worse than it used to be in terms of how the police treat people.” Coptic Christians in Egypt have long pointed to institutional prejudices against them because of their religion, notably in the courts, which they say fail to prosecute those who commit acts of violence against Christians. Eshhad, a project by the Cairo-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy which tracks persecution of Egypt’s Copts, found 36 examples of persecution in 2017 alone, including beheadings, targeted violence and the Minya bus attack. In response to Friday’s attacks, Egypt’s government conducted six airstrikes on jihadi training camps in the Libyan town of Derna. Isis later claimed responsibility for the Minya bus attack, while the Mujahideen Shura Council, an al-Qaida affiliate that controls the area of Derna targeted by Egypt, released a statement saying it was not responsible for Friday’s attack, as it was not its policy to target civilians."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/may/27/county-cricket-essex-v-surrey-somerset-v-hants-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T17:38:00Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Essex v Surrey, Somerset v Hants and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/may/27/county-cricket-essex-v-surrey-somerset-v-hants-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/may/27/county-cricket-essex-v-surrey-somerset-v-hants-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Essex v Surrey, Somerset v Hants and more – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks again for your company today, which has been a thoroughly enjoyable one. Dan Lawrence batted very nicely indeed here, and the action elsewhere has been excellent too. Here are the scores on the doors. Division One: Essex 215-3 v Surrey 369 Somerset 197 &amp; 39-0 v Hampshire 162 &amp; 293 Division Two: Derbyshire 532-8 v Leicestershire 619 Kent 369 &amp; 116-0 v Sussex 164 Northants 238 &amp; 53-2 v Worcs 434 Glos 149 &amp; 37-1 v Notts 430-9d Glamorgan 225-6 v Durham 342 See you all tomorrow! Alex Wakely has been caught hooking three overs from the close at Northants. It’s the Northants way! Tongue the bowler and they are 42 for two and still miles behind. And stumps at Tunbridge Wells, where Kent lead Sussex by 161. That’s stumps at Chelmsford, where Essex are 215 for three. Lawrence has batted very nicely for his 78, while Ravi has been mature in putting together 33. Essex are 154 behind, so I reckon they won’t follow on. Bit of weather about tomorrow, and a new ball due first thing. Lloyds Leach has an early wicket at Northampton. Of course he does. Holden goes and Northants are 24 for one. Lovely. Derbyshire are now 506 for eight as Gary Wilson goes for 97. What an exciting game that has been. Notts are on the move with Gloucestershire’s second innings. Dent goes to Fletcher and it’s 12 for one. And now Donald’s gone. There I was thinking my jinxing knife was a little blunt today. He made 51, apparently a superb catch by Jennings off the utterly unpronounceable Weighell. Good to see. Very pesky last-wicket stand at Taunton, where Crane and Topley put on 36. But Bess has Crane for 30 and ends up with seven in the innings and 10 in the match! 293 the score, 259 the target for Somerset. Nine overs left of what has been a slightly slow day at Chelmsford. Essex 188 for three. Uh oh bad news for Stuie. Notts have enforced the follow on. Gloucestershire 149 all out! Worcestershire all out for 434, a lead of 198! Sanderson got Leach (for a 35-ball fifty) and Lyon (for a first-ball duck) in consecutive deliveries to finish the job. IVA Shantry ends 30 not out. Two wickets for Steve Mullaney at Trent Bridge, and Glos are nine down! Follow on looms, as they are 281 behind. Kent manoeuvring themselves into a position of utter dominance at Tunbridge Wells. They are 60 without loss. Meanwhile at Chelmsford, Dan Lawrence has fifty. Lovely knock. Full bonus points for the Woosters and Shantry and Leach have put on 44 in five overs... Coughlin gets another and Glammy are five down! Can Durham force their way to their first win? 119 for five. The following on is acoming at Trent Bridge. Joverton gets Abbott and Hampshire are nine down with a lead of 222! Good game at Taunton. Nathan Buck has five wickets for Northants! Woosters are 366 for eight, and Shantry has joined Lloyds Leach. Prepare for carnage. Another wicket at Taunton! Joverton gets Ervine, caught at third man by Bess. 246 for eight. Nathan Buck has a third for Northants and the Woosters are 353 for six. The lead is 115, and Shantry’s not even in yet. Kent have chosen not to enforce at Tunbridge Wells so are out for another bat in the final session of the second day. The lead is more than 200. Please listen to this. Thanks. No danger of that at Chelmsford, where it’s another belting day. Not all of these games have made it to tea, but these are the scores whether you like it or not. Division One: Essex 127-3 v Surrey 369 Hampshire 162 &amp; 225-7 v Somerset 197 Division Two: Derbyshire 394-5 v Leicestershire 619 Sussex 164 v Kent 369 Worcs 346-5 v Northants 238 Glos 110-6 v Notts 430-9d Glamorgan 87-3 v Durham 342 Tea! Essex are 127 for three. 69 for three in that session, which saw Surrey bowl nicely. Good from Paul Coughlin, who is a very fine young cricketer. Takes one to get Colin Ingram out right now. Meanwhile, at Tunbridge Wells... Sussex are all out for 164. Oh dear. Harris gets Wiese and Archer in consecutive balls. And now he’s gone! Bad way to go! Just before tea, as well. Two balls after bringing up his 50, he’s drilled a pull off Tracey Meaker straight to midwicket. Good catch by CurranT. 126 for three, RBop in. First 50 of the season for Nick Browne! Taken 150 balls, and it hasn’t all been pretty, but what on earth does that matter? 126 for two. Six for the Bess (six of the Bess, anyone?!) at Taunton! He gets Berg, the seventh wicket, and Hants are 206 for seven. 170 ahead. Tom Kohli-Cadmore is gone to the new ball at Northampton! 304 for four, and Mitchell has 150. Bit of humpty from Berg at Taunton, and Hampshire have something to bowl at. Six down, 152 ahead. Rushworth has another! He gets Rudolph caught in the grippers and it’s 39 for two. Sorry? Wicket! Scurran does the trick! We have 18-year-olds bowling in tandem at Chelmsford and Sam Curran has got Westley for 16. He had a big waft outside off and edged through to Foakes. Six in an hour at Taunton, and all to spin! Hants 145 for six, and battling. Durham have their first, as Rushworth gets Selman! Words I never thought I’d type. Anyway, there’s been three swifties to the new ball. Two for McKay and one for the German defensive midfielder Dieter Klein. 334 for four, and the follow-on a very distinct possibility. Errr Ah, they are playing at Swansea! Glamorgan’s first innings has begun and they are 13 without loss. Hampshire are five down, and Dom Bess has all five! Vince the latest to go for a 24-ball 19. Sussex are in all sorts at 117 for seven. Stevo, that man, has a five-bag. Bess has four! Rossouw gone this time, and Hampshire are 81 ahead and six down. And Rossouw’s second ball goes for four too... He hit his first ball for four. No hat-trick, no Audi. Oh well. It’s 89 for three. George Bailey got a first-baller at Taunton, so Rilee Rossouw is in on a hat-trick, and on an Audi... All very chilled at Chelmsford, where Westley has started well. At Taunton, Somerset have their first, and their second, as Bess gets the openers Toby Carberry and Liam Dawson in consecutive overs. 85 for two and Hampshire’s lead is 50. Centuries for both Thakor and Godleman at that really exciting game at Derby. Gloucestershire lost one immediately before lunch, to Broad, and have lost another in the over after, to Fletcher. 18 for three and my follow-on prediction is looking a good one. Wicket! And it’s Cook! CurranT has got him lbw from round the wicket. He wandered across, missed, and it looked very out. 61 for one. We are back out! Rampaul to Cook. Surrey didn’t bowl that well in that mini sesh and Cook and Browne look comfy. It’s flat. 58 without loss, and time for your man Will to get a feed in. Here’s your luncheon scores. Division One: Essex 58-0 v Surrey 369 Hampshire 162 &amp; 56-0 v Somerset 197 Division Two: Derbyshire 287-1 v Leicestershire 619 Sussex 78-4 v Kent 369 Worcs 213-3 v Northants 238 Glos 12-2 v Notts 430-9d Durham 342 v Glam (no play yet there today) Enjoy your sarnies! Virdi’s having a bowl! A man for all seasons. Bit green. One over until lunch here, and Cook has just played a lovely cover drive. 52 without loss. Hampshire are in the lead at Ciderabad. 50 without loss. Looking good. (Jinxing knife). A century for Daryl Mitchell at Northants! He’s gone back to back. Worcester are 202 for three, and just 36 behind. He’s batting with Tom Kohli-Cadmore. Notts on the move! Fletcher gets Bancroft and Glos are three for one. I would put my house on them following on. Just looked at the scorecard from Derby, where it seems history’s most boring game ever is taking place. Derby 278 for one. Sussex in a wee bit of strife at 46 for three at TW. Luke Wright in early. Wowzer! That first one from Jimmy H. Nottinghamshire declare! They made 430 for nine. Nasty little period before lunch for Gloucestershire... Amar Virdi is very cool. He’s got sunglasses back to front around his turban and mid-on. Essex are 17 for none. Notts ploughing on at Trent Bridge. Empty Wessels and Read have gone so it’s over to Hutton, the grunter, and Broad. 420 for seven. Harmer comes on, field out, and Kumar tries to go large but is caught at long-off. Gone for 200, and what a knock. Every single Essex player shakes his hand on the way off. Listen to the great man and go watch the great man. What a player, what a guy. Not much else to say. Apart from the fact that he was turning down singles when on 199. Huge ovation for the double. Berg gets Bess. Somerset have a lead of 35. Outrageous that this went for six. Wicket! Virdi’s off stump goes flying! Porter the bowler, and that’s his fourth. 363 for nine, with Sanga on 195. A wicket second ball at Tunbridge Wells! Nash hits Harris for four first ball, but is bowled next up. IVA Wells comes to the crease. News from rainy Wales. Nine down at Taunton! Coverton goes to Berg, and Somerset are 184 for nine. Kent 369 all out! Wicket! Meaker’s had a nibble at Porter and gone for 49! The stand was 110 and it’s 349 for eight. Another one for Hampshire! They have three this morning. Abbott gets Leach for squat. 170 for eight. So... Somerset are six in front, but seven down, as Dawson gets Davies. A wicket at Taunton! Abbott again, Gregory goes, scores are level and Somerset are six down. Coverton in. We are underway! And the hundred stand is up between Sanga and Meaker. Sussex on the move! Davies and Gregory at the crease in Taunton, two of my absolute favourites. There’s another liveblog today. Click on it, but don’t tell anybody. Stay here... Delayed start at Swansea, unfortunately. Durham lost four without scoring at the end yesterday to be bowled out for 342. My report from Chelmsford yesterday, and a bit of a roundup too. Morning Stuie! We’ve had a bit of rain at Chelmsford, but it’s passed and we will start on time. Good morning, and happy Saturday. It’s the weekend – a bank holiday weekend, no less – and County cricket - live! is up and about. The blog is at Chelmsford, where Kumar is still batting. What a pleasure! It was a day of vintage quality, yesterday. Kumar did his thing; Ciderabad is back; Pujara made his mark; Colly turned 41 and made a ton; Denly’s the man; so is Shantry; and Leicestershire racked em up on a flattie. Lovely stuff. Here’s the scores on the doors: Div One: Surrey 334-7 v Essex Somerset 157-5 v Hampshire 162 Div Two: Derbyshire 154-1 v Leicestershire 563-4 Nottinghamshire 357-5 v Glos Worcestershire 108-2 v Northants 238 Kent 316-8 v Sussex Durham 342 all out v Glamorgan There are, as ever, various ways to contact me to let me know I’m getting things [delete as appropriate] very right/very wrong.

Speaking to a packed Sydney Recital Hall on Friday night, the author of Difficult Woman, Bad Feminist and now Hunger, said she was deeply concerned about the election of Donald Trump, and what it meant for the United States. Responding to an audience question, Gay described the Trump presidency as “catastrophic” for women and people of colour, particularly those who are working class or impoverished. “They are not on his radar, or the radar of his administration and when they are, they are targets.” She added: “I’m very worried about the level of misogyny and the level of xenophobia and racism in America that we’re seeing.” Continued resistance was the only option, she said: “We are going to have to continue to avoid this idea of resistance fatigue, which people are talking about, because every single day there is some new ridiculous revelation and some new sense of just how horrible he is. It’s really bad.” But she did urge people to keep calm. “People keep saying The Handmaid’s Tale is right around the corner, and I think we need to calm down, and not catastrophise because that doesn’t do anything good. “We are not living The Handmaid’s Tale, and a lot of what we are talking about, we’re talking about in the context of the developed world where obviously everybody is relatively OK, so let’s save the catastrophe for when it’s actually here.” The US president has cast a long shadow over the Sydney writers’ festival this year with many authors unable to avoid talking about his impact. When speaking to author Thomas Friedman on Friday night, George Megalogenis reminded the audience of last year’s keynote speaker, Gloria Steinem, who, when asked about a potential Trump presidency, had said, “It will not happen.” Also on Friday night, US authors George Saunders and Colson Whitehead and Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi spoke with Slate editor-in-chief Julia Turner on a panel called “American carnage”, named for a phrase used in Trump’s bleak first speech as president. The panel began with a statement from Turner that was greeted with applause: “There is really only one way for any upstanding American to open any international conversation about our new president Donald Trump: we are so, so sorry.” Whitehead, who won the Pulitzer prize for his bestselling book The Underground Railroad, said Trump’s ascendence forced him to confront a truth he had been denying. “Obama lulled me into a sense that we had moved into a different place. A place where I didn’t have to fear as much for my kids growing up as my parents feared for me growing up. And I used to joke about this, ‘Oh, post-racial, that’s so stupid – we’re not post-racial!’ - and now I’d LOVE to make a joke about us being postracial. “Everything that Donald represents is an essential part of who we in America are. It’s been there from the beginning and it will always be there,” he said. He said he found himself struggling to empathise with people who voted for Trump: “You don’t have to be racist to vote for him, but it helps, and if you’re not racist you’re OK with having a racist sex abuser in the White House. So for me they are the two things: you’re either a racist or a total arsehole. So I have a hard time rising above myself to understand them.” Chalabi, a Muslim immigrant who has been living in New York for three years, said the election and the travel ban had been “petrifying”. “Some Americans tried to reassure me by pointing out the incompetence of the administration, that’s something I’ve heard again and again. But when you’re in a position of vulnerability that incompetence really isn’t reassuring because it means that things are really arbitrary and it’s very easy for you to slip between the cracks,” Chalabi said. She told of an autocorrected text her mum sent her, which read: “Good Isis, see you at Heathrow”. “I really don’t want that text on my phone,” she said. “And I’m saying this all from an enormously privileged position. I’ve been accepted into American society, I’m in a good social class, I have a good job, I speak English ... For me to be scared – I can’t imagine what other people are feeling.” During Saturday night’s “Nasty Women” gala, the Wheeler Centre’s Sophie Black asked the US writers on stage what it was like to be on the other side of the world and asked, continually, to explain the Trump presidency. Brit Bennett, a writer and essayist whose first book The Mothers came out last year, said she embraces it. “It’s such an insane time. The time difference – by the time I wake up here, the American news cycle is in full swing so I’m just like, ‘OK, what’s everyone panicking about today on Twitter?’” But, Bennett said, there’s an upside to: “It’s been comforting to come here and talk to so many people who understand why we’re panicked and share that panic, to feel like we’re not just alone in our freaking out.” Writer Nadja Spiegelman agreed: “In the United States everyone’s so tired of talking about it. I bring it up at a party and people just look really shellshocked and dead and they can’t speak about it anymore. And I can’t help it – it’s all I want to talk about, it obsesses me, it’s awful, it’s continually awful, but there’s no looking away from it. So it is kind of comforting coming here and having people as eager to talk about it as I am.” Bennett said fiction could have a role to play in bridging the divide, by helping us empathise with and understand other people – so long as it was done in a thoughtful way. “I try to think about this in my own writing: whose voices I can identify with; whose experiences I centre,” she said. “I hope that this imagination and empathy can trickle into our politics. I don’t find a huge leap between creative empathy and political empathy: who you invite into your brain and heart when you read and write, and who you consider when you vote or protest or pass laws. “So I hope that all of us that are rattled or maybe galvanised by this past election will build a way forward by embracing more complexity and more diversity, and always turning towards what we don’t understand.” • Sydney writers’ festival continues until Sunday 28 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/may/27/schapelle-corby-to-return-to-australia-13-years-after-bali-drugs-conviction","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T21:08:01Z","webTitle":"Schapelle Corby returns to Australia 13 years after Bali drugs conviction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/27/schapelle-corby-to-return-to-australia-13-years-after-bali-drugs-conviction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/may/27/schapelle-corby-to-return-to-australia-13-years-after-bali-drugs-conviction","fields":{"headline":"Schapelle Corby returns to Australia 13 years after Bali drugs conviction","bodyText":"Schapelle Corby, Australia’s most notorious drug smuggler, has arrived back in her home country for the first time in 13 years after leaving her Bali home amid intense media scrutiny. Corby left her villa in Kuta with a heavy police escort to sign some final paperwork before going to Denpasar airport to fly to Brisbane. After switching flights at the last minute, she arrived in Australia early on Sunday morning. The 39-year-old was accompanied by her sister Mercedes and arrived in Brisbane on a Malindo Air flight after being deported from Bali 12 and a half years after she was caught with 4.1kg of marijuana. Corby was 27 when she was arrested in 2004 after customs officers at Bali’s airport found the drugs inside her boogie board bag. Corby, whose case sparked a media frenzy in Australia, always insisted the drugs had been planted in her bag. But Balinese prosecutors dismissed her claim that baggage handlers put the marijuana in her – and she was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Her sentence was later reduced and in 2014, after nine years behind bars, she was released from prison. Corby had to stay in Bali until her parole expired on Saturday. In the lead-up to her deportation, she kept a low profile, living in a villa in Bali with her Indonesian boyfriend. On Sunday a large media contingent was waiting for Corby at Brisbane airport but she slipped away via a non-public exit. Two convoys, followed by the media, left the airport, and took separate routes. One ended at the Sofitel hotel in the city, while the other stopped at the KFC store at Ormeau, en route to the Gold Coast. Corby was not seen in either. Queensland police said they had not provided an escort for the convoys. After Corby left the airport, a member of her security team read a statement on behalf of the family, asking for privacy but also thanking supporters. “To all those in Australia and to all of those in Bali, who were there throughout the difficult journey, your support has not gone unnoticed,” the statement said. “To each and every one of you, you are appreciated.” The family said the focus was now on helping Corby adjust to life back in Australia. “The priority of our focus will now be on healing and moving forward,” the statement said. “In the spirit of humility and in the spirit of dignity, we ask all parties to show respect for the family’s privacy during this time.” Corby’s security team also made a last-minute switch to put her on the Malindo Air flight. She had been expected to travel on a Virgin flight that left around the same time. Up to 40 journalists, including a Channel Nine crew, had booked seats on the Virgin flight. Fellow passengers said they were held back from boarding the Malindo Air flight and getting off the plane until Corby was sorted. “They said that the special guest had to get off first, they blocked everyone from business class,” one passenger said. Corby joined Instagram late on Saturday, and posted images from her final day in Indonesia, including a shot from the plane. By Sunday morning she had 97,400 followers. She also raised eyebrows by holding up a bag with the face of missing boy William Tyrrell, who disappeared from Kendall in New South Wales in 2014, as she made her final public trip through Bali. Later on Sunday, Corby’s family began gathering at her mother Rosleigh’s home in Loganlea, south of Brisbane. The intensity of the Australian media’s focus on the Corby case continued unabated on her last day in Indonesia. Commercial television held live broadcasts to monitor the developments, and a throng of Australian and international media waited outside her home. Local police reportedly marshalled 275 officers from Kuta and Denpasar to help escort Corby to the airport for her deportation. The Corby family had requested privacy from the media crews gathered at the home. A bucket of water was thrown at a Channel Seven cameraman, and Mercedes placed a note on the front door, warning media against trying to film over the villa’s fence. It was unclear whether Corby would stay with siblings on the Gold Coast or with her mother in Logan upon her return to Australia. On Friday, the head of Bali’s law and human rights office, Ida Bagus Ketut Adnyana, said the heavy police presence was needed because “it’s not normal, there are too many people”. He said it was likely she would be taken via a different passage to normal passengers at the airport. “Up to now [she was supposed to use] only normal pathway but if it’s difficult, blocked by reporters and passengers, then there could be some special action in the field,” Adnyana said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/may/27/marijuana-legalisation-uruguay-seen-half-measure-users","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-27T18:50:35Z","webTitle":"Uruguay, the first country where you can smoke marijuana wherever you like","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/27/marijuana-legalisation-uruguay-seen-half-measure-users","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/may/27/marijuana-legalisation-uruguay-seen-half-measure-users","fields":{"headline":"Uruguay, the first country where you can smoke marijuana wherever you like","bodyText":"Alicia Castilla was watering the plants in her garden on a quiet Sunday afternoon when five police patrol cars screeched to a halt outside her home. A team of 14 officers “armed to the teeth” stormed through her gate and arrested the mild-mannered, 66-year-old intellectual. They seized everything they could find: computers, her mobile phone, books, even an orange squeezer. They also impounded the 29 cannabis plants she was watering and 24g of marijuana they found in her possession. She was taken to a police station where she spent the night handcuffed to a bench. “They treated me like the female version of Pablo Escobar,” Castilla told the Observer. But far from resembling the infamous Colombian drug lord who inspired the 2015 Netflix series Narcos, Castilla was a peace-loving, grey-haired author whose book Cultura Cannabis had become an unexpected bestseller. Like many Argentinian sexagenarians, she had recently retired to nearby Uruguay. The seized plants were for her personal use. “I make a living writing about marijuana, not selling it.” Castilla’s arrest in 2011 sent Uruguay into shock. Although the consumption of recreational drugs had never been outlawed in a country that prides itself on its broad-mindedness and liberal institutions, its cultivation and sale remained forbidden. The author faced between two and 10 years behind bars. Her imprisonment at the women’s prison in the town of Canelones became round-the-clock news. “I fell into a foul-smelling pit that reminded me of Midnight Express. Cockroaches crawled over the bed, there were rats the size of rabbits in the bathrooms.” Castilla realised she had become a national celebrity when her fellow inmates broke into spontaneous applause on her arrival. The eldest of the 120 women imprisoned there, her fellow inmates nicknamed her “the reefer grandmother”, a moniker that was quickly picked up by the press. Thousands marched to demand her release. The protests soon galvanised a longstanding demand for the full legalisation of recreational cannabis. “The media coverage was crazy. Legislators started bringing legal marijuana draft bills for me to look at in prison,” Castilla, now 72, recalls. Her three-month incarceration (and the lengthy series of trials until the case was dismissed by Uruguay’s supreme court last year) finally paid off. The cultivation of cannabis was legalised in 2014, and in July Uruguay will become the first country in the world where its sale is legal across the entire territory. “It’s important for Uruguay to advance towards a logical regulation of recreational marijuana,” says Eduardo Blasina, director of the recently inaugurated Cannabis Museum located in a large terracotta-coloured property in the old Palermo neighbourhood of Uruguay’s capital city, Montevideo. “The law gives consumers access to certified, unadulterated marijuana,” says Blasina. “South America’s war against drugs has been absurd, with catastrophic results no matter which indicators you consider, including consumption. If Uruguay’s experience turns out positive, it will be easier for other countries such as Colombia or Mexico, mired in huge problems with powerful narcos, to find a better solution than the disastrous one implemented so far.” For Laura Blanco, one of the most energetic campaigners for legalisation, Uruguay’s unique history of never having prohibited the consumption of any drug was key. “We found this grey area in the law where consumption was legal but cultivation was not, so every time a marijuana-grower was taken prisoner it was reinforcing the message that the only place to obtain access to a legal substance was on the illegal market.” But not everyone is pleased with how legal marijuana is being implemented in Uruguay. “I’m happy because now you can plant without going to prison,” says Juan Manuel Varela, the 28-year-old manager of MDAR (Spanish-language acronym for high-quality marijuana), one of the cannabis clubs that have been set up under the new legislation. “But like many things in Uruguay, the new law is a good idea that is being applied badly.” Cannabis activists such as Varela and Castilla are upset that the new law falls short of full legalisation. Home growers are required to register with the government for a permit that grants them a maximum of six plants, and cannabis clubs such as Varela’s require permits for a maximum of 45 members who are allowed to withdraw only 40g per month from the club’s crop. Most controversial of all, when the law goes into full effect in July, legal marijuana will only be available at pharmacies. Though the price will be highly accessible, only $1.30 per gram compared with $3 on the street, consumers must register with the government first. They will then be required to identify themselves with a digital thumb scan to withdraw their weekly maximum of 10g. The government has taken important precautions to prevent the registry falling into the wrong hands because of the privacy issues involved. Pharmacists will not be given the name of the client associated with each thumb scan. Only the amount of grams still available from each client’s quota will be revealed on the pharmacy’s screen. Additionally, only seven members of the government will have access to the full registry, and three of them will need to be present simultaneously in order to retrieve any names from it. “It’s like a police file they’re building of planters and consumers,” says Daniel Vidart, another long-time cannabis activist and author who met, fell in love with and married Castilla shortly after her release from prison six years ago. The impressively spritely 96-year-old is a personal friend of Uruguay’s former president, José “Pepe” Mujica, who introduced a series of liberal reforms during his 2010-2015 term in office, including same-sex marriage, abortion and the sale of state-controlled marijuana. Vidart is highly critical of his friend’s marijuana law. “This law actually stigmatises marijuana more than it legalises it,” says Vidart, holding his wife Castilla’s hand. “Why should there be a registry of marijuana consumers and not one of alcohol consumers? Alcohol is a much deadlier drug. This law continues considering that marijuana smokers are so dangerous that they need to be counted by the government. And a registry is more or less safe as long as you have a democratic government, but it could become a weapon against consumers should the political mood change.” The registry was opened at the beginning of May. So far about 3,500 people (out of Uruguay’s population of 3.4 million) have signed up to buy marijuana at pharmacies. Additionally, since 2014 about 6,700 have signed up as home growers and 57 cannabis clubs have been set up, according to the government’s Cannabis Regulation and Control Institute. Despite the media attention, sales seem to be likely to get off to a slow start. “Only 30 of the country’s 1,000 pharmacies have signed up to sell marijuana so far,” says Alejandro Antalich, vice-president of the Uruguayan pharmacies association. “Our society can be conservative, resistant to change, so there is still uncertainty and many pharmacists are waiting to see how the system works before signing up to sell. There is also fear of reprisals against pharmacies from corner drug traffickers upset at losing their clients.” Castilla also has mixed feelings about the new law. “I would like to see full freedom to plant in your own home,” she says. Has she registered to plant or buy? “No, I haven’t.” Is she still growing at home? “Yes, I am.” Isn’t she afraid of falling foul of the new law? “I don’t think they’d dare come after me again,” says Castilla with a twinkle in her eye."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2017/mar/01/where-are-the-most-difficult-places-in-the-world-to-be-gay-or-transgender-lgbt","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-01T09:51:58Z","webTitle":"Where are the most difficult places in the world to be gay or transgender?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/mar/01/where-are-the-most-difficult-places-in-the-world-to-be-gay-or-transgender-lgbt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/mar/01/where-are-the-most-difficult-places-in-the-world-to-be-gay-or-transgender-lgbt","fields":{"headline":"Where are the most difficult places in the world to be gay or transgender?","bodyText":"Where are the most dangerous places in the world to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT)? It’s not an easy question to answer. “Comprehensive data on hate crimes and state-sponsored violence against LGBT people is just non-existent in a lot of countries,” says Jessica Stern, executive director at OutRight International, an advocacy group. “The most consistent violence tends to actually be where there is the least government documentation [of violence], and the least civil society presence.” Homosexuality is still a crime in 72 countries (pdf). And even countries with no legal barriers, such as the US, record shocking levels of hate crimes – there were 53 transgender murders from 2013 to 2015 and not a single one was prosecuted, for example. Based on the data that is available, here are seven of the countries where LGBT rights are most under threat – but where campaigners are also making the occasional small step of progress. Iraq “It depends on what part of the country you are in – but in two words I’d describe Iraq as ‘not safe’ for LGBT people,” says Amir Ashour, Iraq’s only openly gay activist, explaining that it’s not just the threat from Islamic State in Mosul and Hawija. “In Baghdad and the middle of Iraq the violence is actually more visible from groups supported by the government, who do killing campaigns. The latest one was in January – we knew several people who were killed but there were rumours there was a list of 100 names.” Attacks on gay individuals under Isis have been widely reported, but Iraq’s systematic killing campaigns of gay individuals pre-date the terror group and continue to this day. Ashour, founder of LGBT group IraQueer, estimates there’s been at least one a year since 2006. Suspected community spaces have been burned down or bombed, and it hasn’t been safe to meet up with people for at least six years – especially as people have been targeted via dating apps. “We have no spaces left online or offline,” Ashour adds sadly. It’s clear LGBT Iraqis are still looking for ways to connect though. Ashour says his NGO’s network has grown really fast with the organisation’s website getting 11,000 hits a month, most from inside Iraq. “What’s great is that we’re able to provide resources for LGBT Iraqis that were not there for ourselves.” There’s hope for change too. A rare opportunity for Iraqi activists has come up with Iraq being appointed to the UN human rights council. “The officials used to say they could never meet with us but now they can’t say they’re busy because protecting our rights are part of their job,” he jokes. Iran Iran’s leaders describe homosexuality as “moral bankruptcy” or “modern western barbarism”. Amnesty International estimates that 5,000 gays and lesbians have been executed there since the 1979 Iranian revolution. Although it is less common now, it still occurs. In the summer of 2016 a 19-year-old boy was hanged in Iran’s Markazi province: in 2014 two men were executed. The threat of blackmail is now a huge problem for gay men, explains Saghi Ghahraman, founder of the Iranian Queer Organization. This is because Iran’s complex laws around homosexuality mean that men face different punishments for consensual sexual intercourse, depending whether they are the “active” or the “passive” participant. The passive person faces the death penalty, but the active person only faces the same punishment if married. The laws can lead to distrust between partners, as if caught, the only defence for the passive partner is rape. This also creates an atmosphere for blackmail. And in a remarkable piece of legislation, fathers and grandfathers are given the right under Iranian law to kill their offspring, making “honour” killings legal. “From an early age, children learn starting in the home that the world is very hostile to LGBT people,” says Ghahraman. The government’s treatment of the transgender community is not so black and white. Since 1983, when Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa permitting the acceptance of transgender people in society, sex reassignment surgery has been available and Iranians can take out loans for the surgery. In fact, except for Thailand, Iran carries out more sex reassignment operations than any other country in the world. It’s a double edged sword for some in the LGBT community though – the operations have become a controversial solution for gay men trying to reconcile their faith with their sexuality and the government refuses to recognise transgender people who don’t want surgery. Honduras A global study found that Honduras had by far the highest numbers of transgender murders relative to its population. But it’s not just trans people who are at risk. After the left-leaning president, Manuel Zelaya, was ousted in 2009, LGBT murders soared; 215 have taken place since the coup. It’s important to understand the wider context too – in recent years, people have been able to kill with impunity, regardless of the victim’s sexuality, and Honduras today is murder capital of the world with a national homicide rate of 60 per 100,000 people. But LGBT murders are more likely go unpunished, according to an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights report (pdf), due to discriminatory stereotypes popular among the police. Interestingly, despite the threat of assassinations, LGBT Hondurans are active both in civil society and politics. When René Martínez was murdered last June, he was a member of President Juan Orlando Hernández’s ruling National party. LGBT activist Erick Martínez is also a candidate for the Honduran congress. He says things are improving but there are still challenges: “We started getting LGBT activists elected in 2012 and we are now seeing the fruits of that as we have more LGBTI people able to influence the political parties for real inclusion. “The biggest problem is to make generational relays as because of the violence many LGBTI activists are migrating and one of the fears I live up to is being a victim of the violence for the work I do.” Uganda The number of LGBT refugees a country produces is another indicator of how dangerous a country is for LGBT people. Between 2014-2016, the Friends Ugandan Safe Transport Fund, a US-based Quakers association, reports that they supported more than 1,800 LGBT individuals to escape Uganda. It’s easy to understand why people want to leave. In 2014, the Ugandan government attempted to introduce the controversial Anti-Homosexuality Act, which at first included a provision for the death penalty. It would go on to be declared unconstitutional in Uganda’s courts, but the damage was done, and homophobic violence had been legitimised. People were outed in Ugandan newspapers, one published a list of “top 200 homosexuals”, despite knowing that revealing LGBT people’s identities could lead to them being killed. A report by the Ugandan NGO SMUG showed that persecution based on sexual orientation had increased in the two years after the act. Ugandan activists refuse to be pushed underground, despite the risks – they put on a week of pride events last summer that were disrupted by police. Russia A gay scene with regular events is tolerated in Moscow. But Putin’s government is openly anti-gay, and is discussing another homophobic law, which proposes jailing people for public displays of non-heterosexual orientation or gender identity. LGBT groups have been denied the right to hold pride marches under anti-propaganda laws and well-publicised events that have been held have been disrupted by violent thugs. Nor has any action been taken to shut down groups that openly go after LGBT people, such as Occupy Pedophilia, a national network of Russians who torture gay men, and then post hugely popular videos of their acts online. Egypt Egypt is widely regarded as being the biggest jailer of gay men – the New York Times estimated at least 250 LGBT people have been arrested since 2013 while LGBT blog 76 crimes estimates that that number could be closer to 500. Being gay or transgender is not illegal in Egypt, but ever since the military pushed out the president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, the authorities have engaged in a crackdown on the LGBT community, imprisoning them on the charge of “debauchery”, which comes with a jail term of up to 17 years. Traditional meeting spots are increasingly unsafe, and since 2014 gay dating apps such as Grindr have been warning their Egyptian users that “police may be posing as LGBT on social media to entrap you”.Police have been known to invite journalists and cameramen along on raids; those caught may be outed to the whole country, even if arrested by mistake. In 2014 26 men were filmed as they were arrested naked and accused by a TV presenter of leaving a homosexual brothel. All 26 men were later acquitted but the repercussions of the case led to one man attempting to burn himself to death. Nigeria Of the people interviewed for the ILGA-RIWI Global Attitudes Survey on LGBTI People (pdf), 51% said they “strongly agreed” with the statement “being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender should be a crime” making it the most homophobic country of the 45 surveyed. The country threatens 14 year prison sentences for homosexual acts, and under a law passed in 2013, any Nigerian who belongs to a gay organisation can also be liable for a 10 year jail term. These laws, along with Sharia law in Muslim areas of the country mean it’s not safe to publicly identify as LGBT in many parts of Nigeria. But for Olumide Makanjuola, executive director of The Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERS), it is social acceptance that is a bigger issue than legal protection for the LGBT community. “You can have all the laws you want but it doesn’t matter unless you have social acceptance of LGBT individuals,” he says, explaining that as an overly religious country with a population of 182 million, any engagement needs to be at a critical mass level to change attitudes. “For every 100 politicians for example you might have one who’s progressive, but election campaigns are closely tied to the religious system, so if a politician gets into power with the help of the church or the mosque, he feels an obligation to them.” He adds, however that Nigeria has progressed a lot: “The fact is 10 years ago we couldn’t be having this conversation. But today we have LGBT organisations that are visible en masse, we’re able to hold public events and we can do community engagement.” Additional reporting by Naomi Larsson.

The tourist attraction’s official Twitter and Facebook accounts posted a series of images as part of a “Dark Valentine” campaign. On Wednesday, it deleted all the posts after a backlash on social media. One post, which was deleted before the others came down, read: “What’s the difference between your job and a dead prostitute? Your job still sucks!” Another said: “Jack the Ripper just messaged. He wants to Netflix and kill.” Not all of the messages seemed to be connected to the museum’s criminal-historical context. Some were general jibes about appearance, such as: “I love a girl that’s a good eater. Female translation: you’re fat.” The posts drew condemnation on both Twitter and Facebook. Among those to criticise the campaign was Sarah Jackson, co-founder of the East End Women’s Museum. She said: “Violence against women hasn’t gone the way of gaslights and top hats, far from it. Marketing campaigns like these trivialise the very real violence that sex workers experience, and reinforce stigma which puts them in danger. “The Ripper tourist trade has been making money from the reputation of a misogynist serial killer for far too long – I hope the response to this misjudged campaign makes the London Dungeon and others think twice.” In a statement, a spokesperson for London Dungeon said: “We apologise that our social posts caused offence. Our ‘Dark Valentine’ campaign was a range of posts aimed to highlight the darker side of history and create debate and conversation. “As a brand we strive to entertain our guests so they can enjoy the London Dungeon experience – both in our attraction and on social media. However, on this occasion we recognise that some of the topics many felt were inappropriate and therefore we apologise for any offence caused.” Museums and tourist attractions dealing with Victorian-era violence against women have attracted controversy in the past. In 2015, a museum initially billed as a celebration of London women ended up opening as a Jack the Ripper museum."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/16/tanna-review-vanuatu-romance-tribes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-16T21:30:14Z","webTitle":"Tanna review – Romeo and Juliet, South Pacific style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/16/tanna-review-vanuatu-romance-tribes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/16/tanna-review-vanuatu-romance-tribes","fields":{"headline":"Tanna review – Romeo and Juliet, South Pacific style","bodyText":"This glowing, anthropologically flavoured drama – Australia’s nominee for the foreign-language film Oscar – features an unlikely cameo from Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip by way of an argument for arranged marriage.

Chieftain’s son Dain, the villager with the flyest fern headdress, falls for broad-smiling beauty Wawa, but their attraction threatens neighbouring tribal bonds. It could be something from Renaissance drama. In fact, it is: Romeo and Juliet (almost). With such lush locations, it must have been a temptation for directors Martin Butler and Bentley Dean to epically frame the lovers ad nauseam. But they restrict themselves to one silhouetted shot against the local volcanic eruption, and spend more time in proximity to fantastically vital performances from the Yakel-tribe cast. Less fixated than 2015’s Embrace of the Serpent on the threat to indigenous people from the outside, Tanna is an open-throated and universal call for change from within."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/16/the-great-wall-review-zhang-yimous-damp-squib-of-a-gunpowder-plot","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-16T23:00:15Z","webTitle":"The Great Wall review – Zhang Yimou’s damp squib of a gunpowder plot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/16/the-great-wall-review-zhang-yimous-damp-squib-of-a-gunpowder-plot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/16/the-great-wall-review-zhang-yimous-damp-squib-of-a-gunpowder-plot","fields":{"headline":"The Great Wall review – Zhang Yimou’s damp squib of a gunpowder plot","bodyText":"Zhang Yimou’s new film is a laborious fantasy spectacular crossed with a CGI monster movie, set in the days of Imperial China, in a military garrison on the Great Wall.

There is, however, no way of making the Tao Tei actually pay for the wall. The film credits a host of writers including Tony Gilroy, Max Brooks, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, whose opening credits cheekily claim that their story is based on one of the legends of the wall, while outrageously borrowing a key plot point from Jaws. Matt Damon plays William, a mercenary adventurer who has come to China hoping to steal some of their explosive “black powder”. His weird accent suggests that Williams, like Russell Crowe’s Robin Hood, hails from that part of Tipperary that shares a border with County Durham. He is with his Spanish friend Tovar (Pedro Pascal) when they are captured by the Chinese: commander Lin Mae (Tian Jing) and strategist Wang (Andy Lau), who have a sneaking respect for the way these westerners handle themselves with the monsters.

The choreographer has long been known for her brave and sometimes surprising choices, and for the depth of research she undertakes. She and her dancers spent weeks in training with the British army for 5 Soldiers, while for Sluts of Possession she worked with the School of Anthropology at Oxford, investigating tribal and spiritual ritual. None of her projects, though, have taken her into such alien territory as MK Ultra. Named after the experiments in mind control that the CIA developed during the last century, Kay’s new show explores the phenomenon of the Illuminati, a shadowy cult believed to be on an elaborate mission of global domination, spreading its agenda through the brainwashing of prominent individuals in politics and the media. Belief in the cult is particularly strong among young people, and when Kay first began hearing about it from the teenagers who came to her dance workshops, she discovered that pop stars are considered to be the Illuminati’s most targeted “recruits”. Groomed from a young age, singers like Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Lindsay Lohan and Kanye West have supposedly been made agents of the Illuminati’s New World Order, their songs and videos carrying messages designed to subtly alter the public’s consciousness. According to Kay, “the under-25s now have a whole system for decoding the imagery of music videos, looking for symbols like thrones, butterflies, checkered floors and bird cages, to see if they’re carrying the cult’s message and to see which celebrities have been programmed”. Kay is bemused by the bizarre extravagance of this conspiracy theory. “There’s no actual evidence for any of it,” she says briskly. “A cult called the Illuminati did exist in Bavaria in the 17th century, but no one really knows why so many young people believe they’re around today.” What fascinates her are the reasons why belief in the Illuminati has taken so powerful a hold today. She attributes it partly to the unfettered scope of celebrity culture, and the levels of fantasy it has disseminated, and partly to the paranoia and uncertainty that has been generated by our current era of fake news: “So much doubt is now being cast on mainstream media, so many people are taking their information from alternative sources, and it’s having such a dangerous effect on politics.” As one of Kay’s teenage sources said to her: “We used to be told what was real by our leaders, but since recent events we’ve been let down. Now we fend for ourselves.” Conspiracy theories aren’t easy subjects to choreograph around, but Kay developed an idea for a piece that would tell the story of a group of would-be celebrities who have been suckered into the cult of the Illuminati and are struggling to maintain their individuality and their grasp on the real world. Initially, she envisaged the piece as a pure dance narrative, choreographed, designed and staged in the style of a pop video. But as part of her research she began talking to the film-maker Adam Curtis, who persuaded her that she had to layer more documentary-style material into the work to make its context and significance clear. “As Adam pointed out, most people under 25 will have heard of the Illuminati, but a lot of my contemporary dance audience won’t. He said, ‘You have to give them some way in, otherwise they’ll be scratching their heads and thinking, Rosie has really gone mad this time.’” There have certainly been moments during the making of MK Ultra when Kay has felt overwhelmed by the “bonkers” nature of the world she’s entered. Its dangerous levels of credulity and fantasy have also been underlined for her by the fact that, during this same period, she and her company have been touring 5 Soldiers and have been dealing with issues that are far starker. 5 Soldiers is a subtle and humane portrait of army life in which Kay tells the stories of five men and women who have experienced different forms of trauma while serving on the front line. The work has proved a revelation to its civilian audiences, but in the last 18 months it has also toured to several army bases, and in the process it has brought Kay into movingly intimate contact with individual soldiers. “Often they’ve come into the hall looking press-ganged and anxious. They’ve obviously been told they had to come and see the show. But afterwards we haven’t been able to get them out – they’ve wanted to tell us so many stories about their own experiences. One soldier who lost both of his legs in Afghanistan has become a good friend and a big supporter of the piece.” Touring 5 Soldiers has also put Kay into unexpectedly close contact with top-level military personnel. When she first began to research the work, the army gave her only “grudging” access, but once they recognised the cathartic effect that it was having on the soldiers who saw it, as well as the valuable insights it offered to civilian audiences, they were very keen to offer funding and support. As Kay says: “Nick Carter, the head of the British army, has been pushing to make it more representative. He’s been pushing for more women and BAME [recruits], and he sees the arts as a good way to present a more complex portrait of the army to the wider community.” So great an impact has 5 Soldiers made that Carter has just appointed a top-ranking lieutenant colonel to act as the army’s first arts engagement officer, and Kay is justly proud of the fact that the latter’s first official act was to meet with her and ask for advice about future projects. Kay’s addicted to the process of researching a new subject, and says: “Once I’ve decided on an idea for a work, nothing’s going to stop me.” But she also believes that dance can be a force for change, and is very concerned that the artform isn’t nurturing more radical and political voices. “Sometimes I think we’ve all swallowed the marketing-speak book. We’re under so much pressure to be successful and accessible, we’re so worried about pulling in the numbers, that we’re in danger of losing our bite.” MK Ultra is at Birmingham Rep, 17-18 March. Then touring the UK until 18 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/21/from-exorcism-to-acceptance-lgbt-life-in-nigeria","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-21T10:23:24Z","webTitle":"'The exorcism was over in 15 minutes but nothing changed' - LGBT life in Nigeria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/21/from-exorcism-to-acceptance-lgbt-life-in-nigeria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/feb/21/from-exorcism-to-acceptance-lgbt-life-in-nigeria","fields":{"headline":"'The exorcism was over in 15 minutes but nothing changed' - LGBT life in Nigeria","bodyText":"A pastor spits out prayers as his subject falls to the ground, writhing and contorting after a 30-day fast. Ministers form a circle around the emaciated man and douse him in anointing oil and holy water. When the prayer tsunami ends, a hovering calm ensues. A hologram glides through the man’s atrophied body as he springs to his feet, professing his salvation. So goes the standard script for a deliverance session or exorcism in Nigerian film. Bree, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, said her first deliverance session in 2004 had none of this Nollywood drama. “The pastor acted like it was pretty normal and routine. It was a quick 15 minutes, and nothing changed,” she says, stifling a laugh. “I felt like he didn’t realise it was a big spiritual issue, and he didn’t treat it with the weight it deserved.” Bree, who identifies as lesbian and Christian, has been grappling with reconciling her faith and sexuality for most of her life. Growing up in a conservative community where the two identities were considered mutually exclusive, her sense of God’s disapproval and abandonment had taken its toll. Her meandering from unstable to abusive relationships only confirmed her belief that her sexuality was wrong and something that would continually punish her. In 2009, while attending a Pentecostal church service with her girlfriend at the time, the pastor asked women who wanted to be delivered from the spirit of lesbianism to approach the altar. “I was so tired of feeling rejected by God. I just wanted peace,” she says of her decision to step forward. “I was so conflicted. You go to church and keep hearing about how lesbians and gay people are an abomination, how they are going to hell, and you don’t understand why God is rejecting you before you even had a chance to say, ‘I don’t want this’.” This time around, the pastor laid hands on Bree and her girlfriend. Believing they were entranced in spirit, the women rolled on the ground and were surrounded by ministers. “It was intense, and I was hopeful this was it, maybe we had been cured. I needed to not be gay anymore,” Bree says. After a tearful breakup from her partner following the deliverance session, they got back together a week later, both exhausted from acting “healed.” “I finally had a conversation with God saying that if this is who I am, ‘you made me, then you fix me’,” Bree says. Bree believes one of the burdens religious exorcism places on sexual minorities is the need to “perform” - pretend to be straight. She reminds herself to switch feminine pronouns to masculine ones when discussing past relationships with work colleagues and when writing on her blog. Once, when a colleague gave her a suspicious look for staring admiringly at a woman, Bree invented a quick fib about having previously met the person. Olumide Makanjuola, executive director of The Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERS), an organisation based in Lagos that works on LGBTQI rights and sexual health, says that “performing” is mentally straining. “In a space like Nigeria, people perform sexuality quite well. We don’t care what performance does to people mentally, as we are focused on how people see us and how they imagine us,” Makanjuola says. Through his work, Makanjuola has encountered many people in the local lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) community dealing with acute anxiety and depression as a result of performing straightness brought on by deliverance attempts and conversion therapy. “Exorcism reduces people. They feel so incomplete and powerless,” he says. “We run a religious system that is full of condemnation as opposed to understanding, which is very problematic.” Makanjuola emphasises the need to deconstruct social norms society places on people, whether gay or straight, and warns about the mental health strain that can arise from this constant need to perform. Bree says her deep-seated distrust of Nigeria’s mental health system prevented her from seeking professional help when coming to terms with her faith and sexuality. “I wouldn’t talk to a professional about it, because I’m not going to have someone validate negative feelings,” she says. “The people who we talk to will fall back on culture or religion.” Makanjuola says Nigeria’s LGBTQI community often faces stigmatised responses from healthcare providers because of institutionalised homophobia and prejudice, making it difficult for them to seek help. Addressing this lack of trust and presumed discrimination, psychiatrist Gbonju Abiri from the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital in Lagos says: “Nigeria is deeply ingrained in culture and religious beliefs, and we are not able to deal with diversity just yet as we should. Our practice encourages that we should put health above all first.” She adds that many LGBTQI patients ask doctors about their views on sexuality prior to consultations, using the doctors’ responses to determine whether or not to go forward with the appointment. Acceptance of homosexuality is difficult in a country which outlaws gay marriage. Nigeria’s Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act, which stipulates up to 14 years in prison for divergent sexual orientation and gender identity expressions, was signed into law by President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014. Makanjuola believes the law validates existing social prejudices. “As a health service receiver, you are dealing with two monsters: a doctor who is prejudiced towards you, and a service provider who is also using the law to validate their own sense of what is right. If you win with the law, are you going to win with the angle of their personal belief system?” he asks. In 2012, exhausted from feeling depressed and condemned, Bree decided to study more about the intersection between her faith and her sexuality. She looked through the works of theologians, unlearning most of what she had been taught and reading stories of people who had taken their own lives when faced with similar battles. “You can’t blame people, because there is a culture that has been handed down, but I will not accept that anybody is an abomination because of whom they love,” she says. After hours spent counselling a young woman on the verge of suicide who was unable to find an existence between her faith and her sexuality, Bree is now working towards earning a professional counselling qualification to help others who were once in her shoes. Now that she has found acceptance inside herself, she hopes to help others do the same.

Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-il’s eldest son, was once seen as heir apparent, but fell out of favour in 2001 following a failed attempt to enter Japan on a forged passport, apparently to visit Disneyland. He lived in Macau while his brother took over the nuclear-armed state. If his death was an ordered hit, it would hardly be the first time North Korean operatives have targeted citizens abroad. The isolated state has a long history of assassinations, including estranged relatives of the Kim clan, defectors and South Korean public figures. Other assassinations and high profile attempts have included: Blue House assault, 1968 At the height of the cold war, a team of 31 commandos were sent from Pyongyang to assassinate the then South Korean president Park Chung-hee. They were stopped 100 metres (330 ft) away from the presidential Blue House. Gunfights erupted and more than 90 South Koreans were killed, including many civilians on a bus. Only two of the 31 commandos survived; one fled to the North and one was captured. Presidential attempt, 1974 Park, the late father of the current South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, survived a second assassination attempt in 1974. Mun Se-gwang, a pro-Pyongyang Korean living in Japan, opened fire with a revolver while Park was delivering a speech. He missed Park but killed Park’s wife, Yuk Young-soo. Mun was executed that year. Myanmar, 1983 North Korean undercover agents killed 21 people, including four South Korean cabinet ministers, in a bomb attack in Yangon. A timed device planted under the roof of theMartyr’s Mausoleum was intended to kill the then South Korean president Chun Doo-hwan. It exploded before the president arrived, but his entourage was badly hit. Three North Korean agents fled the scene, one was killed and two others were captured by authorities. Korean Air, 1987 A South Korean plane flying from Baghdad to Seoul exploded over the Andaman Sea. All 115 people on board were killed. The two bombers were traced to Bahrain, where a male agent killed himself by biting a cyanide capsule hidden in a cigarette as they were about to be taken into custody. The other agent, Kim Hyon-hee, was captured and brought to Seoul. She later confessed the attack had been designed to hamper the 1988 Seoul summer Olympics. She was sentenced to death but later pardoned. Diplomat killing,1996 Choi Duk-keun, a South Korean diplomat, was found bludgeoned to death in Vladivostok in 1996 in what South Korean media said was revenge for the death of 25 North Korean submariners who died when their vessel ran aground in the South during an infiltration attempt. A family affair, 1997 Yi Han-yong, a nephew of Jong-nam’s mother Sung Hye-rim, was fatally shot in 1997 outside his home in Seoul. The two assailants were never caught. Yi had been living in the South since his 1982 defection and had published his memoir revealing details of the Kims’ private lives. That book was believed to have been the trigger for the assassination. Before he died, Yi is reported to have muttered “spies”. High-profile defector, 2010 Two agents posing as defectors were arrested in a plot to assassinate Hwang Jang-yop, a former Workers’ party secretary who remains the highest-level North Korean to seek asylum in the South. South Korean officials said both agents were majors in North Korea’s main army intelligence agency and were under orders to slit Hwang’s throat. Hwang, who once tutored Kim Jong-il, bitterly criticised the North Korean government after his 1997 defection. North Korea called him a traitor and “human scum”. He died six months after the assassination attempt at the age of 87."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/feb/15/the-same-review-enda-walsh-old-cork-prison-corcadorca","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T11:47:24Z","webTitle":"The Same review – Enda Walsh's psychodrama thrills in old Cork prison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/15/the-same-review-enda-walsh-old-cork-prison-corcadorca","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/feb/15/the-same-review-enda-walsh-old-cork-prison-corcadorca","fields":{"headline":"The Same review – Enda Walsh's psychodrama thrills in old Cork prison","bodyText":"For the 25th anniversary of Corcadorca theatre company, Enda Walsh returns to Cork and reunites with director Pat Kiernan, with whom he created his first major play, Disco Pigs. Eileen Walsh – who appeared with a then unknown Cillian Murphy in that breakthrough – stars in this new, site-specific work alongside her sister, Catherine Walsh. There is an undeniable sense of an event as the audience gathers inside a recently decommissioned prison. Upstairs, we are presented with a series of sculptural and sound installations, creating an eerie sense of lives frozen in time. Children’s toys, photographs, iced cakes and blobs of molten pastry suggest a childhood that has been disturbed by someone or something. What looks like a brightly decorated Christmas tree turns out to be a cascade of shiny packaging for different types of medication. In other rooms, sand has silted up in the corners. Designer Owen Boss, composer Peter Power and lighting designer Michael Hurley create an unsettling mood before the audience files across a high-walled courtyard in the rain. What follows is a heightened encounter between two characters, with elements of a psychological thriller, that plays with our sense of time. Sitting in the recreation room of a psychiatric institution, the women deliver alternating monologues about moving to a new city and crossing paths with each other. Both are called Lisa, and eventually they speak directly to one another. As events described by the older Lisa (Catherine Walsh) are later experienced by the younger Lisa (Eileen Walsh), they realise that they are the same person, with about 10 years difference between them. Initially, they find joy and solace in being united with a version of themselves, in being completely understood. Lying with her head in the older Lisa’s lap, the younger Lisa recalls the awfulness of a childhood dominated by a mother who clearly had mental health problems. The text leaves many narrative details unexplained and under Kiernan’s direction the piece seems deliberately porous, with silence and sound used as much as language. Walsh’s frenetic scenes of entrapment, seen in recent work such as Ballyturk and last year’s Arlington, have given way to a delicate and sombre tone. Sorrow seeps into the spaces between the two women. Although more metaphorical than literal, the prison setting suggests that Lisa has, at some stage in her life, been institutionalised. While the premise of two embodiments of the same person may sound abstract, in the riveting performances of the Walsh sisters, it becomes real, and somehow simple. It asks whether we would, given the choice, want to know what is going to happen in our future life. The younger Lisa can’t bear the thought of this, of knowing that her future has already been mapped out and lived, while the older Lisa needs to escape from her younger self because of the painful childhood memories she awakens. What lingers in the mind after this superbly realised production is a sense of melancholy: for the things that have happened and cannot be changed, and an intimation that what is to come might not be so very different after all. It might merely be the same. At Old Cork prison, Cork, until 25 February.

The patent, purchased by Apple as part of its acquisition of a display company called LuxVue in 2014, details a system of using LEDs mounted underneath a display to both detect finger’s position and scan its surface to be able to read a fingerprint. Apple said in the newly reassigned patent: “When the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes within the display panel sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. “This patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor as a bitmap where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface’s unique pattern. Because the display panel can sense IR light, the display panel is able to perform surface profile determination when the display panel is not emitting visible light.” The LuxVue-developed technology concentrates on using tiny LEDs under the display to replicate the ability to detect the presence of a finger or other interacting element against the glass of a screen. The majority of mobile devices use capacitive touchscreen layers, which detect a change in capacitance when a finger or other conductive element touches the screen. The technology is also used in many fingerprint sensors and other devices, but has drawbacks particularly in cold weather – they do not work very well when a finger is covered in a glove unless that glove has conductive surface. The patent describes the use of the array of LED sensors under the display to replicate the functions of both a traditional capacitive touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, replicating the function of Apple’s Touch ID home button. Apple states: “The ability to detect an object’s surface profile while the display panel is not emitting visible light enables the display panel to detect a user’s fingerprint to unlock a mobile device such as a cellphone when the display panel appears to be off. “Accordingly, the display panel need not emit visible light to detect a surface profile of an object, nor does the display panel require a separate sensor to detect the surface profile of an object.” Apple is not the only company working on new technologies to allow components necessary to the function of a modern smartphone to be moved under the display. Sensors such as ambient light detectors, which provide information to adjust the display’s brightness in line with current light levels, presence sensors that turn off the screen when you put the phone to your ear, the earpiece speaker and the selfie camera are all currently mounted above or around the screen in separate panels. The placement of those components is one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of all-screen smartphones, where the unnecessary bezels around the screen are removed in favour of a display that reaches to the very edges and top and bottom of the phone. Progress is being made to reduce the need for bezels around the display. Some smartphone manufacturers, including Huawei, Google and LG have moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device. LG’s latest Android Wear smartwatches have a new ambient light sensor that can operate from beneath a screen, while Sharp and Xiaomi have both released smartphones that use bone-conduction systems built into the screens to remove the need for a separate earpiece speaker at the top of the device. At the same time, Apple’s iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the top and bottom of the their screens, with the home button and integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner mounted within the bottom bezel and the speaker grille, sensors and selfie camera in the top bezel. These large bezels have made the body of company’s smartphones relatively large compared to competitors, despite having smaller display areas. Samsung’s highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to have an edge-to-edge “infinity display” with thin top and bottom bezels that do not even have room for the company’s logo. It should give the Galaxy S8 one of the highest screen-to-body ratios of any smartphone, but even then it will not be truly all-screen.

It follows 11-year-old boxing enthusiast Toni as she attempts to join her local Cincinatti all-girl dance team, which then begins to be affected by a mysterious outbreak of fainting fits. The film is in cinemas from 24 February. How did you get the idea for the film? I was producing a documentary, Ballet 422, where we followed a young choreographer and watched dancers learn their moves with this unspoken body exchange. I started thinking about adolescence as a choreography that we learn in a similar way, by body mirroring, by looking at others to define how we move, how we talk, how we think about ourselves. I’d always been fascinated by cases of mass psychogenic illness, and something clicked. It’s also about my own coming of age. I co-wrote this with my editor, Saela Davis, and my producer, Lisa Kjerulff. We all had similar experiences of being close with our older brothers and then entering into larger groups of females. Navigating that moment was really defining for us. Is there a particular outbreak that the film is based on? We looked at a broad range, from 500 years ago to the present day. In medieval times there was this “dancing disease” where a whole town would be struck by episodes of dancing till collapsing, and then there were more recent cases in the US where groups of cheerleaders would all come down with similar symptoms. In the film, the fits are filmed on mobile phones. Do you think, with social media, there’s the possibility the outbreaks could spread that way? In some recent cases there was definitely an ability to spread more quickly that way. And there are fascinating cases of “soap opera disease”, where large groups of people who watch the same TV episode can come down with the symptoms of the characters. You found real-life Cincinnati dance squad the Q-Kidz on YouTube. What did you like about them? It felt like falling in love. One of the things I love about drills [competitive dance contests] is their inherent call-and-response, that mirroring. There’s also a way to incorporate mundane everyday gestures so it allowed us to infuse the narrative into the dance itself. And it felt like a dance that an introverted tomboy like Toni would want to do. Royalty Hightower gives a fantastic performance. What were you looking for in your lead? Toni is a really challenging part – she has almost no dialogue but she carries almost every single frame of the film. To put that burden on, at the time, a nine-year-old girl felt like a big deal, but Royalty has this amazing capacity to listen and be very present. A lot of people think that you cast the kid as themselves, but she is not like Toni at all in real life. The majority of the cast are African American. After last year’s #OscarsSoWhite, do you think that there is an effort to make the film industry more ethnically diverse? If we’re going to really solve deeply embedded problems about lack of inclusion it cannot be about a quick fix or a change of facade; it has to be about real, on-the-ground work, at every part of the crew. It’s not just about the people on stage getting awards. I want to see work from minds and voices that are not just confirming my bias and experience of the world, and I hope other people feel the same thing. What are you working on next? I’m writing again but it’s in the early stages. The average span for a female director between film one and film two is eight years, so I’ll try to come in under that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/16/urban-butterfly-declines-69-compared-to-45-drop-countryside","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-16T06:01:33Z","webTitle":"Urban butterfly declines 69% compared to 45% drop in countryside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/16/urban-butterfly-declines-69-compared-to-45-drop-countryside","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/16/urban-butterfly-declines-69-compared-to-45-drop-countryside","fields":{"headline":"Urban butterfly declines 69% compared to 45% drop in countryside","bodyText":"Butterflies have vanished from towns and cities more rapidly than from the countryside over the past two decades, according to a new study. Industrial agriculture has long been viewed as the scourge of butterflies and other insects but city life is worse – urban butterfly abundance fell by 69% compared to a 45% decline in rural areas over 20 years from 1995. Butterfly species such as the small copper and small heath have suffered particularly disastrous urban declines, according to the study published in the journal Ecological Indicators. Scientists at Butterfly Conservation, the University of Kent and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology found that numbers of small heath fell by 78% in urban areas compared to just 17% in the countryside, while small copper abundance fell by 75% in urban areas compared to 23% in the countryside. Prof Tom Brereton, head of monitoring at Butterfly Conservation and one of the study’s co-authors, said causes included heightened effects of climate change in cities, building on urban green space, the loss of surprisingly wildlife-rich brownfield sites, council cuts and the neglect of parks and pesticide-wielding gardeners who have also turned lawns and flower beds into driveways and patios. He said: “Urban areas are under massive pressure. People are paving over gardens for drives or patios and putting more pesticides on their gardens per area than are put on farmland. Bigger gardens are being sold off for development and councils have less resources for managing green spaces.” The study, which compares trends for 28 species in urban and countryside environments, found that most urban butterflies are emerging earlier and are longer-lived than the same species living in rural areas. On average, city butterflies emerge two days earlier than their country cousins. Urban brimstones are on the wing five days earlier than those found in rural locations. Researchers said the probable cause of the earlier emergence and longer flight periods is the urban heat island effect: human activities make towns and cities warmer than the surrounding countryside. “Warming is generally quite good for a lot of sun-loving butterfly species but some species don’t like warm winters and warm springs and these effects are more pronounced in big cities,” said Brereton. While some councils such as Gateshead and Brighton have been praised for managing verges for wildlife and wild flowers, Brereton said the trend across the country was for hard-pressed councils to cut back on their management of green space with fewer countryside rangers, and contractors “blitzing” grass at the wrong time of year and mowing over wild flowers. But with 87% of people having gardens or access to them – and gardens covering a greater area than all the UK’s national nature reserves – Brereton said gardeners also bear responsibility for recent declines. “When I was growing up in Manchester in the 1970s, no one used chemicals and everyone had a lawn and flowers and we used to see loads of greenfly as kids – you don’t really see them anymore. We need to be more tolerant of nature.” Butterfly Conservation advises gardeners to cut out weedkillers and pesticides and grow some native wild flowers, while also allowing native “weeds” such as ivy, which is a food source for the holly blue and provides vital autumnal nectar for red admirals and other insects. Dr Nigel Bourn, director of conservation science for Butterfly Conservation, said: “Improving the urban environment is something many of us can make a real contribution to, leaving bits of garden as wild areas, using less chemicals and gardening with wildlife in mind.” Bourn also called on councils to adopt “common sense” – and cheap – wildlife gardening. “More can be done locally in our parks and green spaces,” he said. “The same basic principles of wildlife gardening should be adopted across the country as a matter of common sense.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/2017/feb/17/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27118","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T12:00:09Z","webTitle":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,118","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2017/feb/17/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27118","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2017/feb/17/annotated-solutions-for-prize-27118","fields":{"headline":"Annotated solutions for Prize 27,118","bodyText":"Across 1 adroit AD  ST 9 searing S  ING 11 Ten Commandments TEN  TS 12 olid OL&lt;1&gt;D 13 coat hanger C(hild)/OATH/ANGER 17 epentheses (l)E PEN + THESES 18 yawn YAW/N(orth) 20 totalitarianism 1 TRAIT(or) MAO STALIN (anag) 23 despair RI  D (rev) 24 traitor TRAIT/OR 25 kettle double/cryptic def 26 cheers CHEE  S(e) Down 2 drainpipe double def with ‘waste’ (HOM) 3 orison ORI  ON 4 totem pole TO/TEMP&lt;0&gt;LE 5 resin RE-SIN 6 dead meat DATE MADE (anag) 7 avian A/V&lt;1&gt;AN 8 introverted (d)IN  ED [Tourist Trophy] 10 gastronomer G(alileo)/ASTRONOMER 14 theoretic THE  IC 15 gladiator ROT/AIDA/L(a) G(ioconda) (rev) 16 stalwart SALT (anag) + WART 19 damage DAM  E 21 taste double def 22 terse (secre)T/ERSE"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/feb/15/millionaire-who-killed-his-wife-sued-by-sons-for-profiting-from","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T13:15:47Z","webTitle":"Millionaire who killed his wife sued by sons for 'profiting' from murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/15/millionaire-who-killed-his-wife-sued-by-sons-for-profiting-from","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/feb/15/millionaire-who-killed-his-wife-sued-by-sons-for-profiting-from","fields":{"headline":"Millionaire who killed his wife sued by sons for 'profiting' from murder","bodyText":"A millionaire businessman who stabbed his wife to death in the midst of a bitter divorce row is being sued for £1.5m by his two sons. Ben Workman, 27 and his brother Nicholas, 23, said their father, Ian, had “profited” from their mother’s death. In the case at the appeal court in London described as “unique and troubling”, the brothers claim their 63-year-old father would have had to hand over half his fortune to their mother, Susan, in a divorce settlement had he not murdered her. If the car dealer is allowed to keep the £3.3m fortune, the brothers’ lawyers argue, he will have profited from murdering their mother. Workman, who is serving a life sentence, is defending himself from his prison cell and insists he did not kill his wife for money. He is believed to have given away almost his entire fortune to his eldest son, Grant, 28, who has stood by him throughout his conviction. Workman stabbed his wife through the heart in a frenzied row at the family home in Edgworth, near Bolton, in April 2011. Stephen Killalea QC told London’s civil appeal court that Workman snapped as the estranged couple rowed over the financial fallout from their divorce. Susan had been claiming a payout of about £1.5m from her former partner. But the money remained in his possession after he was convicted of her murder at Preston crown court in December 2011. Workman claims he has been treated “unfairly and oppressively” by his two sons but they are determined he should not profit from their mother’s murder. Backing their claim is Susan’s sister, Carol Forrester, who is representing her murdered sibling’s estate. Workman watched the case via live video link from jail as his lawyers insisted he had not been given a fair chance to defend himself.The brothers’ case reached the appeal court after Workman challenged a judgment for £1,503,579 that was entered against him in 2013. As part of an asset-freezing injunction, Workman had been ordered to disclose his assets worldwide. But Killalea said he made no attempt to comply with the order and, as a result, was barred from defending his sons’ claim. The QC also claimed Workman had “voluntarily dissipated virtually all his assets” to Grant. Workman’s obstruction of the legal process had led to “horrendous delays” and caused “intense emotional strain” to the brothers and deepened the trauma already caused by their mother’s murder, he added. However, Workman’s barrister, Katherine McQuail, urged the appeal court to give him a fair chance to defend himself against his sons’ claim. Denying that a “profit motive” lay behind the murder, she said Workman was “in temper” when he killed his wife at the height of a “bitter dispute” during the breakdown of their 35-year marriage. During his trial, Workman insisted he acted in self defence after his wife came at him with a kitchen knife and that she was fatally injured during the struggle. But he was convicted and ordered to serve a life sentence. His conviction challenge was turned down by the criminal appeal court in 2014. At his murder trial the court heard poignant extracts from Susan’s diary – with the last entry written moments before the killing. The log, titled “Sue’s Memories”, recorded how her former husband stormed into the house to retrieve his “clothes and jumpers”. Her last unfinished line read “standing, staring at me acro …” before she was stabbed to death. Lord Justice McCombe, Lady Justice Sharp and Lady Justice Thirlwall have now reserved their decision on Workman’s appeal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/shortcuts/2017/feb/15/harrison-fords-been-flying-his-plane-again-weve-got-a-bad-feeling-about-this","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T12:25:23Z","webTitle":"Harrison Ford’s been flying his plane again – we’ve got a bad feeling about this","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2017/feb/15/harrison-fords-been-flying-his-plane-again-weve-got-a-bad-feeling-about-this","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/shortcuts/2017/feb/15/harrison-fords-been-flying-his-plane-again-weve-got-a-bad-feeling-about-this","fields":{"headline":"Harrison Ford’s been flying his plane again – we’ve got a bad feeling about this","bodyText":"Name: Harrison Ford. Age: 74. Appearance: Still got it. There’s not another Star Wars film coming out is there? Give us a chance to catch up, George! No, it’s another plane crash. What? Ford has crashed his plane again. Oh no! Is he OK? He hasn’t damaged his face, has he? No, all is well. It wasn’t actually a crash, it was a crisis averted. Explain yourself while my hot flush dies down. It looks as if he mistook a taxiway at the John Wayne airport in California for a runway and nearly landed on a Boeing 737 full of passengers who were waiting to take off for Dallas. Yikes! “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” he said, according to air traffic recordings. He is too cool. As Han Solo would say: I know. Still, he does do this quite a lot, doesn’t he? Depends what you mean by quite a lot. Well, two years ago, he crash landed on that golf course and ended up with a broken arm and head injuries. True. And in 2000, he made an emergency landing in a six-seater plane at Nebraska’s Lincoln municipal airport. Yes, but ... And there was the hard landing in a helicopter in 1999. Yes, BUT – he flies a lot. So he’s going to crash a lot. I don’t think that’s the rule. I know, but the helicopter one was during a training session and was totally to be expected. The Nebraska thing was caused by wind shear, and the incident two years ago ... Yes? ... was lauded by the authorities as an exemplary landing after his engine failed. He remained completely calm and guided the plane to the least populated place that ground control could find, before plummeting the last 3,000ft, and injured only himself. That does sound pretty Indiana-Jones-meets-Air-Force-One, doesn’t it? Y’know, he began his career in America Graffiti. Everyone forgets that. They do, don’t they? Anyway, the important thing is that the 110 passengers in the Boeing 737 are fine – probably quite thrilled to have been flown over by Harrison Ford himself. And Ford’s fine, future franchise instalments are fine, everything’s fine. Hurrah!

Lord Justice Pitchford, the senior judge heading the inquiry, wants to ask for evidence from all the undercover officers who are still alive, as he is not confident that all the documents relating to their covert operations still exist. But the Metropolitan Police is arguing that the inquiry may not need to examine the conduct of every undercover officer in great detail. Correspondence published on Wednesday reveals that the Met has pressed the inquiry to consider looking at a smaller number of officers in depth in order to save money. Pitchford also disclosed on Wednesday that his inquiry is unlikely to start holding public sessions to hear evidence before 2018 – four years after the inquiry was ordered by Theresa May, while she was home secretary. It follows a request from the Met for more time to submit legal applications to hold large parts of the inquiry behind closed doors, as police believe that nothing that identifies an undercover officer should be made public. The correspondence is published a week after a police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, disclosed it had uncovered evidence that a Scotland Yard intelligence unit had shredded a large number of files after May ordered the public inquiry. May gave the order in March 2014, to examine what she called the “very real and substantial failings” of the undercover spies. She acted after it was confirmed that the undercover police had collected information about the parents of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. Police have apologised after revelations that undercover officers had formed long-term, intimate relationships with women and stolen the identities of dead children. The Met has signalled its intention to apply for legal orders to keep secret the identities of 116 undercover officers, and 58 other officers, who worked for an undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), between 1968 and 2008. For a year the Met has been arguing that the work of the undercover operatives must be concealed to preserve covert techniques and to protect the spies from harm ranging from revenge attacks to “social ostracisation”. In the correspondence published on Wednesday, it is revealed the Met asked Pitchford in December to reconsider whether the police should be required to submit applications to conceal all of the former undercover officers in the SDS. Melanie Jones, a Met lawyer, wrote: “The Metropolitan Police Service recognises that a number of deployments will be properly subjected to a close scrutiny by the inquiry in meeting its terms of reference. This does not mean, however that each deployment will need to be subjected to the same depth of review.” She asked if the Met could submit legal applications to keep secret only the identities of those undercover officers that Pitchford “wishes to subject to more considered scrutiny”. She argued that it would be a waste public money to carry out legal work to submit secrecy applications which were later approved by the inquiry. Preparing applications to keep secret all the undercover officers would be “disproportionate given the resourcing this will require and all the other demands being made on the Metropolitan Police Service,” she wrote. She also argued that process of preparing the legal applications could be “harrowing and upsetting” for the undercover officers. “Some are in advanced years. Some may need to undergo distressing and confusing psychological or medical assessment which are themselves costly in financial resources.” She added that “individuals the inquiry may in fact have little or no interest in will need to go through this process anyway.” The Met wants an extension of the deadline – from 1 March until 1 October this year – to submit its secrecy applications. Pitchford is holding a public hearing on 5 April to consider the Met’s requests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/feb/15/gas-electricity-bills-rise-fixed-contracts-end-expire","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T14:23:09Z","webTitle":"Energy bills to rise up to 28% for thousands in UK as fixed contracts end","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/15/gas-electricity-bills-rise-fixed-contracts-end-expire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/feb/15/gas-electricity-bills-rise-fixed-contracts-end-expire","fields":{"headline":"Energy bills to rise up to 28% for thousands in UK as fixed contracts end","bodyText":"Thousands of UK households are facing gas and electricity bill rises of up to 28% as fixed price contracts signed before recent energy price increases come to an end. So far this winter, EDF, npower and Scottish Power have all announced hikes, meaning the customers of those companies need to look carefully at what they paying, particularly if they coming off a fixed tariff. Moneysupermarket has said 77 fixed energy deals are set to expire before the end of April, leaving average households typically facing a £200-a-year increase to around £1,100 a year for gas and electricity. Gas and electricity price increases of up to 15% – and much more for those coming off old fixed tariffs – have left consumers scrambling to get on a another fixed deal. But even those who switch supplier are likely to end up paying more over the coming year. EDF, npower, Scottish Power and SSE are among those with tariffs finishing, alongside deals from smaller suppliers such as Spark and Extra Energy. When fixed energy deals end providers roll customers on to their standard variable tariffs, which are typically their most expensive. Some customers who were on especially cheap tariffs have been told their bills will rise 28%. One supplier, npower, shocked the industry and even the regulator Ofgem when it announced it was raising electricity prices by 15% while gas bills will rise 4.8% adding a typical £109 a year to average bills. The other firms to raise electricity prices have announced rises of around 8%. However, British Gas said last week it was freezing bills. Moneysupermarket said consumers could switch penalty-free up to 45 days before their existing deal is due to end, under the regulator’s switching rules. Currently the cheapest providers are names that many consumers will be unfamiliar with, such as Iresa, Economy Energy and Tonik. Of the big six providers, Scottish Power’s online fixed saver is one of the cheaper deals. Stephen Murray, energy expert at Moneysupermarket, said: “The energy market is really unpredictable at the moment and a huge part of that is rising prices. In June last year the cheapest deals were below £750, whereas currently the average cost of the top 10 cheapest tariffs is £880. It is worth noting that these deals still represent a significant saving on standard variable tariffs.” He said customers on expiring tariffs should act now to lock in new fixed deals and avoid being rolled on to standard variable tariffs. “The British Gas price freeze may sound like a fair alternative, but customers are still overpaying by around £170 and so the message is the same – don’t rest on your laurels, standard tariffs still remain among the most expensive. It only takes a few minutes to swap providers to save almost £200 each year.” Mobile phone users are also facing more expensive bills in the coming months, following the rise in inflation. Vodafone, EE and O2 have said millions of mobile phone customers will face inflationary mid-contract price rises in the next couple of months. EE is raising some customers’ monthly bills by 2.5% from 30 March, in line with January’s retail price index inflation figure. O2 will increase monthly its charges by 2.6% in April, and Vodafone bills will rise by March’s inflation figure – also from April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2017/feb/17/looking-for-marketing-job-but-hearts-not-in-it","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"I'm looking for a marketing job but my heart's not in it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/17/looking-for-marketing-job-but-hearts-not-in-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/feb/17/looking-for-marketing-job-but-hearts-not-in-it","fields":{"headline":"I'm looking for a marketing job but my heart's not in it","bodyText":"Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions.

Consequently, I was fixated on stability and survival, even though that meant relegating my real love – writing – to a hobby. I’ve done well as a result and at the age of 27 became head of the marketing department at a mid-sized company. I saved most of the money I earned during that time and a year ago I left to explore. I did some contract marketing work, wrote a book and learned that I’m infinitely happier earning less and writing more than I am spending 40-plus hours a week doing marketing, however great the product or the team. There’s no way I can make a living from writing just yet, so I need a part-time job, or a full-time one that’s less mentally taxing than a senior marketing role. The jobs I have been applying for during the past few months are either going to less experienced people who are committed to the marketing ladder (I’ve made it clear I’m happy to take a substantial pay cut), or equally experienced marketers who have other reasons for going part-time (presumably children) that don’t involve working towards an eventual career change. Contract work is relatively easy to get because it doesn’t matter to either party that the role isn’t the dream job. But I’m looking to buy a property in the next few years – I have great credit and a decent savings pot – so a long-term, stable income is a requirement.

It began with the Berlin Radio Symphony in the 1980s, then 16 years with the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Leipzig Gewandhaus from 2005 to 2015, and now the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where he took over formally as music director in January. Chailly no doubt intends to raise the profile of the orchestra in the concert hall as well as in the opera house itself. His first recording with them makes a neat bridge between the two, as well as signalling his determination to promote a much wider range of Italian music than the house has programmed in recent years. The 16 orchestral pieces included here are taken from operas that received their premieres in Milan; all except the two by Leoncavallo were first performed at La Scala. Chailly has resisted the temptation to present them chronologically, preferring to vary and contrast the mood of the numbers, but it’s still a fascinating forage through almost 100 years of Italian music, from the earliest, the overture to Rossini’s La Pietra del Paragone, first performed in 1812 (and later reused to begin his better known Tancredi), up to Puccini’s Madama Butterfly of 1904. The intermezzo from Butterfly is one of only four pieces on the disc that could be described as well known, together with the overture to Bellini’s Norma, the intermezzo from Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci and the Dance of the Hours from Ponchielli’s La Gioconda. Even the two Verdi items that begin the disc are not particularly familiar: the overture to Un Giorno di Regno (listed here under the original title of the libretto, Il Finto Stanislao) and the prelude to the third-act trio of I Lombardi. Other rarities include the overture to Donizetti’s Ugo, Conte di Parigi, Giordano’s looming prelude to the second act of his Siberia (with its motto from the Song of the Volga Boatmen), first performed in 1903, more Leoncavallo (two preludes from I Medici of 1893), and the majestic music that opens Boïto’s Mefistofele. There’s nothing very substantial, but it all makes a fine workout for the Filarmonica della Scala. There may be room for improvement here and there in the orchestra, but the recording suggests that most sections are already in fine shape – the brass is particularly impressive in the Boïto extract. Chailly has always been a superb Puccini conductor, and predictably it’s the music of the last decades of the 19th century that shows him at his best here. The Rossini and Donizetti are, of course, neat and tidy enough, but they don’t hold the attention in the way that his performances of Giordano, Ponchielli and Leoncavallo do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/15/what-are-your-worst-dating-experiences","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T13:50:27Z","webTitle":"What are your worst dating experiences?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/15/what-are-your-worst-dating-experiences","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/15/what-are-your-worst-dating-experiences","fields":{"headline":"What are your worst dating experiences?","bodyText":"A woman who tried to let a man down gently after just one date was left surprised by his response: a request for his money back.

In a case that brings the deepening NHS bed crisis into sharp relief, a coroner said it was likely that Mary Muldowney, 57, would have survived if she had been given immediate surgery to stem the bleeding. Muldowney was admitted to East Surrey hospital in Redhill on 20 July last year and immediately diagnosed with a suspected bleed on the brain. When a CT scan carried out just over an hour later showed heavy bleeds, doctors requested an immediate transfer to a specialist neurosurgical unit for surgery. But three units – St George’s hospital in Tooting, south-west London, the Royal Sussex county hospital in Brighton, and King’s College hospital in London – refused the request because they had no beds. The coroner heard that other hospitals had been contacted but also had no beds available. The Royal London hospital (RLH) agreed to take Muldowney after a consultant neurosurgeon was contacted by a former colleague at the East Surrey hospital but her condition deteriorated in the ambulance and surgery could not save her. The death will put further pressure on the government to address a growing crisis after leaked figures suggested that A&amp;E patients in England experienced the worst month of delays in January since a four-hour waiting target was introduced 13 years ago. It also comes after the heads of the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) and NHS Providers said that surgeons were “kicking their heels” because of delays to operations caused by a shortage of beds. In a letter to the Sunday Times, Clare Marx, the president of the R CS, and Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, blamed cuts aimed at driving productivity for causing greater inefficiency in some areas. They added that bed occupancy should not exceed 85% for safety reasons, but overnight inpatient beds were routinely 89% occupied. In a letter to bosses at NHS England, first reported by the Health Service Journal, the inner north London coroner, Mary Hassell, said a consultant neurosurgeon at the RLH, had accepted transfer of Muldowney immediately, “though in fact the RLH had no intensive care bed available at that time”. After being admitted to hospital Muldowney had woken briefly at 1pm and interacted with her daughter. She was transferred to the RLH and taken straight to theatre at 4.40pm. But the coroner wrote: “Unfortunately, her pupils had become fixed and dilated in the ambulance during transfer to the RLH and surgery did not save her. If she had been transferred promptly, it probably would have.” The coroner, who recorded a narrative verdict, said evidence showed that Muldowney “could have been transferred, undergone surgery, spent time in recovery, and then an intensive care bed procured”. If a bed could not be found she “could then have been transferred to a different hospital, at least having undergone the time-critical clot evacuation and aneurysm clipping”, she wrote. She added: “With prompt transfer and surgery, Ms Muldowney would probably have survived. In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.” Responding, NHS England’s medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, said a serious patient safety issue had been raised and he was “very sorry” to read of Muldowney’s death. He said Prof Simon Mackenzie, from St George’s hospital, had suggested Muldowney “was not deemed by the neurosurgical services to which she was being referred to require immediate life-saving surgery” and fell outside the scope of the universal acceptance policy. Mackenzie said he believed St George’s had provided acceptable care because Muldowney suffered a re-bleed during the ambulance transfer to the RLH. Mackenzie said that “although at the time of the referral to the St George’s neurosurgical unit a re-bleed was a possibility, this was not the reason for her urgent transfer”, Keogh wrote. The process of securing a bed added a delay of just less than two hours to the acceptance process, he said. Keogh said clinicians from East Surrey hospital and St George’s were due to meet as there was a clear “difference in perspective” between them about how the surgery had occurred."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2017/feb/20/brilliant-boards-charities-trustees-leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-20T07:30:31Z","webTitle":"Six ways to create a brilliant charity board | Leon Ward","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/feb/20/brilliant-boards-charities-trustees-leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/voluntary-sector-network/2017/feb/20/brilliant-boards-charities-trustees-leaders","fields":{"headline":"Six ways charity boards can make their workload manageable","bodyText":"People on voluntary sector boards have heavy workloads – so what’s the best way to share the burden? Sub-committees may not seem exciting, but, used properly, delegating tasks will help your board to be brilliant. Here are my six top tips on how to get the most from your sub-committees: 1. Let them delve into detail Charity trustees often want to get involved in the nitty gritty. But in a busy board meeting, with a tight agenda, that can sometimes be a pain in the neck. However, executives and trustees will still want to work together from time to time, to delve into detail. Sub-committees are the way to do this without taking precious time away from the primary board meeting. It’s a great way for charity staff to engage with trustees and vice versa, enabling trustees to gain a better understanding of the day-to-day issues affecting the charity while offering their own expertise. 2. Bring in specialists If your board is proposing something new, controversial or risky, setting up a sub-committee is a clever way to use people who can bring in particular expertise but who, for whatever reason, do not want to or cannot be a full trustee. It is also a good way to test whether people come up to scratch in terms of their style and expertise, giving you a bigger pool to choose from when recruiting for your main board. You should also consider the “internal” outsider: someone already on your main board who is interested in a particular issue but is not an expert. They can be used as a sounding board (pun intended) and this is often a great way to test a proposal before presenting it to the rest of the board. 3. Don’t let sub-committees linger on pointlessly It’s important to close any committee when it has run its course. For instance, you may set one up for a digital needs review and then close it when the review has been done. But committees can also evolve. Something that starts as a review of digital needs could turn into a committee that monitors the implementation of an organisational IT strategy, for instance. 4. Set boundaries This is perhaps the most important element of committee working. To ensure good governance you must be clear on which, if any, powers the board has granted its sub-committee. That way you can ensure the reins of responsibility remain in the correct hands and avoid a situation where the committee ends up undermining the board, or vice versa. This does not have to be cumbersome – usually a one pager does the trick. 5. Engage junior members of staff Developing staff is critical for any organisation. Boards offer an opportunity for staff to develop their skills by working with the organisation’s trustees. It also helps to build trust with staff when trustees are visible and, as a trustee, it can be eye-opening to work alongside the people managing the work you are scrutinising. This about moving the voluntary sector from its traditional hierarchical management structure to a more egalitarian approach. We say we value our people; this is a quick way of showing that. 6. Involve service users One of the most powerful messages the voluntary sector can send is demonstrating that it is guided by those it serves. Boardrooms are not always the most appropriate way of engaging with service users, but committees can help. If you are working on a specific piece of work it might be an idea to bring those it most directly affects into the fold. Committees can be more informal than traditional boards and, with the right guidance and frameworks in place, it’s possible to work together to solve problems.

He takes to the stage solo wearing a colour-blindness test of a T-shirt because “someone spilled rum” on his favoured stagewear, and delivers a stark, impassioned blues take on bluegrass standard Reuben’s Train. Rag’n’Bone Man has a fantastic voice but, in truth, Graham’s gritted-honey vocals smack as much of Michael Bolton as Ben E King, and he rarely belts it out as powerfully as you might expect. As his band kick in on Wolves and Ego they leave him muted and restrained, grooving gently around the stage to pedestrian mainstream soul and living up to the latter’s line “I know my gospel but I ain’t a preacher”. It’s his base tone – straight-bat retro-soul spirituals with occasional lounge rap interludes, stripped of the modernist crackles of his records and sung in a style that The X Factor has beaten into a generation as the way that good singers sing. Be a Man could have fallen off Phil Collins’ But Seriously…, while Guilty is Clapton’s idea of the blues. Graham seems genuinely proud to have co-written the unremarkable Your Way with the unremarkable Jamie Lidell, or serial-killer suicide lament Lay My Body Down with Dan Smith from Bastille. It all adds up to a new faux-leftfield cult of the ordinary. No wonder Elton’s already been on the blower. When Graham strips the band away and sings “miserable songs” accompanied by haunting piano, though, he stops looking like he’s about to be knocked out of The Voice in the battle rounds and his voice billows, wielded with a mastery that eluded other recent critics’ choices such as Garrett, Smith and that one in the hat. Odetta is a touching ode to a friend’s newborn and his acoustic take on new single Skin received such hushed attention you could hear someone’s knuckles crack. His big, brooding hit Human, a steamy gospel Hulk of a tune, impresses too, but as Graham’s debut album outsells the rest of the Top 20 put together, it comes with a background whimper of some distant, more interesting musical galaxy disintegrating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/feb/16/dutch-uncles-big-balloon-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-16T21:30:14Z","webTitle":"Dutch Uncles: Big Balloon review – broke and betrayed in austerity Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/16/dutch-uncles-big-balloon-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/feb/16/dutch-uncles-big-balloon-review","fields":{"headline":"Dutch Uncles: Big Balloon review – broke and betrayed in austerity Britain","bodyText":"Here’s an alternative to the aggro punk poetry of Sleaford Mods: for their fifth album, Dutch Uncles have captured the cold, industrial grind of being broke and betrayed in austerity Britain.

Tiberghien balances these with the knotty Études and the thick-set Sonata – and through it all, the angular and the earthy, he has a way of making Bartók’s rhythms sound simultaneously stretchy, precise and personal.

Ford, 74, was told to land his single-engine plane on a runway at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, on Monday, but he mistakenly landed it on a parallel taxiway, passing over an American Airlines jet holding nearby, NBC reported. “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” Ford is heard asking air traffic controllers in a recording. American Airlines Flight 1456, with 110 passengers and six crew, departed safely for Dallas a few minutes later. Ford’s publicist, Ina Treciokas, declined to comment. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor couldn’t confirm that Ford was piloting the Aviat Husky that overflew the Boeing 737, but he said the pilot received and had read back the proper landing instructions. The FAA is investigating, Gregor said. In March 2015, Ford was seriously injured when his second world war-era trainer crashed on a Los Angeles golf course when it lost power shortly after takeoff. The actor was praised for his ingenuity in avoiding more populated areas. In 1999, Ford crash-landed his helicopter during a training flight in which he and an instructor were practising auto rotations in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles; neither of them was hurt. An in another incident, Ford was flying a Beechcraft Bonanza in 2000 when wind shear forced him to make an emergency landing at Lincoln Municipal Airport in Nebraska. Ford and his passenger were uninjured when the plane clipped the runway. The actor is best known for his role as maverick pilot Han Solo in the Star Wars series. While shooting Star Wars: The Force Awakens in London in June 2014, the actor was involved in an onset accident in which he broke his leg. The production company was later fined $2m after claims were upheld that the hydraulic door which injured Ford could have killed him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/live/2017/feb/15/uk-unemployment-wages-brexit-greece-janet-yellen-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T17:45:06Z","webTitle":"US inflation leaps to 2.5%, as UK real wage growth slides - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/feb/15/uk-unemployment-wages-brexit-greece-janet-yellen-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/feb/15/uk-unemployment-wages-brexit-greece-janet-yellen-business-live","fields":{"headline":"US inflation leaps to 2.5%, as UK real wage growth slides - business live","bodyText":"Helped by some positive economic news and a strong start on Wall Street - partly due to President Trump talking again about forthcoming tax reforms - European markets ended the day higher. The FTSE 100 was boosted by a weaker pound, with the dollar lifted by the prospect of higher interest rates after comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen in the last two days. Banks and mining companies were both among the main gainers. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 33.85 points or 0.47% at 7302.41 Germany’s Dax rose 0.19% to 11,793.93 France’s Cac closed up 0.59% at 4924.86 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.78% at 9584.1 But Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.69% to 19,056.16 In Greece the Athens market dropped 1.11% to 626.29 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 82 points or 0.4%. On that note it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has completed a flying visit to Athens on an upbeat note saying the impasse between Greece and its creditors can soon be resolved. Helena Smith reports: Emerging from a series of back-to-back meetings in Athens, the French commissioner expressed optimism that friction over the country’s latest bailout review would be resolved although the likelihood of that happening by February 20 when euro zone finance ministers next meet is almost impossible. Following talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras, Moscovici emphasized the need for Greeks “to see a light at the end of the austerity tunnel.” Earlier he had told reporters after a “very constructive” 30-minute meeting with finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos that Greece’s place was at the heart of the euro zone. ‘The fiscal targets can be met and overachieved… the will to go to a solution is there … and where there is a will there is a way.” But despite the upbeat tone, Moscovici also insisted on the need for reform and said efforts were required “from all sides.” That a compromise will come in the form of Greece accepting to implement additional austerity, however, is far from assured. Tsipras took to twitter to welcome Moscovici insisting that “the time has come to recognise all the sacrifices of the Greek people.” “We can talk about reforms but enough with austerity,” he said, adding: “I am sure the European Commission will be an important partner in the alliance of logic that we need today in Europe.” To break the impasse that has arisen over demands Athens adopts further austerity – in addition to the painful measures it has already enforced and committed to – insiders say the leftist-led government is holding out for a multi-layered compromise agreement. In exchange for €3.6bn worth of extra cuts (not least the lowering of the tax threshold) it wants guaranteed trade-offs such as a debt relief road map, the promise of participation in the ECB’s QE programme and a lower primary surplus target. Yellen is asked that, if there is success in deporting all the undocumented immigrants, what would be the impact on economy. Yellen says: Immigration has been an important part of labour force growth in the US for some time. One factor responsible for slowing growth is slower labour force growth and a radical change in immigration would certainly effect the potential of the economy to grow. US markets continue to hold onto most of their gains following Trump’s tax and regulation comments. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Bang on cue, and no doubt with an eye to outshine Janet Yellen, Donald Trump offered a tantalising foretaste of planned tax reforms that sent the Dow soaring to new record highs. The DJIA just bounced off 20,604 level after the president said he will greatly reduce taxes. Markets are taking this as the fodder they need for a fresh pop higher. He was short on details but based on what we’ve seen so far from this radical president there is no reason to think that the tax plans will be anything less than a major shift in US fiscal policy. Major pro-business tax reform has been on the cards but today’s comments reiterate the president’s intentions. Asked about border adjustment tax and its effect on the economy, Yellen says I don’t think its appropriate for me to weigh in on specifics on this policy. On regulation, Yellen says the Fed is concerned about regulatory burden and if that was not clear she wants to clarify it. (There has been a lot of talk about Dodd Frank and the regulations which were put in place to try and improve the banking system after the financial crisis, with some senators calling for their removal a la Trump and some saying they have protected investors. Yellen is not keen on rolling back on Dodd Frank but clearly feels the need to avoid being seen as putting unnecessary burdens on business.) Back with Yellen and she is asked about her potential relationship with the new Treasury secretary, the ex-Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin. She says she looks forward to a strong working relationship with Mnuchin. US markets seem to be reacting more to Trump than Yellen: Senator McHenry, who wrote to Yellen calling on the Fed to halt talks over international agreements about banking regulations until President Donald Trump has a chance to review their work and replace top negotiators, repeats his question. Yellen: Nothing is a rule that is effective in US until regulatory agencies have gone through the normal rule making process. Nothing binds the Fed to carry out agreements in our our rule making in US. In some cases we don’t agree with the outcomes and have no intention of putting [them] in place. He asks if the Fed will wait for the new regulators to be in place, and takes from Yellen’s reply that the answer is no. Back with Yellen, and the questions seem more directly political and partisan than a day earlier, with some interruptions when the Fed chair is answering: Meanwhile President Trump is talking again about chopping regulations and his tax reforms: Away from Yellen, and US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, as did gasoline inventories. Crude stocks rose by 9.5m barrels compared to analyst forecasts of a 3.5m increase. Gasoline inventories rose by 2.8m barrels, better than the 752,000 drop expected. After various comments and questions on Dodd Frank as per Tuesday, next up is Senator Barr who asks what the “serial failure of the Fed’s forecasts on the economy” tells us about the Fed’s policy. Yellen says the Fed focuses on maximising unemployment not economic growth. Economic growth is disappointing but unemployment has come down substantially. We are close to meeting our labour market goals. The reason [for the growth performance] is that productivity growth in the US economy has been disappointing. (Much as she said on Tuesday) Janet Yellen has begun her second day of testimony, and is giving the same opening remarks as on Tuesday, pointing to a US rate hike before long. With US inflation and retail sales pointing to an interest rate rise - which could dampen earnings at American companies - investors are playing it cautiously at the start of US trading and ahead of Janet Yellen’s latest testimony. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 20 points or 0.1% but the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.09% lower and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.07%. More US data, showing industrial production unexpectedly fell in January. Warm weather meant a drop in output from utilities, offsetting rises in manufacturing and mining. So the Federal Reserve’s industrial production index dipped 0.3% compared to expectations that it would remain flat. In December the index showed a rise of 0.6%, itself marked down from an initial reading of 0.8%. (The above shows the December figure before the revision) A reminder that Fed chair Janet Yellen will be up before the financial services committee of the House of Representatives in just under an hour’s time. Rob Carnell at ING Bank reckons the figures mean the Fed is now more likely to raise rates at its next meeting in March: Whilst headline inflation gains can be put down to the impact of helpful base effects, the rise in the core rate, coupled with a better trend in wages growth, sends a clear message that the US economy is now running a little hot, the labour market is tight, and the time for inaction and caution from the Fed is over. Janet Yellen sounded a little more hawkish in her Senate testimony, and that got markets toying again with the idea of a March rate hike. But the data is now doing her work for her, and should push expectations further in this direction. The conclusion we reach from the inflation data is supported also by activity data – in the form of a further strong retail sales figure...The probability of a March Fed hike implied from the Fed funds curve is 42%. We don’t need much more of a push for a March hike to become the market base case. Here’s some instant reaction to the surge in the cost of living in America. Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade. “Today’s figures showed inflation climbed to a five-year high, with the US economy continuing to walk down the same path that led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December. “Under the current levels of inflationary pressure, all eyes will be on Fed Chair Janet Yellen, with investors pencilling in March for the first rate hike of a possible three. “However, uncertainty continues to plague the political landscape, and Yellen will seek further clarity of President Trump’s policies before making a decision when they convene next month.” Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen suggested on Tuesday that interest rate rises would be “appropriate” if the US economy carries on as expected, and this new data can only confirm that belief. (Yellen is due to give the second part of her testimony later but it is likely to be much the same as the previous session.) Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen has indicated that interest rate rises are very much in her plans for the US economy in the year ahead, and today’s inflation data will only serve to underline her stance. Inflation sailed past the Fed’s two per cent target and with economic growth expected to tighten, Yellen may well intervene on multiple occasions in the coming months. The question many investors will be grappling with is when, and not if, rates rise. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Yellen did not provide an explicit timeline in relation to interest rate hike and she is not going to do that today as well. Her job in these events is to manage the market expectations for any future interest rate... However, the CPI data released today has increased more pressure on her and she will be quizzed more intensively. Having said that, we anticipate that the Fed will be able to fire another bullet during the next quarter (when it comes to the interest rate). Yes, sturdy growth and eroding slack in the jobs market are validating the Fed’s economic forecasts, but the wild card is still the Trump’s fiscal and tax plans. The Fed has removed the reference to transitory energy factors from their statement, and for us, it sends the signal that they are confident in achieving their mandate inflation target. But there were some worse than expected outcomes in the day’s data: Boom! Two pieces of US economic data have just hit the wires and moved the markets. The big news is that America’s inflation rate has hit a four-year high last month, jumping from 2.1% to 2.5%. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.6% - twice as fast as expected - as households paid more for petrol (oh ok, gasoline) and food. Retail sales have also smashed forecasts, growing by 0.4% last month - or 0.8% if you exclude automobile sales. Investors are betting that this data puts more pressure on the US central bank to raise interest rates in March. That’s driven up the yield, or interest rates, on US 10-year government bonds. The dollar is also surging, sending the pound reeling to just $1.238 - down almost a whole cent today. But there is a fly in the soup -- average weekly earnings paid to US private workers fell by 0.4% in January. As in Britain, employees aren’t getting the full benefits of the recovery..... Nick Macpherson, former top civil servant at the Treasury, makes an interesting point about today’s employment report -- there are now more job vacancies than people claiming jobless benefit. According to the ONS, there were 751,000 job vacancies for the 3 months to January 2017, while 745,000 people claimed unemployment related benefits in January. The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Bird has helpfully plotted both sets of data for us: There is a caveat (as ever...). Advertising job vacancies is cheaper than in the past, thanks to the internet, so employees may be tempted to speculatively offer positions and see who applies. But this could reinforce the point about Britain’s labour market approaching full capacity. But if that’s really true, why aren’t wages accelerating as workers flex their muscles and threaten to walk? One argument is that there’s more slack in the system than the figures suggest (this is the Bank of England’s argument for not raising interest rates). Another is that the traditional relationship between pay and unemployment has broken down since the financial crisis - which doesn’t bode well for wage rises this year.... The slowdown in real pay growth is causing concern in business, as well as in Westminster -- and prompting calls for government action. Even the CBI, whose members are in a decent position to raise salaries among the ranks, are worried. Rachel Smith, their principal labour market economist, argues that productivity (a long-running problem in Britain) needs to improve. And she singles out business rates as a big concern. “Pay growth remains stubbornly sluggish, which is a concern given rising inflation. There are tentative signs that productivity is picking up, but there is further to go before it can underpin faster wage growth. “Companies will be looking to the Budget to see adjustments to business rates along with measures to boost educational performance, helping firms to drive faster productivity growth.” The rates paid by many businesses are going up sharply in the next few years, with the City of London facing a £1.4bn bill. That’s going to leave less money for pay rises. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams is also sounding the alarm on living standards: “We welcome the overall increase in employment but are concerned that wide regional differences in the numbers of people in work remain. “It is also worrying to see that rising living costs are quickly catching up with wage growth. If this trend continues, the Government’s abysmal record on living standards will get even worse.” The Joseph Rowntree Foundation have seized on today’s wage figures to hammer home their warning that millions more people risk being dragged into poverty by rising inflation. JRF says: “Record employment in the economy is welcome and work has to be the best route out of poverty. But we know employment alone will not always help people reach a decent standard of living. “Our analysis today shows four million more people over the last six years have fallen below a decent leaving standard, meaning they are struggling to make ends meet. “Tackling the high cost of living is crucial to helping just managing families, particularly with a challenging outlook: inflation is likely to average 2.6% this year, in sharp contrast to the very low inflation of recent times. “Government focus on modest incomes is welcome, but there is a fine margin between just managing today and poverty tomorrow.” JRF’s report on the millions of ‘Just about managing’ families who don’t earn enough for a decent standard of living has caused quite a stir today. It shows that some 30% of the population, or 19 million people, are living below the nationally-recognised minimum income standard (MIS) -- defined as having enough money to afford adequate housing, food and clothes. Here’s our take: And here’s Jo Michell, economics lecturer at Bristol Business School: Sam Tombs, economist at Pantheon, flags up that employment growth has slowed. As mentioned earlier, the UK created another 37,000 jobs in the last quarter. That’s the weakest performance since the second quarter of 2015. This chart, from Eshe Nelson of Quartz, shows how real wage growth has slowed as inflation (in purple) catches up with earnings growth (in blue). Real wages are only growing if the blue line is above the purple one -- something that didn’t happen between 2010 and 2014. There could be serious implications for the UK economy if inflation keeps biting into wages, taking real wage growth below today’s two-year low. A real pay squeeze could hurt consumer spending, which has been driving growth since the EU referendum. Andrew Sentance, senior economic advisor of PwC, explains: With wage growth relatively subdued and consumer price inflation now up to 1.8% and set to rise further towards 3% by the end of 2017, the healthy real earnings growth we saw in 2015 and most of 2016 could soon be a thing of the past. “This is likely to take the edge off consumer spending growth later this year and into 2018, which has been the main source of resilience in the UK economy since the Brexit vote. Gerwyn Davies, Labour Market Adviser at the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, is concerned by the fall in real wage growth: “The record number of people in employment is, of course, good news. However there are a number of underlying factors that remain problematic, for example the fall in real wage growth from 1.7% to 1.4% over the last three months. This is especially concerning given the prospect of rising inflation in 2017. Davies is also struck by the drop in EU nationals working in Britain (see 9.57am post). It’s a sign that the EU referendum result is now having an impact on the economy, he agues: “The figures also offer further evidence that Brexit has had a discernable impact on the allure of the UK as a place to live and work. The sharp growth in the number of non-UK nationals from the EU in work in the UK ground to a sudden halt in the second half of the year and has actually fallen in the last quarter. “As a result, employers in sectors that employ relatively large numbers of EU nationals, which also account for a sizeable proportion of vacancies, are likely to come under further recruitment pressures if, as we expect, this trend continues. As our Labour Market Outlook showed, the demand for labour is likely to remain strong in the near-term, which is reflected by the high number of vacancies reported in this month’s figures.“ These charts from Resolution also show how real earnings growth has slowed.... ...and how the average worker has never reclaimed the pay growth lost in the financial crisis. The Resolution Foundation has bad news for UK workers -- they think the squeeze on wages will continue this year. With inflation set to keep rising, real pay rises will be dragged below the 1.4% reported today. Resolution’s latest pay projection show that real pay growth is set to fall to around 1 per cent next month, less than half the pre-crisis average of 2.2 per cent. Laura Gardiner, Senior Policy Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, explains: “Today’s figures show the jobs market remains robust, with employment reaching a new record high and inactivity starting to fall again. “However, the encouraging news on jobs isn’t feeding through into earnings, which have shown no sign of responding to fast-rising inflation. Unless this changes Britain is set for a fresh pay squeeze later this year. This chart shows their latest forecasts: Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at The Work Foundation – part of Lancaster University - also fears that wages are being squeezed by the rising cost of living. He says: The rate of price inflation may soon outstrip wage growth, putting a squeeze on wages. Indeed, the single month figure exceeds 2.5% only in construction.” Today’s report also shows that real wage growth in the UK economy has now fallen to a two-year low, putting more pressure on households. That’s because average earnings only rose by 2.6% in October-December, while inflation averaged 1.2% over the quarter (and has climbed to 1.8% in January!). That means real wages, accounting for inflation, only rose by 1.4% in the last year. The TUC is urging the government to take more action - including ending the pay squeeze on public sector workers. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady says: “With prices rising faster, real pay growth is now slowing down. This will be worrying for families whose have still not seen their living standards recover following the financial crisis. “Next month’s Budget must set out a clear plan for preventing another fall in living standards. The Chancellor should tackle insecurity at work, invest in infrastructure and skills, and end the current pay restrictions on nurses, teachers and other key workers.” This chart plots the UK unemployment rate over the last 45 years (in blue), and also the rates for men (yellow) and women (red) It shows that the overall unemployment rate has dropped from 8.4% in 2011 to just 4.8% at the end of last year, the lowest since mid-2005 (not 2006 as I initially wrote earlier, sorry). Here’s Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green on today’s jobs report: “With employment at its highest rate since records began, and unemployment at its lowest in over a decade, we remain in a position of strength. “Our ongoing welfare reforms will continue to incentivise work and make sure the system is fair to all those who need it and those who pay for it. With youth unemployment down, women in work at record levels and number of disabled people in work increasing too, we’re delivering on our pledge to build a country that works for everyone.” The Department of Work and Pensions are tweeting some positive points from today’s jobs report: Today’s jobs report also shows how the number of non-UK nationals working in Britain has grown over the last two decades, from almost 4% of the workforce to nearly 11%. The ONS says that between October to December 2015 and October to December 2016: UK nationals working in the UK increased by 70,000 to 28.44 million non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 233,000 to 3.48 million And since October to December 1997.... the number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased from just over 1 million to 3.48 million the proportion of all people working in the UK accounted for by non-UK nationals increased from 3.8% to 10.9% this increase in non-UK nationals working in the UK reflects the admission of several new member states to the European Union (EU) Today’s labour market report also shows a small drop in the number of EU workers in the UK, in the final three months of 2016. Does that show that the Brexit vote is having an effect? Possibly....but we should be cautious here, as these figures aren’t seasonally adjusted. The ONS says: “The data on non-UK nationals and non-UK born workers is not seasonally adjusted, so the small drop in the number of workers born in other EU countries, and small rise in the number of non-EU-born workers should be treated with caution. These figures may be affected by seasonal patterns in employment. “The first migration figures that include a post-referendum period will be published on 23 February, when ONS will release migration statistics for the year ended September 2016.” With the employment total at a record high, and the unemployment rate at an 11-year low, Britain’s labour force appears to be approaching full capacity. So argues ONS senior statistician David Freeman, anyway, who says: “Continued moderate growth in employment has led to a new high in the total employment rate, while the rate for women has reached 70% for the first time on record. Overall, the labour market appears to be edging towards full capacity. This chart shows how wages growth slowed in the last month: Here’s a snapshot of the UK jobs report over the last year: BREAKING: Britain’s jobless rate remains at an 11-year low of 4.8% as firms keep hiring workers, but wage growth has slowed. The labour report, just released, shows that: Britain’s unemployment rate was 4.8% in the three months to December, remaining at its lowest level since 2005. The number of people in work jumped by 37,000 in the three months to December, meaning there are now 31.84 million people in work - 302,000 more than for a year earlier. That’s a new record high. The number of people out of work fell by 7,000 in the three months to December, taking the total down to 1.6 million. But.... wages growth was weaker than expected. Average earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.6% in the last quarter, down from 2.7% a month ago. And including bonuses, earnings also rose by 2.6% - down from 2.8%. Details and reaction to follow.... The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has issued a chilling warning today that a third of people in Britain are living on inadequate incomes that don’t provide an adequate standard of living. It’s a timely reminder that the unemployment rate, although important, doesn’t give a full view of the state of the UK economy. An extra four million people have fallen into this bracket since 2008, according to JRF, because the cost of living has outpaced earnings since the financial crisis stuck. JRF says: The number of individuals below the Minimum Income Standard (MIS) rose by four million, from 15 million to 19 million (from 25 to 30 per cent of the population). There are 11 million people living far short of MIS, up from 9.1 million, who have incomes below 75% of the standard and are at high risk of being in poverty. The remaining eight million fall short of the minimum, by a smaller amount, and despite having a more modest risk of poverty, are just about managing at best. More than half of the households affected actually have at least one person in work -- but not being paid enough to provide a decent standard of living: JRF fears that many more people will be dragged into this situation, if wages don’t rise to keep pace with inflation: And here’s Business Insider’s take: Over in Greece, commissioner Pierre Moscovici has claimed Athens and her creditors are making progress towards finally concluding its latest bailout review. Moscovici struck an upbeat tone this morning, before a meeting with finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos. He told reporters that: “There is convergence at certain points so that we can conclude the review and move ahead. Some more small steps remain.” Those ‘small steps’ involve the measures which Greece must take before its creditors are satisfied that it is meeting the terms of its bailout, and hand over €7bn in fresh loans. Moscovici has also tweeted that he’s picked up an award from Greece’s president this morning: European stocks are rallying (again) in early trading. Investors are cheered by yesterday’s testimony by US central bank chief Janet Yellen, and her largely upbeat view of the American economy. Britain’s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies has hit a fresh record high, up 0.2% to 18,825, and there are solid gains in Frankfurt and Paris: Yellen’s hint that interest rates will rise soon is pushing bank shares higher, and her lack of anxiety over the US jobs market is also boosting confidence. Traders also seem to be clinging to hopes that Donald Trump will provide an economic boost by cutting taxes and boosting infrastructure spending, rather than fretting about the unfolding scandal about links to Russia and the sudden departure of national security adviser Michael Flynn.... Today’s average earnings figures are particularly important, argues Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: With inflation on the rise the most talked about figure this Wednesday will likely be the wage growth reading, which is set to remain unchanged at 2.8% [including bonuses] That’s all well and good for now, but given that UK inflation could hit 3% at some point in the second half of 2017 growth needs to pick up to avoid severely pinched pockets across the country. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain’s jobs market is in the spotlight today, with the publication of new unemployment figures at 9.30am GMT. The figures will be scrutinised for signs that the labour force is starting to suffer from last year’s Brexit vote. They’ll also show whether people’s pay is keeping up with inflation, which rose to 1.8% from 1.6% last month. Economists expect a fairly solid set of figures, with the headline unemployment rate likely to remain unchanged at 4.8%, an 11-year low. But the claimant count is tipped to rise by around 800 people in January, after dropping by 23,000 the previous month. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, are expected to remain unchanged at 2.7% -- or 2.8% if you include bonuses. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why this matters: With inflationary pressures starting to catch alight it is especially important that wages data keeps up, having been running ahead of inflation since mid-2014. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale suspects that the unemployment total may inch higher too.... A 5k increase in unemployment, and steady ex-bonus wage growth at 2.7% unlikely to move sterling, but soggy enough to keep a mildly bearish bias. Also on today’s agenda... Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be heading back to Congress for a second day of testimony to US lawmakers, from 3pm GMT. Yesterday she indicated that rate rises are coming, as it would be ‘unwise’ to wait too long. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is in Athens today, hoping to narrow the gap between Greece and her creditors over the long-stalled bailout review. On the economic front, we get new US inflation figures at 1.30pm GMT. Economists predict that the CPI rose by 2.4% year-on-year in January, up from 2.1% in December - part of a wider trend of rising inflation. Plus, beer group Heineken, dairy chain Danone and French bank Credit Agricole are all reporting results today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/15/clive-palmer-cant-recall-huge-payments-from-coffers-of-queensland-nickel","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T07:51:10Z","webTitle":"Clive Palmer 'can't recall' huge payments from coffers of Queensland Nickel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/15/clive-palmer-cant-recall-huge-payments-from-coffers-of-queensland-nickel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/15/clive-palmer-cant-recall-huge-payments-from-coffers-of-queensland-nickel","fields":{"headline":"Clive Palmer 'can't recall' huge payments from coffers of Queensland Nickel","bodyText":"Clive Palmer has told a court an $8m payment to his father-in-law from his Queensland Nickel business in the years before its collapse may have been out of “love and affection”. The former federal parliamentarian struggled to recall the purpose of that and tens of millions of dollars of other payments he ordered from the coffers of QN as he took to the witness box during a liquidator’s hearing in Brisbane on Wednesday. This included $15m transferred to his personal bank account in Hong Kong, as well as another $15m to fund the operation of a former Club Med resort in French Polynesia he bought to turn into a “private retreat”. The liquidator, FTI Consulting, is attempting to claw back money from QN’s collapse which left debts of $300m, including $70m to the federal government, and 800 workers jobless. The liquidator has alleged Palmer used QN as a personal “piggy bank” but Palmer denies any impropriety. He has argued payments related to his other business interests were justified by the interrelationships within his corporate empire and a joint-venture structure that meant QN’s money was not its own. Palmer, during an occasionally combative cross-examination with barrister Walter Sofronoff for the liquidator, repeatedly said he could not recall why he directed the transfer of payments from QN accounts, without reference to a journal he kept or company records. An $8m payment to his father-in-law Alexander Sokolov may have been a loan or simply out of his “love and affection for him” but he could not be sure, Palmer said. Palmer said Sokolov was an engineer from Bulgaria whose work over a number of months at QN’s Townsville refinery resulted in changes that saved the business $40m a year. “$8m would have been worth his contribution, for sure,” Palmer told the hearing at the federal court. Palmer said he could not recall why $15m earmarked for “operational funding” was required for his resort in Bora Bora. The former Club Med resort had not traded since he bought it to turn it into a personal “holiday destination [to] pop over for a weekend”, he said. Palmer said $15m transferred from QN to his personal account with the Standard China Bank in Hong Kong “paled into insignificance” beside the turnover of the nickel business, which he fully owned. “I’m sure it was for a legitimate purpose,” he said. Palmer said QN was not directly involved in an offshore resources project in Papua New Guinea held by another of his companies Palmer Petroleum, for which QN paid almost $8m to a company to conduct seismic exploration. But the companies directing QN in the nickel joint venture would have decided the payment was in their interest, although he would need to refer to company records to “fully understand” what that was, he said. Palmer at one point agreed with Sofronoff’s summary of his general proposition that it was in the commercial interest of Queensland Nickel and its parent companies, QNI resources and QNI Metals, for him to remain personally “solvent”. After taking Palmer though a long series of large cash outgoings from QN that the former federal MP could not remember, Sofronoff asked: “How do you explain your failure of memory?” Palmer replied he was in federal parliament “serving the Australian people” and “concentrating on how to make a better Queensland” after “we’d just got rid of Campbell Newman” as state premier. Palmer said audited accounts and tax filings by QN’s parent companies, QNI Resources and QNI Metals would show cash flowed back into the nickel business. This included $2.5m in QN staff wages he personally paid before Christmas 2015. Sofronoff repeatedly accused Palmer of being evasive with his answers, at one point successfully seeking a direction from the federal court registrar, Murray Belcher, that the businessman respond directly to a question. Sofronoff later chastised Palmer: “Just answer the question, please, you’re not here to make speeches.” “I’ll answer how I want to,” Palmer replied. “No, you’ll answer responsibly,” Sofronoff said. Palmer then said he’d forgotten the question because of the barrister’s “loud voice”. Sofronoff at another point accused Palmer of being evasive, asking him: “Do you want this to go on for a week?” Other payments that Palmer could not immediately explain included $12.8m to his company Waratah Coal in September 2012, and $550,000 to his other company Mineralogy. Neither could Palmer recall how QN came at one point to owe him personally $20m. He and his nephew Clive Mensink, the director of Queensland Nickel, decided to invest millions from QN coffers into a collection of vintage cars because “we thought it was a good investment”, Palmer said. The cars, “mostly from Denmark”, went on display at Palmer Coolum Resort on the Sunshine Coast, owned by his company Palmer Leisure, as soon as they cleared Australian customs, he said. Palmer could not recall the precise nature of the work done by representatives of his ventures in China and Kurdistan, who were paid $4.5m and $1m by QN respectively. The $4.5m payment was a “drop in the bucket” besides the “$15bn or $16bn” iron ore investment his company Mineralogy was involved in through a joint venture with Chinese partners in Western Australia, Palmer said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/15/kim-jong-nam-assassinated-south-korea-us-officials","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T07:31:41Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-nam was assassinated, say US and South Korean officials","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/15/kim-jong-nam-assassinated-south-korea-us-officials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/15/kim-jong-nam-assassinated-south-korea-us-officials","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-nam was assassinated, say US and South Korean officials","bodyText":"Kim Jong-nam was almost certainly murdered by North Korean agents, according to intelligence officials in South Korea, as suspicions mounted that his assassination at Kuala Lumpur airport was ordered by his estranged half-brother, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. South Korea’s spy agency said on Wednesday that two women believed to be North Korean operatives poisoned the 45-year-old exile in a shopping concourse at Kuala Lumpur international airport. Kim, who had not yet passed through security, was preparing to take a late-morning flight on Monday from the Malaysian capital to his home in Macau, according to South Korean MPs briefed by security services. Selangor state’s police chief, Abdul Samah Mat, told the Guardian that Kim Jong-nam arrived in Malaysia on 6 February, a week before he was attacked. “He was travelling on a North Korean passport,” he said. “The postmortem is in progress. It’s up to the pathologists on how long it will take. Sometimes it involves lab tests.” US government sources also said they believed that Kim Jong-nam was murdered by North Korean assassins. Japan’s Kyodo news agency quoted an unnamed Japanese government official as saying that the two suspected assailants may already be dead, but offered no further details. The theory that Kim had been targeted by spies from the country he left more than 15 years ago gathered pace after Malaysian officials released CCTV image purporting to show one of the alleged attackers as she waited for a taxi outside the airport shortly after the incident. The local Malay Mail newspaper published a grainy photo of a woman it said was suspected by police of killing Kim Jong-nam. The image showed a young female, carrying a bag and wearing a white jumper that said “LOL” in large black print across the front. The Guardian has been unable to confirm if the woman is a police suspect. Kim, whose father was the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, claimed to have no political ambitions, but just weeks after his half-brother’s elevation to the leadership in late 2011 he told the Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi that the world would view his leadership as a “joke”. In the same email exchange with Gomi, Kim spoke disparagingly of his younger brother, saying he lacked “any sense of duty or seriousness” and warned that bribery and corruption would lead to North Korea’s eventual collapse. Two years earlier, he told Japan’s TV Asahi that he “personally opposed” the hereditary transfer of power in his family. People with contacts in the north believe Kim Jong-un had long targeted his brother, who reportedly divided his time between Macau, China and Singapore, and enjoyed some level of Chinese protection. South Korean intelligence officials claimed the regime had been planning his assassination for five years, but did not explain why they thought that was the case. Kim Jong-nam was once considered the heir apparent to the North Korean leadership but left the country to lead a life in exile after attempting to enter Japan on a forged Dominican Republic passport in 2001 – an incident that caused embarrassment to his father. Kim had told Japanese immigration officials that he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Jiro Ishimaru, of the Osaka-based Asia Press, said Kim’s murder could only have been ordered by his half-brother, whom he had never met. “Any criticism of the Kim dynasty is viewed as unforgivable, no matter where it comes from,” Ishimaru told the Guardian. “It’s the worst thing you can say about the regime, and certainly not the kind of comment that the leadership would be able to shrug off, no matter how long ago it was said. “The only person inside North Korea with the power to decide whether Kim Jong-nam lived or died is Kim Jong-un.” Mark Tokola, vice-president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Seoul, agreed, saying: “It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un.” Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong-nam was plotting against the leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who want to depose his brother. Kim Jong-nam had told airport workers that someone had attacked him “from behind” and sprayed him in the face with an unknown liquid. He died in an ambulance on the way to hospital. “He told the receptionist at the departure hall that someone had grabbed his face from behind and splashed some liquid on him,” said Selangor state’s criminal investigation chief, Fadzil Ahmat, according to Malaysia’s The Star newspaper. “He asked for help and was immediately sent to the airport’s clinic. At this point, he was experiencing headache and was on the verge of passing out. At the clinic, the victim experienced a mild seizure. He was put into an ambulance and was being taken to the Putrajaya hospital when he was pronounced dead.” Malaysian police confirmed the death of a 45-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang. “Investigation is in progress and a postmortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,” the statement said. South Korea’s government called an emergency security council meeting and condemned Kim’s death. “If the murder of Kim Jong-nam was confirmed to be committed by the North Korean regime, that would clearly depict the brutality and inhumanity of the Kim Jong-un regime,” the country’s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said. In exile, Kim Jong-nam had largely managed to stay out of the spotlight. He had lived both in mainland China and Macau, and was also spotted in Malaysia. He reportedly fled to Singapore from Macau in 2012, fearing for his life after his brother assumed power, and suspecting that the regime’s agents had discovered where he lived. It is not clear if he had returned in recent years, but his family – his second wife and their three children – were living in the former Portuguese colony. A South Korean MP claimed Kim also had a wife and son in Beijing. He was known to travel around Macau without bodyguards, and was occasionally spotted at nightclubs in the Hotel Lisboa, according to a 2007 investigation by the South China Morning Post. Since becoming leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has sought to tighten his grip on power by ordering the purges and, in some cases, executions of high-level officials he believes represent a threat to the regime. The most high-profile victim was his uncle and close adviser, Jang Song-thaek, who was executed on several charges, including treason, in 2013. North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot Kim Jong-nam in Macau in 2011, although details of the incident are shrouded in mystery. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organise a hit-and-run targeting Kim in China in 2010. Kim reportedly pleaded for his life after another attempt to kill him in 2012, according to South Korean lawmakers who had been briefed by the head of the country’s national intelligence service, Lee Byung-ho. “According to [Lee] … there was one [assassination] bid in 2012, and Jong-nam in April 2012 sent a letter to Kim Jong-un saying: ‘Please spare me and my family,’” Kim Byung-kee, a member of the parliamentary intelligence committee, told reporters.

In an interview before two critical global meetings this week in Bonn and Munich, Guterres warned of the advent of a particularly dangerous moment in history, drawing a parallel with the run-up to the first world war. Only a renewed commitment to multilateral cooperation could head off the gathering danger, he said. “It’s no longer a bipolar world, a unipolar world, but it’s not yet a multipolar world. It’s largely a chaotic world in many aspects,” Guterres said in a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian and three other European papers. “Impunity and unpredictability tend to prevail and not only are conflicts becoming more and more interconnected but they are also interconnected with this threat ... of global terrorism.” Guterres was referring to a precarious world order in which American pre-eminence has given way to challenges from both China and Russia, and in which multilateral institutions are arguably weaker than at any point since 1945. Guterres, who served as UN high commissioner for refugees for a decade, has inherited the secretary general’s mantle at a particularly fraught time for global security. The Syrian and Yemeni conflicts are still raging, four famines are looming in parts of the developing world, and the rise of a white nationalist backlash to immigration and globalisation has upended political cultures in Europe and the US. Guterres warned against surrendering democratic values to win votes and an embracing of “alternative truths” – an echo of “alternative facts”, which has become a buzzphrase of the Trump White House. The new US administration loudly opposes many of Guterres’s core principles, like multilateral governance and a generous approach to the world’s refugees. With other powers rising, he said, a more multipolar world was inevitable but not necessarily less antagonistic than the unipolar world we are leaving behind. “It might also increase the dangers of confrontation,” he said, in his first interview with a British newspaper since taking office on January 1. “The point is, in my opinion, the multipolar world without strong multilateral institutions is not necessarily a peaceful one.” “Europe before the first world war was a multipolar Europe but there was no multilateral governance mechanism and the result was the first world war.” Europe’s ability to keep faith in its unity and cohesion could be a key stabilising factor at a perilous time, he suggested. “I think to move into a functional multipolar world, the role of Europe is absolutely essential,” Guterres said, declaring himself “a strong believer in a united Europe” on the world stage, playing a positive role politically and in terms of development and humanitarian aid. He made his remarks to reporters from the Guardian, France’s Le Monde, Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung and La Stampa of Italy, part of a collaborative media group known as Europa. He did not directly criticise the UK’s Brexit vote, calling it a “sovereign decision by the British people”, but he argued it was important for Europe to “learn the lessons of Brexit”, which he said were “a more effective integration, reconciled with the European public opinion”. Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister, said that more effective integration would only be possible with political leaderships that risked telling the truth about the challenges of globalisation, rather than simply blaming immigration. “I think that political leaders need to be able to tell the truth and assert their values, even if that means losing the next elections,” he said. “What we sometimes see are political leaders who forget about their values, use alternative truths as propaganda tools, just to win the next elections.” Mainstream parties that pandered to prejudice to win votes, Guterres argued, tend to lose in the end to populists, because “when people have to choose between the original and the copy, they tend to choose the original”. Given his past role as a passionate defender of refugee rights, Guterres is generally expected to play a more activist role that his predecessor Ban Ki-moon when it comes to reforming UN institutions, and act as a moral conscience to great powers in the security council. He said he did not see himself as a protagonist in global problem-solving but rather “a bridge-builder, a convener, an honest broker, to help find solutions”. But he also made clear he saw an advocacy role for himself. “The secretary general must be in the frontline of the defence of all the principles that are essential in the UN charter, and namely all aspects of human rights,” he said. Guterres said he had had “extremely constructive” meetings so far with the new US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley. But after the interview she blocked Guterres’s pick of Salam Fayyad as the UN’s Libya peace envoy on the grounds that Fayyad was a Palestinian. Speaking later in Dubai, Guterres expressed his disappointment with the US veto, saying ruling out Fayyad was “a loss for the Libyan peace process and for the Libyan people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/15/senators-to-call-for-inquiry-into-alleged-breaches-of-roe-highway-environmental-conditions","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T06:31:42Z","webTitle":"Senators expected to vote for inquiry into alleged breaches of Roe highway conditions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/15/senators-to-call-for-inquiry-into-alleged-breaches-of-roe-highway-environmental-conditions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/15/senators-to-call-for-inquiry-into-alleged-breaches-of-roe-highway-environmental-conditions","fields":{"headline":"Senators expected to vote for inquiry into alleged breaches of Roe highway conditions","bodyText":"The Senate is expected to pass a motion on Thursday calling for a snap inquiry into serious breaches of environmental conditions placed on the Roe Highway extension project in Perth. The extension, known as Roe 8, is part of the $1.9bn Perth freight link project. The project has attracted fierce opposition from environmentalists and community groups because vegetation through the Beeliar wetlands has been bulldozed. On Wednesday the deputy Greens leader, Scott Ludlum, called on the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, to step in and order a stop to works, as well for an investigation into non-compliance with federal approval conditions. Ludlam plans to force a Senate vote on the matter on Thursday. According to an 18-page document sent by Ludlam to Frydenberg on Tuesday, the project’s construction and fauna management plans were not being complied with. The requirement to survey potential nesting hollows of Western Australia’s endangered black cockatoos was allegedly not completed before land clearing, the letter alleges. The fauna plan also requires that trapping of the endangered southern brown bandicoot occur for between three and four days, and that trapping must continue until there have been at least two consecutive nights of no bandicoots being caught. This would ensure as many of the bandicoots as possible are caught and relocated. But community members monitoring the wetlands around the clock say they saw bandicoots being caught and removed from the Coolbellup bushland site just two hours before clearing began. Several similar instances were recorded between 13 January and 5 February, including in one of the most ecologically sensitive areas of the wetlands. “Live bandicoots were seen fleeing from bulldozers and have been photographed being removed from sites on the same day that clearing has occurred, in blatant contravention of the fauna management plan requirements,” Ludlam’s letter to Frydenberg said. Traps were also being set poorly, while other areas known to harbour the bandicoots had no traps placed in them at all before clearing, the letter claims. Despite a requirement that fencing be installed to protect animals from injuries and death during the bulldozing, the letter alleges that no netting was used at any time at the Coolbellup site and that partial and ineffective netting was used at other sites. Trapping of the threatened oblong turtle was described by Ludlam as “reckless”, with traps set for just 48 hours before land clearing began. This was despite advice from turtle experts that traps should remain for at least two weeks and that trapping should take place in autumn and winter to be most effective. The letter also claims asbestos contamination found throughout the project site had been removed in a way that created an unacceptable health risk due to dust and there was inadequate use of water trucks to prevent dust from spreading. Clearing of native vegetation also appeared to be occurring outside of designated clearing areas, the letter alleges. “I am advised, based on evidence of over 40 volunteers working around the clock at the construction site, that there has been no compliance staff from the Office of the Environmental Protection Authority on site over weekends or after hours, which is often when these breaches are occurring,” Ludlam wrote. “An urgent intervention to investigate and enforce compliance is required right now. I also kindly request an immediate copy of any records you are keeping on species mortality on site.” Guardian Australia has contacted the office of Fydenberg, as well as the office of the WA environment minister, Albert Jacob, for comment. The motion put forward by Ludlam on Wednesday, to be voted on by the Senate on Thursday, calls for a Senate inquiry to be held in Perth next Friday to investigate the breaches. Guardian Australia understands Labor and Xenophon will support the motion, pushing it through. On Tuesday the Senate ordered Frydenberg to provide a summary of breaches of approval conditions on site that had been reported to him, and his response to those breaches, by 12.45pm Wednesday. But Frydenberg’s response tabled to the Senate on Wednesday said that “neither the minister nor the department has received correspondence or reports with evidence of compliance breaches with approval conditions since construction commenced”. But a concerned local who is helping to monitor the land-clearing sites, Phoebe Corke, says she has been sending details of alleged breaches to Frydenberg’s office since 24 January and that 13 emails had been sent in total. “I find it incredibly disconcerting that our government doesn’t need to follow its own guidelines and that, given the many breaches of compliance, the contractors are clearly not doing their job,” she told Guardian Australia. She said volunteers had seen bandicoots caught in one section of the project on Tuesday morning, yet land was cleared that same day. She said there were also concerns that the requirement of at least eight bandicoot traps being set per hectare was not being adhered to. She said contractors spent just one hour laying traps in an area of the site spanning almost eight hectares. “It’s so traumatic watching 300-year-old trees being knocked to the ground and the cockatoos start screaming as their homes go,” Corke said. “There are people in floods of tears on the side of the road, who don’t have it in them to protest anymore because it is just too traumatic to witness.” • Do you know more?

There is a big social agenda planned around with the help of the mayor’s office, all about getting more women cycling,” said Guy Elliott of the race organiser Sweetspot. As well as the 14 laps of a six-kilometre circuit in Piccadilly, the five-day event will also include two hilly stages in the Peak District and two less demanding stages which will go close to 150km, the International Cycling Union’s new permitted maximum distance for stages in women’s events. “It’s going to be a tough race, but we’ve seen that women racers like courses which test them,” said Elliott. The race’s first two editions were relatively flat, but the 2016 event ventured into the Peak District for a stage through the hills which saw the then world champion Lizzie Deignan cement her overall victory. Deignan’s Boels Dolmans team will return along with the best 15 teams in the world and two UK squads, Drops and WNT. There is no place for a GB national team, unlike in previous years. With only four stages before the London finish, the race does not venture far from the heart of England, with the first, rolling stage through Northamptonshire from Daventry to a technical uphill finish in Kettering, and stage two finishing in Stoke after a run through the Staffordshire Moorlands which is likely to include climbs such as the notorious Gun Hill. That stage will be dedicated to the memory of a legendary Stoke cycling family, the Swinnertons – “they included three great women’s racers, Bernadette, Margaret and Catherine, who never got the chance to ride an event like ours on home turf,” said Elliott. Stage three takes the riders through Warwickshire to Royal Leamington Spa – “up and down all day through the edge of the North Cotswolds,” said Elliott, but the fourth day’s racing starting and finishing Chesterfield is likely to prove decisive, including climbs in the Peak District to set up the overall before the finale in London. If there is one issue which is now bugging the organisers, however, it is the fact that they cannot extend the event beyond the current five days in spite of the fact that there appears to be more than enough interest from potential host towns to enable them to do so. “We did ask British Cycling if we could have seven days, and it’s not clear why we were turned down,” said Elliott, who is keen to extend the event’s geographical reach. “It’s disappointing because we want to move on and develop the race, we are very ambitious for it and we want to keep it growing”. Sweetspot is not the only ambitious UK race organiser to have been stymied in recent months by the beleaguered governing body, as the Tour de Yorkshire’s application to move from three to four days was also turned down. Contacted by the Guardian, British Cycling said it was keen to avoid the UK’s roster of international events growing faster than might prove healthy in the long run, and that in the women’s Tour’s case, there were races in the calendar in the US prior to the British event which might have proved logistically challenging for some teams. ‘Hypocritical’ to stay away from Para-cycling World Championships, says Jody Cundy Jody Cundy has said a stay-away protest would be hypocritical after lambasting as a “joke” the awarding of the UCI Para-cycling World Championships with seven weeks’ notice. The UCI, cycling’s world governing body, announced Los Angeles would host the March 2 to 5 event on January 10, giving athletes little time to prepare. But after previously venting his fury at the decision, Cundy said: “I felt it would be hypocritical to sit at home and not do anything. I don’t think I can just sit at home and watch somebody else win a world title that I’ve won before and didn’t actually go out there to defend myself.” PA"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/17/mexico-call-centers-trump-deportations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"Mexico call centers await ‘huge pool of talent’ if Trump keeps deportation pledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/mexico-call-centers-trump-deportations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/17/mexico-call-centers-trump-deportations","fields":{"headline":"Mexico call centers await ‘huge pool of talent’ if Trump keeps deportation pledge","bodyText":"If Donald Trump deports millions of people, Mexico’s call centers will have one word for him – and it won’t be gracias; it’ll be thanks. The booming industry needs English speakers to service US customers, and the US president seems set to oblige with a deportation force that could banish record numbers of Americanized Mexicans south of the border. “That’s a huge pool of talent for us,” said Joe Andere, executive vice-president of Americas Survey Company (ASC), which with its sister company Voxcentrix has 450 call center stations in Tijuana. “We’re looking for people at the moment. All the companies are.” Employing native English speakers who understand American culture gives Mexican call centers an edge over rivals in India and the Philippines in a competitive, billion-dollar global industry. Call centers here already employ thousands of people deported under the Obama administration. They do market research, sales and technical support for companies such as McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Toyota. Their English can be so fluent and idiomatic that customers assume they are in the US. Luis Vargas Salazar, 53, a former marine deported in 2014 after 51 years in the US, is due to start a call center job this week. “I aced the tests,” he said. “I scored so high on all the English exams they signed me up straight away.” Call centers post flyers on the noticeboards of migrant shelters where deportees usually spend their first nights after expulsion. The flyers promise dollar commissions, bonuses and benefits, such as free coffee and cookies. Wages, however, are low – about $100 a week. From just a handful a decade ago, there are now more than 50 call centers employing more than 10,000 people just in Tijuana, a sprawling city abutting a border wall beyond which lies San Diego. “We’re fighting for the same pool of people so we have to refine our retention strategies. Wages are going up,” Andere said. “The industry is growing every single day.” About 80% of his agents are bilingual – and of those, most were deported. If Trump keeps a promise to swiftly deport 3 million undocumented people, possibly followed by millions more, it will benefit call centers, the executive said. “Absolutely.” The upbeat view contrasted with the anxiety gripping immigrant communities around the US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids swept up 680 people last week, sparking grassroots resistance and vows to block future deportations. Mass expulsions could undermine a separate Trump election promise to curb the outsourcing of call center jobs. Seven Democratic senators have lobbied the president to ban federal contractors from offshoring such posts. Mexico, however, is far cheaper than the US. If the country gets more native English speakers, US corporations will be even more tempted to outsource such work. Call centers can be a lifeline for deportees who arrive broke, disorientated and disconnected from families in the US. Some of those who left Mexico as infants barely remember the country or speak Spanish. “Everything was new. It was a new world,” said Oscar Ortega, 47, who left four children behind in Duarte, California. He struggled to adapt to life in Tijuana. “I was used to how the [US] runs things. I didn’t know anything about Mexico.” Ortega has been a survey supervisor with ASC since 2009. “It’s been my family.” Spending eight hours a day in a cubicle with a headset, talking to strangers across the US, nurtured a connection with his old life. “It makes me feel closer to things over there. I still feel American.” Jaime Castaneda, 37, was in diapers when his family crossed illegally from Mexico, so being dumped back in 2008 – he was convicted of drug possession – came as a shock. “I was in denial for a while.” He said he enjoys doing customer satisfaction surveys but plans to appeal the deportation next year, when he will have completed a decade out of the US. Trying to bypass border security was a dumb move likely to end in capture and jail, Castaneda said. “They have drones, infrared. If you’re smart, you get with the program here, do the nine-to-five.” Some call center agents, however, do attempt to sneak back into the US, said Ramses St Martin, 32, a supervisor. “Some guys will go missing for a couple of days, trying to cross, then they get caught and deported and show up here again.” Many deportees committed minor offenses, such as driving under the influence, but some match Trump’s depiction of “bad hombres” – they are men convicted of serious crimes. Call centers in El Salvador employ so many former gang members they are nicknamed “homieland”, according to the New Yorker. Salazar, the former marine, spent 14 years in jail for sexual assault. He said he was a born-again Christian who had repented and hoped to return, pardoned and forgiven. Meanwhile, he planned to use his gift of the gab to engage strangers on the phone. “I’m looking forward to it. I like to talk and I like to help people.” Andere, the executive, said companies vetted employees and banned pen, paper and cellphones from work stations to prevent theft of credit card details and other sensitive information. Deportees were overwhelmingly honest, dedicated workers, he said. “We were the first to employ people with tattoos. We saw past it. It doesn’t matter how you look. It matters how you sound over the phone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/15/air-traffic-control-job-cuts-a-huge-risk-to-public-safety-leaks-suggest","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T04:03:23Z","webTitle":"Air traffic control job cuts a 'huge risk to public safety', leaks suggest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/15/air-traffic-control-job-cuts-a-huge-risk-to-public-safety-leaks-suggest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/15/air-traffic-control-job-cuts-a-huge-risk-to-public-safety-leaks-suggest","fields":{"headline":"Air traffic control job cuts a 'huge risk to public safety', leaks suggest","bodyText":"The government body for air traffic control is creating a “huge risk to public safety” by pursuing a program of severe job cuts, according to leaked documents from its own employees. Airservices Australia, which oversees airspace management, communications and aviation firefighting, has shed more than 700 staff since May in a streamlining process known as Accelerate. One executive inside the organisation told the ABC it was “only a matter of time before we have a major aviation incident”. Leaked emails between senior managers reportedly called the Accelerate program “sheer lunacy” with a “cavalier attitude [that is] absolutely appalling”. “The Accelerate program is doing everything backwards and rushing to make changes without careful forethought,” an angry email sparked by wild weather and delays at Melbourne airport over Christmas reportedly said. “As a result it is putting ... the travelling public at significant risk.” Airservices has described Accelerate as a “short-term program” to make the organisation “leaner” and “more agile”. It said the cuts targeted backroom staff in administration and technical support, and frontline jobs in control and firefighting were “quarantined” from the changes. But Ben Morgan, the executive director of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (Aopa), said the Accelerate program was “gutting the organisation of capability and putting the public at risk”. “We’re seeing the early warning signs,” he said. “We’re not talking about a government department that handles paper. The people who are physically doing their job consider there to be a genuine, serious threat to the safety of the flying public.” Rupert Evans, the deputy national president of the Community and Public Sector Union, said Accelerate seemed to be “cutting costs no matter what”. “[Airservices] continues to insist that no frontline capacity has been lost through this process but our members have told us that technical and other specialist roles can’t be cut without compromising the organisation’s core functions,” he said. “A huge number of staff with specialist knowledge have been cut ... and those staff who remain are working valiantly but struggling to cope with the void that’s created.” Senator Nick Xenophon and Aopa have called for the program to be stopped and for an independent investigation into Airservices’ safety procedures. “I don’t believe at this stage that passengers boarding aircraft have a reason to be fearful or concerned but now is the time to thoroughly investigate before it goes too far”, Morgan said. The Airservices chief executive, Jason Harfield, denied there was any threat to safety. “Any suggestion that Airservices is compromising on safety is totally incorrect and refused,” he said in a statement. “There is no risk to the travelling public ... There has been extensive union and employee consultation.” Airservices plans to complete the Accelerate program by June 2017, with earmarked savings of $150m. In 2016 the body recorded a $10m loss, its first deficit in nearly 20 years. Harfield told the Australian the cuts would return a profit of $50m by 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/14/journalists-killed-dominican-republic-facebook-live-broadcast","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-14T21:40:23Z","webTitle":"Journalists shot dead during Facebook Live video in Dominican Republic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/journalists-killed-dominican-republic-facebook-live-broadcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/14/journalists-killed-dominican-republic-facebook-live-broadcast","fields":{"headline":"Journalists shot dead during Facebook Live video in Dominican Republic","bodyText":"Two radio journalists have been killed in the Dominican Republic after gunmen opened fire during a news bulletin which was being broadcast on Facebook Live. Luís Manuel Medina, the presenter of the news programme Milenio Caliente – or Hot Millennium – was killed while on air on Tuesday morning. Producer and director Leo Martínez was shot dead in an adjacent office at the radio station FM 103.5. Gunfire could be heard during the Facebook Live video, along with a woman yelling “Shots! Shots! Shots!” before the transmission abruptly cuts off. The station secretary Dayaba Garcia was also injured in the attack and taken to hospital where she needed emergency surgery. Police said the shooting occurred in San Pedro de Macorís, a small city 45 miles east of the capital, Santo Domingo. The radio station is located within a shopping mall. Three men have been arrested, but none has been charged. Police say they do not yet have a motive. Medina was also the official announcer of the Estrellas Orientales baseball team. Milenio Caliente is a popular local radio programme recognised for its lively political analysis and social campaigns. In recent weeks, Medina had repeatedly condemned pollution in Laguna Mallen, a protected lake in San Pedro. Olivo de Leon, from the College of Journalism who knew both men, said the attack was unprecedented in the country’s history. “For gunmen to open fire in a media outlet like this is unprecedented. “The authorities must investigate to determine not just the killers but also the intellectual authors so that we know why they were murdered. Impunity in this case will generate fear among journalists, making them scared to speak out and do their jobs. The government must guarantee freedom of expression,” De Leon told the Guardian in a telephone interview from Santo Domingo. While murders are rare, harassment and intimidation of journalists reporting on organised crime and corruption is fairly common in the Dominican Republic. In recent years, reporters who spoke out against a controversial 2013 court ruling which stripped Dominicans of Haitian descent of their citizenship have received death threats and suffered vicious online harassment campaigns. The last journalist to be killed in the country was Blas Olivo who was shot dead in April 2015. Police said Olvio, press director of the Dominican Agribusiness Association, was the victim of a bungled robbery, even though neither his car nor phone were stolen. The case remains ongoing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/feb/15/india-launches-record-breaking-104-satellites-from-single-rocket","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T11:45:17Z","webTitle":"India launches record-breaking 104 satellites from single rocket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/15/india-launches-record-breaking-104-satellites-from-single-rocket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/feb/15/india-launches-record-breaking-104-satellites-from-single-rocket","fields":{"headline":"India launches record-breaking 104 satellites from single rocket","bodyText":"India’s space agency has announced the successful launch of a record-breaking 104 nano satellites into orbit, all onboard a single rocket. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said the milestone launch, from the Sriharikota space centre in the country’s south, overtook the 2014 Russian record of 37 satellites in a single launch. On board was a 714kg satellite for earth observation and more than 100 smaller satellites weighing less than 10kg each. Three were Indian-owned, 96 were from US companies, and the rest belonged to companies based in Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. Most were owned by Planet Labs Inc, a US-based Earth-imaging company. The feat did not require vastly new technology, but rather reflects the shrinking size and weight of modern satellites. After reaching a height of about 505km, the satellites will separate from the launch vehicle at different times, angles and velocities to avoid collisions. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, hailed the launch on Twitter as an “exceptional achievement”. The chair of the space agency, Kiran Kumar, said his team had not set out to break records. “We are just trying to maximise our capability with each launch and trying to utilise that launch for the ability it has got, and get the maximum in return,” he said. The launch helps to cement India’s place as a serious player in the burgeoning private space market, expected to significantly grow as the demand for telecommunications services increases. In September 2014 the country became just the fourth after the US, the former Soviet Union and the European Space Agency to successfully guide a spacecraft into orbit around Mars. The Mars mission cost India’s famously thrifty space agency about $73m, nearly a 10th the cost of a Nasa probe sent to orbit the planet the previous year. The low price tag led Modi to quip that India had sent a satellite into space for less than Americans had spent making the movie Gravity. Lower labour costs and an emphasis on locally sourced equipment contribute to the cheaper cost of India’s space programme, though generally the scientific capabilities of its craft are narrower than those launched by Nasa. Isro is racing SpaceX, Elon Musk’s company, to develop a reusable rocket. Avatar, Isro’s reusable rocket project, is scheduled to take at least another nine years before achieving its aim. The agency, which had its operating budget increased by 23% this year, despite cuts to space programmes globally, is also developing plans to send a spacecraft on the three-month journey to Venus and another to Jupiter, which would take more than two years. India, which in 1980 became just the sixth nation to launch its own rocket, has long made space research a priority. India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, personally supervised the country’s efforts in the area, seeing an affinity between a scientific outlook and the rational, secular worldview he hoped to impose on a nation riven by caste and religious divisions. The phrase “world record” was trending on Twitter India for much of Wednesday morning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/12/brexit-labour-identity-crisis-solution-return-to-roots","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T00:04:29Z","webTitle":"Labour in crisis: Can the party reconnect with its heartland?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/12/brexit-labour-identity-crisis-solution-return-to-roots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/12/brexit-labour-identity-crisis-solution-return-to-roots","fields":{"headline":"Labour in crisis: Can the party reconnect with its heartland?","bodyText":"“John Smith do you know what Socialism is?… Good or bad, wise or foolish, it is all I have to offer as a remedy.” From Merrie England, by Nunquam, 1893 “I want to replace the Labour party and make Ukip the patriotic voice of working people.” Paul Nuttall, leader of Ukip, November 2016 When Merrie England (quoted above) was published in 1893, it became a literary sensation almost overnight. Written in vivid, plain English by the Manchester-based socialist campaigner and journalist Robert Blatchford, the book was presented as “a series of letters on the Labour problem, addressed to John Smith, of Oldham, a hard-headed workman, fond of facts”. To this fictional resident of one of Lancashire’s grimmest mill towns, Merrie England advocated a socialist transformation of the most advanced capitalist economy in the world. Using his Latin pen-name, Nunquam, Blatchford deployed satire and polemic to call for communal collaboration to replace competition and chasing profit as the driving force in human lives. “Take the case of a tram guard working, say, 16 hours a day for £1 a week,” begins one of Nunquam’s rhetorical salvos. “That man is being robbed of all the pleasure of his life. Now there ought to be two guards working eight hours at £2 a week. If the tram company makes big dividends the cost should come out of those dividends.” This pocket-sized vision of new Jerusalem, to be built in the hard-bitten towns of the industrial north, was an instant popular classic. When Merrie England’s initial print run of 30,000 sold out, a new penny edition was published and was instantly snapped up by mill workers, railwaymen, maids and hotel porters. The Manchester Guardian suggested that for every British convert won over to the socialist cause by Karl Marx’s Das Kapital, 100 were persuaded by the arguments of Nunquam. Blatchford’s coruscating critique of free market economics and the culture of individualism became part of the warp and weft of the nascent Labour party. Those were heady times for a British working class growing in confidence and taking its first political steps. Over a century later, the modern Labour party could use a Merrie England. Labour’s identity crisis The working class, wooed so successfully, is in danger of going missing. Last June’s referendum laid bare multiple divisions in British society, but none so full of pathos as that emerging between Labour and its own traditional supporters in the heartland towns of the Midlands and the north. It has been estimated that 149 of Labour’s 232 constituencies voted Leave, in defiance of the party’s wishes and at odds with the overwhelming majority of Labour’s mainly professional membership. Alarm bells are ringing loudly, and this month’s unexpected byelection in Stoke Central already feels seminal. Last week, Ukip candidate and leader Paul Nuttall, accompanied by his predecessor Nigel Farage, visited the city, which voted 70% for Brexit. At the Victoria Hall – built in 1888 to commemorate Queen Victoria’s golden jubilee – he claimed to be “facing down a Labour party that has more in common with Stoke Newington than Stoke-on-Trent”. Farage was cheered when he said this month’s campaign would expose the fact that “Labour was not the party it was for the past 100 years”. Brexit, and the stark class divide between Remainers and Leavers, has suddenly placed Labour on the wrong side of the working-class history it did so much to forge. On immigration, the liberal policies of Labour are poles apart from the consensus in longstanding strongholds. As it tries to navigate new times, the party risks plunging into the abyss of what one media wag described as a 0% strategy: not Brexit-friendly enough for those who voted Leave; not Europhile enough for the Remainers defecting to the Lib Dems in droves. Commentators of various stripes have urged Jeremy Corbyn to change the subject and talk about something else, the NHS for example. But as endless arguments between Corbyn and his MPs over Brexit underline, the identity crisis is too serious to ignore. In Scotland, when Labour found itself on the “wrong” side of a referendum divide, it proved to be a tipping point. A subsequent mass desertion to the SNP all but wiped out Scottish Labour, leaving it with a single seat in 2015. In the north of England and the Midlands, where Labour strongholds have become bastions of Brexit, local MPs can feel the chill in the air. “It’s about survival,” says Lisa Nandy, who represents Wigan. “The disconnect between towns and the left is enormous. There is a growing feeling that no one is speaking for them. I feel we could be one or two general elections away from Scotland happening in the north of England. Most of our members are concentrated in London and the other big cities. But without support from the towns we won’t survive.” Win or lose in Stoke (and polls suggest a nail-biter), Labour faces the question of what and who it is for in the Brexit towns of Britain. Early socialists were exuberantly confident that they would transform factory town lives for the better. But that was at a time when the nation was in its imperial, industrial pomp, glorying in the status of “workshop of the world”. For huge swathes of the country, the reversal of fortunes is depressingly stark. The factories have gone, replaced by insecure, badly paid and often temporary forms of work with poor conditions. The trade unions have diminished in size and influence. Over the past 30 years, the renaissance of economic liberalism has steadily liberated capital from its ties and obligations to nation, region and locality. Across Europe, in the words of the political economist and former adviser to the German Social Democrats Wolfgang Streeck, financial capitalism has “overrun its opponents”, from unions to national governments. The 21st century version of Labour is seen by many disillusioned supporters as having done far too little to reverse that trend. Support for the freedom of movement of people within the EU – so toxic that canvassers were urged not to speak of immigration in the election of 2015 – is seen as further evidence of a disregard for the texture and realities of life in communities. How to find a way back? Merrie England sold a romantic vision of a better life as well as a new economics to its 2 million readers. To see off the ugly, modish politics of scapegoating and xenophobia, embodied in the Little England rhetoric of Farage and Ukip financier Arron Banks, the modern Labour party needs to find something similar for the here and now. A place to start might be by exploring what makes communities flourish, and what corrodes their dignity. The melancholy towns During the referendum campaign, Nandy experienced a kind of Brexit epiphany when she was asked to speak to Nissan factory workers in Sunderland, the north-east city that is Britain’s biggest exporter. The Japanese car manufacturer employs 6,700 people at its Wearside plant and local managers had warned the workforce that a vote to leave the EU could jeopardise their jobs. But the message wasn’t getting through. “Nissan’s management told us, ‘They won’t listen to us, maybe they’ll listen to you’,” says Nandy. “Me and a guy from the GMB went over. But it was us who ended up listening to them. They told us, ‘We know that this might cost us in the area – and we’re going to do it anyway.’ I drove home thinking, ‘Oh my God! What’s going on here?’” In the shocked aftermath of 23 June, views such as those expressed by the Nissan workers have frequently been characterised as “irrational”. The former Conservative chancellor George Osborne is writing a book about the populist surge that led to the collapse of the government in which he served. It is to be titled The Age of Unreason. Labour, not least because these are its own voters talking about their lives, cannot afford to be so dismissive about a call for a politics that deals in more than the economic bottom line. For Nandy, whose constituency voted 64-36% to leave the EU, similar themes have emerged closer to home. After a year defined by toxic disputes about how to regulate borders, the former mining town she represents is currently embroiled in one of its own. For generations, a stretch of land known as the Bell has served as a green lung and a buffer dividing the working-class suburb of Kitt Green, a former pit village, from nearby Orrell. Lying a few minutes’ walk from the giant Heinz factory that is still Wigan’s biggest employer, the Bell does not offer a particularly spectacular view. But it serves as a place for Sunday walks and fresh air, and offers the quirky attraction of being the winter home to some of the donkeys employed on Blackpool beach each summer. At least it does for now. The Labour-controlled Greater Manchester Combined Authority – which includes Wigan - has announced proposals to build 170 houses and 150,000m sq of warehouses on the Bell, practically wiping out this last remaining stretch of green belt. There will be jobs, albeit of a low-grade kind, created by the development, but when Nandy held a public meeting at the St Francis of Assisi Church in Kitt Green, she was overwhelmed by the response. “On a cold Thursday night, over 350 people came,” said Nandy. “There were so many people that some had to queue for 45 minutes to get in. There was anger, frustration but also a hell of a lot of passion. That green belt protects the village’s identity; it stops Kitt Green morphing into urban sprawl. And somehow it was about more than the green belt. It was about things like local pride and self-esteem.” The furore was so great that the GMCA extended its period of consultation into this year. But what really irks Nandy about the affair is the top-down high-handed way the proposals were released via an arcane and technical document called the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework. In parliament she railed at the presentation of plans that would change the identity of Kitt Green. “Most of my constituents had never heard anything about the plan before I wrote to tell them about it,” Nandy told MPs. “Even the name is deliberately off-putting to people. It is incredibly difficult for the public to get into these documents, understand what is proposed and make their voices heard.” A tin ear for local sensibilities and a high-handed manner can be dangerous as well as demoralising. A couple of years ago, in another area of Wigan, the giant contractor Serco decided to house about 100 asylum seekers in a local Britannia hotel. A private company, interested primarily in a financial return, was entrusted by government with the fates of highly vulnerable people and the sociology of a town. “The decision was not negotiated with local people” recalls Nandy. “No one ever sat down and said: ‘We’ve got this crisis that we need to try and resolve.’ Suddenly, in a small, overwhelmingly white community, 100 mainly young African men were ‘parked’ overnight with very little support and no notice to the people who lived there.” It was a gift to the racists. False rumours spread that schoolchildren had been filmed by migrants and a church had been broken into. Far-right activists began to take an unwelcome interest and a petition was launched calling for the migrants’ removal. It was swiftly countered by a bigger one welcoming them to the area, but the episode was tense and unpleasant. “Just handled so badly,” says Nandy. “Wigan people don’t lack compassion. When there was an appeal for Syrian refugees, 36,000 bags of donations were raised in two weeks. But when there’s no debate, there is a feeling this thing has been imposed on you. People didn’t blame the migrants in the hotel and many did their best to help. But there was real anger.” Nandy is at pains to point out that Wigan is not some kind of post-industrial disaster-zone, plunged in gloom and misery. But people do feel the loss of the old pit town identity, a sense of powerlessness over the present and a feeling that things could and should be done better. “Wigan is not a shit place!” she says. “Most have enough to get by, but it feels as if everything is under strain, that things that really matter are under threat. That’s where the Brexit vote came from. People feel that they are defending something that hasn’t quite gone yet, that is in danger of being swept away.” She mentions the elderly woman who had a weekly toenail painting service provided by council social care. “It was stopped, and the sense of loss she felt went way beyond anything to do with her toenails. It was about social contact and inclusion.” According to Marc Stears, former chief speechwriter to former Labour leader Ed Miliband, stories such as those from Wigan indicate the extent to which an idea of local “sovereignty”, beyond issues of migration, was at stake in the referendum. Addressing that, he believes, is fundamental if the left is to recover its relevance in the Leave towns of England. In October, Stears relaunched the non-partisan New Economics Foundation (NEF), which defines its mission as: “Building an economy where people really take control” – a nod to the now notorious “Take back control” slogan used by the Vote Leave campaign. “In the late 90s and early 2000s,” says Stears, “New Labour explicitly did a deal with the devil – it said, ‘Look, we’ll leave neoliberal policies alone because we’ll be able to cream off enough money to redistribute adequately.’ So you could generate support for the public services by being very hands-off with market forces, but then redistributing through the state.” The achievements of New Labour in re-investing in the NHS and renovating crumbling schools were the fruit of this bargain. But, says Stears, there was a darker side to the project. “The big problem with the model was that the Labour hierarchy grew to have disdain in high places for the people who were not happy with that settlement. People who were miserable at work because they were being treated badly by some corporate power; or people working in a public sector that was increasingly marketised and target-driven; or people whose communities were changing and felt aggrieved at the emergence of clone towns and high streets that lost all their identity.” The crash brought an uneasy compromise to an end. “If economic times are good and you are getting a fancy new GP surgery, you may feel you can put up with the lack of control at work, or the nature of the high street and so on. But when that improvement in the public realm comes to a shuddering halt, as it did in 2008, then this deal is no deal at all. And you get the populist revolt that we’ve seen.” For Ukip, Donald Trump and other rightwing populist forces on the rise, the aftermath to the crash offered a golden opportunity to fuse xenophobic nationalism with provincial and regional discontents that have been simmering for years. But the response, says Stears, cannot be to wave the anger away as part of an “age of unreason”. Seeing off the likes of Farage depends on finding a vision of work, place and community that can speak to the wider concerns of those Nissan workers in Sunderland, not a return to the status quo ante. “Can it be re-imagined?” asks Stears. “What does it take to re-entangle an economy in its local context, to put people in control of economy, rather than the economy being in control of them?” It is a question that the readers of Merrie England would recognise. Professor Karel Williams, who teaches at Manchester University’s business school, has spent the last couple of years trying to work out an answer. Williams argues that a successful approach will start from where communities are actually at, in what he calls a new politics of “the mundane”. What Williams calls the “foundational economy” – provision of essential goods like health, education, social care, utilities, refuse collection, transport, prisons and food distribution – constitutes by far the biggest source of employment in many towns. Care workers, refuse collectors, bus drivers and cleaners are doing the humble, under-appreciated jobs that are fundamental to collective wellbeing. But the cult of outsourcing and the privatisation of the public sphere has meant that the delivery of these public goods has largely become a profit-driven, high-stress, low-pay endeavour. It is by beginning here, argues Williams, that a project to improve the inner lives of towns can begin. In a study of the large number of care homes run by private equity-funded providers, Williams and fellow researchers from Manchester’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change found that an average 12% financial return was required to reward investors and service debts. Local authorities could borrow capital at a far lower rate, potentially enabling more care home places and fairer wages for underpaid carers. Public financing, by releasing operators from the pressures of shareholder return and high interest rates, would also allow more scope for local experiment and innovation. As this and other areas of the “foundational economy” were wholly or partially brought back into the public sphere, the “common good” could replace profit extraction as the guiding policy framework. “Unstable, financialised ownership of what should be low-risk, low-return activities is a mistake,” says Williams, “We need to think again about socially created value in areas where there’s no risk that demand will go away, like utilities, care services, bus services, food distribution.” NEF ideas on community land trusts, land taxes and local and regional banking speak to the same theme of reining capital back in, and re-claiming swathes of communal life that have been subjected to unrestrained market incursion for three decades. “Some things should be owned and run for the benefit of all of us,” says Stears. “Especially when they are essential for meeting basic human needs.” There are the seeds here of a new philosophy of public wellbeing that seems like natural Labour territory, offering a vision of municipal progress, civic pride and a rehabilitation of local democratic control. Given the coming mayoral elections in which, for example, Andy Burnham is likely to become the first mayor of Greater Manchester, there are likely to be opportunities for Labour to explore this “civic” route to renewal. The alternative – already unfolding in Stoke – is that, as Stears puts it: “The nationalist nativist right will say, ‘We’ll stand up for place and country and belonging and an economy that works for this community.’” Farewell to the working class? The stained glass windows of Rochdale’s splendid Victorian town hall, built 20 years or so before Blatchford wrote Merrie England, bear colourful witness to the town’s golden age. One by one, they pay tribute to the town’s onetime trading partners in Prussia, Spain, Austria, Denmark and Sweden. The tools of Rochdale’s cotton-spinning vocation are also lovingly depicted – a source of pride, wealth and a sense of purpose. This was where Gordon Brown’s general election campaign went off the rails in 2010. Brown, then prime minister, was recorded describing Labour-supporting local resident, Gillian Duffy, as a “bigot”, after she complained about the scale of immigration into the area from eastern Europe. It was the moment that party’s dangerous disconnect with its northern heartlands became visible for all to see. Rochdale voted 60% to Leave, and the pleas of local Labour MP, Simon Danczuk were ignored. In the backroom of the Roebuck pub, a couple of minutes’ walk away from the town hall, some of the white working-class huddle of drinkers are happy to acknowledge that racism was a factor. “I’m racist, I don’t mind saying that,” says Linda, who works as a cleaner. “The Muslims, it’s a problem. That wall that Donald Trump is building – the Chinese built one centuries ago to keep people out and it worked. We need one over here. We could do with a Trump over here.” The level of anger is striking. Zoe, 55, is a carer and works with disabled people. She is furious about what has become of Rochdale’s market, which a year ago left its longstanding home in the town’s exchange building and is now opposite the metro stop. “It’s full of tat and loads of rabbit-hutch stalls run by Muslims with their stuff.” Others voice the common complaint that asylum seekers and refugees are overwhelmingly housed in the poorer parts of the country, rather than in the wealthy south-east. Scott, who celebrates his birthday the following day, and is the worse for wear, laments the number of people from ethnic minorities on the estate where he lives. “Farage and Trump in front of that gold door,” he says. “I fucking loved that. I’ll tell you this. If Labour doesn’t get right behind Brexit – right behind it – Labour’s finished in places like this.” The xenophobia (by no means shared by all) feels suddenly licensed, an ugly sign of the new times. But the root cause of its virulence seems to be a sense of abject social decline. Mark Clegg, who clearly doesn’t share some of the views of his neighbours, is a former butcher and a Labour voter. Around the tables there is general agreement when he says flatly: “Rochdale has become a nonentity. Rochdale and Oldham [five miles away] have been sinking together for decades.” “Twenty-five years ago this town was buzzing,” agrees Zoe, sadly. “More like 40,” chips in someone, but she ignores the correction and carries on. “Drake Street was fantastic, full of life. Now it’s just pound shops and pawn shops and charity shops. Do you remember how the market used to be world-renowned? What’s been lost round here… it’s a scandal.” A former publican speaks up: “We haven’t even got a fish and chip shop in the centre any more. It closed when the business rates went up. Rochdale’s business rates are totally unrealistic, that’s why we’ve got these charity shops. They don’t have to pay them!” Clegg points to the fact that “McDonald’s have shut down in the main street. Once that happens, you’re stuffed. I know you get rose-tinted glasses and all that, but it really was different and better before.” Local politicians have tried to lift the mood. Part lottery-funded, a 14th century medieval bridge was re-opened last year after more than a century out of use. The River Roch now runs through the town again, having been concreted over. “Build and they will come,” jokes Clegg. But no one in the Roebuck believes anybody will come. Linda says she will “100%” vote for Ukip if they put up a candidate here in 2020. The Labour party is lumped together with all the other institutions that have let Rochdale down. Among some on the left, there is a conviction that, whatever its problems in the towns, Labour’s future lies in the cities where the youthful radicalism that launched Occupy a few years ago, and played a vital role in the rise of Podemos in Spain, can be developed. The socially conservative traditional working class, its habits and prejudices forged in the industrial era, is a fading irrelevance. Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP for Dagenham, once home to 40,000 Ford employees, and the former head of the party’s policy review, is distinctly unimpressed by that analysis. “For some of the fashionable left, their strategy seems to be to get out from under the present crisis by disinventing the working class altogether,” says Cruddas. “They assume they will disappear, replaced by some combination of automation and artificial intelligence, and are focusing all their energy on an urban networked youth as the new base for the left. You have a problem with the working class so you just assume it will go away – not exactly the most creative, thoughtful route through our current problems!” Taking a different path, Cruddas is, in a certain sense, going back to the future. He recently set up a new grouping of academics, writers and politicians, including Nandy, with the task of “renewing the public philosophy of the left”. The aim is to produce a book by the summer and a sea change in Labour’s orientation. One of the points of departure, says Cruddas, is the suggestion by Michael Sandel in a recent interview with the New Statesman that Labour needs to return to “its roots in a kind of moral and civic critique of the excesses of capitalism”. This was the core thrust of Merrie England, and the original spirit of a Labour party that had its roots in religion, not Marxism. But during the 20th century, the “ethical tradition” faded as the parliamentary party became more pragmatic and managerial, while the left pursued the more confrontational Marxist route of class struggle. And from the late 1980s onwards, as the new individualism launched by the Thatcher/Reagan era swept all before it, Labour began to talk far more about aspiration, choice and social mobility than it did about community. To argue that, as the Christian socialist RH Tawney put it, the left stands for “the familiar commonplace that ‘morality is at the heart of things’ and men are all, in truth, members of one another,” became rather unfashionable. For the pragmatists of New Labour, what was good was what “worked”. But, as the high tide of economic liberalism recedes, maybe Labour’s neglected ethical tradition is finally due a revival. These Trumpian times could certainly do with a warmer, more inclusive politics of community where local cohesion doesn’t come at the expense of the outsider. The growing melancholy of England’s towns led to the angry surge towards the Brexit door. For Labour, the result was a body blow to the party’s sense of itself and marked the beginning of a mighty battle to hold on to its bastions, beginning with Cumbria and Stoke. A Tawney-style Labour party may have a chance of winning that fight, and regaining the affections of the descendants of “John Smith of Oldham”. But it will be a long struggle. “Once you used to think of Labour as the party for the working man and woman,” says Clegg, as the night in the Roebuck drew to a close. “Not any more.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/feb/10/raf-simons-calvin-klein-design-chief-americana-flag-colours","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T19:13:40Z","webTitle":"Raf Simons bids to make Calvin Klein great again with cultural popcorn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/feb/10/raf-simons-calvin-klein-design-chief-americana-flag-colours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/feb/10/raf-simons-calvin-klein-design-chief-americana-flag-colours","fields":{"headline":"Raf Simons bids to make Calvin Klein great again with cultural popcorn","bodyText":"Raf Simons’ mission at New York fashion week is simple: make Calvin Klein great again. In the cultural battlefield that is the contemporary US, a sleeping giant just woke up to stake a claim for what Americana looks like now. Calvin Klein is an American icon. Back in the glory days of the USA that Bruce Springsteen sang about in 1984, the name transcended jeans and underwear to become a byword for youth, sex and style. It morphed into part of the vernacular, from Brooke Shields’s infamous “Nothing comes between me and my Calvins” ad to a cameo role in Back to the Future. The newly appointed Belgian designer Simons, fresh from success at Christian Dior and Jil Sander, intends to put Calvin Klein back at the heart of Americana. In the cavernous Calvin Klein building near Times Square, the first outfit on to the catwalk was a pair of red trousers, with a white polo neck beneath a neatly tucked blue shirt. These stars and stripes colours, with their shades of Kellyanne Conway’s marching-band aesthetic, were soundtracked by David Bowie singing This Is Not America and set against a new installation by artist Sterling Ruby, whose work addresses issues of American identity and economic decline. There were no slogan T-shirts in the show. But by creating high-taste fashion out of the most popcorny elements of US culture – the male models wore the kind of heeled boots the Fonz used to wear, while women’s coats came in Little House on the Prairie quilting – Simons set out a vision for Calvin Klein that framed America as something highbrow and refined, but – crucially – refused to cede the aesthetic middle ground. The show was an invigorating moment for the New York fashion scene. Simons looks to be pitching his Calvin Klein as somewhere between Andy Warhol and Ralph Lauren, and masterminded a front-row scene that left no room for doubt that this show was the place to be. So packed were the white benches that even Gwyneth Paltrow dared not risk giving up her place for fear of being unable to squeeze back in, and instead mouthed ‘I love you’ at Sarah Jessica Parker across the catwalk as they waited for the show to start. At the end of the show, after Simons and his creative director, Pieter Mulier, had taken a bow to raucous applause, Shields – star of the Calvin Klein adverts three decades ago – leapt from her seat to greet Millie Bobby Brown, the Stranger Things actor who stars in Calvin Klein’s newest campaign. “Oh wow, I’m so excited to meet you,” said Brown. “No! I’m so excited to meet you!” replied Shields."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2017/feb/10/less-of-the-burden-when-reporting-on-tax-forecasts-please","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T19:24:20Z","webTitle":"Less of the burden when reporting on tax forecasts, please | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/10/less-of-the-burden-when-reporting-on-tax-forecasts-please","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/feb/10/less-of-the-burden-when-reporting-on-tax-forecasts-please","fields":{"headline":"Less of the burden when reporting on tax forecasts, please","bodyText":"While the people of Surrey await full disclosure of precisely what was said, by who, and when, from their county council to the government on the issue of council tax rises (Report, 9 February), it is not unfair to point out that there certainly were compelling reasons for council leader David Hodge to try to get a special deal over the issue.

The reports, based on leaks from current and former officials, also point to contacts between the former general and Russian officials going back to before the 8 November election – an election that the US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to influence in Donald Trump’s favour. Both the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Flynn talked to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kisilyak, about forthcoming sanctions from the Obama administration in response to Russian electoral meddling. The allegations led to calls from Democrats for Flynn to be dismissed while some prominent Republicans were tepid in their support. “The allegation that General Flynn, while President Obama was still in office, secretly discussed with Russia’s ambassador ways to undermine the sanctions levied against Russia for its interference in the presidential election on Trump’s behalf, raises serious questions of legality and fitness for office,” said Adam Schiff, the Democratic ranking member of the House intelligence committee, in a written statement. Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, told CNN that it was up to Trump what happened with Flynn, saying that if the country had been misled, “we would expect the president to take appropriate actions”. When asked by reporters aboard Air Force One about the report, Trump replied: “I don’t know about that. I haven’t seen it. What report is that? I haven’t seen that. I’ll look into that.” Flynn and the US vice-president, Mike Pence, had previously issued flat denials that Flynn and Kisilyak had spoken about anything of substance and the White House had insisted that the conversations involved only the exchange of Christmas greetings and preparations for a future Trump phone call with Vladimir Putin. On Friday, Flynn’s staff at the national security council said he could no longer be sure whether sanctions had been discussed. Officials told CNN that Pence had taken Flynn’s word before vouching for him. The Kremlin denied that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the ambassador. The reports quoted sources who had seen a purported intelligence transcript of the calls. It would have been fairly routine for the Russian ambassador to Washington to have his calls tapped, raising questions over whether Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency chief, knew his discussion would be monitored. The officials said Flynn had not gone as far as pledging the sanctions would be reversed, but had raised that possibility. Such a conversation could be a breach of the Logan Act, a 1799 law prohibiting private citizens from negotiating with countries with which the US is in dispute. Only one person, in 1803, has ever been indicted under the Logan Act and it is not unusual for officials on presidential teams to have contacts with foreign governments. Legal experts said it was the earlier denials by Flynn that have made his hold on his job more tenuous, as well the broader context. An investigation is still under way by several intelligence agencies into Russian hacking of the election and possible collusion between the Trump camp and Moscow. Susan Hennessey, a former NSA lawyer now at the Brookings Institution, said: “The FBI doesn’t really investigate Logan Act violations. If there’s an ongoing inquiry two months on, it’s a counter-intelligence investigation.” The Senate intelligence committee also pledged last month to hold its own inquiry into the Kremlin’s role in Trump’s victory, and to subpoena officials if necessary, but it has yet to get started amid disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over its scope and whether it needs extra staffing. In the wake of the new revelations, some Democrats warned that the delays could be intended to work as a cover-up. “We are very discouraged that week after week goes by and that panel … has not been convened,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said. “A lot of us wonder if it is just an effort to delay and delay and delay until no one is interested in this any longer.” The doubts hanging over Flynn’s future have deepened the chaos surrounding Trump’s efforts to form an administration. Not all his cabinet secretaries have been confirmed, and very few deputy secretaries have even been nominated. A possible candidate for deputy secretary of state, Elliot Abrams, a former Reagan and Bush administration official, was reported on Friday to have been rejected by Trump after the president was made aware of negative remarks Abrams had made about him during the campaign."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/feb/24/hollywood-robert-evans-the-kid-stays-in-the-picture-simon-mcburney-royal-court","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T12:00:31Z","webTitle":"How Robert Evans changed movies for ever – and for the better","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/24/hollywood-robert-evans-the-kid-stays-in-the-picture-simon-mcburney-royal-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/feb/24/hollywood-robert-evans-the-kid-stays-in-the-picture-simon-mcburney-royal-court","fields":{"headline":"How Robert Evans changed movies for ever – and for the better","bodyText":"Half a century ago, Hollywood was at a crossroads. The major studios were in the doldrums, haemorrhaging money on bloated star vehicles such as Paint Your Wagon that were relics from a different era. Iconoclastic social critiques such as Bonnie and Clyde and Easy Rider were generating headlines and queues around the block. No one knew what the public wanted next. All bets were off. “There was a brief window where someone could go into a studio and propose any film,” explains Simon McBurney, the 59-year-old actor and artistic director of groundbreaking theatre company Complicite, when we meet in an east London cafe. He sounds so excited by this notion that he would surely be rubbing his hands with glee if his right thumb were not swaddled in a cartoonishly large bandage, the sort that Tom might wear after Jerry has thwacked his paw with a mallet. It was an accident while cleaning the blender: “I didn’t realise it was plugged in. It took a piece out of my thumb the size of a sugar lump.” I wince in sympathy but he looks blankly at me from beneath the brim of his canvas cap. He is too caught up in thinking about that Hollywood revolution to worry about a sore thumb. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest was for him the clinching film from the American new wave of the late 1960s into the 1970s. “As an actor, that was the absolute explosion for me,” he says. McBurney is steeped in the era and its social and cultural impact again now that he is directing an adaptation of The Kid Stays in the Picture, the scandalous, hard-boiled show-business memoir by producer Robert Evans, who transformed the industry when he became head of production at Paramount. In shepherding to the screen hits including Rosemary’s Baby, The Godfather and Chinatown, he took the studio from ninth place (of nine) to No 1. The dynamic and silver-tongued Evans, who is 86 and still has an office on the Paramount lot, was a former actor who became a millionaire in his 20s after selling the women’s clothing business he had started with his brother. (He liked to say he was “in women’s pants”.) He described himself as a “half-assed” actor but what he knew about was story. In the second half of the 1960s he snapped up the rights to novels including The Detective and The Godfather (when it was still titled Mafia and amounted to a pile of “rumpled pages”), which he transformed into modestly budgeted mega-hits. He also mastered cross-platforming long before that term was coined: the publisher of Love Story didn’t have much faith in that tearjerker but Evans put $25,000 toward expanding its print run when he bought the film rights. He then nurtured relationships among media subsidiaries of Paramount’s parent company, Gulf+Western, to guarantee the success of the book, which in turn boosted the movie version. He was a gambler, to be sure, and the gambles didn’t always pay off. Towards the end of the 1970s, he was deeply in debt and addicted to cocaine; in the 80s he was briefly a murder suspect after the death of a potential investor in his film The Cotton Club (a spectacular flop). But he was also a visionary. He changed the movies for ever, and for the better – it was he who ordered Francis Ford Coppola to add nearly an hour to The Godfather after the director turned in an initial cut that resembled, in Evans’s words, “a long, bad trailer for a really good film”. “What he understood,” says McBurney, “was ‘fuck stars, fuck distribution’. What’s key is story. He worked out that if you get the right story, everybody will go. The more truthful that story is, the more not on the money but slightly ahead of the money, the more it will key into the zeitgeist. People had begun to understand through television that there were some shit things going on in the world and they wanted a degree of that reality.” One of the elements that interests McBurney in Evans’s memoir is the overlap between art and life. The preface to The Kid Stays in the Picture memorably begins: “There are three sides to every story: yours … mine … and the truth. No one is lying.” McBurney smiles at that. “The whole question of what is and isn’t true is a fascinating one. People say, ‘But is it a real story?’ Well, all stories are real because they all really do something, they all really engage you. When I told you about my thumb you bought into it because it’s a good story. I can make it less good – ‘It’s fine, it’s just a little cut’ – but I choose to embellish because I enjoy telling stories.” This extends even to the nature of our conversation. “In a moment you’ll ask me another question and I’ll tell you some other lie.” He smiles faintly and takes a chomp on his sandwich. The distinction between fact and fiction is particularly irrelevant in the case of Evans because of the bizarre hall-of-mirrors effect created by his films. After Love Story was released, the rate of impregnation suddenly shot up. When The Godfather opened, it became the favourite film of the mafia, who then began to dress like the characters in the film. “There is this extraordinary interplay in 20th-century American culture,” says McBurney, “between who people are and who they imagine they are. Look at America now. Everything is corrupt. Everything is done on the fly, with a degree of improvisation. There is the surface where you have the myth and the magic, but underneath it’s extremely murky. As Evans said to Henry Kissinger, politics is only second-rate show business. Which then of course becomes true with the election of Ronald Reagan. And Kissinger, coming out of The Godfather, says: “It’s just like Washington but with different faces.’” No one familiar with Complicite’s work would expect a “straight” adaptation of the book. It seems McBurney is planning to use Evans’s story as a prism through which to view the US. “Kind of,” he says with a slight grimace. “I’m not hijacking the story. What interests me is the way that something is real and not real, happening and not happening. There’s a story about it and yet the story is the reality.” The creative process behind any McBurney production can appear precarious to outsiders: A Disappearing Number, Complicite’s show about the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, was first staged in 2007 in an incomplete form, and there was still no script for The Encounter 10 days before its premiere in 2015. I can vouch that a script exists for The Kid Stays in the Picture – it occupies the seat beside its author while we talk – but the details are still up in the air. There are unlikely to be any clips from Evans’s movies. “That would just make you want to see the rest of the film.” McBurney will admit that there is currently a live camera feed in the show. “Whether there will be finally I don’t know.” The actor Danny Huston (whose father, John, was unforgettably sinister as Noah Cross in Chinatown) has been cast in the show but there is a rumour that the role of Evans will be divided among multiple performers, à la Todd Haynes’s Dylan film I’m Not There – or, indeed, Beware of Pity, Complicite’s recent Stefan Zweig adaptation. Of course, there is only one Robert Evans. When I call him at his home in Los Angeles, he is in good spirits. His words sometimes come haltingly – he suffered a series of strokes in the late 1990s – but the charm is intact and impressive. As is that deep, rich voice, both gravelly and sweet. I ask what makes a good producer and he gives a wheezing laugh. “That’s a good question. Every success I’ve had has been for a different reason and every failure for the same one – I said ‘yes’ when I meant ‘no’. With very few exceptions, that’s been the story of my life. Darryl Zanuck told me, ‘If you can introduce your movie in a paragraph you’ll make it a hit. If you can do it in a sentence, you’ve got yourself a blockbuster.’ He was 5ft 4.” Height is clearly an important factor here, so I ask Evans how tall he is. “5ft 10!” he says with relish. He has the knack of making well-worn stories sound as though they’ve just popped into his head. The next moment, he will ambush you with a poignant reflection. “I’m still alive. A little battered. But I like myself. For not selling out. There are people who have bigger homes, bigger boats. I don’t care about that. No one has bigger dreams.” I wonder what he sees when he looks around Hollywood today. “Young people,” he shoots back without missing a beat. “However. I’m not into machines. I’m not into Mars. I like feelings. How does it feel? That, to me, is the turn-on. And story. If it ain’t on the page, it ain’t on the screen, or anywhere else.” McBurney concurs: “The studios now will only fund something if they know it’s going to make money – if it’s superhero X, Y or Z, and it did well the first time, then they’ll make a second or third.” Or, for that matter, a fifth. After all, McBurney himself starred in the most recent instalment of – but no, he’s already beaten me to the punch. “I know, I did Mission: Impossible,” he says, turning away from me. “I don’t know whether to say ‘Shame on me’ or not. The fact is I have a family, and every now and then I go, ‘Well, I’d better pay for some trousers now.’” His own brushes with Hollywood have been few and far between but he did briefly approach Coppola’s orbit in the early 1990s, when he was flown out to audition to play Renfield in the director’s adaptation of Dracula. “I spent two weeks in Los Angeles drifting in and out of castings and meetings. Coppola at that point was very heavily protected by his own coterie of people at Zoetrope and reportedly never got to see my tape – but, hey, I lost out to Tom Waits.” His experience of LA and the film industry is largely typical. “I stayed in the house of a producer friend who then gave me keys to someone else’s house where the Beatles had stayed. All very bizarre. We were let in, no one was there. My girlfriend and I swam up and down in the swimming pool, wandered around stark naked, drove up to Big Sur. It was kind of crazy. The sense of impermanence, the lack of specificity can, if you are in the least bit sensitive or emotionally unstable, be disturbing. I’ve been incredibly lonely there. It’s so nebulous and yet it’s easy, in spite of its vastness, to feel closed-in.” McBurney has often said he makes things so that he can understand them, and The Kid Stays in the Picture is no exception. “I don’t know about Hollywood and this world and I find a lot of it distasteful. And yet meeting Robert and reading the book there is something fascinating and human about this story of a man who goes right to the top, which in that profession means right to the top of America.” McBurney and Evans seem like unlikely bedfellows but both men emphasise their points of overlap. When no one could fathom Robert Towne’s Chinatown screenplay, McBurney points out, “Evans made it, in a sense, in order to understand it.” The producer chuckles at the memory: “Everyone thought it was written in Chinese!” Though he has met McBurney only once, he thinks they might be kindred spirits. “His reputation precedes him,” he says admiringly. “I’ve been told by many people he’s a genius. He is an actor and a writer and he’s been around a long time. He’s his own man.” Sounds familiar, I say. He lets out a laugh like a bowling ball rolling down an alley. “That’s my type o’ guy.” • The Kid Stays in the Picture is at the Royal Court, London SW1, from 7 March to 8 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2017/feb/12/seafood-microfiber-pollution-patagonia-guppy-friend","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T15:00:09Z","webTitle":"Microfibers are polluting our food chain.

These bits eventually make their way into rivers, lakes and our oceans, where they pose health threats to plants and animals. The two men knew they had to act. “We said, ‘either we have to stop selling fleece [apparel] or we have to think of a solution’,” explains Nolte. “So we went out to our beer garden and said ‘what can we do?’” The beer-filled brainstorming session eventually led to Guppy Friend, a mesh laundry bag, that goes into the washing machine. The bag captures shedding fibers as clothes are tossed and spun, preventing the fibers from escaping. It’s roomy enough for a couple of fleece jackets or other apparel made of synthetic fabric. In two weeks, Langbrett, in partnership with outdoor clothing company Patagonia, will start shipping the Guppy Friend to the backers of their Kickstarter campaign. Patagonia will then begin selling the bag to customers. The Guppy Friend is the first device designed and marketed specifically to prevent microfiber pollution. Microfibers are tiny, so they can easily move through sewage treatment plants. Natural fibers, such as cotton or wool, biodegrade over time. But synthetic fibers are problematic because they do not biodegrade, and tend to bind with molecules of harmful chemical pollutants found in wastewater, such as pesticides or flame retardants. Plus, fibers from apparel are often coated with chemicals to achieve performance attributes such as water resistance. Studies have shown health problems among plankton and other small organisms that eat microfibers, which then make their way up the food chain. Researchers have found high numbers of fibers inside fish and shellfish sold at markets. To date, no studies have shown that microfibers cause health problems in humans. But that’s cold comfort to Nolte: “Scientific research is slow, so it might take another generation to find out what harm [these pollutants] will do. I don’t want to wait that long.” Nolte and Spies worked with German research institute Fraunhofer to test and vet the bag’s design and material. They settled on polyamide, also known as nylon, that doesn’t shed fibers easily. It’s made with a 50-micron mesh, a width that allows soapy water to enter the bag without allowing fibers to leave. When the bag is removed from the washer at the end of a cycle, the fiber – visible against the white mesh – can be removed by hand and disposed of. Tests show that the bag remains functional and intact after hundreds of washings. The duo isn’t alone in tackling the problem in the laundry room. A startup called the Rozalia Project is developing a microfiber-catching device, but it is not yet available. Devices called after-market filters are already available – these are designed to reduce the amount of lint that enters septic systems. But unless you have some plumbing skills, hiring a plumber to install the $130 filters can be expensive. Guppy Friend attracted the attention of Patagonia last summer when word about the project reached Phil Graves, managing director of Tin Shed Ventures, Patagonia’s investment fund. Patagonia already had a relationship with Langbrett, which sells Patagonia clothing. Patagonia is interested in reducing microfiber pollution, based on the results of a study it commissioned at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2015. Researchers calculated the microfibers shed from Patagonia outerwear during laundry, and found that a single fleece jacket sheds as many as 250,000 synthetic fibers. Using sales numbers, the researchers extrapolated that about 100,000 jackets are in use worldwide each year, and washing them would produce enough plastic to make 11,900 grocery bags. “We received early prototypes [of the bag] and tested them with the UCSB researchers we had worked with on our fiber loss study. They confirmed that the bag trapped anywhere from 90-95% of fibers,” Graves says. “We brought in our material engineers and gave [Nolte and Spies] feedback on construction.” Nolte says design improvements have boosted the bag’s ability to capture fibers to 99%. Patagonia gave Nolte and Spies financial support – a €100,000 ($108,000) grant – to develop the mesh bag and a supply chain for it. The duo also launched the Kickstarter campaign that ran from last October to December and raised €28,640 ($30,604) from 668 backers. In exchange for the grant, Nolte and Spies agreed to let Patagonia be the first retailer, aside from Langbrett, to sell Guppy Friend. Patagonia plans to sell Guppy Friend at the cost of buying and shipping it from Nolte and Spies – the California company won’t be making a profit. It hasn’t settled on a retail price yet, but it will likely be between $20-$30. Since sales of synthetic fabric are growing, Guppy Friend will need to be a big seller to make a dent in microfiber pollution. So how likely is that? It will require some convincing. Nik Sawe, a Stanford University researcher who uses neuroscience to study how consumers make decisions on environmental issues, says the key is to use emotion to influence behavior. “If Guppy Friend can appeal to consumers’ feelings around the negative impacts of microfiber pollution, it might be able to elicit them to spend $20 or $30 for the bag,” he says. In the meantime, Nolte says he’s gotten a lot of interest from retailers. So far, he and Nolte have 30,000 pre-orders for Guppy Friend, from Patagonia and other retailers he could not yet name. Next up: Nolte and Spies are also working on reducing microfiber losses before the fabric reaches the laundry room. They are working with Deutsche Textilforschungszentrum, a German standards body, to create a metric that will show the rate/amount of fiber losses of a given textile. They hope clothing designers will choose fabrics that aren’t prone to shedding. “We know that higher quality fabrics shed fewer fibers,” he says. He hopes the testing standard will make that clear to brands and consumers. But eventually it might take government regulation to curb the sale of high-shed synthetics, he says. But with Guppy Friend, he says: “We can act now. We do not need to wait for anyone.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk-news/2017/feb/24/country-diary-hedgerows-haven-birds-hares-badgers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T05:30:23Z","webTitle":"Hedgerows are haven for birds, hares and badgers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/24/country-diary-hedgerows-haven-birds-hares-badgers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/feb/24/country-diary-hedgerows-haven-birds-hares-badgers","fields":{"headline":"Hedgerows are haven for birds, hares and badgers","bodyText":"The reed buntings sway on their vertical perches like trapeze artists waiting for the next trick. Bare hawthorn whips make a good vantage point from which to survey the landscape before they flit into a field of winter stubble to feed. The males have a black head and smart white collar, adding to the appearance of professional performers. The females look at bit dowdy at first but, on closer inspection, their streaky brown plumage and fine white moustaches, running from the base of the beak across their cheeks, are just as handsome. Once on the UK’s endangered list, Emberiza schoeniclus has recently made a comeback, largely because of its ability to adapt to living on farmland. These reed buntings are lucky to have found a farm where the hedgerows haven’t been grubbed up to make way for agricultural machinery and where the stubble hasn’t been ploughed up to make way for a second crop. The leftover kernels of wheat will see the birds through the hungry gap over winter and early spring. Here at Rectory Farm, the tenants grow oilseed rape as well as wheat, which they add to bought-in millet, sunflower seeds and the niger seeds that goldfinches so love, to sell as garden birdfood mixes. Wildflower margins planted around the fields provide more seeds and attract insects for birds to feed on in the summer. Customers are encouraged to visit and see the results for themselves. The effect of these “green corridors” is visible on even the shortest walk across the fields. Skylarks lift into the air, although on this February day their chirruping has yet to reach the joyous sound of springtime. Flashes of white suggest that the “little brown jobs” flitting in and out of the hedge are chaffinches. The yellowhammer perched on a briar is easier to identify, his head and breast bright against the muted landscape. In the distance, a kestrel hovers and a red kite glides overhead.

Demographically speaking, the next couple of decades are a unique window of opportunity. With the exception of Africa, the world is ageing, which means the proportion of young people in the global population will never again be so high. The “youth bulge” – broadly defined as a peak in young people’s share in a country’s population – could be a blessing for many countries, provided governments and others do what is necessary to ensure young people become healthy, educated and productive citizens. But where should they be looking to find the data that will help them develop more evidence-based policies and programmes? Credible data on young people is rather difficult to come by. Data split by gender is even harder to find. A youth development index (YDI) developed by the Commonwealth Secretariat seeks to address this anomaly. The index, which aggregates data on 18 indicators related to the health, education, employment and political participation levels of young people, provides a snapshot of the multi-dimensional nature of youth development in 183 countries. Like all composite indices, the index has its shortcomings. But crunching the data it throws up offers a lot of food for thought, particularly for policymakers. Overall, the prospects for a majority of young people in the world are bleak. Three in four of them are failing to get the start in life they deserve. The inequality in opportunities and outcomes for young people across countries is huge. For instance, the youth mortality rate is on average five times higher in the lowest-ranked countries of the index in comparison with countries where young people have the best shot at living a decent life. Equally shocking is the gap in secondary education enrolment rates for the highest and lowest ranked countries. In some respects, however, the best and worst-performing countries are similar: unemployment, drug abuse and mental disorder rates among young people are equally worrying in both. It is the poor quality of healthcare and education in so many countries, and a socio-economic horizon blighted by poverty, unemployment, violence, inequality or lawlessness, that are usually to blame. For girls and young women, the future looks particularly precarious. Only 40% of countries have achieved something close to gender parity in secondary education enrolment rates. In tertiary education, that figure drops to 4%. Young females are on average twice as likely as young males to be out of education, employment or training. Worldwide, HIV prevalence rates are also significantly higher among young females. The study reveals that large youth bulges, violent conflict, a country’s income status and regime type are among the most important predictors of youth development. Nearly all the countries in the index where youth development is categorised as medium or low are ones where young people make up a significantly large proportion of the population. But the unluckiest young people are the ones living in countries that have also been ravaged by violence and armed conflict – in other words, the countries at the bottom of the index, such as Central African Republic, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Chad. In a similar vein, political unrest and war in the Middle East and North Africa are undoing the significant progress many countries in the region had made in the past few decades in providing decent education and healthcare to their young people. Syria, for instance, has registered the largest drop in education scores in the five-year period tracked by the index. A critical factor in youth development is the extent to which young people are able to participate in the political and civic life of their countries. But role models are in short supply: according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, of the 45,000 national level legislators in the world, only 1.9% are below the age of 30. It is hardly surprising that young people are fast losing faith in apathetic political systems at a time when social media is giving them the tools to launch an insurgency from their bedrooms. In 2015, the world signed up to the sustainable development goals, an ambitious set of targets to be achieved by 2030. Be it ending poverty or pushing back climate change, getting close to these goals will depend largely on the ability of today’s youth to rise to the challenge. The evidence suggests most countries are failing to prepare their young people for the economic, environmental, technological and political upheavals that lie ahead. In much of the world, the window of opportunity for converting the youth bulge into a “demographic dividend” will remain open for another few decades at best. Unless the challenges young people face are treated as urgent, it is more than likely that many among their nearly 2 billion-strong number will end up as a lost generation.

Thanks for joining us for a snapshot of air pollution on this otherwise unremarkable Monday in February 2017. The results have been worrying. Air pollution is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the world, killing nearly 7 million people a year – mostly in urban areas. Indoor air pollution is responsible for roughly half those deaths. And exercising outdoors in several cities is actually worse for your health than doing nothing at all. We started the day in Beijing’s evening, where we learned that some Chinese have started referring to smog as “the weather” and saw this disturbing video: In Delhi, Michael Safi showed us his cigarette-packet-warning-esque air filter ... ... and we strapped an air pollution monitor to a rickshaw: We visited Almaty, Kazakhstan ... ... Lagos ... ... and Stockholm: And finished up by passing through Manchester, London, Rio ... ... the South Bronx’s infamous “Asthma Alley”, Mexico City and our last stop: the Los Angeles house that is literally next door to an oil refinery. Stay with us tomorrow as our air pollution series The Air We Breathe continues with an interactive on how air pollution increases your chance of death, an exclusive investigation of a steel scandal in Bosnia and a look at the “Trump effect” in Bakersfield, California, the worst city in the US for air pollution. And due to popular demand we’ll get to the bottom of whether you’re going to have to get used to the fact that air masks are going to become trendy. Which, given today’s results on our portable air pollution monitors, you almost certainly are. Thanks for joining us. Los Angeles: 9.45am. I’m in a neighborhood called Wilmington, in the far south end of the city, which is home about 60,000 people – and some of the worst air quality in southern California. It’s an unlucky part of town, nestled in between the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. There’s a major complex of oil wells and refineries, and a heavily used diesel truck and rail shipping corridor. The port complex is America’s largest. Some homes are right next door to oil wells and refineries. I’m monitoring the air quality from a few different locations, and posting readings via Twitter – here’s the first: Compare that to recent readings I took in LA – one during rush hour on Sunset Boulevard, and the other in the morning in the heart of downtown: Wilmington’s numbers aren’t looking so bad today. And, compared to other days I’ve been here, the smell of oil is barely detectable. The air isn’t even too bad at this house that’s literally next door to an oil refinery: Across town, near the Alameda Corridor, one of the major trucking routes from the ports, the air quality gets significantly worse – and the smell of diesel engines, oil and general unpleasantness are unavoidable. Efforts have been made to try to improve the air quality here, and to reduce emissions from the ports, but progress is slow. But now the regional air agency, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, is hoping to make bigger improvements throughout southern California with a new Air Quality Management Plan – a 15-year blueprint for a four-county area that aims to reduce smog-forming NOx emissions by 20 tons per day within 15 years. Some have criticised it for seeking only voluntary commitments on some elements from the goods-movement industry, which has a large impact on the air in Wilmington especially. The plan is expected to be voted on early next month. For now, parts of this neighbourhood will be left to suffer though some of the state’s worst air. Hello from Los Angeles – our last stop on today’s journey, following the sun through the hazy air of the world’s cities. This multi-centric, car-dominated metropolitan area of roughly 13 million people has been a notorious den of poor air quality for decades, and its famous smog has been a stand-in for the problems of freeway-enabled suburban sprawl. The air is getting better in LA, but it’s still not great. The American Lung Association’s 2016 State of the Air report ranked Los Angeles as the worst metropolitan area in the US for ozone pollution, and the fourth worst for PM2.5 particulates. Last summer was particularly bad. Recent rains have helped clear out some of that stagnant air. But the issues facing the city, and particular pockets, remain hard to solve. Air pollution in your city: stories from our readers around the world We’ve been collecting your experiences, pictures and stories of how urban air pollution issue impacts your daily life. Here’s a selection from the many contributions we’ve received – please keep sharing using this form or tagging #guardiancities on social media! Medellín, Colombia London, UK “I live in southeast London. I used to enjoy doing lots of running but haven’t since I moved to London because it is not healthy. I have to wear a PPF3 filter when cycling to work each morning which is really annoying as it makes it harder to breathe. It also does nothing to protect me against NOx or ozone, and my eyes sting when the pollution is bad, such as this morning.” (Shov) Yueyang, China “There’s constant smog in my small city in Hunan (Yueyang), although nothing like as bad as some other Chinese cities. I’m leaving, in part because of the pollution, and locals were astounded to hear that it bothers me. ‘But the air is so clean here! It’s just fog!’ is a common response on days when the AQI registers at over 150.” (Audrey Schoeman) Delhi, India Kraków, Poland “Recently I’ve decided to get fit. To give myself some motivation I entered the marathon here in Krakow. My training has been restricted to indoors on a running machine because the smog has been so bad that medical guidance says that strenuous activity outdoors is highly dangerous. I tried a little run outdoors and I could taste the soot in my throat. Smog masks are a common sight here, my daughter wears one whenever she’s out. There’s been a bit of a shortage of them, such has been the demand. There is an ongoing plan to phase out the remaining coal and wood burning heating in some of the older buildings (some people burn rubbish, plastic and the like). I live in an attic flat. The Velux windows are covered in a black, oily, gritty film. On the worst days the city council has allowed free travel on public transport if you show your car registration document (a bit unfair to regular users who don’t have a car).” (Polana) Mexico City, Mexico Mexico City: 11.30am. While air quality is much better in Mexico City than it was in the 1980s and 90s, things are going in the wrong direction. On the plus side, the city is much more bicycle-friendly, with new dedicated lanes and the Ecobici bike hire scheme, is the fourth biggest after Huangzhou, Paris and London. But I was an avid cyclist in London and never cycle here: the five-lane avenues, kamikaze driving and pollution put me off. In some good news, mayor Miguel Ángel Mancera has made a pact, together with the mayors of Madrid, Athens and Paris, to ban diesel vehicles by 2025. And the new wildly unpopular 20% petrol tax might stop people using their cars so much. But there’s no credible plan to tackle industry emissions, which requires state governments, from different political parties, to work together, and a commitment from federal government to make companies comply with regulations. Mexico City: 11.15am. I’m in Colonia Doctores, a run-down neighbourhood just south-west of the historic centre, and so-called because most streets are named after renowned doctors. It’s famous for lucha libre (Mexican freestyle wrestling) at Arena Mexico; homemade soup stalls; traditional cantinas; and the sprawling general hospital, where hundreds of people are streaming in this morning. Ironically, Doctores regularly registers the worst air quality in the whole city, although both patients – and doctors – seem unaware of this. The neighbourhood is 2.5 miles from my house where the air quality was 95 this morning; right now in front of the General Hospital, it’s 147, which is officially “unhealthy”. Hello from Mexico City – the world’s fourth biggest city, with 21 million people, 5.5m cars and at least 64,000 factories. In the 1980s, it was also the world’s most polluted city, and even in the late 1990s I remember frequently feeling faint. Air quality has improved since then, but pollution resurfaced as a major problem in 2016, forcing authorities to issue the first health alert in 11 years. Since then, warnings have come thick and fast. Protective masks are increasingly common. While things aren’t anywhere near as choked-up as the bad old days, most people have suffered allergies or respiratory problems such as sinusitis, bronchitis, worsening asthma and generally feeling tired and icky. I try to keep my windows shut and limit the hours I wander around the city. It hit me how bad it was when I went on holiday to Costa Rica at Christmas after three weeks of feeling terrible (irritated eyes, breathing difficulties at night, annoying cough, sinusitis), and felt normal within 24 hours of arriving. Coming back, the plane passed through two layers of black polluted clouds, and the same symptoms returned the following day. Scary stuff. In response, the city government reintroduced no circular, effectively banning all cars on one weekday each week and one weekend each month. It’s unpopular and hasn’t worked, which experts say is largely because cars only produce 30% of hydrocarbons; industrial pollution hasn’t been tackled. There have been huge protests since the government imposed a 20% petrol tax on 1 January, but a few protesters I interviewed admitted that a positive consequence could be a reduction in cars. South Bronx: 11.55am OK, so the pollution readings near the highway fluctuated wildly – from 17 to 206, which is the level where they tell you to get inside and shut the windows. The problem was trucks: every time one would pass the meter would spike. Imagine living here and not being able to open your windows Conclusions? It’s hard to unbuild things. The Bronx was zoned so that industry, highways and residential structures are right on top of each other. And as the city’s population booms, you can bet that more people will be jammed into every corner, regardless of the air quality. Changing pollution and people’s proximity to it here would require a massive rethinking and rebuilding of urban infrastructure that’s unlikely to happen anytime soon. South Bronx: 11.45am Several people I’ve spoken with have thought about moving because of how bad the pollution is here. “I’m looking at moving back to Brooklyn,” says Dee Rivera, 33, who has lived in the Bronx for five years. She’s asthmatic; her friend who lives in her building has an asthmatic son. “It’s cleaner there. I don’t want my daughter [who is five] to develop asthma.” Amanda Hernandez, 23, fears the same thing. She has family in Florida and Pennsylvania. “You can tell the difference as soon as you land at the airport. You breathe the air here and it’s different. Dirty.” Bennett Andrew, 48, a cook at a French restaurant on the upper west side of Manhattan, has lived here seven years. He too is asthmatic: he developed it before moving to the Bronx but his attacks are triggered more frequently here. He lives next to the Bruckner Expressway, one of the huge highways rammed through the Bronx. “It’s really bad where I live. I don’t want to live like that.” He’s thinking of moving to Connecticut to get away from the pollution. My meter reading shows a respectable 25 (which is what I meant to say in the tweet) – but it’s windy, which reduces the stagnant pollution, and this reading isn’t close to the highways and trucking facilities. Going to go closer to those now, to see the difference ... Greetings from the South Bronx – a diverse, low-income area of New York City that some people call Asthma Alley. The Bronx has the second highest rate of asthma in the state – about 130 out of 1,000 130 out of 1,000 residents. Nearly 60 people die each year in the Bronx due to asthma-related health problems. The problem is racially stratified: whites experience a death rate about four times lower than Hispanic New Yorkers, and five times lower than black New Yorkers. One in four children is hospitalised for asthma. The main problem is trucks and cars. The South Bronx is surrounded by multiple highways that carry suburbanites into Manhattan during rush hour, and are the main arteries for trucks entering the city. A 2006 NYU study recommended curbing truck pollution, but officials nonetheless proposed tax breaks for a new facility for Fresh Direct, a food delivery company, that would add thousands more truck trips through the area in 2012. The community galvanised around blocking the Fresh Direct facility, holding protests and testifying at hearings, but it was built anyway. “You don’t have to look beyond this city to see that environmental racism is real,” activist Mychal Johnson said at the time. “In Brooklyn Heights, a fantastic public park sprung up along their waterfront overnight, but there’s not a single quality-of-life improvement project slated for the south Bronx. All we get is everyone’s garbage.” Rio de Janeiro: 2.20pm But that’s not to say the cariocas don’t still feel the ill effects of Rio’s air pollution. Welcome to Copacabana! It may be beloved by tourists from around the world, but today the beach resort has the worst levels of particulate matter in Rio de Janeiro. According to the latest readings from the municipal government’s 40 monitoring stations, Copacabana has 55.2 micrograms of PM10, which is likely to “cause coughs and weariness to people in sensitive groups”. Even so – as the blue skies overhead testify – this is an enviably low level compared to many of the world’s big cities, thanks to the sea breezes that disperse air pollution before it can build up. Officials say air quality in the city is generally “good”, though levels of PM10 and PM2.5 have increased in recent years. This is partly because of last year’s Olympic Games. Up until last August, a major pollution hotspot was the Olympic Park in Jacarepagua/Barra de Tijuca because the construction work on the stadiums generated enormous amounts of dust and traffic. Elsewhere, there are longer-term problems of sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone. Bangu – which is next to the busy Avenida Brasil and trapped between two ridges – usually has the worst overall air quality. On the worst days, this can reach extremely unhealthy levels and create a dirty “double horizon”. London: 3.40pm I spoke to some Londoners about the deteriorating air quality in their city. Spot the theme. No points for guessing what all these folk agree on. Hello from London, where the UK capital wondrously managed to breach its air pollution limit for all of 2017 in just the first five days of January. The Guardian offices are in Kings Cross, where the busy Euston road artery causes some of the city’s worst smog. We stepped out to take some readings in front of the train station. For the record, an AQI of 137 is “unhealthy for sensitive groups, including people with respiratory or heart disease, children and the elderly”. People are recommended to limit outdoor exertion. Let’s go find some. A question that keeps coming up across our air pollution coverage is what people can do to reduce air pollution. Experts Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King’s College London, and Claire Holman, chair of the Institute of Air Quality Management, have been online to help us out. Q: What’s the best thing we can do to reduce air pollution in cities? The main source of air pollution in urban areas is traffic, particularly diesel cars. The best way to improve air pollution would be to remove older diesel vehicles from the road. At an individual level, the choice of car is important, petrol cars are much cleaner than diesel cars, particularly regarding nitrogen oxide emissions. (Claire Holman) Q: Are there any bio-solutions people are considering to help clean up this pollution? (@katie_mayboyd) Planting trees can help reduce pollution, but its effectiveness depends on the pollutant and the species of tree. It is also important to consider the effect planting vegetation can have on the dispersion of traffic pollution. If poorly designed it can make the situation worst. (Claire Holman) Q: What impact do cookstoves have on air quality? There are many cookstove replacement programmes in place in developing countries that aim to reduce pollution. Although decreasing exposure to cooking emissions must be a good thing it is often difficult to demonstrate directly linked health effects because of other confounding pollution sources. (Frank Kelly) Q: What can and should local authorities do to enforce against wood burners, which breach the Clean Air Act? (@AQcouncillor) Wood burners sold in the UK should comply with legal requirements. If used in a smokeless zone, they need to be an exempt appliance and only burn the permitted fuel. This is difficult for local authorities to enforce, especially given their limited resources. However, there is a need for much greater public understanding of the health effects of domestic wood burning, and how to minimise emissions. Local authorities may have an important role with their Trading Standards Officers taking action against any illegal stoves being sold or fitted in smokeless zones. (Claire Holman) Air mask fashion: Gap meets Mad Max The Guardian’s online fashion editor, Morwenna Ferrier, is exploring the phenomenon of the fashion air mask for us. Here’s what she’s found so far. The market for pricier, soundly designed masks has been growing steadily in the past few years. Sales are not notable but Freka, a British brand, had the monopoly for a while. And rightly so given that they tapped into the trend for minimal sportswear, almost Céline like in design, seeking to become more of a background accessory than anything standout. Which sets the Airinum M90 – launching today, entirely by coincidence – apart. While the design is typically Scandinavian design, these face masks are neon camo. As for the fashion appraisal, trad camo is having a moment – particularly in menswear. But neon camo, nothing short of an eyesore, is unchartered territory. It’s also oxymoronic. But that’s the point: if the aim is to raise awareness of the problem then it’s unlikely you’ll miss one of these on the street. As Beijing prepares itself for another week of heavy smog, Chinese cities have been told to coordinate efforts to reduce airborne pollutants, according to Reuters In contrast, Greenpeace East Asia has a new report out about China’s steel capacity, which grew in 2016 despite promises to cut excess capacity in the sector. “Global markets are awash with steel and the people of northern China continue to choke on the industry’s major byproduct, smog,” says Lauri Myllyvirta, Greenpeace global coal campaigner. In the UK, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas has been commenting on the need to transpose more than 1,100 EU environmental laws, ranging from air pollution limits to energy efficiency, into UK law. A new report [pdf] by Lucas – called Exiting the EU, Not the Environment – is out today. Air pollution experts Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King’s College London, and Claire Holman, chair of the Institute of Air Quality Management, are here today to take your questions. Holman responds: The main emissions of concern for health are particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). PM emissions have been cut dramatically from newer diesel vehicles by fitting diesel particle filters. For NOx, the use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) has reduced emissions from the most recent diesel cars – but they still remain higher when driven on the road than when tested in the laboratory tests used in the legislation. It is likely that a combination of technologies will be needed to make diesel car NOx emission as low as those from petrol cars. This will include the use of SCR with lean NOx traps. Kelly responds: Plants, like ourselves, are sensitive to pollutants in the air. Our cities are not polluted enough to stop plants surviving, but like us they probably do not live as long as they could do. Plants are particularly sensitive to ozone pollution and in many warm countries crop yields are affected.” Holman responds: Local authorities are already required to review and assess air quality in their areas, and declare an “air quality management area” (AQMA) if concentrations exceed the air-quality objectives. Where an AQMA is declared, local authorities must prepare an action plan. Most local authorities already monitor air pollution in their areas; however, with the current pressure on resources, many local authorities have cut back their monitoring. They need to do more, not less – but to do so they need more money. The air in Lagos today? Not good. A reading of 178 is classified as “unhealthy ... reduced outdoor activity for everyone”. Nor is it much better in Port Harcourt. Soot has enveloped the city for about a month now, as panic-stricken residents wake up to a black sky and black dust on plants, cars, and rooftops. The soot is being blamed on carbon emissions from an asphalt plant that was only just shut down two days ago. The images are grim. Shabi Adebola is the general manager of the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (Lasepa). He says the government is well aware of the effects of transportation and industrial activities on Lagos, and is doing all it can to keep the air clean. “The Lagos of today is a far cry from what it was decades ago. There is an obvious improvement when it comes to environmental issues,” he said. He confirmed that the state government has recently begun vehicle emission tests. It’s a start. At the very busy scrap market at Ladipo, Mushin, I meet Ayelumosi packing waste from the road side. Ayelumosi works for the Lagos Waste Management‎ Authority, and comes in contact with dirt and rubbish on a daily basis. “Whenever I don’t have my nose mask on, I feel a tingling sensation in my chest. But when I do have it on, I fare OK,” she says. Asked how she copes with handling waste on a daily basis, she says it is a means of livelihood that she has to put up with. Hello from Lagos! On my commute to work three days ago, I sat seething in a commercial bus as it crawled slowly behind a degenerating rapid transit bus whose exhaust pipes were billowing black dense clouds of smoke. We had been behind the bus for about five minutes. I watched irritably as the driver ignored every opportunity to switch lanes and save us from inhaling the toxic air. Sadly, this is typical in Nigeria’s largest city. If you are lucky enough to escape choking on your commute, the fumes from your neighbour’s power generators are bound to get you. As an industrial hub and commercial powerhouse, Africa’s fastest-growing metropolis is plagued by transportation, power, housing and pollution issues. Providing more than 50% of all manufacturing employment in Nigeria, the rapid pace of industrialisation here is both a blessing and a curse. And apart from the more obvious sources of air pollution – power generators, industrial emissions and car exhaust – other sources include dumpsites, landfills, random waste/bush burning, and open incinerators. With London breaking air pollution records last month, Amy Fleming rounded up some of the best advice for what, exactly, you can do to protect yourself during a peak pollution alert. Hot tip? Eat vegetables, walk one street back ... and pray for rain. Readers have also been feeding in from around Britain today. General consensus: it’s a high-pollution day. Break out the broccoli. For those of you looking to help, meanwhile, Defra is hosting an #AirHack in Leeds on 24-25 February at ODI Leeds, 3rd Floor, Munro House LS9 8AG. This two-day event explores the problems, the data and the solutions to air pollution, and is looking for “anyone and everyone, no matter what your background or level of experience with data. You don’t need to be a computer wizard to take part. You can get as much done with pens and post-its as you can with a computer.” Well, except a scintillating liveblog. I’d like to see them do this with Post-Its. (I really would.) Manchester is in the middle of a construction boom. Cranes pierce the horizon and the sound of hammering and drilling fills the air. Outside the Guardian’s office on Deansgate, one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares, workmen are re-laying the pavement, as demolition experts ready the neighbouring building for the wrecking ball. But while all this may be good for cementing Manchester as the heart of the so-called “northern powerhouse”, it is rather less good for our lungs. I just took a Node reading outside as one of the allegedly low-carbon metroshuttle buses trundled past, and was alarmed to be advised against prolonged outdoor activity: an AQI reading of 122, suggesting that sensitive groups, such as asthma sufferers, should limit outdoor exertion. The level of PM2.5 fine particle emissions was also worryingly high: 44 micrograms per cubic metre, which can cause harm for people with respiratory or heart disease, the elderly and children. Deansgate isn’t even that busy today, as it’s half-term. But local leaders are starting to seriously worry about the air Mancunians breathe, with much of it breaching legal limits. Later today, Andy Burnham, the Labour MP hoping to be the first elected mayor of Greater Manchester, launches “a major new drive” to clean it up. Day 1 of The Air We Breathe, our special weeklong investigation into air pollution, has also featured some in-depth reporting from our correspondents on the front lines of this needlessly lethal crisis. Here are some of the highlights so far. ... and a brilliant video by Michael Safi and Atish Patel, who strapped a monitor to a rickshaw to test how dangerous Delhi’s notoriously poor air really is.

These past few posts have painted a grim picture of Delhi, but some air quality advocates feel hopeful. Sarath Guttikunda runs UrbanEmissions, an air-quality research hub. “Progress is being made in bits and pieces, and compared to five years ago, there’s a lot more awareness and a much bigger push for clear air.” By way of examples, he mentions upgraded car-emissions standards passed by the Indian government last year, and a 2015 order that coal-fired power stations must be fitted with equipment that drastically reduces waste. India has also set an extraordinarily ambitious renewable energy target, and floated the possibility it may not need to build any new coal power stations for the next 10 years (though it has a number of new stations in the pipeline). “At least the intention is there, there is some pressure,” Guttikunda says. “Now there’s something to ask for.” But the gap between promises and the reality remains large. The equipment that will reduce emissions from coal-fired power stations was supposed to be fitted nationwide by the end of 2017. Last week, India media reported that not a single power station complies with the new standards – and that the standards themselves might have been diluted behind the scenes. The above picture shows Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, as tall buildings disrupt natural ventilation patterns between the surrounding mountains, thus trapping pollution. More than 80% of air pollution in the city is caused by vehicle traffic. Large-scale illegal logging has only helped to worsen local air quality. What’s air pollution like in your city? Share your experiences using the form on this page. Here are a few stories we’ve received so far: Iris, age 10, Beijing, China We have been learning about air pollution in school. I have to wear a mask to school and we are not allowed outside for recess and PE. Even some days it is so bad we don’t have school, which I was happy about! Recently the school introduced an air cleaning system. The big problem for me is that I worry about my health in the future, as I don’t know what damage the air pollution is really doing I hope the government can stop people driving petrol cars and the factoies can use cleaner energy.” (shared by Mr Ashley, BIBS international school) Muhammad Faique, Lahore, Pakistan Every day when I come home from work I have to sit in the traffic and breathe in large amounts of petrol and diesel. After returning home when I spit out into my basin I can clearly see the black spots in it. My hair and beard gets full of dust, I look like I’m a construction worker. Every second week I get a bad chesty cough. Most of the street food being sold in the city is full of air pollution.” Luigi Baro, Santiago, Chile In winter air pollution gets so bad that the city of Santiago created an app showing the daily air quality. When it’s really bad, schools are told to keep students from sport and outdoor activities. Apparently air pollution is worse when the national team plays. That is because of the custom of asados, social BBQs, taking place.” Are you involved in improving air quality in your city?

Peak-hour traffic will be starting to surge now, and with it, levels of air pollution in Delhi. Here’s a read from an air quality monitor near my office, a comparatively greener neighbourhood where rates are probably better than in the city’s older, or more heavily trafficked districts. The air might look pretty clear – but the level of PM2.5 pollution the monitor is showing increases my risk of developing a chronic obstructive lung disease by 41%, of lung cancer by 27%, and nearly doubles my risk of heart disease and stroke, according to research from the Global Burden of Disease project. Below, on the right, is the reading from Anand Vihar, an area of Delhi where traffic is likely to be very heavy right now. That’s an Air Quality Index score of 171 and a PM2.5 level of 78. Sitting in that stew causes a 95% increase in the risk of heart disease, and a 135% jump in the risk of stroke. A reader has suggested we look at another south Asian capital, Kathmandu, which gets comparatively less publicity, but endures pollution levels as high as many north Indian cities. We had a look at air pollution in Kathmandu a little while ago through eyes of Andrew Lodge, a doctor at a teaching hospital in the city. He wrote: Nepal generally evokes images of a pristine mountain nation on top of the world. The thick cloud of pollution that threatens to suffocate Nepal’s largest city, however, provides a stark contrast to this reputation. While there are several environmental crises converging here – severe water shortages, for instance, have become status quo – none is as dire as air quality. In the past 10 years, the number of vehicles on Kathmandu’s streets has risen threefold. The problem has become so acute that many of its 1.74 million residents are left wondering: at what point will their city become unliveable? Delhi residents on Twitter are sharing their experiences of pollution in the city. If you’re on Twitter, add to the conversation – tag @GuardianCities or #GuardianCities I went for a wander about an hour ago to speak to Delhi residents who make their living outside, such as petrol pump workers, chai-wallahs and bicycle rickshaw drivers. Air pollution might be well understood in cities such as Beijing, but awareness in the Indian capital is generally limited to the city’s middle classes. Masks are rare and many people told me they didn’t notice any problems – though of course damage is being done.

Post them in the comments below and our air pollution experts will be live between 1-3pm GMT to answer them. The people who probably bear the brunt of Delhi’s poor air are its fleet of auto-rickshaw drivers. To get a sense of the levels to which they’re exposed each day, we stuck a small air-quality monitor on a rickshaw belonging to Suresh Sharma, who plies his trade across south Delhi. See the results for yourself: Keep in mind, a safe AQI is anything below 50. Sharma spends the day breathing air that is three times that limit – at one point, at least 500. Here’s another way of visualising the extent of Delhi’s pollution problem. For those few who can afford it, one way to minimise – though not eliminate – the amount of toxic air one breathes is by installing air purifiers in the house. Filters need to be changed regularly, which makes for a sobering sight. Here is what my filter looked like after five months in Delhi. That’s a fresh filter on the left for comparison. Hello from Delhi, the capital of India, and one-time “most polluted city in the world”. As we’ve already reported, that unenviable title now belongs to Onitsha, a tropical port city in Nigeria – but Indians aren’t celebrating yet. According to the WHO, half of the world’s 20 most-polluted cities are in India, starting with Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, and Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. The rankings have helped to drive a growing awareness in India that air pollution is not confined to its smoggy capital. The proliferation of coal-fired power stations, brick kilns, crop burning and other pollution sources across northern India have made it so not a single city in the entire region meets international air quality standards, according to a report from Greenpeace. Delhi is where the problem gets most attention though, and pictures of the haze that settled on the city after Diwali in November last year were broadcast around the world. The city government labelled the toxic air an “emergency” and ordered immediate action, including temporarily closing schools and construction sites. It helped clear the immediate spike in pollution, but longer-term steps are still urgently needed. Fun fact: according to one reader in China, smog is now referred to as “the weather” (!)

Post them in the comments below and our air pollution experts will be live between 1-3pm GMT to answer them. Despite the above tweet, it’s actually a lovely fresh afternoon in Beijing after a day of smog on Sunday – as our Node air pollution monitor attests. (An AQI reading of 27 is well within the “good” range.) But the pollution is expected to roll back in later as smog covers large parts of north China. Nevertheless, for all of the bad press about Beijing’s toxic “airpocalypses”, there is definitely hope for the Chinese capital and its nearly 22 million residents. Recent years have seen city authorities start to take action – largely as a result of growing public awareness and pressure – forcing factories to close and dirty vehicles off the roads. Red alerts are now declared each time a really foul bout of smog envelops the city in a bid to reduce the pollution levels. Some believe the central government’s attempts to transition the Chinese economy away from heavy industry are also having an impact. While huge problems remain, “air pollution has improved a lot in the last three years,” says Anders Hove, a clean energy expert from the Paulson Institute who is based in the Chinese capital. Naaman Zhou spoke to locals in Sydney this evening Jess works at the University of New South Wales, and says she keeps an eye on the air quality most days, especially when there are health warnings. “My son is three and has bad asthma, so I’m very aware of air quality. When we had those dust storms, that was really bad. We were warned over the weekend that the air quality wasn’t going to be very good, so we paid attention and kept him indoors.” Cassie is a cyclist who has stopped at the station mid-ride. “Because I’ve lived in the country and cycle a lot on roads, I reckon I just block it out”, she says. “But if I was taking a deep breath now, I probably wouldn’t enjoy it. I probably just take shorter breaths” However, she says she doesn’t notice the symptoms of pollution, even when riding through tunnels. “Sometimes if there’s a bushfire, you notice there’s a bit of haze in the air. But compared to other countries I’d definitely say Sydney has good air quality.” Wang Zhen from our Beijing office has been out talking to the city’s residents about how the smog affects their lives. Gao Yuhang, 28, works for a media firm that is located between Beijing’s second and third ring roads. This is one of the city’s most polluted areas, particularly during rush hour. “I get in such bad moods on smoggy days,” complains Gao. She is increasingly afraid about opening her windows when the smog strikes. “I feel I am losing out by living in such a big city, with no blue sky, where the traffic doesn’t run smoothly and the cost of living is so high,” Gao says. “I’m not a mum yet, but lots of my friends have children and are concerned about their kids’ health.” Zhu Jianchao, a 19-year-old student, likes to practice martial arts in the morning in Ritan Park, not far from the second ring road. He says he keeps training outdoors even when the smog rolls in. “My breathing is certainly affected, but not that much,” says Zhu, who often brings his 11-year-old sister along with him to train. Wang Weibang, in his early 70, is more cautious. He has been coming to the same park each morning for nearly a decade to practice tai chi. But when he looks out of his window in the morning and can’t see the tall buildings because of the smog, he stays at home. “When the smog is only light, I’ll come to the park.” At Sydney’s Central station, commuters pile into trains, wait for buses, and some hop on bikes they’ve left in nearby Albion Park. On our Node reader, which measures PM2.5 fine particle emissions, the reading here in the middle of the city never deviated much from 4 micrograms per cubic metre, which places it quite squarely at a safe level. The highest readings ever in Sydney were 33 micrograms, in the suburb of Rozelle, but today, at the end of a weekend heatwave that record remains intact. National health standards take 8 micrograms to be a safe national limit, and on most days, city-wide, Sydney is well within that. Toxic air is a major cause of heart attacks, strokes and lung diseases – the causes that are put in death certificates. But researchers are finding ever more varied and worrying impacts of breathing noxious air. Air pollution has now been linked to increased mental illness, diabetes and kidney disease, and toxic nanoparticles have been recently discovered in brains, suggesting a link to degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s. It is even thought to be prematurely ageing the faces of city dwellers, by accelerating wrinkles and age spots. But perhaps the most worrying impacts are on children, whose lung development is stunted and whose intelligence can be reduced. Unicef found recently that 300 million children live in areas with extreme air pollution – six times higher than international guidelines – and that almost 90% of the world’s children live in places where outdoor air pollution exceeds World Health Organization limits. Thanks largely to heavy industry belching out pollutants in the region around Beijing, China’s capital has a big, big smog problem – as this incredible time-lapse video from last month shows. When I set off from my house (which is just below the bottom of this image) on the day this footage was shot, it was a glorious winter morning in Beijing. By the time I’d reached the middle of the image, the city was enveloped in a nicotine-shaded haze that made the air taste like paint. When Beijing’s smog is at its worst, schools are forced to close, flights are unable to land at its airports and emergency rooms fill up with young children and elderly residents suffering from respiratory problems caused by dangerous levels of particulate matter. Across China hundreds of thousands of premature deaths are blamed on pollution each year. Three years ago China’s prime minister Li Keqiang vowed to declare war on pollution with authorities vowing to rid Beijing of its smog just as London did after the Great Smog of 1952. But real change is likely to take many, many years. Today, Guardian Cities kicks off a week to exploring one of the worst preventable causes of death around the world: air pollution. Dirty air kills 3.3 million people every year – more than HIV, malaria and influenza combined. Indoor pollution claims roughly the same number again. Most of these deaths happen in cities, where automobile exhaust, factories and power plants, and coal and wood fires for heating and cooking are among the deadliest culprits. Over the course of this day, Guardian foreign correspondents will report live from the worst-off cities, from Delhi to Beijing to Lagos. We’re also be joined by experts who can answer your questions. And we’ll give tips on how to minimise your risk, rate the best anti-smog devices and learn how some cities are innovating to fight back. Plus, we’ll take a live air-pollution reading from every city, using an AirVisual Node air pollution monitor. We’d love to hear from you, too. How does air pollution impact your daily life?

A letter sent to all parents of secondary schoolchildren in the Liberal Democrat-controlled borough of Sutton, south-west London, states: “The future looks bleak. Next year means more expenses for schools. Inflation is increasing too. Local authority cuts mean that schools are expected to do more with less.” The letter explains the cause of budget pressures the schools face and criticises the government and Department for Education’s claims to have protected “core schools funding” with record levels of funding nationally. “Schools will have to consider fewer teachers, larger classes, less choice, less support for students and families, fewer opportunities, trips or co-curricular activities. In some areas of the country, schools are already cutting school hours. Others are suggesting a four-day week to reduce staffing demand and utility bills,” the letter tells parents. The schools are unhappy at Sutton council proposals to slice 0.5% off funds it currently devolves to secondary and primary schools. That would come on top of reductions in funding for sixth-form education by central government, cuts in education services grants, and increases in wages, national insurance and pension contributions to be paid by schools. Nathan Cole, the headteacher of Wilson’s school in Wallington, said the Sutton schools felt parents were not getting enough information on the budget pressures and facts about government funding. “The secondary schools of Sutton, who work in partnership, felt that it was in the public interest that the reality be known,” Cole said after the letter was distributed on Friday. “We are close to crisis,” the letter concludes, adding: “Headteachers are not known for their militancy. However, this information, sent to all parents of secondary age children in the London borough of Sutton, is a cry for help. “We need you to help us signal to local and central government that school funding is in crisis. They are not listening to us and we hope they might instead listen to you. “We would not contact you in this way if the situation wasn’t desperate. Please take a little time to draft an email or a letter to those who you have elected to speak on your behalf and encourage all you know, in whichever part of the country, to do the same.” The letter is similar to others being drawn up around England, with schools increasingly asking parents for contributions, in some cases to pay for core items such as textbooks and classroom supplies. A report by the National Audit Office said schools face cuts of 8% in real terms by 2019-20, while the government’s new funding formula is viewed with increasing scepticism by backbench Tory MPs alarmed that schools in their constituencies will fail to benefit or, in many cases, even lose funding. Grammar schools have also campaigned against the formula, and an increasing number are asking parents for regular donations amounting to £600 a year. In a further sign of problems ahead for the government, the usually moderate Association of School and College Leaders announced that a veteran headteacher, Geoff Barton, was elected as its new general secretary in a landslide victory, after campaigning to aggressively fight the government’s funding policies. The DfE responded that spending on schools was nominally at the highest level on record. “The government has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, but the system for distributing that funding across the country is unfair, opaque and outdated,” a spokesperson said. “It is based on patchy and inconsistent decisions that have built up over many years and on data that is over a decade old. We are going to end the historic postcode lottery in school funding.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2017/feb/11/arsenal-v-hull-city-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-11T14:37:58Z","webTitle":"Arsenal 2-0 Hull City: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/feb/11/arsenal-v-hull-city-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/feb/11/arsenal-v-hull-city-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal 2-0 Hull City: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"Welbeck tries to put a sick twist on the scoreline from 12 yards, but screws his shot wide right. And that’s that! Arsenal make off with the three points, but they made hard work of that. Fortune smiled on them, too: Sanchez’s opener went in accidentally off his own hand, Gibbs could easily have seen red, and the Clucas incident wasn’t the most egregious of handballs. But you have to take your chances when they come, and Arsenal and Sanchez did exactly that. They go third, with a result that should change the mood music around the club ahead of some big games. Hull meanwhile stay in the relegation zone, but if they keep playing like this, they’ll stay up. That was a very entertaining match, from which both teams can take succour. And in it goes, slapped into the bottom left! Clucas hangs out an arm, stopping the ball on the line. He’s sent off, though given how Arsenal scored their goal, that will hurt because he didn’t make a huge movement towards the ball. Anyway, off he goes. Sanchez will take the spot kick. 90 min: Robertson turns on the jets down the left, and earns a corner. Clucas takes. There’s a stramash in the Arsenal box. The ball’s raked clear. Sanchez is sent clear into acres down the left. Jakupovic races out of his area. Sanchez rounds him on the left, then sends a deep cross into the centre for Lucas, who heads goalwards from six yards. And then... 88 min: Arsenal make a rare excursion into the Hull final third. Lucas throws a cross-cum-shot in from the right. Jakupovic punches clear with great uncertainty. But there are no red-and-white shirts on hand to take advantage. Hull clear. 87 min: On the touchline, Marco Silva is doing quite a lot of loud shouting. Some semaphore shapes, too. He’ll be of the opinion that his team deserve to be level, I’ll be bound. He’s probably got a case. But his lads are running out of time. 86 min: Markovic earns a corner off Welbeck, near the right-hand corner flag. Evandro hits it deep. Diomande rises miles above Bellerin on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. He should at least plant a header on target; he probably should score. But he sends the ball sailing miles over the bar. Arsenal with a serious let-off there. 84 min: Markovic, making a nuisance of himself on the left, bustles hither and yon but can’t quite break through. Hull win a free kick out on the other flank. Ranocchia meets it with a header from the edge of the area, but can’t generate any power. 82 min: Arsenal make a double swap. Iwobi and Oxlade-Chamberlain make way for Welbeck and Lucas Perez. 81 min: Hull have enjoyed 77% of possession during the last five minutes. Arsene Wenger, up in the stands, is fidgeting quite a lot in his seat. 79 min: Markovic slips a ball down the right for the overlapping Elmohamady, who earns a corner off Iwobi. The set piece is whipped hard and fast to Niasse at the near post. Niasse flashes a header into the side netting, with some power. Out-of-form Arsenal are beginning to retreat into their shell. The last ten minutes are suddenly a fingernail-bothering prospect for the Emirates faithful. 78 min: Diomande comes on for Huddlestone. 77 min: Hull come back at Arsenal after a quiet few minutes. Arsenal half-clear an Elmohamady cross from the right. Maguire swings it into the mixer again from the other flank. Markovic, ten yards out, tries to steer a header into the top left, but doesn’t generate much power and Cech gathers. But the crowd are getting nervous again. 76 min: Sanchez, looking to beat Ranocchia on the right, dives over the defender’s hanging leg and is booked for simulation. He can have no complaints. But he makes one anyway. 75 min: N’Diaye drops a shoulder and powers down the inside-right channel, winning a free kick off Koscielny. It’s a chance for Hull to load the box. Evandro takes the set piece, and finds Maguire at the far post. But the big defender has mistimed his jump, and lets the ball skim off the top of his noggin and harmlessly out for a goal kick. 72 min: Arsenal have shifted up a gear here, and are pinging the ball around in a very determined style. Hull are on the back foot. 71 min: Ozil sends Sanchez scampering down the left with the most delicate of passes. Sanchez earns a corner, from which Mustafi clumps a header harmlessly wide of the target. 70 min: Ranocchia is rightly booked for standing clumsily on Sanchez’s foot. 69 min: Theo ‘Just Let Me At ‘Im’ Walcott is replaced by Elneny. 67 min: Elmohamady comes on for Elabdellaoui. 66 min: Robertson cuts in from the left before sliding the ball inside for N’Diaye. He’s got Markovic in space on the right, but goes for the big blooter towards the top right instead. From the best part of 30 yards, that’s ambitious. And way off target. 63 min: Markovic opens his legs and zips down the right. His low cross, aimed for Niasse in the middle, is intercepted by a sliding Koscielny. A goal-saving tackle. It leads to a corner, from which nothing comes. It’s not easy to predict who’ll be scoring next. But it’ll be a surprise if this game ends 1-0. 62 min: It’s end-to-end fun. Sanchez has the chance to send Gibbs clear down the right but misplaces his crossfield pass; Robertson overhits a through ball that would have seen Evandro free in the Arsenal box down the right. 61 min: Evandro comes on for Grosicki, who started brilliantly before fading. 60 min: Iwobi attempts to recreate Demarai Gray’s solo effort for Leicester against Derby in the week. He gives up on the dribble down the inside-left channel, one-twos with Ozil, and overcoooks a curler towards the top right. Neat play, mind. 59 min: Markovic has looked good this afternoon. Aren’t Liverpool looking for a winger? 57 min: There’s a pleasing febrile atmosphere at the Emirates now. Hull fans will feel hard done by; Arsenal’s know this game isn’t over yet, and are urging their team forward for what would surely be a decisive second. It’s an entertaining match. 55 min: The resulting free kick comes to nothing. 54 min: Kieran Gibbs is very fortunate not to see red here. A long hoick down the middle is met by Markovic, who would be clear with one touch. But he’s barged off the ball illegally by Gibbs. The referee only shows yellow, which is questionable to say the least. Anyway, that’s a big decision by Mark Clattenburg, and for the second time today Arsenal benefit from the rub of the green. 52 min: Theo Walcott loses the place completely. He’s ushered out of play down the right, Maguire shepherding the ball away for a goal kick. Walcott wants a corner, and throws the ball away with theatrical annoyance. He’s going to get booked for that, for sure, but beforehand he faces up to Maguire in the physical style. It’s a mismatch, really, and Maguire seems highly amused. It’s reminiscent of Lallana v Toure at last year’s League Cup final. Some light relief. 51 min: Markovic turns on the jets and sprints past Koscielny down the right. His cross finds Niasse on the penalty spot. The striker swivels and batters a shot towards the right-hand side of the goal. Cech parries around the post brilliantly. Hull so close to the equaliser. The resulting corner comes to nought. 50 min: Otherwise, a subdued start to the second 45. Huddlestone has a chance to send Grosicki into acres down the left, but his crossfield rake doesn’t have enough on it. 48 min: Ah, that might just have been a dead leg. It looked quite serious for a minute, and Elneny was warming up vigorously, but he’s going to try to run it off. Elneny stands down. 46 min: Within 18 seconds of the restart, Oxlade-Chamberlain strides forward with extreme prejudice and slaps a shot wide left from 25 yards. Jakupovic ushers it wide. But at the start of the move, Coquelin stretched out a leg to challenge N’Diaye, and took a whack on the knee. He’s also holding his thigh. He looks in some discomfort. So we’re off again! Arsenal get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. “The problem with Arsenal is they always try to palm it in,” quips Henry Stennett. Curtis Davies of Hull City is in the Sky studio, and here’s his admirably mature take on the Sanchez goal: “We’re disappointed obviously. If it goes in against you, you’re devastated. But if it happens down the other end, and it happens to Niasse, and comes off his hand and goes in, I’m celebrating like no-one else.” Half-time reading: It’s fair to say Sanchez’s goal won’t go down in Arsenal history. Here’s one that did, though. Hull earn a free kick out on the right. A chance to load the box. Bellerin clears the up-and-under easily enough. Sanchez goes up the other end and earns a free kick of his own, but there’s barely time to take it before the whistle blows. The teams traipse off to the changing rooms, Arsenal deservedly leading albeit in a slightly strange and fortunate manner, Sanchez’s close-range shot innocently ricocheting in off his own arm. 44 min: Markovic, out on the right, hits a deep, deep, deep cross. It looks like it’s going out of play, but it’s trapped brilliantly on the line by the impressive Grosicki. He earns a corner off Bellerin. Arsenal are then fortunate that Hull balls up their quick set piece, because they were sleeping as a defensive unit. 42 min: This half is petering out a little. Both teams sharing possession in the middle third. Arsenal seem happy enough to take what they have to the break. Hull probably aren’t too upset either; they’ve shown some promise up front and aren’t out of this by any means. 39 min: No doubt there will be some confected controversy surrounding Sanchez’s goal. People gettin’ angry. But aren’t you so tired of it all? It’s old hat. 37 min: That’s settled the home crowd a bit; they’ve found their voice. Whether it’s settled Arsenal or not is a moot point: they allow Grosicki, from the left, then Markovic, from the right, to hoick crosses into their area. Niasse’s nowhere to be seen, and Cech eventually steps in to gather. This had been coming. Though what a scrappy affair this is. Gibbs, to the left of goal, takes a shot in a crowded area. It’s blocked by Robertson on the line. The ball breaks to Sanchez, who bundles it over from a couple of yards. On second viewing, his shot rears up off Jakupovic, hits his arm accidentally, and goes into the net. Shades of Arsenal’s winner at Burnley, and a huge stroke of luck for the home side. But on balance they deserve their lead. 33 min: A good old-fashioned stramash in the Hull area finishes as a Walcott snap-shot from 12 yards is blocked by Clucas. That hit Clucas’s hand, but it wasn’t deliberate - close range, back turned, all that - and Arsenal aren’t getting the decision. Then Arsenal come again, through Oxlade-Chamberlain, who scoops into the box. Maguire sends a bullet header towards his own goal, and he breathes again as Jakupovic claims! 31 min: Gibbs tears into acres of space down the left. But with team-mates in the Hull box, he allows himself to be stripped of possession by the backtracking Markovic. The home side are beginning to seriously dominate now. 29 min: Jakupovic miscontrols a simple backpass, and the ball very nearly squirts into the empty net. He tracks back and hacks clear. Arsenal, one way or another, should be ahead on the balance of play. 27 min: Arsenal force a corner down the left. From the set piece, Oxlade-Chamberlain, on the edge of the D, wedges a pass down the inside-right channel for Sanchez, who tries to steer the ball into the top left. Jakupovic parries clear, and the offside flag goes up anyway. 25 min: After a period of the old sterile possession, Arsenal work a bit of space down the left, Sanchez scooping a ball into the box, Ozil contorting on the penalty spot to volley high and wide left. That wasn’t too far away, though, and would have been picture-book had it wheeched into the net. Arsenal might not be playing with supreme confidence, but they’re still not far away from serving up some aesthetic delights. 22 min: The first lull of the match. The crowd respond in kind. It’s very flat. And quite a few of those seats remain empty. Meanwhile here’s the very reverend Mike Gibbons: “The managers here have copped the full range of diabolical football opinion lately. Silva was on the end of that ill-informed, hot-faced bluster of Paul Merson and Phil Thompson, while the canteen food throwing of Arsenal fan TV sparked that tedious cyber spat between Gary Neville and Henry Winter this week. Long may they both run, thumbing their nose at their detractors and dismissing the above for the white noise it is.” Keep on preachin’, brother. 20 min: Hull push Arsenal back a bit, with Grosicki showing a lot on the left. The home fans aren’t particularly pleased with what they’re seeing. 18 min: Both teams are looking to ping the ball around at speed, and to feet. This has been a very entertaining match so far. All it needs is a goal. 16 min: Even closer! The busy Oxlade-Chamberlain bustles into the Hull box from the right. He loses control but the ball breaks to Sanchez, level with the right-hand post, 12 yards out. Sanchez takes a touch to the left, and he’s clear on the penalty spot! But as he continues to move left, his attempt to reverse a low shot into the bottom right flies inches wide! He really should have scored then, though it’d have been a lovely goal had he done so. 15 min: This is much better from Arsenal! A crisp one-two between Oxlade-Chamberlain and Bellerin sets the latter free into the area down the right. His fierce shot only just misses the right-hand post. Close! 14 min: Grosicki is found in acres of space on the left. With the outside of his boot, he curls a gorgeous cross to the far post for Niasse, who rises and sends a fine header towards the top right. It’s flying in, but Cech claws it away for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but Hull are playing with confidence here. Arsenal, not so much. “In the way that eskimos are reputed to have 20 words for snow, does Arsene have 20 words for Top Four?” wonders Gary Naylor. Variations on Round of 16 are also available. 11 min: Niasse feeds Robertson into space down the left, the full back eating up the turf at speed. His cross isn’t so hot, though, and once again Arsenal escape while light at the back. The home crowd, who started out in good voice, are already a bit nervous and flat. 9 min: OK, well, good luck calling this one. Markovic robs Iwobi in the centre circle, then tears off down the right. He makes it all the way into the Arsenal box, and cuts a ball across the six-yard area. Niasse must score - think Paul Gascoigne in the Euro 96 semis - but he fails to stick a boot out, and Arsenal survive. 8 min: A little period of digging in might be an idea, though. First a loose pass from Huddlestone sets Arsenal on the attack, Ozil’s shot from the inside-left channel blocked at source. Then a loose Clucas header sets Sanchez scampering forward, but the striker’s shot is soft and straight at Jakupovic. 6 min: Markovic wins a corner down the right for Hull, from which nothing occurs. But it’s proof that the visitors haven’t just turned up with defence in mind. 5 min: It looks as though plenty of those empty seats are filling up. Hard to say for sure from afar, of course, and it’s certainly not a full house. But there we are. 3 min: ... Coquelin swings a peg wildly from the edge of the area. Goal kick, and three of your Six Nations points. 2 min: A nice, lively start. Ozil has a run at Hull’s back line. Then Grosicki has a gander up the Hull left. Finally Ozil makes a royal nuisance of himself, dribbling along the byline to the right of the Hull goal. His scampering, along with the presence of Sanchez, forces a corner. From which... And we’re off! Hull get the ball rolling, Niasse kicking off. An aimless punt upfield, and the ball’s lost within the first ten seconds. Arsenal take the chance to stroke it around the back awhile, giving their entire back line a feel of the ball. The home fans giving it plenty. The ones who are here, that is: quite a few empty seats in the stands, with some talk of stay-away protest in the air. Let’s see if they fill up. The teams are out! Arsenal sport their best Herbert Chapman designer duds, while Hull City eschew their usual neat Tiger stripes for an equally tidy all-back affair. There’s an anticipatory crackle down Ashburton Grove way, the home fans having waited a long, long week to see how their team responds to that Watford-Chelsea double whammy. The Hull team, to a man, stride out with purpose. Whatever happens, this is unlikely to be dull. We’ll be off in a minute! That’s all the team news. Now over to Yoko for the weather. It’s not settling, though. Arsene Wenger talks! And he does so to Arsenal Fan Sky TV. “Gibbs is a tactical switch, to face Grosicki. It should be a good battle. We are positive, but of course we have to respond to our last two results, and there is only one way to do that, and it’s on the pitch. It’s important to have the crowd behind us, but to be honest that has to come from our dynamic, our commitment, our desire; if we show that, the crowd will be behind us. I am upbeat. I love to win, and the next game is always the opportunity to do that.” Marco Silva speaks! And he does so in a slow, calm, measured, confident manner. “The Liverpool game is the past. Of course it was a fantastic win for us, and the three points were important for our team. But it’s a new week, and a new match, and we need to be ready for the sure tough, tough game for us. The players are ready to do what I want for this match. At the moment we only have two centre backs, but I have clever players, Tom Huddlestone is a clever player, and it is possible to do two systems. Arsenal’s problems are not important for us. We respect them, they are a good team, we have to do our best. It is normal they feel pressure, but we feel pressure, that is football. We will show good organisation and spirit, and enjoy the match.” Arsenal make one change from the starting XI at Stamford Bridge last weekend. Kieran Gibbs comes in for Nacho Monreal. Hull City meanwhile make two swaps from the team that beat Liverpool last Saturday. Lazar Markovic and Oumar Niasse step up, Abel Hernandez and Evandro Goebel step down. Arsenal: Cech, Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Gibbs, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Coquelin, Walcott, Ozil, Iwobi, Sanchez. Subs: Gabriel, Lucas Perez, Giroud, Ospina, Monreal, Welbeck, Elneny. Hull City: Jakupovic, Elabdellaoui, Ranocchia, Maguire, Robertson, Huddlestone, N’Diaye, Markovic, Grosicki, Clucas, Niasse. Subs: Meyler, Maloney, Diomande, Marshall, Elmohamady, Tymon, Evandro. Referee: Mark Clattenburg (Tyne &amp; Wear). ... and welcome to our coverage of a Premier League match between two clubs currently failing to keep their fanbases completely content. Just look at this ... ... then read this! Arsenal could still, in theory at least, win a treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League. Well, y’know. But all Hull have to play for is Premier League survival. And yet the team in 18th spot is currently in a better mental place than the one up in fourth. Arsenal have lost their last two Premier League matches, against Watford and Chelsea, their dreams of a 14th title pretty much up in smoke. Hull meanwhile looked down and out just a couple of weeks ago, but their last two games saw them draw at Manchester United and beat Liverpool, and suddenly an unlikely escape is on. Arsenal should still win this – they’re hot favourites with the bookies. But in-form Hull will fancy their chances, and they’re under no pressure this afternoon: if they get anything, it’ll be a bonus, and their upcoming run of fixtures against Burnley, Leicester, Swansea, Everton, West Ham and Middlesbrough may allow them to play without fear here. By comparison, should Arsenal fail to grab all three points today, expect a wee ripple or two of discord on the concourse afterwards. Kick off: 12.30pm.

Unite, the union representing about 2,900 crew members in BA’s mixed fleet, called on the airline to join talks to reach an agreement to avoid further strikes, which are planned to run from Friday 17 to Monday 20 February. But executives are adamant that there will be no negotiations and appear ready to sit out further action. BA said it cancelled 34 flights this week because of strike action, but all passengers reached their destinations. It has staffed some planes with higher-paid BA crew from its long-standing long- and short-haul fleets, while some flights have been operated by airlines such as Titan. Unite’s national officer, Oliver Richardson, said: “BA should focus on addressing poverty pay in its mixed fleet, rather than continuing to waste hundreds of thousands of pounds on chartering in aircraft to cover striking workers. “Despite the bully boy tactics, the threats and the sanctions, our members in British Airways mixed fleet have continued to show great resolve in their fight for better pay. Mixed fleet cabin crew are the future of British Airways and deserve better.” Basic pay in the mixed fleet, which all new recruits to BA join, starts at around £12,000, although the airline says crew earn a minimum of £21,000 after allowances and bonuses. Speaking earlier, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA’s parent group, IAG, said: “The offer’s on the table. There are no negotiations. The strikes have had no effect, the passengers are flying and flights are operating, so I’d say this is completely futile action on the part of the union. The offer we’ve made is a fair offer.” He said the action was having a “minimal, if any” impact on BA’s finances, adding: “It’s not being supported – that’s very clear. Over 75% of cabin crew have been coming to work. Over 80% voted [to strike], but not 80% are supporting it. “I have some sympathy for the crews involved because I think they’ve been misled. The offer’s there, it’s still available to them – it’s not going to change. We have contingency plans that are robust and very effective. The strike is not in any way impacting, and it’s not going to change our views in relation to it.” Unite said there was still strong support among crew for the strike. A parliamentary rally was held on Tuesday with support for the striking crew, with backers including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. BA said it would again ensure all customers were flown to their destinations and would publish more details of any merged flights or contingencies next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/feb/25/why-i-love-syd-dj-songwriter-crush-bim-adewunmi","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-25T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Why I love… DJ and singer-songwriter Syd","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/25/why-i-love-syd-dj-songwriter-crush-bim-adewunmi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/25/why-i-love-syd-dj-songwriter-crush-bim-adewunmi","fields":{"headline":"Why I love… DJ and singer-songwriter Syd","bodyText":"Let me ask a simple philosophical question: who do you trust? I don’t mean your family and friends; I’m wondering about something a little different: art. I was thinking about this a few weeks back, as I bought an album without having heard a single note of it. There aren’t many musicians whose new music I will buy without sampling the goods, but such is my trust in this musician. Enter American producer, DJ and singer-songwriter Syd. I think she’s utterly electric. My first introduction to Syd (née Sydney Bennett), 24, came a few years ago, when she was a DJ in the hip-hop collective Odd Future (she officially departed last year). She seemed like the quiet one in the rambunctious group; her vibe is an appealing, unaffected chill. Then I heard her sing with her band the Internet, and what came out of her mouth was so unexpected, it made me stumble. Her voice is silky and breathy, reminiscent of Janet Jackson. It’s also thoroughly girlish, a fact belied by her uniform of hoodies, straight jeans and that stunning short haircut. Her voice is also absurdly, moodily sexy: a sound that makes you raise your eyebrows, especially when coupled with her lyrics (sample: the super-sultry Special Affair, which is steeped in a melange of sex, weed and general good times: “I can get you high if you wanna climb”). Syd is an old-school cool kid with the visuals to match. Like all the best pop stars, she just oozes sex appeal. It’s a little intense, but in a good way. But back to my recent purchase: Syd’s solo debut, Fin. I was right to trust her, because there are no flaws in any of those 12 smooth R&amp;B tracks. She’s a perfect pop star."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/13/extraordinary-levels-of-toxic-pollution-found-in-10km-deep-mariana-trench","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T23:33:41Z","webTitle":"'Extraordinary' levels of pollutants found in 10km deep Mariana trench","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/13/extraordinary-levels-of-toxic-pollution-found-in-10km-deep-mariana-trench","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/13/extraordinary-levels-of-toxic-pollution-found-in-10km-deep-mariana-trench","fields":{"headline":"'Extraordinary' levels of pollutants found in 10km deep Mariana trench","bodyText":"Scientists have discovered “extraordinary” levels of toxic pollution in the most remote and inaccessible place on the planet – the 10km deep Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean. Small crustaceans that live in the pitch-black waters of the trench, captured by a robotic submarine, were contaminated with 50 times more toxic chemicals than crabs that survive in heavily polluted rivers in China. “We still think of the deep ocean as being this remote and pristine realm, safe from human impact, but our research shows that, sadly, this could not be further from the truth,” said Alan Jamieson of Newcastle University in the UK, who led the research. “The fact that we found such extraordinary levels of these pollutants really brings home the long-term, devastating impact that mankind is having on the planet,” he said. Jamieson’s team identified two key types of severely toxic industrial chemicals that were banned in the late 1970s, but do not break down in the environment, known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). These chemicals have previously been found at high levels in Inuit people in the Canadian Arctic and in killer whales and dolphins in western Europe. The research, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, suggests that the POPs infiltrate the deepest parts of the oceans as dead animals and particles of plastic fall downwards. POPs accumulate in fat and are therefore concentrated in creatures up the food chain. They are also water-repellent and so stick to plastic waste. “The very bottom of the deep trenches like the Mariana are inhabited by incredibly efficient scavenging animals, like the 2cm-long amphipods we sampled, so any little bit of organic material that falls down, these guys turn up in huge numbers and devour it,” said Jamieson. He said it was not unexpected that some POPs would be found in the deepest parts of the oceans: “When it gets down into the trenches, there is nowhere else for it to go. The surprise was just how high the levels were – the contamination in the animals was sky high.” The level of one type of POP, called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), was only equalled anywhere in the northwest Pacific in Suruga Bay in Japan, an infamous pollution blackspot. The researchers also found severe contamination in amphipods collected in the Kermadec trench, which is 7,000km from the Mariana trench. The pollution was ubiquitous, found “in all samples across all species at all depths in both trenches”, the scientists said. PCBs were manufactured from the 1930s to the 1970s, when their appalling impact on people and wildlife was realised. About a third of the 1.3m tonnes produced has already leaked into coastal sediments and the open oceans, with a steady stream still thought to be coming from poorly protected landfill sites. An expedition conducted by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last year also found various manmade items on the slopes leading to the Sirena Deep, part of the Mariana trench, and the nearby Enigma Seamount. They included a tin of Spam, a can of Budweiser beer and several plastic bags. The results are both significant and disturbing, said the marine ecologist Katherine Dafforn at the University of New South Wales in Australia and not part of the research team: “The trenches are many miles away from any industrial source and suggests that the delivery of these pollutants occurs over long distances despite regulation since the 1970s. “We still know more about the surface of the moon than that of the ocean floor,” Dafforn said. She said the new research showed that the deep ocean trenches are not as isolated as people imagine. “Jamieson’s team has provided clear evidence that the deep ocean, rather than being remote, is highly connected to surface waters. Their findings are crucial for future monitoring and management of these unique environments.” POPs cause a wide range of damage to life, particularly harming reproductive success. Jamieson is now assessing the impact on the hardy trench creatures, which survive water pressures equivalent to balancing a tonne weight on a fingertip and temperatures of just 1C. He is also examining the deep sea animals for evidence of plastic pollution, feared to be widespread in the oceans, which has been the focus of much recent attention, leading to bans on plastic microbeads in cosmetics in the UK and US. “I reckon it will be there,” he said. Jamieson said it had been positive that the dangers of POPs had been identified and their use ended but that plastic pollution presented a new concern for contamination of the oceans. “We’ve just done it again,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"membership/live/2017/feb/11/weekend-reading-farewell-tpt-brexit-heartache-and-pesto-taste-tested","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"membership","sectionName":"Membership","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-11T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"Weekend reading: Farewell TPT, Brexit heartache and pesto taste-tested","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/live/2017/feb/11/weekend-reading-farewell-tpt-brexit-heartache-and-pesto-taste-tested","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/membership/live/2017/feb/11/weekend-reading-farewell-tpt-brexit-heartache-and-pesto-taste-tested","fields":{"headline":"Weekend reading: Farewell TPT, Brexit heartache and pesto taste-tested","bodyText":"A life of parties, privilege and paparazzi Close friend of the royal family and celebrity magazine favourite, the former socialite once said of her cocaine addiction: “I’d like to go back to that young girl and shake her” ‘A super-villain for a world without heroes’ All presidents come into office with something to prove, it’s just rarely their sanity.

John Nimmo sent messages to Luciana Berger, the Liverpool Wavertree MP, which included a picture of a knife and a threat that she would “get it like Jo Cox”. He referred to Berger as “Jewish scum” and signed off his messages with the words “your friend the Nazi”. Berger, who has repeatedly suffered racist and antisemitic taunts online, told the court in a statement that the threats from Nimmo had caused her “great fear and anguish”. She said: “I have had antisemitic messages before, but this time they were alongside references to my colleague Jo Cox. This incident has impacted on me, for all I knew the offender could have been residing next door to me. This caused me to feel physically sick.” Nimmo has a history of online abuse of women. He has previously been jailed for online harrassment and threats to the Labour MP Stella Creasy and feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez. At Newcastle crown court on Friday he was sentenced to 27 months in jail after pleading guilty to nine charges; four of sending a communication conveying a grossly offensive message, three of conveying a threatening message and two of sending a communication conveying false information. The Crown Prosecution Service successfully argued for an increase in the sentence, which could be applied because some of the offending was motivated by racism. Judge Robert Adams said Nimmo, who created fake accounts on Twitter to send abusive messages during an 18-month campaign against his victims, was responsible for “cowardly” armchair attacks on the MP and other victims. Adams said the attack on the MP was the most serious of Nimmo’s offences, coming soon after Cox’s murder last year. Berger, a former shadow health minister, received Nimmo’s online threat shortly after finishing her regular Friday afternoon MP’s surgery on 8 July. In the note, Nimmo included a photograph of a large kitchen knife, with a warning: “You better watch your back Jewish scum.” The judge said the threats to the MP contained “significant echoes” of what had happened to Cox and must have been terrifying for Berger. “You caused terror and paranoia,” he told Nimmo. “You attacked people who were helping society in a variety of different ways. “The offences were carried out from the comfort of your own home, where you thought you would never be identified while causing misery to other people.” In separate campaigns, the 28-year-old sent emails to Faith Matters, an anti-hate crime organisation, and threatened to blow up a mosque. In a long-lasting campaign against another female victim, he branded her a “danger to children” and publicly accused her of being part of a paedophile ring. The victim, who worked with offenders, was left living in fear for herself and her family. She told police: “I didn’t know what John Nimmo would do next. I have never encountered such an evil person in my life.” Vic Laffey, defending, said Nimmo, who has Asperger syndrome, led an isolated existence and that the internet had enabled him to say things which would never be said face to face. The judge increased the sentence by 50% for each of the offences which were motivated by racism. John Dilworth, from the CPS, said: “Nimmo conducted an online campaign of hate-filled abuse in the belief his identity was securely hidden behind the fake accounts he had created. “However there was a clear forensic link between the messages sent and the device used to send them.” Berger who has repeatedly been targeted by antisemitic abuse online, told the Guardian she felt Twitter did not do enough to combat abuse. “I have heard them say for more than two years they are working on these product changes to tackle this,” she said. “It is ridiculous. Where are they? I have had numerous conversations with Twitter about this. “I have said to Twitter: ‘There is no point [in] me reporting it, because you never take it down.’” A Twitter spokesman has said the company accepted it had not done enough, and was toughening up its conduct policy. In a statement after the sentencing, Berger said: “I hope that if any good at all can come from this traumatic experience, it is that others will see that you do not have to suffer in silence. Action will be taken. “I would encourage anyone affected to report these crimes. Together, we can stand up to and defeat the racists in our communities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/10/renewables-floods-and-the-incredible-amazon-catfish-green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T16:44:40Z","webTitle":"Renewables, floods and the incredible Amazon catfish – green news roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/10/renewables-floods-and-the-incredible-amazon-catfish-green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/10/renewables-floods-and-the-incredible-amazon-catfish-green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Renewables, floods and the incredible Amazon catfish – green news roundup","bodyText":"Environment news Almost 90% of new power in Europe from renewable sources in 2016 Tesco’s plan bee: spilt supermarket sugar to help feed hungry honey bees EU must shut all coal plants by 2030 to meet Paris climate pledges, study says Blast at French nuclear plant does not pose contamination risk, say experts Winter migration of monarch butterflies to Mexico drops after one-year recovery Massive ancient undersea landslide discovered off Great Barrier Reef Republican elders call for new national carbon tax to replace federal regulations Lack of transparency over green energy subsidies ‘shambolic’, say MPs Floods and erosion are ruining Britain’s most significant sites Europe escalates action against UK for breaching air pollution limits Hedgehogs now a rare garden sight as British populations continue to decline Features and comment Whistleblower: ‘I knew people would misuse this.’ They did - to attack climate science | Dana Nuccitelli Power to the EV: Norway spearheads Europe’s electric vehicle surge The primal thrill of sharks: the emotional case for rewilding the sea In Australia and the US, sound climate policy is being held hostage by vested interests Multimedia The week in wildlife – in pictures Hundreds of whales die in mass stranding on New Zealand beach – video The world’s most unloved, underappreciated wildlife – in pictures Cod in a cold climate – in pictures And finally ...

He claims to have been present, along with his father and two uncles, when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death, and has said only “scum of the earth” would suggest this was not true. After he added in a newspaper interview last weekend that he did not like to talk about the disaster, the Hillsborough Families Support Group questioned why he had never offered any support, while others who knew him at the time say they have no recollection of him saying he was present during the disaster. With these questions being raised, Ukip gave the Guardian two statements on behalf of Nuttall, one from his father and another from a Ukip employee, saying that they and Nuttall had been at Hillsborough on the day of the disaster. The statement from Nuttall’s father gave an incorrect age for his son at the time of the 1989 disaster. The statements appear to raise further questions for Nuttall, who is contesting the Stoke Central byelection for Ukip on 23 February. He declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the matter. His parents have not responded to a request that they speak to the Guardian. Nuttall first publicly claimed to have been at Hillsborough in a letter to the Liverpool Daily Post in July 2010. He raised the matter again in May last year, saying during an interview on the BBC’s Politics Show North West that he had been in the overcrowded Leppings Lane end of the ground. He told his interviewer that he thought police officers responsible for the disaster should be prosecuted. “I think people should carry the can for their actions,” he said. Nuttall was 12 at the time of the disaster, and was a pupil at Savio high school in Bootle, Liverpool. One of his former teachers, a Roman Catholic priest, has told the Guardian that the school believed it had been aware of the identities of every boy who had been at Hillsborough in order to help them through a difficult period, and that Nuttall was not among them. A fellow pupil at the school who says he has been a friend of Nuttall for decades said the Ukip leader had never mentioned being there. “I have been very good friends with Paul for over 25 years,” he said, adding that during that time they had “never spoken” about Hillsborough. While the teacher and friend expressed surprise that Nuttall has said he was at Hillsborough, their comments do not prove that he was not present. Joe Benton, who was Labour MP for Bootle for 25 years, said that to the best of his knowledge Nuttall had not mentioned Hillsborough when he stood against him as Ukip’s candidate in the 2005 and 2010 general elections. Nuttall had not mentioned being present at Hillsborough during any public meeting they had both attended, nor in his campaign literature, Benton said, despite the strength of feeling within the constituency about the police negligence that led to the deaths and the subsequent official cover-up that led to Liverpool fans being blamed for the disaster. The current Labour MP for Bootle, Peter Dowd, said that as far as he was aware, Nuttall had not mentioned Hillsborough when he contested Bootle for Ukip in the 2015 general election. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, said: “If Nuttall was [at Hillsborough] then it is extremely disappointing that during many years of pain and anguish for the families, he never once used his position nationally and internationally to stand up for people from his own community and join the fight for justice.” Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, said she was surprised that Nuttall had never offered to assist with their decades-long campaign to overturn the cover-up that led to Liverpool football fans being blamed for the 96 deaths. “I haven’t heard anything about him being at the match,” she said. “Has he given a statement to the police, who have said they want to hear from everyone who was there? He can’t say he hasn’t heard that the police want to take statements from everyone who was in the Leppings Lane, as it’s been all over local and national media.” Nuttall declined to explain why he had not offered his support to the group. He also declined to say whether he had given a statement to the police who are currently investigating events on the day of the disaster. He further declined to offer any comment about the way in which a former teacher and old school friend said he had never mentioned being at Hillsborough, nor about the way in which he appears not to have mentioned being present at the disaster while fighting three general elections in a Liverpool constituency. Nuttall, a member of the European parliament for eight years, also declined to say whether he had ever sought to have the parliament debate any of the issues arising from the disaster. In response to the questions, Ukip issued a statement that said Nuttall was the victim of a smear campaign sanctioned by senior members of the Labour party. Any claim that he was not at Hillsborough was “totally false and highly defamatory”, the statement said, adding: “Paul was indeed at Hillsborough. He attended the match with his father and other family members. For political opponents to suggest otherwise and for left-wing media organisations to promote such claims constitutes a new low for the Labour party and its associates.” Ukip produced two statements. The statement from Nuttall’s father begins: “I am and always have been the father of Paul Nuttall, leader of the UK Independence party.” It goes on to state that Nuttall had been 13 years old at the time of the disaster. He was in fact 12. The second statement is said to be from a Ukip official at the European parliament. This said that the two men had been friends for 35 years and were both at Hillsborough. Last week, Nuttall told the Ukip-supporting Sunday Express that he had been at the match with his father and two uncles, and that after being caught in a crush outside the stadium they had entered the upper tier at Leppings Lane. Only “scum of the earth” would say otherwise. It is not the first time that claims made by Nuttall, or made on his behalf, have been questioned by others. Staffordshire police have said they are investigating an allegation of election fraud after Nuttall’s nomination papers for the Stoke Central byelection gave an address in the city at which he subsequently admitted he was not living. Knowingly providing false information on a nomination paper is an offence punishable by up to 51 weeks’ imprisonment. Ukip said all rules had been complied with. Nuttall’s personal website has carried the claim that he had once been a professional footballer with Tranmere Rovers. After Rovers stated that he had been a member of its youth side, but never a professional, Nuttall blamed his website’s statement on a Ukip press officer. Until late last year, Nuttall’s profile page on the LinkedIn social networking site implied that he had a PhD. He did not complete his doctoral studies, however. Challenged about this, Nuttall insisted that the LinkedIn page “wasn’t put up by us, and we don’t know where it’s come from”. The page was subsequently edited to remove any reference to a PhD. In 2015, while Ukip’s education spokesperson, Nuttall appeared in a photograph that was found to have been digitally altered to give the impression that he was standing in a library. Nuttall responded by joking that he had two copies of each of his books. He is currently among six Ukip members of the European parliament who are under investigation for alleged misuse of funds. If they are found to have broken the rules, they will be expected to pay the money, which totals about £500,000. Ukip rejects the allegations, saying it has “scrupulously applied” the rules of the European parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/feb/13/un-accused-of-failing-afghan-refugees-forced-to-return-home-from-pakistan","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T11:35:27Z","webTitle":"UN accused of failing Afghan refugees 'forced' to return home from Pakistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/13/un-accused-of-failing-afghan-refugees-forced-to-return-home-from-pakistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/feb/13/un-accused-of-failing-afghan-refugees-forced-to-return-home-from-pakistan","fields":{"headline":"UN accused of failing Afghan refugees 'forced' to return home from Pakistan","bodyText":"The UN refugee agency has fallen short of its mandate to protect refugees by failing to denounce a “campaign of abuse” by Pakistan that has ushered thousands of Afghans out of the country, leaving them at risk of persecution at home, according to Human Rights Watch. Last year the Pakistani government ordered all Afghan migrants and refugees to leave the country, mounting a campaign of intimidation, according to HRW, that has so far led to the eviction of nearly 600,000 people since July. Afghans in Pakistan constitute one of the world’s largest refugee communities, housing until recently an estimated 1.5 million registered and 1 million unregistered Afghan refugees. Many are second- or third-generation refugees with little connection to Afghanistan. After the Pakistani government last year ordered all Afghan migrants and refugees to leave, authorities began raiding their homes and shops. On a recent trip to the border, the Guardian heard stories of police harassment and arbitrary arrests and of landlords cancelling leases. There were also reports of communities that had housed refugees for decades suddenly turning against Afghan families. By not denouncing the mass eviction as refoulement – the return of refugees to a country where they have reason to fear persecution – HRW said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had failed in its duty to protect refugees. By failing to accurately inform of the conditions awaiting returnees in Afghanistan, and handing out $400 (£320) cash grants to each returning registered refugee between June and December last year, the agency “effectively promoted the forced return”, HRW added. “The UN refugee agency should end the fiction that the mass forced return of Afghan refugees from Pakistan is, in fact, mass voluntary return,” said the report. Patricia Gossman, senior researcher HRW, added: “UNHCR’s essential mandate is protection.” A spokeswoman for the refugee agency, Ariane Rummery, said: “UNHCR has been raising concerns about the pressures on Afghans.” She emphasised the complexity of the factors driving the situation, which she said included Pakistani security operations, economic hardship and a campaign by the Afghan government to encourage Afghans in Pakistan to return home. She said that UNHCR “advocates for an improvement in the protection environment for Afghans in Pakistan”, and pointed out that Pakistan recently extended the deadline for Afghans in that country to leave until the end of 2017. “It is not UNHCR’s opinion that the situation can be characterised as refoulement, but there is no question Afghan refugees are having to make tough decisions on where they can find more reliable and predictable protection at this time,” Rummery said. “We call on the international community and the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to ensure that refugee repatriation is voluntary, gradual and aligned with development programmes as well as efforts to bolster peace and security.” Laurence Hart, chief of mission in Afghanistan for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), said it was unfair to point fingers at the UNHCR in failing to stand up to Pakistan’s conduct. “They have certainly made, along with other actors, a lot of advocacy but perhaps it wasn’t public,” he said. “International agencies need to preserve their operational space in Pakistan and being too public in their statements could jeopardise this space.” But other organisations agreed with HRW’s criticism. “We have a situation now in which UNHCR is clearly facilitating a return of refugees that appears involuntary, and this is against the core principle of refugee law,” said William Carter, head of programme with the Norwegian Refugee Council. He added that the organisation had tried without success to convince the UNHCR to change approach. “Unfortunately UNHCR remained intransigent,” Carter said. After a hiatus over winter, the UNHCR plans to resume cash support to returnees in March, but critics say a different solution is needed. Approximately 40% of the 600,000 returnees are not documented refugees. They do not receive UNCHR cash grants, which in the case of large families can add up to several thousand dollars. “I think the main issue is that response to returnees, being undocumented or registered refugees, remains unbalanced notwithstanding the similar vulnerable situation they find themselves in,” said Hart. “It would be important to move from a status-based approach to a need-based one, so that inequities are avoided,” he said. The NRC insisted that cash grants be abolished completely for now. “Clearly, the UNHCR should not resume its repatriation programme until we are sure that refugees are returning voluntarily,” Carter said. “The Afghan government needs to give itself enough time to put in place realistic plans and finances to provide durable solutions for returnees.” Most returning Afghans settle in the poor eastern province of Nangarhar or in the capital, Kabul. “Obviously, when these people come to the country they become very vulnerable,” said Timor Sharan, Afghanistan analyst with the International Crisis Group. “They settle around urban centres, which may be relatively safe, but what essentially happens is it cuts them off from communities they belong to.” Returnees sometimes resort to extreme methods to cope. During her six years in Punjab in Pakistan, Daryan Begam had a stable life. She helped support her four children, including a disabled daughter, by sewing footballs. But a year ago, shortly after her husband died, authorities began pressuring her until she left. To pay rent in her new house in Nangarhar, the widow said she had to marry off her daughter, who is 15, to a local police chief. “My daughters don’t have a father so we have no provider at home. It is not easy for a mother to marry her daughter off at a young age, but I had no choice,” Begam said.

If we are going to get technical about vinyl record reproduction (Letters, 8 February), the output of a moving coil or moving magnet cartridge is proportional to the velocity of the needle, not its position. So high frequencies produce a greater output than low frequencies and the phono amp needs to boost the bass to produce a flat frequency response. But amplifying the bass also amplifies other low-frequency components such as rumble from the turntable bearing and motor, so the deep bass often has to be sharply filtered out. The only way to get a strong deep bass is to space the grooves out on the record so that there is room for large deviations of the groove. This is admirably supplied on 12in singles where only five minutes of music takes up the space used by 30 minutes on an LP. But digital reproduction uses numbers to describe the waveform, and though the highest frequency a system can reproduce is limited by Nyquist’s theorem to half the sampling frequency, there is no theoretical reason why a digital system couldn’t reproduce bass frequencies down to zero. Ron Bailey Newburn, Tyne and Wear • Doug Simpson (Letters, 8 February) may not recall that bass sounds are compressed on a vinyl record. More than 60 years ago, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) set an international standard, extending the playing time of a record by de-emphasising low frequency sounds. (Higher frequency notes are boosted on a record.) The phono input restores the original sound shape.

I still have my emotional barriers, but I now also have physical dysfunction. Can anything be done? Being perimenopausal is not a dysfunction. It is a normal transition period, and does not necessarily curtail sexual enjoyment – although it is commonly a time when hormonal changes can affect sexual desire, arousal and/or orgasm to some degree. Let go of your expectations that sex should be a certain way, or follow a certain pattern, and try to allow yourself to accept pleasure. Just the fact that you say you would like to have enjoyment with him means that it is entirely possible. Try not to be anxious and focus, instead, on simply having fun; this will relax you and very likely lead to mounting desire. If physical touching begins between you, try not to second guess the next step, but simply try to enjoy each caress in the moment. If your mind is constantly questioning “What if …?”, that will sabotage your chance to experience pleasure. This psychological impediment to sex is far more of a problem than perimenopause.

The Guardian has learned that David Lytton, who flew back to England from Pakistan and lay down on the ground to die at a remote beauty spot, was formerly called David Lautenberg. It is understood he changed his name due to a family feud. Much of his life still remains a mystery but it is now known he was born to Sylvia and Hyman Lautenberg in 1948. His father is believed to have died but Lytton is survived by his mother and younger brother, Jeremy. His mother’s family were originally from Poland and were of Jewish descent. They came to England in around 1901 and first lived in the east London area, possibly Whitechapel. They are then believed to have moved to a large house in Oxford Gardens, Kensington. It has been suggested that the family may have been refugees and were living in lodgings shared with other families. Lautenberg’s father was the manager of a men’s hosiery shop, so it would have been unlikely that he owned the grand Victorian mansion. The Guardian attempted to talk to Lytton’s brother, who now lives in north London, but he said he would not be speaking to the press as he was tied in to a Channel 4 documentary about the mystery. Speaking from the window of his second-floor flat, he said: “They thought it would take another week at least” for the press to discover he was related to Lytton. “Sorry for your wasted journey. I would’ve helped, but I’m already tied into to this,” he added, referring to the documentary. Intriguingly, Jeremy and his mother also changed their surnames, from the German Lautenberg to the anglicised Lawton. Lytton’s former neighbour Peter Dias said: “I did suspect that he [Lytton] had a different name. It does not shock me that he would have changed his name. Everything about him was a bit of a mystery. “He was very good at hiding stuff and he did not want the world to know his business and I guess changing his name was another element of this secrecy. I do still feel really sad about the whole thing.” Dias said that when his family moved next door to Lytton in the suburb of Streatham in around 1983, his father made a note of all the neighbours’ names. “My dad found his notebook last week and David gave his name as Lytton, so he must have changed it before 1983,” he said. Last week a home video emerged showing Lytton in a very different light to the stark, isolated picture previously painted of him. In an intimate moment captured at a neighbour’s wedding in 1994, a female friend gently puts her arm on Lytton’s and leads him to the dancefloor, her head momentarily resting on his shoulder. The lonely nature of Lytton’s death and the fact no one came forward to identify the body had seemed to hint at an insular life spent without friends, family or companionship. But the Guardian revealed last week that the former tube driver was in a relationship for more than 15 years with a woman who counselled him through bouts of depression. Thirteen months after the discovery of the body and following a painstaking police investigation, the mystery surrounding Lytton’s identity was finally resolved this month. On 10 December 2015, Lytton, 67, boarded a plane in Lahore and travelled to London. At about 2pm the following day he walked into the Clarence pub in Greenfield, near Oldham, Greater Manchester. Tall, white, with receding grey hair, brown eyes and a prominent nose, he asked for directions to the “top of the mountain”, the summit of the 1,500ft Indian’s Head peak on Saddleworth Moor above Dovestone reservoir. He was wearing a light mac, trousers, a shirt and slip-on shoes. A day later his body was found on a secluded moorland path. Toxicology tests last March confirmed he died from a dose of strychnine, a highly toxic odourless alkaloid used as a pesticide, particularly to kill rodents. He had no wallet, mobile phone or other identification and his name remained unknown despite numerous public appeals and the release of CCTV footage of his last known movements. The story was picked up as far away as Japan and America. An Australian news website speculated that he was an international spy. Little is know about his life but what is known is that he lived in London for three decades before briefly moving to Florida in the US and then for some unknown reason to a working-class suburb of Lahore in Pakistan. One neighbour said Lytton told him he was no longer able to afford the mortgage on the terraced house he had bought in his 30s and was moving to Hounslow. Another neighbour, Veda Best, 73, who knew Lytton for more than 30 years, said he sold his house and went to the US, leaving behind his long-term partner. Best said the woman told her Lytton had suffered from depression for a number of years due to a family feud that had resulted in him changing his name. Although details of Lytton’s life are beginning to emerge, it is likely that we will never know why he travelled thousands of miles to end his life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/feb/09/g4s-welfare-support-families-children-deportation-gatwick","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T17:13:11Z","webTitle":"G4S to take over welfare support for families facing deportation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/09/g4s-welfare-support-families-children-deportation-gatwick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/feb/09/g4s-welfare-support-families-children-deportation-gatwick","fields":{"headline":"G4S to take over welfare support for families facing deportation","bodyText":"The private security company G4S is to take over from a children’s charity the contract to provide welfare support to detained families facing deportation, the Home Office is expected to announce on Friday. The Home Office has privately insisted that the much-criticised private security company can provide the “same key aspects of welfare support to families” as have been delivered by the current providers, Barnardo’s. The decision has led to serious concerns being raised by the former Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, who secured an end to the routine immigration detention of children as part of the coalition government, and says it is “openly putting children at risk”. The change of provider follows the closure of the underused Cedars “pre-departure accommodation” near Gatwick in December. The Cedars was opened in 2011 after the coalition agreement as part of new family deportation policy that encouraged families to leave voluntarily and gave a higher priority to the welfare of the children involved. A new “discrete self-contained unit” at nearby Tinsley House immigration removal centre to handle family deportations is due to open in May. The Home Office is to announce on Friday that G4S has been awarded the contract for the unit, which is initially for 3 years but can be extended to five years. The Home Office contract requires the firm to provide support to children and families while they await their removal, to help them to come to terms with the plans for their return and to help them make preparations for their departure and future resettlement. Clegg said: “The government’s recent disregard for the welfare and safeguarding of vulnerable children is not the Great Britain I know and admire. First they go back on a promise to accept unaccompanied child refugees from Syria and now they are openly putting innocent children at risk. “Charities have been clear that moving families waiting to be deported to Tinsley House is not in the best interests of the children. The truth is, the prison-style environment is not physically safe for children and could impact on their emotional wellbeing. That is exactly why the Liberal Democrats, whilst in coalition, insisted on the establishment of Cedars as suitable accommodation in the first place.” In a letter seen by the Guardian flagging up the G4S decision, Home Office minister Susan Williams says that the key aspects of the welfare support provided to families will remain the same despite the change of provider and the change of location. She insisted that the new pre-departure accommodation at Tinsley House will be used only as a last resort after all voluntary and other return options have failed and an independent family returns panel will be consulted before any family is detained in the unit.

But his supporters deserting him should","bodyText":"Oh, Labour – 118 characters, 23 words, and the awfulness of the party’s current position has been revealed in full. “Real fight starts now,” tweeted Jeremy Corbyn, or whoever does these things for him, in the aftermath of the House of Commons’ second vote on article 50. “Over next two years Labour will use every opportunity to ensure Brexit protects jobs, living standards &amp; the economy.” In among a whole universe of online mirth, there was one particularly cutting strand of reply, repeated over and over again, and reducible to a simple point: as one wit put it, “First rule of ‘Real fight starts now’ club – turn up when the fight is over.” My personal favourite came from the musician Martin Carr: “*Puts baby in lion’s mouth* ‘The real fight starts now. Over the next 2 yrs Labour will use every opportunity … Oh, it’s eaten it.’” Of course, the usual health warning applies: for the most part, you should never mistake an explosion on your timeline for anything halfway real. But among what might now be Labour’s true “core” support – liberal-inclined people who voted remain, and feel anxious beyond belief about where Britain has ended up – something has definitely shifted these last few weeks, and all those tweets and Facebook posts are among the proof. I know once-passionate Corbyn supporters who are now racked with doubt about the man they once believed in, and about his handling of such a watershed political moment; others who joined the party after the 2015 election with a sense of almost moral duty, but who are among the 7,000 or so people who have reportedly stopped their standing orders and chucked it in. These are not fickle types either, but people who practise their politics because of deep passions, and immovable principles. Put simply, they are at their wits’ end. Who can blame them? Their angst, moreover, goes further back than the pantomime around the two votes on article 50. In many cases it arises from the knowledge that Labour may now be in an almost impossible political position, so confounding that to speculate about who might be the next leader (Clive Lewis? Keir Starmer? The renowned Rebecca Long-Bailey?) is to ignore the depth of the crisis. The result of the referendum and the supposed chasm between leave and remain voters have exposed the same class divides now paralysing centre-left parties across Europe and beyond. But in a British context, what makes that realisation all the more painful is a rising sense that Corbyn and his allies might be at least partly to blame. In other words, eight months on from 23 June 2016, there are plenty of Labour people who are haunted by the culpability of the current leadership for Brexit. It is not hard to trace the story back: from John McDonnell’s claim last November that leaving the EU was nothing less than an “enormous opportunity”, through Corbyn’s absurd post-referendum insistence that article 50 ought to be triggered immediately, and into a whole mess of stuff around the campaign to stay in the EU – surely the quintessential “real fight” – and the dreadful record of the people in charge of the party. For the details, have a read of All Out War, the accomplished instant history of the referendum written by the Sunday Times’ political editor Tim Shipman. I know, he’s a Murdoch man, but Shipman tells his story in cool, dispassionate terms, and the Labour elements of it are backed up by everyone from backbenchers to former ministers. It is all there, in a chapter titled Labour’s Not Working: “For months, Corbyn and his office resisted calls by [Alan] Johnson and the Labour In campaign to declare his personal support for staying in Europe”; “Corbyn would film fortnightly Facebook videos telling his supporters what he was doing. It would have been natural, in the midst of a historic election campaign to devote one to the EU. He refused.” One recollection from Will Straw, the Stronger In campaign director and 2015 Labour candidate, says it all: “It took six months for me to get a single meeting with Jeremy Corbyn’s team, and that was the only meeting. In March. It was basically hopeless. He didn’t want to engage.” Given the closeness of the vote, there is a strong argument that this is one of the key reasons why the referendum was lost. Moreover, if the party leadership’s approach to the remain campaign was such a fiasco, how could it capably navigate its way through what happened next? Put another way, with Brexit now part of the same global mess as the coming to power of Donald Trump, how can a leadership that has so let down its own supporters and engaged in such awful doublespeak – affecting to be pro-EU, but constantly tilting in the opposite direction – even begin to answer people’s need for political clarity, let alone hope? We all know the answer to that: as the shambles of the last few months has proved, Corbyn and his people are locked into deep political failure. Given their flat-out refusal to countenance opposing the Brexit bill, Labour’s red lines have turned out not to be red lines at all. The party has no coherent position on the single market, and the dire consequences of leaving it. Labour runs Wales, along with just about all the big cities in England – but the deep fears of its politicians in charge of those places find no echo in the tepid rhetoric at the top. On Wednesday night we saw the strange spectacle of Labour proposing what looked like crucial amendments to the article 50 bill – on the NHS, the rights of EU nationals, and the prospect of the UK becoming a tax haven – and then after their rejection trooping through the lobbies with the Tories regardless. Diane Abbott said that the way Labour MPs were told to vote “does not mean that we have to accept Brexit in the haphazard way in which it is being handed to us”. A more convincing view was put by the Greens’ Caroline Lucas. The unamended bill, she said, was the “blueprint for an extreme Tory Brexit and Labour waved it through”. Beyond the Corbynites and furious Labour remainers, there is another position. One senior Labour MP told me this week that the danger of the moment is that too many people on the left are either clinging to the idea that the decision to leave the EU might somehow be reversed, or obsessing over milder versions of Brexit, and averting their eyes from an urgent task – accepting our exit, and coming up with a convincing vision of the future that might somehow bring back the old Labour heartlands that voted leave. To that, there are two answers. First, the hard Brexit the government is pursuing is highly likely to cause no end of pain, and if Labour had any kind of long view, it would have long since set out a strong case for soft Brexit, and used it as the cornerstone of its approach to the rest of this parliament. Second, even if the party accepts the “move on” argument, it is going to take skilled leadership to make a go of it. But what signs are there of that? Which brings us back to Real Fight Starts Now Club, and a few requirements so basic that most tweeters did not think to mention them: competence, vision, consistency, and a modicum of strategic nous. Does anyone at the top still have any of that stuff? Or is Labour now so collectively befuddled that all hope is lost?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/10/truth-trolls-internet-abusive-comments-online","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T12:00:00Z","webTitle":"The awkward truth about trolls: any of us could become one | Justin Cheng","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/truth-trolls-internet-abusive-comments-online","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/truth-trolls-internet-abusive-comments-online","fields":{"headline":"The awkward truth about trolls: any of us could become one","bodyText":"Today, online harassment and trolling is prevalent in social media, and especially in online discussions, whether on Facebook, news sites, or Reddit. A recent Pew Research Center survey estimated that four out of 10 users have been harassed in one way or another: from name-calling to sexual harassment. Last year, the Guardian ran a feature that showed how more than a million comments posted to this website were deleted for being abusive or off-topic. Several websites have resorted to completely removing the comment facility. But why has trolling become so widespread? One common misconception is that trolls are in some way sociopathic, and comprise a small but vocal minority of all users of the web. This notion has also been reinforced by past research that focused on interviewing trolls or showed that trolls have unique personality traits. But there’s another possibility: trolls might be made rather than born, and are just ordinary people like you and me. In fact, our new research shows that trolling is more situational than an innate characteristic. In other words, under the right (or wrong) circumstances, anyone can become a troll. Through a combination of experimentation, data analysis, and machine learning, we can identify two key factors that make the average person more likely to troll. The first is their emotional state or mood: trolling ebbs and flows with people’s emotions depending on the time of day and even the day of week – people are most likely to troll late at night, and at the beginning of the work week. There is even some evidence of this mood spilling over from one discussion into others – a person simply participating in the same discussion as a troll is more likely to troll in a later, unrelated discussion. The second factor is the context of the discussion a person is having. Seeing prior “troll comments” in a discussion doubles a person’s likelihood of subsequently trolling. Trolling also has a domino effect: the more troll comments there are at the start of a discussion, the more likely subsequent participants in that discussion will also troll. What these findings suggest is that any person who happens to wake up on the wrong side of the bed can be the spark that results in a cascade of bad behaviour. And if troll comments beget more troll comments, you can imagine a discussion, or even a whole community, being overrun by these kinds of posts if left unchecked. We might hypothesise that “upvotes” and “downvotes” can solve the problem, as a community can use these signals to tell bad commenters that what they write isn’t appropriate or appreciated. However, voting can make matters worse. While it might have been designed as a simple indicator of a comment’s quality, it’s been shown that downvotes propagate negativity through a community. That is, people who have their comments downvoted not only write a greater number of negative, troll comments in the future, but they also retaliate by downvoting others. (And if you were hoping that being upvoted leads to better comments or more upvotes, this isn’t the case.) These sobering findings suggest that what we currently have in discussions might not be working as we hoped. Nonetheless, there are other things communities can implement to minimise trolling. For instance, when we see something we disagree with, many of us are susceptible to posting angry comments in the heat of the moment. Briefly delaying when comments get posted could create opportunities to amend or retract comments that our later selves may come to regret. We can use these findings to develop predictive models that can identify potentially problematic discussions, and help community moderators defuse aggressive situations more quickly. We can also come up with social techniques to try to influence people towards acting more civilly. One recent experiment conducted on Reddit demonstrated how pinning a post about a community’s rules to the top of discussion pages made it more likely for newcomers to follow those rules when commenting. Still, there’s a lot that we don’t know about trolling. How common is organised trolling? What role do sock puppets (people who use multiple online identities to promote their own views) play? How about bots? Have strategies for trolling evolved over time? With a growing community of organisations and researchers interested in tackling the problem, I am optimistic that online discussions will get better as these findings inspire improvements. With the increased polarisation that we see in the world both on and offline, it’s easy to dismiss trolls as these people who are not “one of us”. The reality is that many trolls are just people like ourselves having a bad day. Recognising that we’re responsible for both the inspiring and the despair-inducing conversations is key to having better, more productive online debates in future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/10/lego-batman-movie-fences-best-new-films-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"The Lego Batman Movie and Fences: this week’s best new films in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/10/lego-batman-movie-fences-best-new-films-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/10/lego-batman-movie-fences-best-new-films-uk","fields":{"headline":"The Lego Batman Movie and Fences: this week’s best new films in the UK","bodyText":"1 The Lego Batman Movie (U) (Chris McKay, 2017, US/Den) 104 mins Yes, it’s basically a double-pronged marketing exercise, but this Lego Movie spin-off is irresistibly, irreverently entertaining – in a junior Deadpool sort of way.

Since her arrest in 2015, the Russian authorities have extended the order for Sharina, director of the Ukrainian Literature Library in Moscow, to be detained at home repeatedly, despite calls for her release. In a move roundly condemned by human rights groups, Sharina went on trial in November 2016 for incitement by stocking books banned in Russia and labelled extremist and “anti-Russian propaganda”. Three weeks after the trial began, embezzlement was added to the list of charges. If found guilty, she faces up to 10 years in prison. Speaking to the Russian website Interfax, her lawyer Ivan Pavlov said the appeal to the ECHR had been launched because of her continued incarceration, which he described as absurd. “The authorities have not provided us with a convincing justification for the extensions of house arrest of Sharina,” Pavlov said, adding that remand prisoners are usually allowed a minimum of supervised daily walks. “The refusal to allow her to leave the flat at all is having a detrimental effect on her health, as is the prohibition on using any form of communication.” In November, Amnesty International launched a campaign for her release, urging members to write to the Russian authorities. Amnesty said in a statement: “Natalya Sharina is a prisoner of conscience and must be released immediately and unconditionally.” The librarian was charged with acquiring banned books, brochures and a CD considered extremist and making them available to the public, with particular emphasis on books by nationalist activist Dmytro Korchynsky, which are banned in Russia. When his Ukrainian-language book War in the Crowd was brought out of a back room that holds the library’s “special collection” by police, other library employees said the book had been disposed of when it was placed on Russia’s list of extremist material and that it did not belong to the library. When Sharina’s trial opened in November, the 59-year-old told the court: “I do not understand the charge and so I do not feel any guilt. I ask the respected prosecutor to explain what actions I actually took to spread enmity.” Her lawyer claimed her arrest was the latest salvo in the battle between Russia and Ukraine. “It’s no coincidence that it’s the Ukrainian Literature Library that was searched, and not a Belarusian or a Cossack one,” Pavlov said at the opening of the trial. Ukraine and Russia have been at loggerheads since Russia annexed Crimea and pro-Russian forces seized power in parts of eastern Ukraine in October 2014. The trial over banned books is one of many alleged human rights violations by President Vladimir Putin’s regime that have been condemned by Amnesty, whose Moscow office was closed down last November. Putin’s cultural policing has not just been focused on political opponents. In May 2014, the Russian leader signed into law an order banning swearing in arts, cultural and entertainment events. It also became illegal to distribute books, CDs or films containing swearing if they were not in sealed bags labelled: “Contains obscene language.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/09/refugee-children-devastated-by-end-of-dubs-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T14:35:54Z","webTitle":"Refugee children 'devastated' by end of Dubs scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/refugee-children-devastated-by-end-of-dubs-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/09/refugee-children-devastated-by-end-of-dubs-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Refugee children 'devastated' by end of Dubs scheme","bodyText":"Aid workers in France, Greece and Italy said unaccompanied refugee children would be devastated by the curtailment of the Dubs scheme, and would respond by risking their lives to get to the UK illegally. Charity workers in Calais said an estimated 200 asylum-seeking children were now living rough in the forests and woodland around the demolished refugee camp, many of whom had expected to be eligible to be transferred to the UK under the Dubs amendment. “They are not in tents because it makes them more visible to the police; they want to stay secret and out of sight. But it is quite dangerously cold,” said Amelia Burr, with the charity Help Refugees. Throughout January nighttime temperatures have been around -5C (23F). “We give out sleeping bags and blankets at night; when we come back the next day the blankets are frozen.” Now that there is little chance of a legal route to the UK, young asylum seekers are once again attempting to get on lorries travelling to the UK at night, she said. Last month a 20-year-old from Eritrea was killed on the motorway. “There is very little legal option for minors who want to get to the UK now, so they are left with only one option, which is to risk their lives to try to get to England.” Natasha Tsangarides, Greece field manager with the charity Safe Passage, which helps refugee children to find legal ways of seeking asylum in the UK, said there were more than 1,000 child refugees in Greece on a waiting list for places in children’s shelters who urgently needed help accessing appropriate places to stay. She is currently helping more than 100 minors from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere who were likely to have been eligible under the Dubs legislation to come to the UK. Some are living in squats in Athens, others are living on the streets, and some are in migrant detention centres. “A couple of boys are prostituting themselves just to survive in Greece. There are over 1,000 lone, vulnerable and desperate children here, who don’t even have a home to sleep in. There is a huge problem here,” she said. “If they are going to take no more than 150 children more from across France, Italy and Greece, that’s simply not good enough. “It is devastating for the children. The Dubs amendment was a symbol of hope for everyone. These kids have been through enough already – this offered the prospect of security and safety in the UK. This is another blow in what is amounting to an attack on refugee rights. There was public and parliamentary support for it. Everyone will be disappointed.” Aid workers in Italy said that there was no estimate of how many unaccompanied asylum-seeking children might have been eligible under the Dubs legislation, but last year 28,223 unaccompanied minors arrived in the country, a 100% increase on the previous year. “To deny one of the very few safe and legal routes for unaccompanied minors is clearly going to have a serious impact on their chances of having any kind of safe future,” said Lara Cumming, Help Refugees field manager in Italy, who is based in Palermo. Many children were being exploited, forced to work on farms or in the sex industry. “You see increasing numbers of them in the sex industry; they are visibly minors.” There was anger from the aid workers at the Home Office decision to wind down the Dubs scheme. “Letting 14- and 15-year-olds sleep out in the cold in woodland wouldn’t be tolerated in the UK, risking their lives to jump on a truck or freeze to death – it just wouldn’t be allowed because it would be deemed negligent. It is disgusting that as a country we are turning our back and allowing them to freeze to death or get run over because we won’t take responsibility for the situation,” Burr from Help Refugees added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/09/jeremy-corbyn-labour-shadow-cabinet-brexit-bill-rebecca-long-bailey","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T19:29:54Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn fills gaps in shadow cabinet after Brexit bill rebellion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/09/jeremy-corbyn-labour-shadow-cabinet-brexit-bill-rebecca-long-bailey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/09/jeremy-corbyn-labour-shadow-cabinet-brexit-bill-rebecca-long-bailey","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn fills gaps in shadow cabinet after Brexit bill rebellion","bodyText":"Rebecca Long-Bailey, the MP for Salford, has been promoted to the job of shadow business secretary, as Jeremy Corbyn replaces the members of the shadow cabinet who resigned rather than vote to trigger article 50 and begin the Brexit process. Long-Bailey, a solicitor and close ally of John McDonnell who is regarded by some as a potential successor to Corbyn, takes the place of Clive Lewis, the Norwich South MP who resigned on Wednesday night before voting against the government’s Brexit bill. Labour also announced that the Workington MP Sue Hayman would be shadow environment secretary; the Neath MP Christina Rees would be shadow Welsh secretary; and the Bootle MP Peter Dowd would replace Long-Bailey as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Corbyn has carried out five reshuffles since taking the leadership in 2015, in response to a series of resignations including the mass walkout that preceded Owen Smith’s leadership challenge last summer. Long-Bailey, the daughter of a Salford docker, whose 2015 election campaign was backed by the Unite trade union, is Corbyn’s fourth shadow business secretary – a key position, given the party’s hope of winning back its reputation for economic competence. The Brexit bill will now move on to the House of Lords, where Labour has tabled eight amendments. Angela Smith, Labour’s leader in the Lords, hopes to push the government to make a firmer commitment on giving parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal and to safeguard the rights of EU citizens. Lady Smith told the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast that she had no intention of being scared off by threats from the government about curtailing the powers of the Lords were it interfered. “We’re seeing particularly some Tory MPs almost harking back to the old westerns: this is High Noon and we’re going to have a gunslingers battle. That’s not how we operate,” she said. “People have personal views. I voted for remain, I campaigned for remain. It is inconceivable to me that having had a referendum and a House of Commons vote to invoke A50, that I as an unelected peer should say I think that’s wrong. And I think that’s the overwhelming view in the House of Lords. “I hope we don’t have this mock outrage, ‘it’s a constitutional disgrace’, if the House of Lords asks the House of Commons can you look at this again, which is basically the only power we have.” Diane Abbott, who voted with Corbyn’s three-line whip to back the Brexit bill on Wednesday night despite representing a strongly pro-remain seat, has said Labour fears a Scotland-style electoral meltdown in the north of England if it fails to back Brexit. Abbott, the shadow home secretary, says some polling suggested there was a risk that the party’s electoral support could collapse in some of its traditional heartlands if it appeared to be trying to block Brexit, just as voters deserted the party after the 2014 independence referendum in Scotland. She voted with Corbyn’s three-line whip on the third reading of the Brexit bill on Wednesday having missed the previous vote last week because of a migraine. She said the shadow cabinet had had “intense discussion” in recent days and one of the things that had swayed her was warnings about the electoral consequences of failing to abide by the result of the referendum. In an article for the Guardian, Abbott wrote: “There were voices within Labour that warned of a Scottish scenario. In Scotland, Labour voters who voted against the Labour line in the independence referendum have yet to return to voting for the Labour party. And there was some polling which seemed to reveal that the same scenario could play out in the north of England in the wake of Brexit.” Scotland returned 41 Labour MPs to Westminster at the 2010 general election and just one in 2015. Corbyn has not yet announced a replacement for Dawn Butler, who was shadow minister for diverse communities. He will also have to decide what action to take against more than 10 other frontbenchers who refused to back the bill and three of his whips, the MPs who are meant to impose party discipline. Corbyn has said he will be “lenient” and repeatedly stressed that he understood the concerns of MPs from remain-leaning areas. But backbenchers say they cannot remember a precedent for whips failing to support the party line and being let off scot-free. Labour sources said there were other forms of discipline that could be used to reprimand MPs, short of sacking them. Rather than being locked in a room in Westminster plotting the reshuffle, Corbyn spent Thursday touring the constituency of the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. In Lewis’s resignation letter released on Thursday morning but written before Wednesday night’s vote, the MP thanked Corbyn for discussing the issue of Brexit in an “open and comradely way” but he said he could not vote for the Brexit bill as Labour had not succeeded in amending it. “Our party, the Labour party, was right to attempt, through parliament, to win the protections the people of this country need,” Lewis wrote. “Unfortunately, despite the progress we did make, we have been unable to secure them.” Further announcements are expected before the weekend, with Jon Trickett, usually regarded as a key Corbyn ally, expected to lose oversight of the party’s election campaigns. Labour sources insisted Trickett remained a core member of the team and no one would be sacked or demoted, but stripping him of responsibility for election campaigns less than a fortnight before a pair of crucial by-elections, in Stoke-on-Trent and Copeland, would underline the anxiety in Corbyn’s inner circle about the party’s prospects. Trickett appears to be set to move into the role of shadow communities and local government secretary, a post previously held by Grahame Morris, who is receiving treatment for cancer, and temporarily filled since his illness by Teresa Pearce. When Morris returns, he is expected to slot into the shadow Defra post, Labour sources suggested. The job of equipping the party for elections looks likely to be shared by close Corbyn ally Ian Lavery, and Andrew Gwynne, who is already closely involved in the Copeland by-election. Trickett told the Guardian in December he was working 15-hour days to put Labour on an election footing and preparing to put Labour’s half a million members to work in an electoral ground war “on a scale this country hasn’t seen before”, if Theresa May called an early general election. But with the Tories pouring resources into the by-election battle in Copeland, in Cumbria, and Ukip leader Paul Nuttall standing in Stoke-on-Trent Central, there are concerns about the party’s likely performance – and how that may reflect on Corbyn’s leadership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/feb/09/tara-palmer-tomkinson-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T18:01:42Z","webTitle":"Tara Palmer-Tomkinson obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/09/tara-palmer-tomkinson-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/09/tara-palmer-tomkinson-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Tara Palmer-Tomkinson obituary","bodyText":"As a schoolgirl Tara Palmer-Tomkinson dreamed – so she would later tell an interviewer – of riding in the Grand National or becoming a concert pianist. Instead she became a 1990s version of the “It girl” (the original was the silent movie star Clara Bow), famous for being famous. Partying frenetically throughout the period, affluent and well-connected to the royal family, Palmer-Tomkinson rapidly became a gift for the media, and not just the tabloids. She was glamorous but friendly, accessible and witty with journalists: usually good for a quote and always willing to pose, usually in designer outfits, for photographers, however undignified they made her look. Her celebrity won her regular appearances in gossip columns during the 90s, a ghosted column in the Sunday Times Style section, headlined “Yah!” for a time, free sports cars and designer clothes from manufacturers keen to promote their brands, appearances on TV shows and confessional interviews with newspapers. There were also a couple of jokey books containing advice such as: “I would never go out with a man who turned right when boarding an aircraft.” Bizarrely, hers was even the face selling Walker’s Celebration crisps for a while and also Kentucky Fried Chicken. Yet Palmer-Tomkinson, who has been found dead in her Kensington flat at the age of 45, insisted in more recent interviews that her brittle gaucheness hid deeper insecurities and a lack of self-confidence disguised through the greatest period of fame 20 years ago by the intake of copious quantities of champagne and a £400-a-day cocaine habit. “They wanted a real Ab Fab person,” she told the Daily Mail in 2011. “That was only a small part of who I was.” Palmer-Tomkinson was the young- est of three children of Charles Palmer-Tomkinson, a Hampshire landowner and former British Olympic skier, and his wife, Patti Dawson, an Anglo-Argentin- ian former model who met her husband while working as a “chalet girl” in Switzerland. Tara’s father taught the Prince of Wales to ski in the 70s and the family have remained regular skiing and holidaying partners of the prince and his sons ever since. Patti was severely injured when during a holiday in 1988 the royal party was engulfed by an avalanche that killed Major Hugh Lindsay, an equerry, and injured the prince. Tara’s first brush with celebrity came when she was photographed by the paparazzi while giving the prince a chaste kiss at Klosters in 1995. She later boasted, inaccurately: “I have kissed Prince Charles every day since I was four,” but she was a friend to his sons and counselled Kate Middleton during her temporary separation from Prince William in 2008 before their marriage. Tara grew up on the family’s 1,200 acre Dummer Grange estate near Basingstoke, Hampshire, and was educated like her older sister, Santa, at Sherborne school for girls, Dorset, where she obtained nine O-levels and A-levels in English, art and ancient history. She was regarded as a talented pianist, though she never reached Grade 8, telling the Daily Mail last year that: “I couldn’t be bothered with all the boring technicalities of scales and arpeggios.” Instead of university, she enrolled for a dance and drama course at the London Studio Centre and worked, briefly, for Rothschild’s bank before becoming a model and, increasingly, as her celebrity blossomed, a fashionable woman about town. Flitting between parties and nightclubs on the arms of a succession of wealthy but transient boyfriends, she caught the eyes of the tabloid photo- graphers waiting outside and was soon given a column to chronicle her activities in the Sunday Times, staff on the paper crafting her words each week into usable copy. The Style section’s then editor, Jeremy Langmead, said: “She was amusing and self-deprecating in a bonkers way.” The column was popular but her unreliability was problematic. Celebrity came at a price, advances against the column were used to fuel her cocaine habit, her credit cards were removed because of mounting debts, and in 1999 her parents paid for her to go into rehab in Arizona for a month. Later the drug habit would require the surgical reconstruction of her nose after the septum collapsed. “Every time I come out of a loo cubicle people ask what she’s been doing in there,” Palmer-Tomkinson observed later, insisting she had not taken drugs for 10 years. The partying was gradually replaced by other media appearances on tele- vision, in which she displayed feistiness and wit. She was the runner-up in the inaugural series of I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here in 2002 and two years later she co-presented ITV2’s spinoff show with Mark Durden-Smith. She appeared on other popular TV shows such as Blind Date, Cold Turkey (about her attempt to give up smoking), Loose Women, Top of the Pops and Bognor or Bust. She was a patron of charities for the young bereaved and for autistic children helped by music. There were still occasional appearances in the gossip columns, as in 2014 when she was temporarily arrested after creating a scene at Heathrow airport and having to be restrained, but last November she revealed – characteristically in the Mail – that she had been diagnosed with a brain tumour and a growth on her pituitary gland and was scared of dying. She had become frail and reclusive and said: “I am not the person I was. I’m much calmer… the party world scares me. I am a very quiet person now. I have a better perspective on life.” Palmer-Tomkinson is survived by her parents, Santa, and her brother, James. • Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, television personality, born 23 December 1971; died 8 February 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/09/eu-must-shut-all-coal-plants-by-2030-to-meet-paris-climate-pledges-study-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T15:57:24Z","webTitle":"EU must shut all coal plants by 2030 to meet Paris climate pledges, study says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/09/eu-must-shut-all-coal-plants-by-2030-to-meet-paris-climate-pledges-study-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/09/eu-must-shut-all-coal-plants-by-2030-to-meet-paris-climate-pledges-study-says","fields":{"headline":"EU must shut all coal plants by 2030 to meet Paris climate pledges, study says","bodyText":"The European Union will “vastly overshoot” its Paris climate pledges unless its coal emissions are completely phased out within 15 years, a stress test of the industry has found. Coal’s use is falling by about 1% a year in Europe but still generates a quarter of the continent’s power – and a fifth of its greenhouse gas emissions. If Europe’s 300 coal plants run to the end of their natural lifespans, the EU nations will exceed their carbon budget for coal by 85%, according to a report by the respected thinktank Climate Analytics. It says the EU would need to stop using coal for electricity generation by 2030. “Not only would existing coal plants exceed the EU’s emissions budget, but the 11 planned and announced plants would raise EU emissions to almost twice the levels required to keep warming to the Paris agreement’s long term temperature goal,” said Dr Michiel Schaeffer, Climate Analytics science director. The report will feed into a review of the EU’s Paris targets next year, which could see the bloc’s planned emissions cuts raised significantly, in line with an aspirational 1.5C goal agreed at Paris. Artur Runge-Metzger, the EU’s lead negotiator at the Paris talks said that the bloc’s first estimates indicated that a 95% emissions cut would be needed by 2050 to cap warming at 1.5C, significantly higher than the 80% pledged in Paris. “We are not only looking at what is technically feasible but what is socially bearable and how we are really going to manage that kind of transition,” he said. Uncertainties stirred by the election of President Trump were causing “a lot of anxiety in the EU and that will spill over into the [low carbon] debate,” he added. But the commission is making contingency plans. “You always need to look at several scenarios at the same time to be prepared and not to be surprised,” Runge-Metzger told the Guardian. “It’s a little bit like playing chess, isn’t it?” Trump has promised a coal renaissance in the US rust belt but coal plants will have to be shut across the planet by 2050 to prevent dangerous warming, the study says, with China planning to mothball its coal industry by 2040. While the UK has Europe’s third highest capacity for coal, Germany and Poland are responsible for more than half of the EU’s coal emissions and will face the greatest challenges. Germany is postponing its coal phase-out plans until after elections later this year. Poland, which is preparing a legal challenge to the EU’s climate policy, argues that it can plant trees to offset coal emissions, and one day apply experimental carbon capture and storage technology (CCS). A Polish diplomatic source told the Guardian that Poland aimed to “develop the [carbon] sink potential of its forests as one of the most cost efficient ways to achieve the necessary reductions.” Steps in that direction will be closely monitored by the commission. “Will the numbers really work?” Runge-Metzger asked. “If you count [existing forests] against emissions, I’m not sure whether that calculation will work in the end. We will have to see additional removals from the air, from land use and forestry which have a certain permanence.” The UK on Wednesday recommitted to a coal phase-out by 2025 but environmentalists fear that “capacity payments” to seven coal plants worth £453m over the next four years could sabotage that deadline. Earlier this week, the government granted another £78m to keep coal plants open next year – including £10m for Aberthaw, which has repeatedly violated emissions limits, according to a European court ruling last September. James Thornton, the chief executive of the green law firm ClientEarth said that the UK’s plans were weak and filled with loopholes that coal operators could exploit to stay open. “The first place we should see proof of ambition is in government subsidies,” he said. “When these are cut, investors catch on. So why are we still seeing subsidies for fossil fuel capacity? “The government has not yet put its money where its mouth is,” he said Anti-coal campaigners have been buoyed by a recent vote in the Irish Dail to divest from all fossil fuels, and a decision by Danish energy giant Dong Energy to stop burning coal at its power stations by 2023. Coal accounted for 80% of Dong’s fuel supplies a decade ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/09/midsomer-murders-boxset","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T15:57:58Z","webTitle":"When the world gets you down, try a few Midsomer Murders | Emma Brockes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/09/midsomer-murders-boxset","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/09/midsomer-murders-boxset","fields":{"headline":"When the world gets you down, try a few Midsomer Murders","bodyText":"After binge-consuming bad news for two weeks I have given up, and now find myself bingeing instead on something designed to soothe the nerves but that, in its country of origin at least, has come to stand for something much gloomier: episode after episode of Midsomer Murders. It is hard to explain to American friends, some of whom have watched and admired the show, quite the nature of the disregard in which it is held. It is as slickly made as Inspector Morse, with the same am-dram overtones. John Nettles, who appeared in the first 80 – 80! – episodes, is the standard curmudgeonly turn-of-the-millennium British TV detective. The premise is ludicrous – with a body count that, over the years, exceeds the population of the village – but no more so than Miss Marple. And yet, uniquely among these titles, not only has Midsomer Murders become shorthand for a version of England considered narrow to the point of offensive, but also the idea of watching it is thought akin to slow death, like Songs of Praise but a thousand times worse. Not now, however. If the aim of escapism is to travel as far from one’s present condition as possible, then Midsomer Murders is the most outlandish journey I can make in one evening, back to a time of affable sexism and coded homophobia. A teacher sleeps with a pupil and the storyline lays the blame squarely on the latter. I had always imagined the broad appeal of the show to be that it took place in a “gentler time”, before everyone spoke in italics, but that’s not it at all. Watching Midsomer Murders is like finding an old copy of News of the World lying around in a Home Counties pub: all tarts and vicars and incest. It’s amazing. There are traditional comforts, too. Everyone in the show is an antiques dealer or a retired civil servant from Kent. They’re all called Phyllis or Iris or Dr Lessiter or Jennings, names that conjure what we might now call hideous whiteness, but that also speak to a genre of eccentrics and grotesques going back to Punch and Judy. And, as with any British crime show of more than 20 years’ vintage, there are a million cameos from people who went on to be famous (Emily Mortimer, Orlando Bloom, Hugh Bonneville), as well as grand old dames (Anna Massey, Honor Blackman) hamming it up one last time. I can’t discount the effect of the scenery, a sign of my incipient middle age or else the beginning of a breakdown, but either way, all those shots of hedgerows had me practically weeping. Mainly, however, it’s the show’s brazen self-confidence that is hard to resist. It was observed recently that Sherlock Holmes, in his latest iteration, had been forced into Mission: Impossible-type antics and even Miss Marple is rebranded simply as Marple, as if she’s going to take on Iron Man in a battle for St Mary Mead. Not so Barnaby and Troy, unfailingly smug, cosy, lightly ironic in the face of all deviance. One season down, 18 to go! Lay down your ‘weaponised’ Language sometimes fails us in the era of President Trump, and if normalisation is the watch-word, I’m also wary of its inverse, a kind of comic hyperbole that feels wrong when hyperbole and reality overlap. On this basis, I vote for a moratorium on two jokey formulations so worn out they have no further meaning, the suffix “industrial complex” (as in “bullshit industrial complex”) and the prefix “weaponised”. This week I saw a reference to Melissa McCarthy’s impression of Sean Spicer as having a “weaponised hostility”. Really, these days exaggeration is superfluous to need. He’s to diet for! It’s Valentine’s Day next week and in bookshops I’ve spotted themed Valentine’s sections featuring piles of weight-loss titles directed at women. That’s right, ladies: make yourself lovable by losing some weight. Otherwise, buy some chips and a novel, and settle for a lot of cold nights in with Netflix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2017/feb/11/attack-of-the-drones-sport-drone-racing","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-11T17:00:21Z","webTitle":"Attack of the drones: sport’s next big buzz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/11/attack-of-the-drones-sport-drone-racing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/feb/11/attack-of-the-drones-sport-drone-racing","fields":{"headline":"Attack of the drones: sport’s next big buzz","bodyText":"They have been responsible for innumerable deaths in the Middle East during the last decade and, if Amazon has its way, will deliver millions of toasters, gift sets and novels in the future. But recently drones have begun to fulfil a less utilitarian kind of role: competition in the nascent world of futuristic motorsports. A confluence of technological advances has made drone racing possible. A minuscule camera, mounted on the drone’s nose, allows the pilot, as competitors are luxuriously titled, to control the vehicle through virtual reality-style goggles, as if perched in its tiny cockpit. With powerful lithium batteries, the size of which dictates the speed class of the drone, these machines, which are typically the size of a box of tissues, can reach speeds in excess of 120mph. Studded with coloured LEDs, they fly like hyper-evolved, fluorescent mosquitoes and, thanks to their size and manoeuvrability, can make use of those areas of a sports stadium that are usually out of bounds: streaking over the pitch, for example, before grazing through a window, along a corridor and out again into the night sky. Impromptu courses can be set up anywhere. In September, during an event timed to coincide with the Paris Drone festival, pilots raced along the Champs-Élysées, watched by 150,000 spectators. Zealous entrepreneurs closely follow on the tail of any emerging sport. Each invariably hopes to corner the market by establishing the definitive league. “When I first started the Drone Racing League, once a week I had someone telling me they were launching their own league,” Nicholas Horbaczewski, co-founder of the DRL, told me. Horbaczewski watched his first drone race in a car park outside a Home Depot in New York City. “I thought: how do we elevate this to a level where we can put it on TV?” Since its founding in 2015, the DRL has attracted serious investment – $12 million to date, with high-profile investors ranging from New York’s Lux Capital to media partners such as MGM, ESPN and Sky Sports. Last week, Horbaczewski announced that the German insurer Allianz would sponsor the DRL’s 2017 championship, the final event of which will be staged at London’s Alexandra Palace in the summer. It’s a legitimising deal. Allianz is a major investor in Formula 1 racing, football (the company has bought the naming rights to six stadia around the world, some of which will be used in the forthcoming DRL championship) and a sponsor of tennis, golf and swimming tournaments. “What Red Bull has done with extreme sports is what we want to do with digital sports,” explained Allianz’s Jean-Marc Pailhol. “We want to make drone racing one of the main sports in the world.” There are major obstacles standing in the way. Filming high-speed drones, zipping through courses as tall as they are wide, is an enormous broadcasting challenge (one tough enough to prevent the DRL championship from being broadcast live on Sky this year). Then there are significant technical concerns. The ultimate aim is to allow spectators to pull on their own headset in order to watch the action from the perspective of their favourite drone. Finally, there’s the need for sufficient money in the ecosystem to support young pilots so that they can afford the time off work to compete. “Executing successfully is extraordinarily difficult,” said Horbaczewski. “You have to be a tech firm, a media company and a sports league all rolled into one.” Then there’s the issue of competition. Horbaczewski claims that with the emergence of the DRL, drone racing is a “professional sport now”. Rival leagues, he said, have faded away and, in the DRL, there is “finally a well-organised sports league”. These claims are vigorously disputed by Richard de Aragüés, director of the 2011 documentary film TT3D: Closer to the Edge and founder of the British drone racing team Tornado XBlades Racing. “This is far from a one-horse race and many of us close to the sport feel the DRL press claims are somewhat misleading,” he told me. In the US, for example, the rival DR1 league has TV deals in place with Eurosport, Discovery and the Science Channel and is backed by the vast commercial clout of PepsiCo. While the DRL supplies a standardised drone to its pilots, the DR1 follows Formula 1’s approach, allowing teams to customise their craft. While the DRL is strictly indoorsy, the DR1 also stages races in outdoor venues: castles, abandoned mines and ravines. There are differences, then, but not along the amateur/professional divide. “DRL is definitely not the only professional drone racing league,” a spokeswoman for the DR1 said. Three of the top-ranked British drone pilots, including current world champion, Luke Bannister, are all members of De Aragüés’s team. While 16-year-old Bannister was too young to race in the DRL, team-mates Gary Kent, winner of the French Drone Nationals race, and Mac Poschwald, a Drone Champions League champion, both turned down DRL contracts. The small print, according to De Aragüés, forbids signees from having any third-party sponsorship. This has ruled out any of the top Korean players from signing to the DRL, as companies typically fund them as an investment opportunity. “The sponsorship deals some of our team members already have in place are worth more than the $10,000 annual salary that was offered by the DRL,” De Aragüés said. It’s not just the money. The DRL contract reportedly forbids pilots from racing in any non-DRL competitions that create content, such as broadcast footage, from the event, a move presumably intended to squeeze out the competition. “We would have loved to have participated in their league,” said De Aragüés. “But not to the exclusion of the other leagues and sponsors.” The result is that in 2017, many of the most successful pilots in drone racing are absent from the DRL’s roster. “It would be like the ATP tennis championship not having Federer or Nadal participating,” said De Aragüés. Horbaczewski is eager to downplay the absence of top names such as Shaun Taylor and Minchan Kim from his league. “Although there is a broad ecosystem of drone racing events out there, they are all sort of amateur events,” he said. “So it’s very tough to say what other events represent a talent pool we can rely on. Each event is several days long. This must be a full-time occupation for the pilots.” But for 27-year-old Matthew Evans, one of the few European players to sign to the DRL, being a full-time pilot is, for now, just a dream. “I still have to work full time as a software engineer, so I have to try to juggle my time very carefully,” he told me. “I know some of the people who turned the contract down and I think that just came down to personal circumstances. It depends what’s going on in your life, what other championships you want to take part in.” The winner of DRL’s inaugural championship in 2016 won a $100,000 contract. But for drone racing’s financial backers, the risks and potential rewards are far greater. Until winners and losers are settled, the rivalry off the pitch will be just as keen as on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/feb/09/kingsmill-massacre-no-charges-against-man-linked-to-palm-print","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T14:15:41Z","webTitle":"Kingsmill massacre: no charges against man linked to palm print","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/09/kingsmill-massacre-no-charges-against-man-linked-to-palm-print","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/feb/09/kingsmill-massacre-no-charges-against-man-linked-to-palm-print","fields":{"headline":"Kingsmill massacre: no charges against man linked to palm print","bodyText":"A man whose palm print was allegedly found on a van suspected to have been used for a getaway in the 1976 Kingsmill massacre in Northern Ireland will not be prosecuted, it has been confirmed. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said on Thursday there was not enough evidence to bring charges against the unnamed 59-year-old man over the murder of 10 Protestants in south Armagh. A spokesperson said: “We have concluded that there is no reasonable prospect of a conviction based on the available evidence and that the test for prosecution is therefore not met. “We are mindful of the disappointment that this decision will bring to the surviving victim and families of those who were killed. Although 41 years have passed since this atrocity, we are conscious that their pain endures.” The massacre happened at Kingsmill, close to the border village of Bessbrook, in January 1976. One Catholic who was travelling with his Protestant colleagues was allowed to flee the scene. Only Protestant, Alan Black, survived despite being shot 18 times. A group claiming to be the South Armagh Republican Action Group claimed responsibility for the atrocity, but an investigation by a police historical inquiries team concluded in 2011 that in fact members of the Provisional IRA’s Armagh Brigade murdered the workers in retaliation for loyalist murders of Catholics in the county. Danny Kennedy, an Ulster Unionist assembly member for Newry and Armagh who knows many of the Kingsmill families, expressed disappointment over the PPS decision. “The families and the sole survivor have waited over 40 years in their pursuit of maximum truth and justice for this brutal and barbaric sectarian crime, so the news that the PPS has decided not to prosecute the suspect whose palm print was found on a vehicle believed to be used by the IRA gunmen responsible for the Kingsmill massacre is indeed a setback,” he said. “I will be seeking clarification on whether or not all the available evidence has been completely and exhaustively explored in relation to the palm print. It is scarcely credible that this case has not been able to move forward as a result of this potential evidence.” Black said he hoped an ongoing inquest may shine some new light on the atrocity, for which no one has ever been prosecuted. “Unless the gunmen take an attack of conscience and come forward, I doubt we will get all the truth, but we may get some,” he said. “I am hopeful that we will get some answers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/feb/10/whoopi-goldberg-secret-cinema-top-things-uk-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T09:00:47Z","webTitle":"Whoopi Goldberg to Secret Cinema: top things to do in the UK this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/feb/10/whoopi-goldberg-secret-cinema-top-things-uk-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/feb/10/whoopi-goldberg-secret-cinema-top-things-uk-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Whoopi Goldberg to Secret Cinema: top things to do in the UK this week","bodyText":"Comedy Whoopi Goldberg A brilliant one-off: the award-winning actor brings two performances of her character comedy to the London Palladium for the first time on Saturday 11 February.

That’s not because one in eight people in the US over the age of two will eat pizza on any given day. It’s because, unlike other food groups, the chance an American will eat a slice doesn’t vary much by gender or race. Today is National Pizza Day, so we took a look at data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Their most recent pizza study, published in 2014, shows that 21% of white Americans aged two to 19 will eat pizza on any given day; for black and Hispanic Americans, that figure is almost identical, at 20%. Men eat more pizza than women, but not by much: 15% of men, compared with 11% of women. The only factor which seems to affect pizza intake is age. Americans aged six to 19 are four times more likely to be found eating pizza than those over 60. The USDA also asks people to complete detailed food diaries to find out what they are eating when. Pizza for dinner is uncommon – most people eat pizza as a snack (59%) or as lunch (28%), and 2% of the country eats it as breakfast. Many other food groups look very different in the numbers. Take soda, for example: Americans consume more cola than juice, but that varies significantly by race and income. Black and Mexican adults get 60% more of their calories from sugary drinks than white Americans. There isn’t much historical data available on pizza consumption. So we looked for clues elsewhere. The USDA has data going back to 1909 showing how much of which cheeses have been consumed. Overall, total cheese consumption has risen remarkably, but one stands out: per capita consumption of mozzarella was seven times higher in 1994 than it was in 1970."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/09/dubs-child-refugees-calais-theresa-may-deception-cruel-people-smugglers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T13:59:28Z","webTitle":"I work with child refugees in Calais.

Lord Dubs and his supporters had suggested the UK could potentially help 3,000 of the most vulnerable children in Europe - there are estimated to be 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across the continent as a whole, including thousands who wait in the camps of Greece and Italy, described by Unicef as “alone and extremely vulnerable”. In itself, 3,000 was a modest and achievable number. But now, it emerges, we will be taking only 350 – including 200 who have already come over from the refugee camp in Calais – and we will then slam shut the door. I worked with the organisation Safe Passage, and volunteer for the charity Help Refugees, and I’m not surprised our government has dodged its responsibility to lone refugee children – it’s been attempting to do this since the beginning. From May, when the amendment passed, until October, when the eviction of the camp in Calais commenced, our government took no action to safeguard children or fast-track their transfer to the UK. It was only after the fires in the Calais camp, the mayhem that ensued, and its eventual demolition, that children were sent to accommodation centres across France to be interviewed by the UK Home Office. I visited 14 of these centres and found children with one goal – safe arrival in the UK. They were totally distressed by the lack of information they had received. In some centres the mental health of children was visibly deteriorating: they were self-harming and not eating, running away from state protection and back on to the road. Children who had been relocated to these centres were told they would be given a fair opportunity to make their case for transfer to the UK and have their “best interests” assessed. But when the Home Office began to conduct interviews, the goal posts were moved. The Dubs amendment stated that “the best interests of children” would be foremost in decisions made about their transfer. Instead, in a move criticised by the independent anti-slavery commissioner, the government didn’t consider an eligibility framework centred on “best interest” – one that considered trauma, mental health, risk of abuse or of trafficking. It decided to discriminate specifically on the basis of age and nationality, only considering refugees under 12, or Syrian and Sudanese refugees under 15 – completely disregarding the needs of Afghan teenagers fleeing the Taliban, Eritrean boys fleeing conscription, and 16- and 17-year-old refugees too young to legally drink alcohol or vote, but apparently old enough to be considered not especially vulnerable. This decision by the Home Office ruled out the majority of those unaccompanied refugee children who had been evicted from Calais. The immigration minister gave a nod to those left behind in France, stating that “all children not transferred to the UK are in the care of the French authorities”. Except they are not. For the past few weeks I have been back in Calais, helping with night patrols, driving the streets looking for children who are hiding from the authorities under bridges and in the woods around town. More and more arrive each day. With volunteers from Help Refugees and Utopia 56, I bring these children hot food, a mug of tea, and a sleeping bag or an extra pair of socks to help them survive the sub-zero temperatures. More than 150 of them are in Calais, according to Utopia 56, which has been registering children. Everywhere I look in Calais I’m greeted by familiar faces – young boys and girls I knew from the demolished camp who have returned here. They are despondent and broken. Riot police patrol the area, seeking out children in the side streets and sleeping in bushes. They wait outside the train station in the centre of town to trap returnees. They destroy the shelters that children construct in the woods, take their sleeping bags and fire tear-gas into hiding places. Utopia 56 estimates over 80% of the children they have seen return to Calais are originally from the Horn of Africa. It is the Eritrean children our government has especially deceived. Last March a delegation of UK officials met the Eritrean government with the intention of coming to an agreement on reducing migration. They offered aid money in return for a promised softening of human rights abuses – this softening never materialised. As a result of new guidance the Home Office put out in response to this agreement, the percentage of successful asylum claims by Eritreans dropped. The Home Office now had the grounds to refuse to consider lone Eritrean children from Calais. And they’re back here, climbing on to trucks, risking their lives to reach the UK by “illegal” means. Some of them will be successful, but not all. A 16-year-old Eritrean boy called Dawit phoned me after reaching the UK in the back of a refrigerated truck. His travel companion had to be taken to hospital with hypothermia, after the truck was stopped by the British police. Boys show me rips in their clothing and lacerations and bruises they’ve received in their attempts. And then there are those who don’t make it. Last week it was John Sina, a 20-year-old Ethiopian boy, barely out of his teenage years, who was hit by several trucks on the motorway, and killed. Last July a 19-year-old Eritrean called Samarwit was killed in a hit-and-run; in September a 14-year-old Afghan, Raheemullah Oryakhel, fell off a lorry and was struck by a car; and on Christmas Eve a 17-year-old Congolese boy fell from the undercarriage of a truck as it boarded a ferry in Dunkirk, and was crushed. Who do children in Calais now turn to? They barely trust the UK charities that supported the Dubs amendment. The charities put their faith in the rule of law, expecting that an agreement made in parliament would hold true. But the government’s failure has created a vacuum that will be filled by criminal people-smugglers, the only resort many of these children now feel they have. The government is treating these children like an immigration statistic to be reduced. If the government is unwilling to act in the best interests of these children, then it is responsible when a child turns to a smuggler, goes missing, or is hit by a truck. We, the British people, have the willpower, and the public support to tackle this issue, yet Theresa May has chosen not to. Our government has utterly failed these children."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2017/feb/09/david-to-picasso-ashmoleanrise-of-modernism-ursula-stanley-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T17:58:29Z","webTitle":"David to Picasso – stellar cast helps Ashmolean chart rise of Modernism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/feb/09/david-to-picasso-ashmoleanrise-of-modernism-ursula-stanley-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/feb/09/david-to-picasso-ashmoleanrise-of-modernism-ursula-stanley-johnson","fields":{"headline":"David to Picasso – stellar cast helps Ashmolean chart rise of Modernism","bodyText":"Drawings and paintings by artists including Degas, Cézanne, Manet, Monet and Picasso are to go on display for the first time in the UK in an exhibition telling the bumpy, complex story of the rise of Modernism. More than 100 works by more than 40 artists are part of a show opening on Friday at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, all from the private collection of the Chicago art dealer Stanley Johnson and his wife, Ursula. It is the first time the works have been shown in the UK and the first time anywhere that the collection has been exhibited as a whole. The museum’s director, Xa Sturgis, said in some ways the show was telling a well-known story, “a story of extraordinary artistic invention and experiment” in the 150 years leading up to the second world war. “What is exciting about this show is that though the story might be familiar, very few of the works themselves are. There are so many exciting discoveries to be made within the exhibition and that is because it is told through the prism of a private collection.” Referring to the exhibition, Ursula Johnson said for her and her husband it was like they were seeing the works for the first time. “Because they are hung so differently, the light is different, the relationships between the works are so different. I am making connections and thinking, ‘How did I never see that?’” she added. German-born Ursula Johnson met her future husband, American-born Stanley, in 1957. They were students in Paris in the 1960s when they began collecting what are some of the biggest names in art. Some works were affordable, others less so. “We actually worked one full year in order to be be able to afford that little thing,” she said, pointing to a small but dramatic and violent Géricault watercolour of a lion fighting a tiger. The remarkable collection has been steadily built up by the couple. “The discerning eye is a big part of the deal,” said Stanley Johnson. “We are dealing with European art so who are our competitors? They are European dealers, European collectors, so we had to beat them at their own game. We had to be more sophisticated, more knowledgable and have a better eye.” He said it was always the collection that decided what was going to be bought next. “People might say what a wonderful collection you have but we wouldn’t see it that way. We’d see it as a collection of works in which there is one horrible, hideous, ugly, gaping hole which must be filled … so now we are beating the pavement finding the work that we need to have to fill the hole.” The exhibition aims to plot a course from neoclassical and romantic artists such as David, Ingres and Delacroix to impressionists and post-impressionists such as Degas, Monet and Seurat – and then on to the wild and game changing experiments of Braque and Picasso. The David drawings include one of an old man and a young woman which was once owned by Henry Moore; while the Picasso works include an early study for his monumental Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, which hangs in MoMA’s permanent collection in New York. • Degas to Picasso, Creating Modernism in France 10 February to 7 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2017/feb/13/brighton-hove-children-kids-sights-museums-cafes","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-13T06:30:06Z","webTitle":"City breaks with kids: Brighton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/feb/13/brighton-hove-children-kids-sights-museums-cafes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/feb/13/brighton-hove-children-kids-sights-museums-cafes","fields":{"headline":"City breaks with kids: Brighton","bodyText":"I’m bored! Brighton’s Palace Pier may be the city’s most iconic landmark but in my experience a trip there with kids rarely ends well. It’s not just that the rides are expensive – though they truly are: £4.50 for the log flume, £2.50 for the carousel or unlimited ride wristbands £70 for a family of four – it’s that the rides are also short. As soon as they finish one, your children are tugging at your arm for another go, or pulling you towards the ice cream kiosk or the churros stand or the sweet shop. The structure itself oozes faded seaside glamour or, in kids’ eyes, bright noisy flashing stuff, but it’s most excitingly viewed from below, on a boat tour (£8.50 adult, £6.60 under-16s, Watertours.co.uk) which my children, aged four and six, both love. Trips lasts for around 45 minutes and run from mid-March to November except in stormy seas. With slightly older children you could hire a kayak or standup paddleboard (from £10 an hour, Brighton Watersports) and play about in the sea between the Palace Pier and the eerily beautiful skeleton wreck of the West Pier. The best place to see the West Pier is from i360 observation tower (adult £13.50, 4-16 £6.75). Weekends and Wednesdays in summer, and Sundays in all school holidays, there’s a free Punch and Judy show at the bottom of the i360, run by Professor Glyn Edwards, who has been performing the act for 50 years. Parents may roll their eyes but my kids guffaw the whole way through. Another firm seafront favourite for children is the historic Volks Electric Railway train, which starts just east of the Palace Pier at the end of Madeira Drive and runs along the coast for a mile. It has open-air carriages and goes past the nudist beach, which always makes my kids giggle, even though a strategic mound of pebbles protects the modesty of bathers. It’s the world’s oldest electric railway, opened in 1883. It’s temporarily closed for refurbishment but should reopen in the early summer of 2017. My eldest son likes Brighton Museum’s World Stories treasure trail at the Royal Pavilion (one adult and two children £8.20) and learning about the pharaohs in the Ancient Egypt gallery. Both enjoy the Toy and Model Museum (£14 for two adults and three kids), mostly to watch the giant 1930s train set in action, although they also enjoy the old-fashioned teddy bears, Meccano sets and penny arcade games, especially the one where the puppets can be made to dance. A more surprising hit with my family is the Booth Museum of Natural History, a short way inland from the seafront on Dyke Road. It was originally a Victorian collector’s private museum and entry is free, though donations are encouraged. I’ll always find it slightly uncomfortable to be surrounded by stuffed dead animals, but my kids on the other hand were in their element. Their eyes widened at the giant brown bear mother and cub at the entrance and then galloped excitedly from one exhibit to another. My younger son liked the lion, zebra and the extinct Tasmanian tiger best, while his elder brother was more in to the rare owls, ospreys and eagles. We also saw the bones of a dodo and a sinister-looking python skeleton. Where are all the other kids? While few kids will tire of paddling on Brighton’s long stretch of pebble beach, which is lifeguarded from May to September, and skimming stones into the sea, under-fives will also love the paddling pools at Kings Road playground, just west of the i360, and at Hove Lagoon, an easy 15-minute cycle along the seafront to the west. Hove Lagoon also has a popular skate park, playground, wakeboard cable and watersports centre and Norman Cook’s Big Beach Café. My kids love it there but their favourite playground in summer is The Level close to the centre of Brighton, mainly because it has fountains people can dance about in on hot days and the city’s most imaginative playground. They stand awestruck watching the local skateboarders and BMXers in the skate park. We love cycling along the seafront as a family. Bikes can be hired from Amsterdammers’ by Brighton station, from £7 for adult-and-child bikes for three hours. It also has cargo bikes and kids’ seats. And from summer 2017 the city will have its own bike share scheme. Most visitors to Brighton barely move much beyond the Palace Pier and the Lanes so if you take a short cycle in either direction the crowds will quickly thin out. Our two favourite rides are west to Hove Lagoon (as mentioned above) and east to Ovingdean, passing the boats at Brighton Marina, and along the dramatic chalk undercliff path (shared with pedestrians). I’m hungry There are plenty of places offering good value breakfasts in Brighton. Try Little Miss Piggies in Kemptown for fry-ups, Joe’s Café inland towards Preston Park for breakfast hashes and milkshakes. My boys love the pancakes at Moksha Caffe on York Place by St Peter’s Church. I also like the zero -waste ethics of Silo, so we sometimes go there for porridge or honey toast. In Hove, the banana bread and crumpets at Treacle are delicious, and the Monmouth coffee is great. The Hidden Pantry also has good brunch and lunch options for kids (sausage and fish finger sandwiches). Our favourite lunch haunts include La Choza, which can get busy, but the quesadillas, and crispy fish burritos are excellent. My boys are also rather taken by the burgers at Lucky Beach on the seafront. There are lots of amazing veggie restaurants. The focaccia pizza and halloumi burgers at Food for Friends are favourites of ours. Planet India does lovely vegetarian curries and the Infinity Foods Café and Iydea are also good options. The chain restaurants Pho, Leon (both close to the Lanes) and pizza joint Fatto A Mano (in Hove and on London Road) are reasonably priced fall-back options. I’m tired Strawberry Fields is a bright and cosy B&amp;B just off the seafront in Kemptown. Its attic rooms are great for families and start at £45 a night. The YHA is centrally located and good for Brighton style on a budget: family rooms start at £29. The Holiday Inn may not be the most exciting brand in the business but the Brighton one is right on the seafront and many rooms have stunning sea views. Family rooms start at £77. Brighton is very much an Airbnb hotspot. It’s the company’s second most popular English city for rentals after London (it’s fourth overall in the UK, after Edinburgh and Glasgow) and there are plenty of cool spaces for families on a budget. If you can’t find what you want for your money in Brighton, look west towards Hove. From there, buses to Brighton are quick and frequent, or it’s an easy 10-minute cycle or stroll along the seafront."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/11/bettany-hughes-working-day-where-history-happened","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-11T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"Bettany Hughes: ‘I cannot write about the past unless I go where history happened’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/11/bettany-hughes-working-day-where-history-happened","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/11/bettany-hughes-working-day-where-history-happened","fields":{"headline":"Bettany Hughes: ‘I cannot write about the past unless I go where history happened’","bodyText":"My father, who is now 94, was an actor. The prime thing he taught us as children was to walk through the world with our eyes open. I don’t remember him telling me, I just remember knowing. So as soon as I wake, I look and I think. Sometimes at night I think, too – and that is usually a bad thing. Dragged thoughts from half-shut eyes are diabolic or diminished creatures – growling with anxiety or, in the morning, punier than you imagined them to be. A dear friend Nicholas Egon gave me my waking view; a painting of the tree outside his London home. Nicholas is a fine artist, traveller and raconteur – so with the cherry blossom come his stories of rattling around the Middle East as a war artist, or living in a tent on Magdalen college cricket pitch after the second world war because he couldn’t afford the college bills. The painting reminds me to be in two times at once. My best writing day starts with coffee from our local Cypriot cafe and a newspaper from the Tamil corner shop – they always ask what I’m up to, and why I haven’t brushed my hair – then a short, sharp walk. I think as I go. Humans have long been migrants. Physiologically we are nomads and the brain responds to walking – I solve all kinds of problems, personal and historical on the move. So that’s a good day. A more typical day starts with a 5.30am dash to finish off a script or emails before breakfast for children, random house guests, tortoises, rabbits, a cat. Then frustrating attempts to stop the cat editing the touchscreen with her tail. I cannot write about the past unless I go where history happened. Some make very good armchair historians, I’m not one of them. If you’re going to inhabit someone else’s world, the very least you can do is to spend a little time in it. So my words almost always start al fresco as impressions and ideas that are then set down in notebooks. I have scores and scores of these notebooks in my study. The journals have become little archaeological fragments in their own right – crunching with the mud of Göbekli Tepe in Turkey or coffee splashes from Egypt or grass seed from the Steppes. For 30 years I’ve travelled to historically plangent places to write: documentaries followed later as another way to communicate that privileged, exhilarating experience. This peripatetic existence means that next to my children and my health, those notebooks are the most precious thing I own. I’ve only ever lost one. A wonderful woman tracked me down by Sherlocking together the clues on the pages and the book was returned unharmed. She got the most expensive bottle of wine I’ve ever bought. I have an illogical fear of being separated from those notebooks. They are somehow proof that I’m alive. My second writing shift starts after dark. When the children were young it was the way I could get in a 12-hour day: 6am to 2pm (cycle home, spend a few hours dressed as a wasp or Viking – the things that being a parent requires), then back at my desk 9pm to 1am. I’d like to think they didn’t notice I was absent in my head, working, but they called my Helen of Troy “that treacherous book”. The perfidy of writing is ingrained. Studying the Spartans for years has given me a fascination with the elevation of denial and so I have a natural inclination to make things harder than strictly necessary. I tend not to read general works on the period I’m studying until about two thirds of the way through writing any new history. I want to come to the evidence/archive/archaeology fresh. But then I’ll discover that the genius original thought I’d imagined I’d had has been had before. So I have to start from scratch to give the reader something new. My guilty pleasure at the end of the day is an old thesaurus. I know that can lead to overwriting, but if words such as lambent, pyretic and boscy exist, how sad they should stay recondite. These word-ideas move a narrative sideways as well as forwards – a trick perfected by Homer, whose wisdom-bright metaphors transport us from blasted battlefields to the tenderness of a nursing mother. I sleep with a replica early Greek tablet and a digital tablet on the shelf by my bed. If one, 2,800 years ago, created the common reader, wouldn’t it be splendid if the other could nurture the common thinker? • Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities by Bettany Hughes is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.

I can’t say that I’m suffering too much, in this, the Great Iceberg Lettuce Shortage. Even before I discovered that at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, they serve a dish called Mr Trump’s Wedge Salad (of which iceberg lettuce is, we hope and pray, the primary ingredient), I wasn’t too keen on the stuff. But in any case, in these parts there’s no sign at all of a crisis. My local corner shop currently has three outside it, albeit a touch yellow at the edges, and the amazing greengrocer up the road – the one that was once in Vogue – still has trays of the things, not to mention all the other veg (aubergines, broccoli, courgettes) of which the bad weather in Spain is supposed to be depriving us. What does this mean? Is the Great Iceberg Lettuce Shortage an example of fake news? Or is it just that I live in a place where people would rather eat rocket? Let’s assume, though, that somewhere desperate lettuce hounds are indeed waving 50-quid notes at supermarket staff. Aren’t such shortages in reality a good thing? As experts (I know, I know) such as Professor Tim Lang of City University have already taken the trouble to point out, Brexit is likely to have a momentous effect on the food we buy. Food stocks in Britain are low: an estimated three to five days’ worth; our self-sufficiency stands at only 61%; we get 30% of our food from the EU. Meanwhile, a lot of what we do produce here is picked and packaged by foreign workers. In the long term, we need to start worrying about the way food production affects climate change and vice versa. In the short term, prices are likely to rise dramatically. Basically, we need to start thinking about food security pronto, and if it’s the want of a bowl of winter ratatouille that focuses minds, then so be it. Brexiteers of a nostalgic bent (quite possibly most of them) might, at this point, usefully ponder the war, and the measures that led to a period of rationing that would last 14 years. These, remember, were born of panic and desperate need, not national saintliness. If people were stoical, they were frequently ravenously hungry, too. How fantastic it would be if we could only fix it for Andrea “let-young-British-people-pick-our-cherries” Leadsom, the secretary of state for agriculture, to spend six months living on such delights as hasty pudding (ingredients: six tablespoons of oatmeal, three of suet, a pint of cold water, and one onion or parsnip) and the occasional tin of pilchards. Imagine the good it would do her. She might even stop going on about all the naan bread we are going to export to India in this bright new future of ours. Until now, we’ve had a false sense of security, all kinds of foods having seemingly been readily available to us at all times of the year, and at artificially low prices to boot. Of course it’s a little bit great that fresh lemongrass is so common now as to be boring. But variety has spoiled us, too. We crave certain dazzling flavours, and consider instant gratification – tonight: green beans from Kenya! – almost to be a right. Think, though, of leeks in wintertime, cooked in butter until they are soft and sweet and yielding. How much lovelier they are than a salad sprayed with pomegranate seeds and olive oil, however much your vitamin D-deprived soul longs for such a thing. That salad will taste better – just right – come the early summer. This isn’t only a matter of seasonality. A pleasure deferred is a pleasure extended, as anyone who is addicted to English asparagus will tell you (only nine weeks to go). What we need now, perhaps, is for our new circumstances and a certain kind of modishness somehow to collide, for people to start thinking of, say, swede and turnips – grown here so easily in season – in the same way that they thought of the horrible tasteless pumpkins and dishes with too much sumac in them that edged them off our menus in the first place. Personally, I don’t think this unlikely. I keep thinking of kale, ubiquitous now in our supermarkets and restaurants. In the 80s, when my dad sowed what we always called curly kale on his allotment, he did so because you saw it in the shops only rarely then. No one wanted it – or at least, they wanted it a great deal less than they did spring greens and celery. Though it grew like wildfire, huge dark green trees that we sometimes struggled to carry home as children, it was – honestly, kids – to us a distinctly exotic vegetable. We spoke of it rather snobbishly, and ate it with pride and Yorkshire puddings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/10/fifty-shades-darker-review-jamie-dornan-el-james-dakota-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T07:43:13Z","webTitle":"Fifty Shades Darker review – submissive sequel offers little light relief but lots of washing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/10/fifty-shades-darker-review-jamie-dornan-el-james-dakota-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/10/fifty-shades-darker-review-jamie-dornan-el-james-dakota-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Fifty Shades Darker review – submissive sequel offers little light relief but lots of washing","bodyText":"This is a chaste age at the cinema. La La Land may be sold on its leads’ sizzling chemistry, but Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone remain strictly zipped throughout. Film fans in search of titillation are unlikely to be sated by Loving’s snuggles or Moonlight’s angsty, unseen intimacy. In tilting for Oscars, contenders are emulating the statuettes’ anatomy. Enter Fifty Shades Darker, the second instalment of EL James’s shamelessly mainstream sadomasochist romance. Finally, a funnel for all that lust. But the only thing aroused by this headache of a movie is a desire to see Sam Taylor-Johnson back at the reins. Somehow, in 2015, she transformed James’s appalling porn into something watchable. She coached charming performances from Dakota Johnson as bookish graduate Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as deranged but dishy billionaire Christian Grey. She then departed the franchise, apparently in reaction to the author’s whip-cracking. In her place: the slavish duo of James Foley (House of Cards) as director and Niall Leonard (Mr EL James, coincidentally) in charge of the script. Submission might turn on our hero – and, perhaps, his creator – but it does not make for a gripping film. The plotless pant of the novel is faithfully recreated, as Christian wins Anastasia back by renouncing bondage unless she’s really, really up for it, then various peripheral figures – a former submissive, old flame Kim Basinger, Anastasia’s hot rotter of a boss – try to force them apart. Spliced between such drama come the sex scenes, steamy as a greasy spoon and almost as erotic. Fifty Shades’s chief way of proving how dirty it is seems to be making its stars take endless showers – which inevitably leads to more sex, and so a terrible cycle of shagging and washing. A few leather cuffs do pop up, but they’re unbuckled fast so the missionary position can be better adopted. Nipple clamps put in an appearance, but only on fingers. The most outre it gets is our heroine going to a party wearing a couple of silver balls in a place that doesn’t really show them off (Anastasia: “You’re not putting those in my butt.” Christian: “They’re not for your butt”). Yet even these are just a warm-up act for some standard-issue humping, beneath, of all things, a poster for The Chronicles of Riddick. Taylor-Johnson’s genius was to handle such batty trash with pace and class. This time round, there’s neither. The sex comes suddenly, like someone else’s drinks – all blow-out, no build-up. Christian is so accomplished he can bring Anastasia to the brink of orgasm fully clad in a crowded lift which isn’t going far and whose muzak is Van Morrison. “Deep down inside me,” explains Anastasia in the book after this sort of thing, “sweet joy unfurls like a morning glory in the early dawn.” On film, we just get a grin and a gasp. Other events are similarly quick; Fifty Shades Darker features the most abrupt helicopter crash of all time. As the movie progresses, so cohesion further loosens and we descend into soap. One woman gets not only a martini in the face but also a slap chaser. This incompetence is entertaining until you consider the psychology. Anastasia seems almost as unhinged as her boyfriend, forever chopping and changing between being captivated by his behaviour and clocking he’s a psychopath. Her rationale for sticking with him is also worrisome: his main rival turns out to be, deep down, just as disturbed. If all men are sadists, you might as well go for one with money. A final word for a late scene featuring acrobatic shots of Christian in his penthouse gym, atop a pommel horse.

Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, and organ transplants are no longer possible. Even simple surgery is too risky to contemplate, while epidemics triggered by deadly bacteria have left our health services helpless. It is science fiction, of course – but only just. According to many doctors and scientists, the rise of antibiotic resistance across the planet could soon make this grim scenario a reality. And if it does, humans will have to face up to challenges that would once have seemed unthinkable. The question is: when – and how – might this horrific medical ordeal unfold for the human race? It is a question that crime writer Val McDermid will attempt to answer next month in an unusual way – in a three-part radio drama, Resistance, which is to be aired on Radio 4. In it she will put dramatic flesh on scientific warnings of the hazards we now face because of our past misuse of antibiotics. “We are looking down a barrel, into a world that was like the one we had when there were no antibiotics,” says McDermid. “We face returning to a time when every form of surgery was life-threatening, because every form of surgery carries with it the danger of infections. Even going to the dentist to have a tooth out will have risks involved.” The issue of antibiotics resistance is not new. There have been many powerful, well-made documentaries on the issue. But a drama series on the subject represents a very different approach. “The point about drama is that it has the power to tell a personal story – to put us in the shoes of the people to whom this is happening,” McDermid argues. “Potentially, it will have more impact because the listener is thinking, ‘That could be me, my family, my neighbours or my friends.’ ” Resistance is the end product of a workshop on anti-microbial resistance – organised by the Wellcome Trust – that was attended by scientists, writers and radio producers. “They threw us all in a room, gave us a couple of talks, then let us chat about what the future might look like,” says one of the show’s science advisers, Christopher Dowson, professor of microbiology at Warwick University. The end result was McDermid’s pitch to the BBC about an outbreak of a deadly epidemic that is spread by a microbial agent that acquires antibiotic resistance. “I was profoundly shocked about what I learned about antimicrobial resistance at the workshop,” adds McDermid. “We have not developed any new antibiotics since the 1980s. We have just gone to the cupboard and taken out the next one – to the point that the cupboard is now bare.” It is a global problem, of course, and that poses real headaches for a dramatist, adds McDermid. “Trying to convey the scale of something like this while still keeping the drama on a human level is very tricky. Listeners have to engage with the characters. They have to care about them. Combining that with the urgency of such a global threat is really challenging.” To get round this problem McDermid has placed a journalist – to be played by Gina McKee – at the centre of the action in Resistance. “She is there at the start of the whole thing. She has a husband, children and friends, who are all closely involved. She is the human heart of the drama, if you like. And there are others – scientists and researchers. I keep coming back to the human aspect of it all. Then the epidemic breaks out and the characters have no way of knowing who will be affected. “Some will have natural resistance, but no one knows who that will be. So in that sense, the whole world is threatened – which is, of course, the situation in real life.” As to the causes of the coming crisis, we all have some guilt in this, says McDermid. “We have gone to the doctors and demanded antibiotics – well, most of us have – and the doctors have given us them when they shouldn’t have. We have even turned our seas into reservoirs of resistance by painting battleships with the antibiotic tetracycline to stop barnacles attaching themselves to hulls. And what does that do? It just fills the oceans with tetracycline.” The global nature of the problem also makes it very difficult to tackle, adds Dowson. “There is no single solution to this crisis. You have got to cross animal veterinary medicine, food chains, individual responsibility, corporate responsibility, hospital responsibility, government responsibility, international plane travel. It is extraordinarily complicated – and worrying.” Resistance will be broadcast on 3, 10 and 17 March at 2.15pm on BBC Radio 4"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/16/deutsche-bank-examined-trump-account-for-russia-links","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-16T14:09:58Z","webTitle":"Deutsche Bank examined Trump's account for Russia links","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/16/deutsche-bank-examined-trump-account-for-russia-links","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/16/deutsche-bank-examined-trump-account-for-russia-links","fields":{"headline":"Deutsche Bank examined Donald Trump's account for Russia links","bodyText":"The scandal-hit bank that loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to Donald Trump has conducted a close internal examination of the US president’s personal account to gauge whether there are any suspicious connections to Russia, the Guardian has learned. Deutsche Bank, which is under investigation by the US Department of Justice and is facing intense regulatory scrutiny, was looking for evidence of whether recent loans to Trump, which were struck in highly unusual circumstances, may have been underpinned by financial guarantees from Moscow. The Guardian has also learned that the president’s immediate family are Deutsche clients. The bank examined accounts held by Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, her husband, Jared Kushner, who serves as a White House adviser, and Kushner’s mother. The internal review found no evidence of any Russia link, but Deutsche Bank is coming under pressure to appoint an external and independent auditor to review its business relationship with President Trump. Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell Jr, a member of the House Ways and Means committee, said: “We know that Deutsche Bank is a major lender to President Trump, and the firm is also currently undergoing scrutiny by the Department of Justice for alleged misconduct. “I think it’s important for the American people to know the extent of the bank’s involvement with the president, and whether there is any Russian involvement in loans made to Mr Trump.” Pascrell said the bank was under federal investigation for aiding Russian money-laundering - a “troubling potential conflict”. He said he would encourage Deutsche to “shine a bright light” on its lending to the president to “eliminate any speculation of wrongdoing ”. Congress should also be allowed to review Trump’s tax returns in closed session, he added. A source familiar with Deutsche Bank’s internal review said it came after Trump’s bid to become US president made him a politically exposed person. Under banking regulations, PEPs undergo tougher scrutiny than regular clients because of their proximity to government. After Trump’s victory in the US election in November the bank “double-checked” its records, the source said. The bank has also fielded numerous media inquiries about recent Trump loans, which were viewed as unorthodox among some bankers familiar with the transactions. According to an analysis by Bloomberg, Trump now owes Deutsche around $300m. He has four large mortgages, all issued by Deutsche’s private bank. The loans are guaranteed against the president’s properties: a new deluxe hotel in Washington DC’s old Post Office building, just round the corner from the White House; his Chicago tower hotel; and the Trump National Doral Miami resort. In recent years the disgraced bank has been hit by a series of scandals. Last month the UK and US imposed record fines of $630m. Deutsche failed to prevent money laundering by its Moscow branch involving at least $10bn of Russian cash, regulators found. Deutsche’s client relationship with Kushner was made public in a 2013 article in the New York Observer, which Kushner owned. Ivanka Trump, who formerly served as an executive in Trump’s real estate business, is also a client of Deutsche. She now works as an unofficial adviser in the White House. Kushner’s mother, Seryl Stadtmauer, is also a client, according to a person familiar with the matter. The bank’s internal review looked at the president’s accounts as well as his wider family, it is understood. The bank said it would not be drawn on what had prompted the internal examination, who had undertaken it or what its findings had been. Deutsche said it would not say anything about whether the review had found any links between Trump’s loans and Moscow. However, two bank sources have told the Guardian that it found no evidence to show the loans had been underwritten by money from Moscow, or any Russian bank. Deutsche Bank’s says its position is that it will not comment or guide on any stories about Mr Trump’s financial affairs. Another source familiar with the issue said speculation about possible ties to Russia could be part of a “disinformation campaign”. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, deputy press secretary at the White House, referred queries to the Trump Organisation, which did not respond to a request for comment. Trump and his businesses have a long history with the German bank, which this month posted its latest net loss, of €1.4bn. It has been the only financial institution willing to lend Trump significant sums. In the 1990s other Wall Street banks, which had previously extended him credit, turned off the tap after Trump’s businesses declared bankruptcy four times. In November 2008 the German bank took the unusual step of suing Trump after he failed to repay $40m of a $640m real estate loan. Trump countersued. The tycoon argued that Deutsche had contributed to the global recession, which had depressed property prices. He demanded $3bn in damages. Deutsche’s astonished lawyers described Trump’s lawsuit as frivolous and demanded immediate payment. The two parties settled in 2010. The bank then quietly re-established its relationship with Trump via Deutsche’s private bank. The private wealth division deals with ultra high-net worth individuals, typically with assets in excess of $50m. A person familiar with the matter said the relationship resumed because Deutsche Bank hired a group of private wealth bankers including Rosemary Vrablic, who had previously worked at Citigroup and Bank of America and was Trump’s personal banker. Vrablic began working for Deutsche in 2006. When he was questioned about his bona fides on Wall Street by the New York Times, Trump referred to Vrablic as the “boss” of Deutsche Bank, although she is not the group’s chief executive. A glowing profile of the banker appeared in Kushner’s New York Observer. Sources in the banking world have expressed astonishment that Deutsche would continue lending to Trump in the wake of his $3bn 2008 lawsuit. Asked whether this was normal practice, one former Deutsche Bank employee, who worked for the bank in New York, said: “Are you kidding me?” Another former CEO of a rival investment bank, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “The idea that a bank would walk away from an enforcement lawsuit on a defaulted loan with a litigious borrower because they hired a banking team is preposterous.” One person familiar with the matter said there was no interaction between the investment banking department that had originally lent to Trump and private banking. The investment bankers who dealt with Trump’s loans had left the company, the source said. Possible links with Russia are a matter of acute sensitivity inside the bank, the Guardian has been told. The Trump administration has been fighting accusations contained in a dossier by a former MI6 officer that it secretly colluded before the US election with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Trump has rubbished the claim as fake news. On Monday the Michael Flynn resigned as US national security adviser after it emerged he had lied to the vice-president, Mike Pence, over his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to Washington. Flynn had discussed the possibility of the incoming Trump administration lifting Russian sanctions. Citing current and former US intelligence officials, the New York Times reported on Wednesday that three members of Trump’s team had been in contact with senior Russian intelligence officers before the US election. In January a US regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services, fined Deutsche Bank $425m for laundering around $10bn of Russian money. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority imposed a £163m fine, its largest ever. The US Department of Justice is still investigating the Russian scheme. In December Deutsche agreed to pay the department $7.2bn. The fine related to the mis-selling of residential mortgage-backed securities and other activities during 2005-7. The US originally asked Deutsche to pay $14bn. Got a story?

The researchers used motion-capture technology to record the moves of women dancing to a drum beat, before turning them into featureless avatars and showing them to both men and women to rate. The results, the team says, reveal the sort of shapes women should be throwing to win the admiration of others – suggesting that hip-swinging and keeping synchronised with the beat of the music both garnered the thumbs up. “The other things were movements of the arms and thighs,” said Nick Neave, a psychologist from the University of Northumbria, who led the research published in the journal Scientific Reports. We actually found that the more asymmetric movements were better,” he added. The study also revealed that those deemed to be better dancers were better synchronised to the beat of the music. The research follows a previous work by the team which looked into male dance, concluding that men who tilted and twisted their necks and torsos in a variety of moves were deemed by others to be good dancers. “We then went on to find that the stronger the male was, the better the dancer he was thought to be,” said Neave. The new study, he adds, was designed to unpick whether there might similarly be more to female dance than meets the eye. In total, 39 women aged between 18 and 30 were recorded dancing to a 125-beat-per-minute drum-based rhythm and turned into avatars to disguise their features and remove the possibility of judgements on how tall, attractive or well-dressed the individuals were. The 15 second-clips were then shown to 57 men and 143 women – all heterosexual and over the age of 18 – in an online study. The participants were then asked to rate the dancing on a scale of 1-7. The results, say Neave, suggest that certain dance moves impressed both men and women. “They were in very strong agreement as to who made a better dancer,” he said. That, he adds, fits in with the idea that dancing is sending signals to both sexes. “Yes, [the women] are dancing to attract men but they are all dancing to show off to other women how good they are,” he said. The preference for certain dance moves in women, says Neave, might offer clues to these potential mates, or competitors. “The way that you move is very crucially linked to your health, your hormonal status and your personality and also possibly things like intelligence and creativity,” he said. “You are seeing someone move and you are able to interpret an awful lot about that person from the way that they move.” While the team have yet to decode the signals within female dance moves, the authors suggest the preference for hip-swing and arm movements might be down to them being perceived as distinctly feminine traits, while the throwing of asymmetric shapes could offer health clues. “We think what that is showing is that people have then got very good motor control,” he said. But don’t overdo it. While asymmetric thigh moves, arm gestures and hip swing were all given higher ratings, dancers attempting either a lot, or very few, thigh moves or asymmetrical arm gestures were deemed less accomplished that those who used them in moderation. Although Neave admits that dance moves were different in the past – Jane Austen is unlikely to have thrown an impromptu thunder clap move during a country reel – he says the underlying conclusions of the research are widely applicable to music from many different cultures and eras. “We weren’t getting people dancing to music that they hated or that they really liked. We just wanted to see how they moved in time to the rhythm,” he said. “Whatever the music is, it doesn’t matter, if someone is keeping to a rhythm then that signifies a decent dancer.” Not everyone is so convinced. “The dancers and people rating the dancing in this study were limited to one – Western – culture, and in other human societies men perform courtship dances – for example the Wodaabe people of Niger,” said Bronwyn Tarr, a dancer and researcher on dance and human evolution from the University of Oxford. “So what counts as attractive dancing will inevitably differ to some degree depending on cultural context.” But, she added, the study ties into wider research delving into the role of dance in snagging a mate. “Studies like this help us build a more complete picture of how we, like many birds and other animals, can use dance to attract attention from the other sex,” she said. “Based on this Western study, those of us looking to up our dancing-game should remember: the hips don’t lie.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/09/devil-may-care-investors-fall-spell-trump-mania-congress","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T14:31:01Z","webTitle":"Devil-may-care investors fall under spell of Trump-mania","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/09/devil-may-care-investors-fall-spell-trump-mania-congress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/09/devil-may-care-investors-fall-spell-trump-mania-congress","fields":{"headline":"Devil-may-care investors fall under spell of Trump-mania","bodyText":"Wall Street is making some big bets on Donald Trump. One of the biggest is that the US president can persuade Congress to unravel the Dodd-Frank Act that he believes ties the financial services industry in knots. Bank shares have carried the US stock market higher ever since Trump said it was a priority. Another big bet is on a Trump-inspired spending spree by Congress on all manner of infrastructure projects, including the Mexican wall and on the military. This bet gets a steroid boost when traders add in the impact of huge tax cuts, albeit for the richest, trade tariffs on imports (protecting smaller US firms from competition) and a supposedly benign form of blackmail targeting major corporations that consider opening factories abroad (forcing them to locate inside the US). All these initiatives add up to the greatest economic stimulus since Ronald Reagan blew the US federal budget in the early 1980s and sent the stock market into the stratosphere. With what appears to be devil-may-care abandon, investors have moved their savings out of cash and into risky assets on a huge scale. The Dow Jones index of stocks soared above 20,000 a few weeks ago (it was worth 15,660 this time last year). In tandem, investors have expanded their lending to the corporate sector to embrace some of the riskiest businesses. These are companies that are usually forced to borrow money at sky-high interest rates after analysts have looked them up and down and agreed that they are at the greatest risk of going bust. It means the bonds they issue to investors fall well below the AAA ratings given to the safest businesses. Charmingly, they are accorded junk status and their bonds are rated CCC or less. But in the middle of a Trumpian boom, who cares about ratings? Nothing and nobody is going to go bust. There will be employment for everyone and, if there isn’t, the deregulated banks will lend struggling households and businesses some more money. Figures this week show borrowings by CCC-rated companies have increased by two-thirds in the past year. There will be many on Wall Street who say: what could be better than even the most conservative investors entering the $2.2tn (£1.75tn) junk bond market? Except we know that when this happens, it is a house of cards that will collapse with horrible consequences for all. To emphasise the point, there are even early signs of junk-rated businesses using cheap lending facilities to borrow more money and use it to enrich their private equity owners, a move that evokes the worst behaviour before the 2008 crash. Thankfully, the betting must be that only a few investors get hurt in the stampede, the reason being that Congress simply will not allow Trump to pursue his crazy spending plans and mania for deregulation. Trump needs to win over eight Democrats in the Senate to push through his controversial agenda and that looks increasingly unlikely as he goes about his daily routine of upsetting even moderate Republicans with his attacks on the judiciary and anyone else who stands in his way. And while he can probably secure a majority for some extra military spending and a little extra infrastructure, these things take years to result in more ships and new motorway building. So we must hope that investors rein in their search for yield and take a more sober view of the bonanza they believe lies on the horizon. It is a mirage. Greek blame game As protesters take to the streets of Athens, the blame game among those who have imposed debilitating austerity on Greece is hotting up. The International Monetary Fund aimed the first punch, arguing that the beleaguered nation had taken enough punishment. The IMF is reluctant to support the European Union’s stance on Greece without a huge debt-relief package in place. In the opposite corner is the official who manages the Brussels credit card, Klaus Regling. He has ruled out debt relief, saying the solution for Greece lies in the government making further cuts in pensions and benefits. This untenable position, which ignores 25% unemployment and endemic corruption, was then undermined further by a simple untruth. Writing in the Financial Times, he said: “The eurozone’s rescue funds have disbursed €174bn to Greece. We would not have lent this amount if we did not think we would get our money back.” There is no way the Greeks will ever pay that money back. It will just hang over them forever while they struggle to pay the interest and sink further into the mire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/feb/19/michelin-men-claude-bosi-terence-conran-and-the-return-of-bibendum","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T08:30:03Z","webTitle":"Michelin men: Claude Bosi, Terence Conran and the return of Bibendum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/19/michelin-men-claude-bosi-terence-conran-and-the-return-of-bibendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/19/michelin-men-claude-bosi-terence-conran-and-the-return-of-bibendum","fields":{"headline":"Michelin men: Claude Bosi, Terence Conran and the return of Bibendum","bodyText":"In the gutted upstairs room of Bibendum on London’s Fulham Road, I’m suddenly feeling my age. The flagship Conran restaurant is in the process of a makeover. Floors and walls have been stripped and the famous Michelin blue stained-glass windows and great arched conservatory glass roof look down on an interior of rubble and scaffold. The windowless kitchen behind the cathedral-like dining room has been half-removed by the contractors giving it the look of a medieval vault. I’m surveying its gloom with Claude Bosi, recently installed as the new head chef for the restaurant’s reopening in April. Bosi, who won his first Michelin star at 26, and still carries that forward-looking sense of exuberant possibility, points to the few tiles that still cling stubbornly to the kitchen walls, as if at a cave painting: “Most of this stuff is from 1987!” he suggests, marvelling at the antiquity. Bibendum opened that year, the year I first moved to London, and since that obviously doesn’t seem much more than five minutes ago, it’s hard not to take his marvelling a bit personally. Squint and the dining room itself feels like a monument to those beginnings. 1987 was the first full year of Nigel Lawson’s Big Bang, when, for better and worse, London determinedly rehashed itself as an outward looking global city, at ease with foreign money and foreign culture. The deregulation was the starting gun of a different kind of confidence, one which wanted to adopt the lifestyle of European capitals. That openness was symbolised most clearly, perhaps, in a trio of new restaurants which opened almost simultaneously. Rowley Leigh’s Kensington Place, the inspirational River Café of Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray, and Bibendum itself, which were united in celebrating a joie de vivre that had, up until then, most often seemed the preserve of life across the Channel. Newspapers noted it as a “let there be light” moment. London felt a bit airier. The Guardian welcomed Bibendum in these terms: “The dining room is an extravagance of glass windows and space. A central pile of open shelves is filled with fruit and shellfish and plates and topped with a great vase. Above all the room is big, big on the scale of a grand hotel.” The food too represented something of a breath of fresh air from the fussier interpretations of French cooking that had been approximated in London kitchens in the recent past. It would not try too hard, but aim to do simple classics well. Bibendum, under the direction of Simon Hopkinson, would be a deliberate break from the “mould of colourful sauces”; it would dare to call itself “continental”, the Guardian noted. Hopkinson pledged to create the best steak frites outside France. There would be also tete de veau, tripes lyonnaise, rabbit with mustard sauce and boudin blanc. The Observer’s review, by Paul Levy was succinct, but to the point: “Gastro-retro, reactionary chic French bistro food: herrings, braised endives, pink roasted veal, chocolate pithiviers, mmmm.” Bibendum even came with a slogan, from Horace’s Odes, that raised a glass to a more hedonistic future: Nunc est Bibendum! (Now is the time to drink!) Three decades on, it seems appropriate in the sobering year of Brexit, that Bibendum should have temporarily shut its doors on that past, and be dusting itself down and reinventing itself for new realities. Looking back on those beginnings from his home in Battersea, Sir Terence Conran, now 85, can recall something of the thrill of opening. Bibendum was an ambition it had taken him half a lifetime to pull off. Conran had opened the first Habitat store over the road in the 1960s and as the nation’s most ardent Francophile had been “utterly seduced by the Michelin building” and coveted it. “It was always my great dream to finally get my hands on it, and restore the building to its former glory,” he suggests. His chance came when the French tyre company decided to cash in on its dramatic London headquarters, its UK home since the dawn of motoring in 1911. Conran, along with the publishing tycoon Paul Hamlyn, bought it and decided it was the place for a special restaurant. “Our dream was to create something entirely new, somewhere between the relaxed atmosphere of a Parisian brasserie and the precise, elegant formality of somewhere like The Connaught,” Conran says. He’d had experience in creating new restaurants, with The Soup Kitchen and The Orrery, and his venture with brother-in-law Antonio Carluccio in Neal Street, but this represented “a big step up the gastronomic ladder”. He had been eating lunch two or three times a week at Hilaire, a few streets away, where Hopkinson worked. He persuaded the chef to be the third partner in Bibendum. Not long after its opening, Bibendum had established itself as perhaps the most fashionable of west London restaurants, with a mix of Kensington regulars and relaxed celebrity. (Hopkinson recalls a table for three of Alec Guinness, Lauren Bacall and Alan Bennett as a particular favourite.) Elizabeth David, culinary heroine to both Conran and Hopkinson, would come in from time to time (Conran can still recall the howls of delight of then sous chef Jeremy Lee when the “great lady declared his lemon tart was the best she’d ever had”). In 1994, though, after Hopkinson had published his suitably understated cookbook Roast Chicken and Other Stories (voted “most useful cookbook of all time” in a 2005 poll) the chef suffered a sort of breakdown one night during service. At the time, Hopkinson was straining to do 100 covers a night. One evening Alain Ducasse was in. Ducasse asked the head waiter if he might have the recipe for Hopkinson’s steamed ginger pudding, and to see the kitchen, but Hopkinson heard himself in a moment of extreme stress refusing both requests. Later he went into his office and cried uncontrollably. After that Bibendum wasn’t quite the same. Though Hopkinson retained his stake in the business, he left the kitchen soon after to pursue a career writing about food, and while Bibendum remained true to his philosophy and standards, a little of the buzz inevitably departed with him. Conran suggests now that “it is very rare for a restaurant to have lasted so long while managing to keep a sense of timelessness, particularly in London”. But he also concedes it is true that Bibendum “got a little too comfortable” and added a couple of tyres to his waist over the years. It is said it rankles with him a little that his efforts with Bibendum over three decades have never been rewarded with a Michelin star (the star for Conran’s Orrery remains a solitary achievement). It is, perhaps to right this particular omission that he has taken on Bosi, who has not been without one (or two) stars for the past 17 years. In bringing Bosi in, Conran suggests he is hoping to make the restaurant “virile for the next 30 years”. Sitting with Bosi on a couple of knackered restaurant chairs among the rubble, you can see why he fits that particular bill. The Lyon-born chef is not long back from a holiday in Mauritius with his wife and young son and, at 44, is looking tanned and bright-eyed and straining to get back in front of a stove. When he first came to Britain, Bosi avoided London and went out to Ludlow where he established his restaurant Hibiscus as a destination. He moved Hibiscus to Mayfair nine years ago, but had hardly visited the capital before that. “It’s funny,” he recalls, with a laugh. “The first time I came I picked up the Michelin guide and looked where to eat. And I saw this restaurant called Bibendum. I thought wow! You have to be pretty desperate to get a Michelin star to call your restaurant that! I didn’t know any of the history.” Conran’s offer came at a good moment. Bosi had arrived at a crossroads with Hibiscus. He had bought out his partner in the restaurant three years ago and was sole owner with all the pressure that entailed. He was due a rent and rate review on his lease and experiencing a few sleepless nights as a result. The high-end landscape of fine dining in Mayfair had lately been disrupted by the flash arrivals of Caprice Holdings’ Sexy Fish in the old Nat West building in Berkeley Square (after a £15m refurbishment) and by Alan Yau’s “tens of millions” investment in decorating Park Chinois. “These big places were a bit more cool, a bit more funky,” Bosi suggests. When a good offer came in for the lease of Hibiscus he knew it was the time to take it. Conran originally asked him to work as a consultant on the new Bibendum, but he told him and the Hamlyn family that he would only be interested in a “heart and soul” role. The resultant partnership has involved him putting “every last penny” he made at Hibiscus into the new venture. Conran likes Bosi because he is full of the “confidence, personality and vision” he knows Bibendum will need to recreate its former excitement. Given he is not coming in to the restaurant at the easiest moment, you suspect he will need every ounce of those qualities. The area around Fulham Road has become synonymous with the trend of “lights out London” as properties in the neighbouring squares have been bought up by foreign investors and left empty. A couple of years ago, Henry Harris, who had been another of Hopkinson’s protégés in the Bibendum kitchen cited this fact as the reason he was shutting his much-loved restaurant Racine, a few hundred yards up the road. “The non-doms have bought up large chunks of central London,” he said. “I had a regular customer living in Cadogan Square call me to say she is selling up because she didn’t like returning home with all the lights off in the flats around her. A lot of the locals would come in once a week or once a fortnight, but [many] have moved away. There was a strong and loyal core to the end, but not a big enough one.”Bosi is up for the challenge. He is enlarging the kitchen slightly and aiming for slightly fewer covers than the restaurant enjoyed at its height. He likens the opportunity to the time he arrived in England without a word of the language to be sous chef at Overton Grange and was offered the job of head chef instead after the incumbent left. “I just take it as a joke,” he said. “I could do whatever I want. They said, you take over in February, we want three rosettes by April. I thought OK. I started and I got the three rosettes and at the end of the year we got a Michelin star.” He is not daunted by the task at Bibendum. He respects Hopkinson’s reputation but admits the two have never met (though he plans to before the opening). Bosi made his reputation with some obsessively precise French cooking at Hibiscus, but he has no problem with Conran’s direction that they should keep some of the classic dishes of Bibendum’s past. “I said ‘of course!’ because it was never in my mind to get rid of them,” Bosi says. “I want a roast chicken on the menu, a different flavour for each season – we are having a rotisserie put on the carvery. We are going to have tripes lyonnaise – my mother used to make a wonderful tripe and cuttlefish gratin, which I am revising a little bit.” He insists that over the years his food has become more concentrated and simpler. “In the beginning there was of course some showing off at Hibiscus. But this is going to be more where I want to be.” He says he wants people to come to Bibendum for perfect calf liver and onion and bacon. The restaurant won’t be fixated on tasting menus, it will be about eating. The aim is Conran’s original vision, of making people as comfortable “to come with their kid or with their wife as for a business meeting”. To this end, Bosi’s second wife, Lucy, who works for Open Table, is his most reliable critic, he says. His rule of thumb when thinking about the Bibendum menu is to have nothing on it that her parents wouldn’t recognise or want to eat. He smiles. “Lucy is never afraid to say, ‘What are you doing? Tone it down a bit …’ Sometimes I don’t want to accept it, but I know she is seeing it as a normal customer would see it.” Bosi has a reputation for fieriness – he had an infamous spat with a food blogger who gave Hibiscus three stars out of five in a review. (Bosi tweeted ‘Nice way to gain respect with chefs...!! I think you’re a cunt and this it’s personal sorry...!!’ – the tone of which he now regrets, if not the sentiment itself.) As evidence that this was out of character, he points to his 17 years of regular custom and the fact he will be bringing pretty much his entire staff from Hibiscus to Fulham Road. When I ask him how long he plans to be here, he talks in terms of fixtures like the Waterside Inn and Le Gavroche. He grins, gazes over the rubble. “This is my last move. I hope so. I feel at home here.” And Michelin stars? One thing at a time … Conran tries to be equally sanguine about the ambition. When I ask if a star would be a vindication of his three decades of effort under this glass roof, he is not sure that vindication is the right word, but of course can’t help thinking, “It would seem perfectly fitting for our Michelin building. No pressure, though, Claude, there’s no rush – just enjoy the kitchen!” But he would say that, wouldn’t he?

In the US, cancer bills are the leading cause of personal bankruptcy, while in the UK, drugs that might prolong life are rejected for NHS use because of their price. Many new drugs have to be used in combination, adding to the cost. Treatment with the two new immunotherapy drugs nivolumab and ipilimumab costs $252,000, which is more than the median cost of a US home ($240,000 in 2016), they write. Fantastic scientific work is going on – for instance, in sequencing cancer genomes – which should lead to advances in treatment, said Prof Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, which is the world’s most successful academic cancer drug discovery organisation. “All this invention is meaningless if patients cannot afford these drugs,” he said. “It is unsustainable. For those of us involved in research, it is disturbing that the amount of research that goes on and the success that is made is not translated into treatment for patients. And for patients it is a terrible situation.” Pharmaceutical companies used to justify their prices by pointing to the high cost of clinical trials involving many thousands of patients. But that is no longer always necessary, the scientists say in their paper. The new targeted drugs require a test for a genetic biomarker to see whether patients will respond or not. That means the drug can be trialled on far fewer people. The drug crizotinib, used for advanced lung cancer, was approved following a trial involving only 347 patients, they point out. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was first approved for advanced breast cancer and later for early breast cancer, increasing the market for the company but with no reduction in price. “Some drugs are tested on 50 or 100 patients and yet these drugs still go to Nice [the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which decides whether the NHS can afford a new drug] at the maximum price,” said Workman. Workman, together with colleagues from the US and the Netherlands, proposes that academic discovery centres like his should forge relationships with new commercial partners – probably not the major drug companies but smaller biotech or generic drug firms. Academics should take greater control of the drugs they discover, they argue, and join with small companies that will agree to cap the price when the drug reaches the market. They would not have the expectation of big profit margins, as the major pharmaceutical companies do. But in an era where drugs are tested on smaller populations and genetic testing means they are more likely to be effective, they would not need to “cost in” all the failed attempts at producing blockbusters, as the big companies do. Workman said the institute was already talking to small companies about the possibility of a new way of developing more affordable cancer drugs. He believes other scientists will support the ideas in the paper. “We’re calling for a more mature and open conversation about how this could be done and offering a solution,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/feb/10/hr-thinks-music-in-the-office-is-a-good-idea-but-i-dont","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"HR thinks music in the office is a good idea – but I don't","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/10/hr-thinks-music-in-the-office-is-a-good-idea-but-i-dont","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/feb/10/hr-thinks-music-in-the-office-is-a-good-idea-but-i-dont","fields":{"headline":"HR thinks music in the office is a good idea – but I don't","bodyText":"Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions.

It may seem an unlikely blend of English pastoralism and oriental mysticism – the story of Sāvitri, whose love for her husband convinces death not to take him, comes from an episode in the Mahabharata – but it’s one of the quiet masterpieces of 20th-century British music, which can be almost as dramatically effective in the concert hall as it is when fully staged. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra’s last performance of Sāvitri was nine years ago. This one, conducted by Nicholas Collon, was nominally a straightforward concert version, but a darkened auditorium, judicious lighting and some well-judged entrances and exits gave it a frisson of theatricality. Yvonne Howard (replacing Sarah Connolly, who was ill) was Sāvitri, showing just enough steel and resolve beneath the emollient vocal surfaces to make her character more realistic than merely symbolic, and Robert Murray was her husband, Satyavan. James Rutherford was Death, projecting his lines with persuasive power whether on or off stage, while the CBSO Youth Chorus supplied the wordless female choir. The opera formed the first half of an all-Holst evening, and his suite The Planets, almost inevitably, made up the second. The performance set off at a tremendous rate, with fiercely incisive playing from the CBSO, which never flagged. But Collon never really found any other gears: everything was brightly lit and a bit too strident; even movements such as Venus and the final Neptune lacked the distance and mystery needed. The Planets may be a brilliant orchestral showpiece, but there’s more to be found in the score than that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/09/christianity-theme-park-in-mao-zedongs-home-province-sparks-outrage","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T13:01:43Z","webTitle":"'Christianity theme park' in Mao Zedong's home province sparks outrage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/christianity-theme-park-in-mao-zedongs-home-province-sparks-outrage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/09/christianity-theme-park-in-mao-zedongs-home-province-sparks-outrage","fields":{"headline":"'Christianity theme park' in Mao Zedong's home province sparks outrage","bodyText":"Neo-Maoists have launched an online crusade against a “Christianity theme park” that recently opened in the southern Chinese city where Mao Zedong “converted” to communism. The park – which is reportedly centred around an 80-metre (263ft) tall church designed to resemble Noah’s Ark – was inaugurated last month in the city of Changsha, the capital of Hunan province. News reports about the project have infuriated China’s Mao devotees, for whom the city is a species of holy land. “When I saw the news about the so-called ‘Christianity theme park’, I couldn’t believe my eyes,” Guo Songmin, a prominent neo-Maoist scholar and commentator, wrote online. “The whole church thing is as inconceivable as a visitor from outer space and is largely a cultural invasion,” Guo said, demanding that authorities replace the church’s cross with a red star. Guo declined an interview request from the Guardian. A second article, published on the neo-Maoist website Utopia, called the project an “imperialist cultural invasion”. Building a church in a public space was a violation of people’s freedom not to believe in God, wrote Qian Changming. Qian lamented how authorities had allowed its construction but had last year ordered the demolition of a giant golden statue of Mao further north in Henan province. Zhao Danyan, a third critic, called for the immediate demolition of the “unnecessary and inappropriate” structure. At best, it would harm local culture, he argued. At worst, it posed a threat to China’s “ideological security”. Jude Blanchette, a Beijing-based academic who studies China’s resurgent community of neo-Maoists, said the commotion was largely the result of the church’s location in Chinese communism’s answer to Mecca. Mao was born in the nearby village of Shaoshan in 1893 and as a teenager moved to the provincial capital, where his long revolutionary march to the pinnacle of Chinese politics began. “Mao Zedong went to school in Changsha, he lived in Changsha, he opened his first bookstore in Changsha,” said Blanchette. “That is sacred ground. “While I doubt this would have gone down well anywhere if they had known about it, it is especially galling [for neo-Maoists] to have this blatant act of betrayal happen in the holy land.” Blanchette said much of the fury was focused on a website called the Red Song Society, which he described as the Drudge Report of neo-Maoism. “The narrative that they are passing around … is that this is just another sign of infiltration by hostile foreign forces and of how tepidly communist and red our officials are that you now get state money going to build a cross on the side of a building.” While China is home to tens of millions of Christians and Christianity is one of five faiths recognised by the official atheist government, it is not always viewed or treated favourably by the Chinese Communist party. Hundreds of church crosses have been torn down in eastern China in recent years while President Xi Jinping has warned of foreign infiltration of religious communities. A source in Changsha’s Christian community, who asked not to be named, said that what news reports had hailed as a “Christianity theme park” was in fact simply a church and Bible study centre built on a strip of land handed to them by the government. The source was aware of the online firestorm surrounding the project but was unsure how the authorities might react. “So far, the government hasn’t spoken with us about the matter yet, and our project is still carrying on.” Blanchette said China’s leaders considered neo-Maoists a powerful organising force whose militancy had to be taken seriously. The church’s chances of surviving the outcry were slim. “I would be surprised if the cross stays up there that long,” he said.

Accompanying the new policies is a section aimed at educating advertisers about the extent to which ad targeting is allowed on the social network, both in terms of Facebook’s own policies and applicable national laws. Enforcing the rules may be tricky, but Facebook plans to use new technology “that leverages machine learning” to identify the most egregious offenders – those that “offer housing, employment or credit opportunities” in a discriminatory manner. The move follows accusations that the social network offered tools that allow advertisers to break American anti-discrimination laws, through an ad-targeting feature described as “ethnic affinity” profiling. First highlighted in March 2016, the affinity targeting was intended to allow advertisers to target messages to specific audiences without getting into the murky ground of racial profiling. Facebook describes the feature as grouping people not by “their genetic makeup, but their affinity to the cultures they are interested in”. That way, a white Facebook user who has expressed interest in hip-hop music, the TV channel BET, and the the films of Spike Lee might be put in the “African-American” affinity group. Although Facebook goes to great lengths to emphasise that the feature, which is still available for advertisers, is not the same as racial profiling, a second wave of negative publicity arrived in October 2016, when ProPublica reported that the affinity targeting could be used to exclude particular groups from advertising for home sales. That is explicitly banned under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, due to America’s long history of segregation. Now, if Facebook’s tools think that a user is attempting to implement the “multicultural advertising segments” targeting unlawfully, it will force them to undergo manual review, with a Facebook employee explicitly checking for compliance. And for housing, employment and credit adverts which are targeted in other ways, the company is asking advertisers to explicitly certify their compliance with relevant laws. “Several organisations have asked us to work with them to help identify ways that our advertising technology could be used to promote inclusion and opportunity for underserved communities, while also protecting against discriminatory uses,” Facebook said in a blogpost. “We believe in the power of our advertising products to create opportunities for people from all backgrounds, so we are committed to working with these groups toward that goal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/09/postcardstobannon-the-campaign-to-send-missives-to-the-real-us-president","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T15:49:57Z","webTitle":"#PostcardstoBannon: the campaign to send missives to the 'real' US president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/09/postcardstobannon-the-campaign-to-send-missives-to-the-real-us-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/09/postcardstobannon-the-campaign-to-send-missives-to-the-real-us-president","fields":{"headline":"#PostcardstoBannon: the campaign to send missives to the 'real' US president","bodyText":"Who’s really calling the shots at the White House – President Trump or chief strategist Steve Bannon? That’s the question that has been circulating on social media over the past week and a half about the still-fledgling Trump presidency. Now, a new campaign has people sending postcards addressed to President Bannon and sharing them on social media using the hashtag #PostcardstoBannon. It began when @cwardell suggested a letter-writing campaign targeted at “President Bannon”: Justin Hendrix then kickstarted the hashtag #PostcardstoBannon: Now, hundreds of others have joined in, some sending multiple postcards. Hendrix said: “People are having fun with it – it’s not the most serious protest. But what is serious is that the former publisher of a hate site that has embraced the alt-right and talked openly of destroying American institutions is pulling the strings in the Oval Office.” Bannon was executive chair of Breitbart news, which he described as the “platform of the alt-right”. He has also been widely quoted as describing himself as “a Leninist ... [he] wanted to destroy the state and that’s my goal too”. Hendrix said of his postcard campaign: “People are creative – I’ve seen people post photos of handmade cards, for instance. One lady made 30 of them in one night. I think it’s cathartic.” One account, @Note2PresBannon, has also got behind the campaign. The person who runs it, who wishes to remain anonymous, said they began writing the postcards on their own out of frustration before joining with others sharing their missives on the internet. “I’m a DC resident so I haven’t been able to partake in a lot of the actions of calling my representatives because I don’t have any,” they said. “Plus, my biggest beef has been with Bannon, who no one has a say about. “I felt using humor and a snarky tone took away power from Bannon. I made the account after a few friends expressed interest and I realised this could catch on. “One of my friends told me recently that resisting should be fun, and writing the postcards is a blast.” The hashtag #PresidentBannon has become more popular recently, as commentators suggest it is Trump’s chief strategist who is pulling the strings. Time magazine featured him on their cover, dubbing him “the great manipulator”: There’s a possibility these reports have angered President Trump. On Monday, he tweeted: Meanwhile, press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters about Trump: “He’s the one who develops the policy, he’s the one who makes the decisions, and I think there are so many times when you see things that don’t recognise that he is the guy that calls the shots.” But in an article on divisions within the still-new White House team, the New York Times reported that Trump was “not fully briefed” when signing the executive order that put Bannon on the National Security Council."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/feb/09/british-tabloids-ignore-end-of-scheme-to-bring-child-refugees-to-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T18:47:06Z","webTitle":"British tabloids ignore end of scheme to bring child refugees to the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/09/british-tabloids-ignore-end-of-scheme-to-bring-child-refugees-to-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/feb/09/british-tabloids-ignore-end-of-scheme-to-bring-child-refugees-to-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"British tabloids ignore end of scheme to bring child refugees to the UK","bodyText":"Those British tabloids most outraged by the issue of immigration barely noted the government’s decision to limit sanctuary for lone child refugees to just a few hundred, rather than the thousands hoped for by campaigners. The Daily Mail put its story headlined “Child refugee scheme for 3,000 halted at just 350” at the bottom of page 6, while the Sun found space for just five paragraphs and the Express had nothing at all. Such apparent lack of interest comes despite the fact that the issue of child refugees marks a possible high-water mark for the media’s impact on both public opinion and government policy. It was a leader in the Mail last April offering surprise support that helped Labour peer Alf Dubs gain support for his landmark amendment promising sanctuary for unaccompanied child refugees in the first place. The piece, in which the Mail leader backed then prime minister David Cameron, possibly for the last time, was headlined “The Mail has always been robust on migration but we MUST give these lost children sanctuary” and talked of the UK’s “moral and humanitarian duty”. It prompted Dubs, who was brought to Britain as part of the Kindertransport scheme in 1939, to buy a copy of the paper “for the first time”. That changed dramatically in October, when unaccompanied migrants arriving in Croydon was reported in the Sun under the headline “Are you kidding? Calais ‘children’ arrive in UK”. Edited by former Mail executive Tony Gallagher, the paper published three headshots of refugees on its front page and questioned if they were really under 18. Similar Mail and Express front-page stories followed – and public opinion changed again. Google “child refugees” today and “are adults” is the third most popular term after the less loaded “stories” and “in Calais”. The pictures sparked a debate about puberty and whether hardship makes people look older, rather than a debate about the ethics of taking and publishing pictures of minors. The editors’ code of practice states: “Children under 16 must not be interviewed or photographed on issues involving their own or another child’s welfare unless a custodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents.” A Sun executive, pleased at having set the agenda, said he would not be able to publish pictures of far younger refugees because of this rule. Fears over the safety of these children means that all reports on the issue take care not to identify young people, who often have no one to speak for them. In many ways the pictures of the young refugees last October marked a return to the norm for British papers. Research for the UNHRC by Cardiff University found that all other EU newspapers were more likely to stress humanitarian issues in migration stories than the British press, which tended to focus primarily on the economic impact. The research was carried out in 2014 and early 2015, before the tiny lifeless body of Alan Kurdi was found on a beach in Turkey in September 2015. Pictures of the rescuer carrying the child provoked international sympathy when used by the media and an increase in support for refugees in opinion polls. But it did not last. The support of titles like the Mail soon waned, as last April’s editorial showed. Its leader included a line urging the then prime minister to be cautious: “The pressures of our relentless population growth mean we cannot afford to make more than a gesture – accepting perhaps a few hundred of the most vulnerable lone children from the camps of Calais and Dunkirk.” Evidence if ever it was needed of how the Mail’s editorial line can become government policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/feb/09/pieter-bruegel-the-elder-holburne-museum","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T12:53:55Z","webTitle":"Ignore the art market – there is only one Bruegel that matters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/feb/09/pieter-bruegel-the-elder-holburne-museum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/feb/09/pieter-bruegel-the-elder-holburne-museum","fields":{"headline":"Ignore the art market – there is only one Bruegel that matters","bodyText":"Why does the British art world persist in pretending there is more than one great artist called Bruegel, or indeed Brueghel? The Holburne Museum’s new exhibition claims to be “the UK’s first exhibition devoted to the Bruegel dynasty,” but this Flemish family get all too much attention, from high-profile sales to campaigns to “save” their art. Did you notice that variation in the spelling of the family name? Here is my golden rule: the only Bruegel worth bothering with is the one whose name is spelled without the “h”. Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c1525–69) is one of the most imaginative, original and captivating artists in history. He painted The Hunters in the Snow, that unforgettable image of hunched up peasants, cosy cottages and joyous skaters in a white winter world. He also painted The Tower of Babel, a surreal vision of a mega-structure like a cross between the Colosseum and a termite mound that dwarfs its builders and the town below. Another of his fantastic visions is The Triumph of Death with its army of skeletons who mercilessly massacre the living. The genius of Bruegel shows itself not just in his wild imagination – in which he resembles the southern Dutch visionary Hieronymus Bosch – but his acute feeling for landscape and human behaviour. He travelled to Italy and the scenery he saw on his journey (especially crossing the Alps) haunts his paintings, giving them a panoramic, map-like quality. Scenes such as The Hunters in the Snow seem to sum up the very nature of life on earth in their geographical sweep and anthropological scope. Like Shakespeare, he can capture the theatre of life in scenes that are comic yet full of acute psychological portraits. Look at the faces in his picture The Peasant Wedding and the tensions of love and jealousy in The Peasant Dance. Bruegel is one of western art’s most profound observers of the human condition, the painter who inspired Auden’s line: “About suffering they were never wrong, the old masters.” So who are all these other Bruegels, or Brueghels, the art world wants to distract us with? Before he died in his 40s, Bruegel had two sons, who also became painters – Pieter Brueghel the Younger (1564/5–1637/8) and Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568–1625). Jan’s son also joined the family business and is known as Jan Brueghel the Younger (1601-78). There were other, lesser descendants, too. I don’t mind the works of Bruegel’s children and grandchildren. Jan the Elder’s flowers are nice, and Pieter Brueghel the Younger made invaluable copies of his father’s lost works. But why are British museums and art dealers such as Christies, which staged a Brueghel show in 2014, so obsessed with these lesser painters? Because our private and public collections are full of their so-so product. Indeed, one of the reasons the Holburne is staging its show is that its director spotted that a supposed copy of one of Pieter Brueghel the Younger’s works in its collection is now seen as an original. As the museum enthuses, this peasant dance “can be attributed firmly to the hand of Pieter Brueghel the Younger. Previously thought to be the work of a copyist or follower of Brueghel, it now takes its place as the only version of this popular scene in a UK public museum.” This boast typifies the way the art world’s experts are happy to confuse the public about Bruegel and his family. Brueghel the Younger is not a great artist: his paintings are pastiches and often copies of his father’s style. So why is it such a big deal to attribute a painting to him? A more accurate version of this blurb might read: “A painting once thought to be a copy of a copyist has now been credited to the original copyist. It is a genuine second-rate simulacrum of the works of Pieter Bruegel the Elder.” You know who this kind of confusion really helps? Auction houses and art dealers. There are so many works by Bruegel’s sons and grandsons lying around in stately homes that a keen market in their work can draw on a steady supply of so-so carnival scenes. “Brueghel is one of the hottest artists on the old master market, and Sotheby’s has bagged not just one but three great examples of his work for its old master sales,” enthused the Telegraph in 2014. Like the Holburne, they meant Pieter Brueghel the Younger – but who cares if people confuse his much lesser talent with the genius of his father?

Justin Welby said he was “saddened and shocked” by the decision to limit the Dubs scheme to only 350 children, saying he believed ministers had been “committed to welcoming up to 3,000”. The most senior Church of England cleric said it was “regrettable” to end the scheme when it had helped such a small number. “Jesus commands us to care for the most vulnerable,” he added. He was joined by a string of backbench Conservatives, as well as Labour politicians and relief workers, who said the prime minister should lift the cap on numbers, while local councils made clear they could take more refugees if more money was made available. Heidi Allen, the Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire, said she and a number of colleagues were angry and would be pressing for the Dubs route to remain open, starting with a parliamentary debate on 23 February. “Quite a few of us had sensed things were not heading in the right direction and had applied for a backbench debate anyway. That will be the first parliamentary opportunity. There are quite a lot of us that are not going to let this go,” she said. “Our job over the next week or so is to make everyone aware of what has happened and I don’t believe we will let this go. All the government has to do is leave the system open and let councils come forward. There is just absolutely no reason to shut the scheme down.” In the House of Lords, Alf Dubs, who originally designed the scheme, accused the prime minister of a breach of the “spirit of the commitment” she had given him during the passage of the Immigration Act last May. He said ministers were “arbitrarily closing down the scheme”. Barbara Winton, whose late father Sir Nicholas Winton helped 669 mostly Jewish children – including the future Lord Dubs, flee Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, asked May to remember the words the prime minister had used at her father’s memorial service as the world “once again teeters on the edge of dark times”. An application to expedite a high court legal challenge is to be heard on Friday. The charity Help Refugees, which brought the challenge, claims the government has failed to properly consult local authorities over the number of available places for unaccompanied child refugees as required under the Dubs amendment. But May and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, strongly defended their decision to close the scheme once one last group of 150 children have been brought to Britain, probably from Greece and Italy. When May faced questions about the issue at a Downing Street press conference after talks with the Italian prime minister, she emphasised Britain’s financial contribution to refugee camps in the Syrian region and the number of refugee children who had arrived in the UK from outside Europe. “We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom. I think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right, on top of course of the significant financial support and humanitarian aid we are giving to refugees in the region of Syria – £2.3bn, the second biggest bilateral donor,” she said. Charity workers in Calais said an estimated 200 asylum-seeking children were now living rough in the forests and woodland around the demolished refugee camp, many of whom had expected to be eligible to be transferred to the UK under the Dubs amendment. “They are not in tents because it makes them more visible to the police; they want to stay secret and out of sight. But it is quite dangerously cold,” said Amelia Burr, of Help Refugees. Throughout January nighttime temperatures have been around -5C (23F). “We give out sleeping bags and blankets at night; when we come back the next day the blankets are frozen.” Young asylum seekers were once again attempting to get on to lorries travelling to the UK at night, she said. Last month, a 20-year-old from Eritrea was killed on the motorway. “There is very little legal option for minors who want to get to the UK now, so they are left with only one option, which is to risk their lives to try to get to England.” Natasha Tsangarides, Greece field manager for the charity Safe Passage, which helps refugee children to find legal ways of seeking asylum in the UK, said there were more than 1,000 child refugees in Greece on a waiting list for places in children’s shelters who urgently needed help accessing appropriate places to stay. “A couple of boys are prostituting themselves just to survive in Greece. There are over 1,000 lone, vulnerable and desperate children here, who don’t even have a home to sleep in. There is a huge problem here,” she said. “If they are going to take no more than 150 children more from across France, Italy and Greece, that’s simply not good enough.” Ministers were careful not specify a number when the Dubs amendment made it into law last May, although it had widely been expected that several thousand unaccompanied children would be allowed to enter the UK and that the scheme would remain open in the long term. Tania Mathias, the Tory MP for Twickenham, said: “It was never expected to be closed at any point. Britain should be leading the way, there should be more resources for local authorities.” She said she was “hopeful because there was such a lot of criticism today” that the government would change its mind and keep the scheme open. “I’ve asked authorities to be given more money because they’ve said it’s not a question of looking after the children for one or two years; these are complex cases,” she said. Rudd said the government had fulfilled its obligations. She said 350 was the limit of the capacity of local councils this financial year to fund places. She also said British and French authorities feared that the existence of the Dubs scheme was “a pull factor” for refugee children to head to Britain and provided opportunities for the people traffickers. “We don’t want to incentivise journeys to Europe,” she said. David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, which has estimated it costs £50,000 a year to look after a vulnerable lone child refugee, said it had long urged the government to put in place long-term funding arrangements. The chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, Yvette Cooper, said she was shocked at the closure of a scheme that had ensured teenage girls from Eritrea who had been trafficked, raped and abused were now in school in Britain. “Far from deterring traffickers, this decision to halt legal routes to sanctuary will encourage them instead,” Cooper said. “The government is pushing vulnerable children back into the arms of smuggler and trafficker gangs, and back into modern slavery. Already we are seeing hundreds of children starting to return to Dunkirk and Calais. Both France and Britain have an obligation to work together to make sure the dangerous Calais camp conditions don’t start all over again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/10/boris-johnson-urged-uk-to-continue-saudi-arms-sales-after-funeral-bombing","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T19:18:20Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson urged UK to continue Saudi arms sales after funeral bombing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/10/boris-johnson-urged-uk-to-continue-saudi-arms-sales-after-funeral-bombing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/10/boris-johnson-urged-uk-to-continue-saudi-arms-sales-after-funeral-bombing","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson urged UK to continue Saudi arms sales after funeral bombing","bodyText":"Boris Johnson pressed Liam Fox to continue exports of weapons to Saudi Arabia after the bombing of a funeral in Yemen last October that killed more than 140 people and was condemned by UN monitors. Correspondence between the ministers shows that a month after the strike, Johnson, the foreign secretary, wrote: “I am aware you have deferred a decision on four export licence applications to supply the Royal Saudi Air Force with equipment which could be used in the conflict in Yemen.” In the letter dated 8 November, Johnson advised the trade secretary it was right to proceed with the arms sales. “The issue is extremely finely balanced, but I judge at present that the Saudis appear committed both to improving processes and to taking action to address failures/individual incidents,” he said. The foreign secretary added that the Saudis had given the UK commitments in the aftermath of the airstrike on the funeral in Sana’a that meant “the ‘clear risk’ threshold for refusal … has not yet been reached”. Fox then recommended that the licences be approved in the light of the assessment provided by the foreign secretary, but in his reply dated 17 November added that the situation remained risky and that he “must insist” on regular updates on the situation in Yemen. The trade secretary wrote to Johnson: “I agree that this is an extremely complex situation and that the issue of clear risk is extremely finely balanced. In the light of your assessment and [REDACTED] recent advice I accept that we should continue, for the present, to assess export licences for Saudi Arabia on a case-by-case basis.” But he added: “In doing so I want to be very clear with you about the risks inherent in making this decision, not just because of the grave situation in Yemen.” The letters were among documents disclosed in court proceedings this week, as the NGO Campaign Against Arms Trade faced the government in a judicial review of the decision to continue licensing arms exports to Saudi Arabia despite the kingdom’s widely criticised offensive in Yemen. The 8 October airstrike on the funeral in the Yemeni capital was among the bloodiest incidents in a conflict that has cost the lives of at least 4,600 civilians, according to the UN. A hall was bombed as a funeral was taking place, with hundreds present. Minutes later, as people tried to help the wounded, a second airstrike hit in a “double-tap”, leading to further deaths, including those of rescuers. A UN report seen by Reuters found that 140 people were killed and hundreds more injured, and that the attack had breached international humanitarian law. The coalition acknowledged it had mistakenly targeted the funeral based on incorrect information. Fox delayed signing off on further weapons exports to the Saudi air force following the strike, the correspondence suggested. The government’s top export official, Edward Bell, wrote on 28 October that his department was consulting the Foreign Office to see whether there was a clear risk exports could be used to break the laws of war. He added: “We are making contingencies should licensing policy change.” Under UK export rules, licences should not be approved if there is a clear risk the weapons could be used for serious violations of international humanitarian law. Saudi Arabia is Britain’s most important weapons client: the government has signed off sales of more than £3.3bn since March 2015, when the kingdom led a coalition of Middle Eastern countries in an attempt to push Houthi rebels out of the Yemeni capital. Johnson visited Saudi Arabia in December, days after an embarrassing row when comments he had made about the kingdom engaging in “proxy wars” in the Middle East surfaced. He wrote to Fox that he was able to discuss these issues at first hand with the Saudi leadership, and noted an “encouraging positive trend” to reduce the risks of serious breaches of IHL. He therefore recommended that sales should continue, even though the US had recently blocked a sale of precision-guided munitions to the country. A spokesman for the UK government said: “The UK is playing a leading role in work to find a political solution to the conflict in Yemen and to address the humanitarian crisis. “We operate one of the most robust export control regimes in the world and keep our defence exports to Saudi Arabia under careful and continual review. Given the current legal proceedings we will not be commenting further outside of court at this stage.” The Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Tom Brake MP said: “It is up to the courts to rule whether Johnson and Fox have broken the law, but there is no doubt that they have trampled over the spirit of the law, which is in place to scrutinise the sale of weapons, uphold British values and protect human rights. “Saudi Arabia’s vicious campaign in Yemen has cost thousands of lives and left a country in ruins, and this Tory government are complicit in that tragedy.” Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, the SNP’s international trade spokeswoman, called Johnson’s letter “truly sickening”. She said: “It is clear from this revelation that the foreign secretary has absolutely no moral compass. Instead of immediately halting arms sales to Saudi Arabia or challenging the human rights violations happening every day in Yemen, he is actively encouraging arms sales. It raises serious questions about whether Boris Johnson is fit to be foreign secretary.” The Green party’s co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the letters showed a “stunning disregard” for human rights on Johnson’s part. He said: “Johnson has shown utter contempt not just for the 140 people who lost their lives in the Sana’a bombing, but also for the people whose lives he put at risk with this terrible decision. “Britain should stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia immediately. UK weapons must not be used to violate international law and human rights.” Documents disclosed on Tuesday revealed that earlier in the year Bell had advised then-business secretary Sajid Javid: “My gut tells me we should suspend,” the court heard. Javid wrote to the then-foreign secretary Philip Hammond and defence secretary Michael Fallon that he intended to continue granting licences, adding: “I would like your agreement that this is the right policy for us to pursue at the present.” Half of the case has been heard in secret as the government wants to rely on sensitive material that it says would damage national security if heard in open court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/feb/09/survey-reveals-uk-judges-concerns-over-pay-and-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T13:23:46Z","webTitle":"Survey reveals UK judges' concerns over pay and safety","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/09/survey-reveals-uk-judges-concerns-over-pay-and-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/feb/09/survey-reveals-uk-judges-concerns-over-pay-and-safety","fields":{"headline":"Survey reveals UK judges' concerns over pay and safety","bodyText":"Almost half of all high court judges plan to leave the bench early, according to a survey that exposes widespread resentment among the judiciary over loss of earnings, deteriorating working conditions and fears for their personal safety in court. While almost all judges believe they provide an important service to society and are committed to their roles, morale has declined sharply since the last survey was conducted. The latest Judicial Attitudes Survey, conducted in the summer of 2016, found that 42% of all judges would leave if they had a viable alternative option, compared with 23% in the previous survey in 2014. More than a third (36%) of salaried judges said they may consider leaving the judiciary early over the next five years. This included 47% of high court judges, 41% of court of appeal judges and 40% of crown court judges. That judges feel poorly rewarded despite earning substantial salaries is no surprise. Because they can earn high fees in private practice, transferring to the bench has always been a matter of swapping lucrative potential for public service and income security. Last month an employment tribunal ruled in favour of more than 200 judges whose pension entitlements had been cut, declaring that they had been unfairly discriminated against. A high court judge earns around £180,000 a year, and a crown court judge £134,000. There was a four-year freeze in judicial pay from 2009 to 2013, followed by three years of increases of 1% per annum. An overwhelming majority (78%) of salaried judges surveyed said they had experienced a loss of net earnings over the past two years, 62% said they had been affected by pension changes and 74% felt their earnings “do not adequately reflect the work they have done”. Nearly two-thirds of the judges said their salary and reductions in pension rights were directly related to their sense of low morale. The latest survey, coordinated by Prof Cheryl Thomas, co-director of the Judicial Institute at University College London, was carried out to assist the Senior Salaries Review Body, which makes recommendations to the government annually on pay. As many as 99% of all salaried judges in England and Wales courts and UK non-devolved tribunals took part. Most judges felt valued by their colleagues on the bench but fewer than half (43%) felt appreciated by the public and virtually none felt esteemed by the media (3%) or by the government (2%). The survey was completed before the Daily Mail’s notorious “Enemies of the People” headline after the high court’s Brexit judgment last November. Other areas of concern highlighted by the survey included poor physical quality of court buildings (31%) and low morale of court staff (64%). A narrow majority of judges (51%) reported concerns for their personal safety while in court. Cuts to legal aid have resulted in far fewer lawyers being present, particularly in family courts, where judges often find themselves alone in rooms with feuding ex-partners attempting to resolve emotive child custody disputes. The same proportion said the amount of out-of-hours work was affecting them, up significantly from 29% in 2014. The lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, and the senior president of tribunals, Sir Ernest Ryder, said: “The quality of the judiciary underpins the rule of law and the continued success of our legal services market nationally and internationally. “We are therefore extremely grateful to those who took part in the survey, which assists the SSRB in making evidence-based recommendations to government on judicial pay. In the light of the substantially greater remuneration available to the most able practitioners in private practice, these matters are vital to our ability to attract candidates and retain judges of the highest calibre.” Commenting on the judicial attitudes survey, the justice secretary and lord chancellor, Elizabeth Truss, said: “Our independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law and is vital to our constitution and our freedoms. The reputation of our judiciary is unrivalled the world over. “I appreciate concerns raised around pay and pension. Having a fair and effective remuneration scheme in place is critical to the continued attraction and retention of high calibre judges. “I am working with the Lord Chief Justice and senior judiciary to address wider judicial concerns by providing judges with greater support in the courtroom, opportunities for development and progression, and improving the environment in which they operate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/pls-like-a-brutal-new-mockumentary-satirising-youtube-stars","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Pls Like: a brutal new mockumentary satirising YouTube stars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/pls-like-a-brutal-new-mockumentary-satirising-youtube-stars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/10/pls-like-a-brutal-new-mockumentary-satirising-youtube-stars","fields":{"headline":"Pls Like: a brutal new mockumentary satirising YouTube stars","bodyText":"What is it? A brutal and much-needed 15-minute takedown of vloggers. Why you’ll love it: Between W1A, People Just Do Nothing and America’s Documentary Now series, the mockumentary is slowly and steadily staging a comeback. And the latest is arguably one of the best: BBC3’s new YouTuber comedy Pls Like. It’s a tricky subject to get right. After all, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of crossover between people who watch YouTube stars and people who watch traditional TV. Plus, the nature of the YouTubers themselves – all grinning and scrubbed and so disgustingly, wretchedly young – can be a turn-off, even when the aim is to skewer them. Fortunately, Pls Like succeeds because it has comedian Liam Williams at the helm. Grunting, scruffy and occupying the fragile midpoint between suspicion and annoyance, Williams is the perfect counterpoint to all the harrowing optimism of the show’s subjects. The premise is this: desperate for money, Williams enters a So You Think You Can Vlog? competition that offers a £10,000 prize. When his jaundiced, embittered video captures the imagination of the British public, he is asked to complete six challenges, each relating to a popular genre of vlog. The rest of the series – so short that you can consume the entire thing in 90 minutes – is a breezy skip through some of the most popular vlogging subjects, such as beauty and fitness and technology. Williams rubs up against a procession of gurning YouTubers throughout the series, all of whom are managed by Tim Key’s oily James Wirm. Although the promotional material claims that Key knows nothing about the world of YouTubers, his performance is note perfect. Wirm’s surface chumminess masks a bottomless pit of controlling greed, and he serves as a handy common enemy for everyone involved. A show like Pls Like inherently runs the risk of sneering at people it assumes to be inferior, but, thankfully, the awkward holier-than-thou moments are limited to one especially toe-curling sequence, where Williams essentially breaks Zoella out of her superficial bubble by educating her with a Joni Mitchell song. It’s an awful moment, tone-deaf and sanctimonious and possibly sexist, but at least it passes quickly. The show works much better when Williams allows himself to become the butt of the joke as an angry misery-guts adrift in a world he doesn’t fully understand. Sometimes this comes out in his embittered narration – at one point he calls the millennial whoop “the sound of all true hope dying” – and pops up in pointlessly angry interstitial bursts of text, such as: “The word ‘vlog’ is a blend of ‘video’ and ‘eulogy’ because some believe they represent the culture of death.” YouTubers’ relentless torrent of artificial optimism is a ripe target for mockery, and Pls Like generally acquits itself well. I know little of the world myself, but recognised shots at Zoella, Alfie Deyes, Joe Wicks and Dapper Laughs. It also mercilessly captures the pointless challenges, the sinister product placements, the endless creepy insincerity, and the nonsensical enthusiasm of the form. Hopefully, Pls Like will stage a Fleabag-style breakthrough, although the brevity of the episodes may prevent that. Either way, it deserves to be watched by as many people as possible. It may just go down as the Spinal Tap of vlogging. Where: BBC Three. Length: Six 15-minute episodes, available weekly from 11 February. Stand-out episode: Episode two, which introduces the unlikely catchphrase “hogs”. If you liked Pls Like, watch: Haters Back Off (Netflix), Mascots (Netflix)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2017/feb/09/talking-horses-thursdays-best-bets-huntingdon-doncaster-keeper-hill","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T10:31:12Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Thursday's best bets for Huntingdon and Doncaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/09/talking-horses-thursdays-best-bets-huntingdon-doncaster-keeper-hill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/feb/09/talking-horses-thursdays-best-bets-huntingdon-doncaster-keeper-hill","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Thursday's best bets for Huntingdon and Doncaster","bodyText":"Thursday’s best bets A novice chaser who fell last time out and is expected to start at around 1-7 is unlikely to appeal to many punters this afternoon, but anyone who was impressed by all but the final act of Might Bite’s run in the Grade One Kauto Star Novice Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day may want to get involved now for next month’s RSA Chase. Might Bite was at least 15 lengths clear of the field as he came down to the last, and Daryl Jacob could have chosen to pop it with a minimum of fuss. Instead, he sent Might Bite into it like any other obstacle, and his partner got it badly wrong and suffered a heavy fall. Despite that crushing disappointment for his backers, Might Bite’s performance was still enough to see him rise to the top of the BHA’s ratings for staying novice chasers, and he is currently top-priced at 6-1 with Boylesports and Ladbrokes for the RSA. If you fancy him for the Festival, this could well be the moment to get on. Might Bite is not the only horse with a realistic chance at Cheltenham on show today, as Messire Des Obeaux, who took the Grade One Challow Hurdle at Newbury last time out, will line up for the Sidney Banks Memorial Hurdle at Huntingdon. Messire Des Obeaux gave 7lb and a half-length beating to Ballyandy, a leading contender for Saturday’s Betfair Hurdle, at Sandown in early December, and did not need to improve a great deal to win the Challow on his next start. That win means that he is giving 8lb all round today, however, and Keeper Hill (2.20) is a very dangerous opponent who could make the weight concession count. The market sees Messire Des Obeaux as a clear favourite at around 5-4, but Keeper Hill is a very live contender at 7-2 having won a novice event at Hereford in January with much more in hand than the bare form suggests. Skipthecuddles, second home there, was a six-length winner at Wetherby last Saturday, and Keeper Hill should outrun his odds this afternoon. Protek Des Flos (3.20) and Bertenbar (3.50) also make plenty of appeal at the prices on the same card, while Snow Leopardess (2.30) should emerge in front in a competitive novice hurdle back at Doncaster. Sutter County (2.05) is one of the most reliable and competent performers in the business on the all-weather circuit and will take all the beating at Lingfield, and Zorba The Greek (8.30) has a live chance at around 13-2 on the evening card at Chelmsford City.

The estimated number of affected children is now 450,000 (pdf), with 14 million people needing humanitarian assistance across the region. Nigeria is one of four countries the UN has warned is facing famine, along with Somalia, Yemen and South Sudan, where famine was declared on Monday in parts of the country. On Friday, a major international conference, hosted by Nigeria, Norway and Germany, will be held in Oslo aimed at increasing funding for the crisis in north-east Nigeria and the wider Lake Chad region. Nigeria’s north-east has for decades been poor, underdeveloped and dominated by agricultural industry and subsistence farming. In the past four years, the insurgency by Boko Haram has exacerbated problems in the region, leaving it further impoverished and facing a severe lack of food. The insecurity has left many farmers unable to plant or harvest their crops. In Borno state, 5.8 million people face extreme food and nutrition deficits, a figure that has doubled in the past year. According to Doune Porter, chief of communication for Unicef in Nigeria, the international community has failed to grasp the seriousness of the need for financial support in the region. “Last year we had a funding appeal of $115m [£92.4m] but we received just 41%,” he said. “We’ve still managed to do what we can. In the final eight weeks of last year we were able to scale up our aid by 37%. It’s made an impact, but without increased funding these are fragile gains.” When humanitarian workers are able to access insecure areas, helping children suffering from severe acute malnutrition is straightforward, according to Porter. “Treating them is a simple eight-week out-patient process that is really effective in helping develop their diet and health.” Around 1.8 million people are internally displaced with most living in accommodating – but increasingly populated – host communities. In the heat, some mothers feed water to their babies below the age of six months, which has increased malnutrition, especially in areas where water purity is low. Porter said that campaigns have been very effective in explaining to women that feeding infants exclusively with breast milk is the best way to prevent malnutrition. But aid organisations face challenges in reaching the areas most in need. “When we get there, the rates of malnutrition drop significantly,” Porter said. “The problem we have is reaching those areas that are still inaccessible due to the insecurity.” Last year, the Nigerian government and army announced they had “technically won the war” against Boko Haram, after President Muhammadu Buhari set a December deadline for defeating the terrorist group. Many areas in Borno state have indeed been liberated from Boko Haram occupation after a concerted military effort. Yet many of these areas are still dangerous and remain under military control, with residents’ movement restricted. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Ocha, about a third of Borno remains inaccessible due to insecurity. Adrian Ouvry, the regional humanitarian adviser for Mercy Corps, said that many areas deemed safe by the military remain under tight control. “In some areas, like Dikwa in eastern Borno, there are over 110,000 people penned into a heavily guarded urban area because of the surrounding insecurity.” He spoke of some areas having improved, mentioning Damboa in central Borno, where six months ago he had witnessed many children whose hair had been turned red by severe malnutrition – he said instances are fewer now. But he warned against complacency. “The conditions that caused the crisis are still there, so even after malnutrition rates and death rates fall there is still a need to sustain resources to those areas.” According to Unicef, of the 649 health centres and hospitals in Borno, 272 have been destroyed by the insurgency (pdf), putting added pressure on a state with millions in need of medical attention. The Nigerian government has been working with aid organisations to rebuild much of the health infrastructure in Borno. Education in the region has also been severely disrupted. Alkasim Abdulkadir is head of communications for an initiative set up by President Buhari to coordinate government resources. He said that though the majority of primary and secondary schools in Borno have been destroyed, there has been some progress in reconstructing them. “In Chibok, the school where the Chibok girls were kidnapped has been levelled and is now being rebuilt, along with many other schools.” The military have been demining farms across the state. According to Abdulkadir, much of the farmland had been a battlefield in the war against Boko Haram but the government is working to make it safe for cultivation again. Yet while the military works to make liberated areas secure, conflict still poses a threat to the relief effort. A refugee camp in Rann, Borno, was inadvertently bombed in January by the Nigerian military, killing more than 100 displaced people and aid workers. In an incident two weeks previously, 30 people were killed by the army as the result of a communications error. In neighbouring states such as Adamawa, aid organisations and the government have made significant progress in rebuilding destroyed areas and helping displaced people to resettle in safety. Yet across the north-east, and especially in Borno, the crisis remains. While some areas close to main trade routes have seen increased market activity and a decrease in malnutrition rates, maintaining and improving those conditions is a big challenge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/12/air-pollution-when-smog-hits-headlines-pollutionwatch","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T21:30:17Z","webTitle":"When smog hits the headlines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/12/air-pollution-when-smog-hits-headlines-pollutionwatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/12/air-pollution-when-smog-hits-headlines-pollutionwatch","fields":{"headline":"When smog hits the headlines","bodyText":"Newspaper headlines in January told us that London’s air pollution was worse than Beijing. BBC journalist Joseph D’Urso likened this to the heatwave weather stories each summer that say Brighton is hotter than Barcelona. Brighton is not normally as warm as Barcelona. Comparing particle pollution, London was worse than Beijing for four smoggy days, from 20 to 23 January, but over the whole month London’s particle pollution was around a quarter of that in the Chinese capital. However, January’s smog did break recent records. Still, foggy conditions trapped air pollution in our towns and cities. Twenty four places in London reached the top level of 10 in the government air quality index, the greatest number since the index was created in 2012. Traffic and wood-burning on the evening of Sunday 21 January led to the worst pollution peak since 2011. The smog was not just in London. Index level 10 was measured across south-east England, level nine in Northern Ireland and eight over the Midlands and Bristol. Smogs catapult air pollution into the news and potentially up the political agenda. The deaths of an estimated 12,000 Londoners in the 1952 smog led to the Clean Air Act and an end to coal pollution in our cities. Images of Beijing smogs led to a change in environmental direction in China. More recently, the spring 2014 smog caused an estimated 300 extra deaths across England, compared with normal spring pollution, or 600 compared with a clean air situation. This January’s smog will add to calls for more meaningful action to clean our air."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/09/did-you-come-to-the-uk-as-a-child-refugee","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T10:17:27Z","webTitle":"Did you come to the UK as a child refugee?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/did-you-come-to-the-uk-as-a-child-refugee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/09/did-you-come-to-the-uk-as-a-child-refugee","fields":{"headline":"Did you come to the UK as a child refugee?","bodyText":"The government plans to end the “Dubs” scheme, which offered a safe haven for thousands of vulnerable lone child refugees in Europe.

Provisional data passed to the BBC says an unprecedented number of patients spent longer than the target time waiting to be seen in emergency wards in January. It showed that more than 60,000 people waited between four and 12 hours for a hospital bed. And more than 780 waited more than 12 hours. Both figures are record highs since the introduction in 2004 of a target that 95% of patients must be seen and either admitted or discharged in under four hours. The leaked document from NHS Improvement suggests that out of 1.4m visits in January, only 82% saw patients dealt with within the four-hour target. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Dr Tajek Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: “The [four-hour] target is a very sophisticated metric of the overall system and the thermostat is set red hot in the emergency department.” He added: “We are facing an incredible demand on our services. The dignity of care is significantly compromised. The international evidence shows that the more crowded your emergency departments are the higher the risk of dying. Delays to assessment will compromise your care.” The NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, said: “These figures have not been verified and should therefore be treated with caution, but they are in line with the feedback we have been getting from trusts. “NHS staff have responded magnificently to increased winter pressures, but the situation has become unsustainable. The rise in long trolley waits is particularly worrying, as there is clear evidence they can lead to worse outcomes for patients.” Hospitals have not hit the target nationally since the summer of 2015. A Department of Health spokesman said the January data was yet to be verified and that official figures, released on Thursday morning, only covered December. He said: “We do not recognise these figures – it is irresponsible to publish unverified data and does a disservice to all NHS staff working tirelessly to provide care around the clock. “Despite the pressures of winter, the vast majority of patients are seen and treated quickly and hospitals have detailed plans in place to manage busy periods – supported by an extra £400m of funding.” NHS performance against key waiting time targets was also poor in December as the “winter crisis” began to bite, the latest official figures from NHS England published on Thursday show. Hospitals in England admitted, transferred or discharged only 86.2% of patients from an A&amp;E unit within four hours – the worst-ever performance since records began in 2004. Those delays occurred as hospitals came under the most intense pressure ever seen, with a record number of patients – 497,915 – needing to be admitted as an emergency. The number of people who waited more than four hours to be admitted in December after treatment in A&amp;E – 61,727 – was also the highest ever seen, and well above the previous record of 53,640, seen in March 2016. Ambulance response times were also far below target. In the eight regional ambulance trusts still using the long-established way of measuring performance, crews got to the scene of just 66.4% of Red 1 calls – life-threatening emergencies such as someone having stopped breathing or suffered a cardiac arrest – within the required eight minutes, when it should be at least 75%. Ambulance services last met the 75% target in May 2015. Performance was even worse against the 75% target for responding to Red 2 calls, which includes strokes, fits and other life-threatening emergencies. Crews reached only 58.8% of such 999 callouts within eight minutes. Ambulance services last met the 75% target in January 2014. Hospitals also breached waiting time targets covering patients’ speedy access to 15 different types of diagnostic tests, receipt of non-urgent hospital treatment within 18 weeks and urgent cancer treatment within 62 days. The figures were “shocking”, said Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat former health minister. “These are the worst monthly figures since records began for waiting times,” he said. “More patients than ever spent over four hours in A&amp;E. We even have ‘trolley nurses’ now expressly to deal with often seriously ill patients not receiving the treatment they need.” Labour accused the prime minister of displaying “utter disregard” for the NHS. Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “Theresa May has lost control of the NHS this winter and patients are paying the price as target after target is missed and standards of care deteriorate. Experts are saying that standards are being pushed back 15 years or more. “Behind each of these statistics is a patient suffering and in unacceptable discomfort. It’s making Theresa May’s utter disregard for the dire state of the NHS all the more disgraceful.” Matthew Swindells, NHS England’s national director for operations and information, said: “NHS frontline services came under real pressure in December with A&amp;E, ambulances and NHS 111 all helping record numbers of patients and callers. Despite these pressures, it is a tribute to the professionalism and dedication of doctors, nurses and other staff in A&amp;E that they continue to see, treat, admit or discharge the vast majority of patients within four hours.” NHS England pointed to the rapidly rising demand for care and the fact that there was a 41% increase in delays in patients being trapped in hospital, despite being fit to leave, because social care support was not available to allow their discharge. Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association council, said delays in A&amp;E were a symptom of a bigger crisis in social care, which the government was failing to grasp. “When social care isn’t available, patients experience delays in moving from hospital to appropriate ongoing care settings – preventing patients being admitted at the front end in A&amp;E,” he said. “The prime minister cannot continue to bury her head in the sand as care continues to worsen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2017/feb/09/which-is-the-best-browser-for-windows-10-firefox-or-chrome","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T09:55:18Z","webTitle":"Which is the best browser for Windows 10: Firefox or Chrome?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/feb/09/which-is-the-best-browser-for-windows-10-firefox-or-chrome","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2017/feb/09/which-is-the-best-browser-for-windows-10-firefox-or-chrome","fields":{"headline":"Which is the best browser for Windows 10: Firefox or Chrome?","bodyText":"Which is the best web browser for Windows 10: Firefox or Google Chrome? Libby Over the years, I’ve used and recommended a lot of different browsers for Windows, including Mosaic, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Maxthon, Firefox, Chrome and Vivaldi. Times change, and so do web browsers. You can always switch to whichever feels better at the time. As mentioned previously, Windows 10 already includes two browsers: Edge and Internet Explorer 11. Edge is Microsoft’s new browser and replaces Internet Explorer 11, which is only provided for backwards compatibility with websites written for IE. Nothing stops you from installing alternatives, either as your default browser or for other purposes. For example, you can use a separate browser for Facebook and/or Gmail, to reduce cross-site tracking, or use different browsers for different Twitter accounts. I use Firefox most of the time, but I use Vivaldi for some websites, such as Gmail. I also use Edge for BBC iPlayer and other video sources, because I find it works better. However, browsers are notorious resource hogs – especially Chrome – so I may close them when I’m not using them. Closing and reopening browsers is the new “reboot your PC”. Of course, it’s only viable if you set your browser to reload existing tabs on restarts. One advantage of Firefox, Vivaldi, Opera and some others is that they do “lazy loading”: they only reload a tab when you click on it. This avoids a firestorm of reloads crippling your PC, especially if you have loads of tabs. (My record in Firefox is 608.) Not just technology There are four major web browsers, and three of them are designed to profit the companies that produce them: Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome) and Microsoft (Edge). Firefox is the only one to put the user’s interests first. Other things being equal, that’s a good reason to use it. Firefox is also the only major browser based on open-source code. Google releases the Chromium code as open source, and there are other browsers based on Chromium. Opera and Vivaldi are examples. However, Google adds proprietary code to produce Chrome, and others may do the same. Using multiple browsers helps maintain competition. We don’t want websites to be optimised for specific browsers (“Google works better with Chrome” etc), because that cedes too much power to whoever owns it. Ideally, we want both browsers and websites to follow agreed common standards, not company-specific quirks. Today, all four major browsers use different rendering engines: Blink (Google), Gecko (Firefox), Trident (Microsoft) and WebKit (Safari). Blink is a fork of WebKit, which was Apple’s fork of KDE’s open source KHTML, but they are diverging. (To be picky, Edge uses a fork of Trident, with the legacy junk removed.) Browser round-up Today, all the main browsers perform well on Windows 10, and you can happily use any or all of them. However, each one has some advantages. Chrome is the most popular browser and provides the best support for web standards, though it’s not significantly better than Vivaldi and Opera. It’s also secure, because the browser is sandboxed for extra protection. Chrome uses different threads so one bad tab can’t crash the whole browser, though it does tend to use a lot of memory and resources (add an extension, such as The Great Suspender), and it eats batteries. It struggles if you open a lot of tabs, and its interface is unable to cope: each tab shrinks to an unusably small size. Firefox is generally as fast as Chrome but more configurable, and it’s much better at handling tabs. You can scroll through dozens of tabs with a mouse-wheel, pick them off a drop-down list, or find them by typing the site’s name into the address bar and selecting “Switch to tab”. It uses less memory than Chrome, but a bad tab can crash the browser. (In my experience, it rarely happens.) Having too many tabs can slow it down, requiring a restart, but this is fairly quick thanks to “lazy loading”. Edge is fast, more secure, and claims to be kind to batteries, but it is still in development. It has the advantage of being plumbed into Windows 10 and integrated with Cortana – which makes it hard to avoid, even if you don’t like it. It’s already about as standards compliant as Firefox, which is a bit behind Chrome/Vivaldi/Opera but well ahead of IE11 and Safari. One of its party tricks is annotating web pages with a pen or stylus. Its main drawback is a shortage of extensions. For privacy and other reasons, I prefer Chromium-based Vivaldi to Chrome. It’s a “power user” browser and much more configurable. It’s slower to start up, but it uses “lazy loading”. It handles tabs better than Chrome, by reducing them to favicons, and by showing a full preview when you hover the mouse over a tab. You gain a lot for sacrificing a few seconds in load time. Vivaldi is being developed by some of the people who created the old Opera browser, hence the musical name. The old Opera browser also aimed at more sophisticated users, and had its own rendering engine, Presto. The new Opera is simpler and, like Vivaldi, based on Chromium. It’s worth a look. Both Vivaldi and Opera can use Chrome extensions, but they don’t all work. I’ve had much more success with Vivaldi, where you can download extensions from the Chrome store. Extensions All browsers now offer extensions for purposes such as saving passwords safely, saving browser sessions, downloading embedded videos, and doing image searches on the fly. There’s a natural tendency to install lots of useful-looking extensions, but they can cripple browser performance. The extensions I use include Ghostery (anti-tracking), Session Manager, Mozilla Archive Format (for saving pages in MHTML) and Extended Statusbar. I also have extensions for reverse image searches at Google, Bing and TinEye. These are all for Firefox, but you can often get the same or similar extensions for other browsers. I recommend adopting a two- or even a three-browser strategy. If you load your main browser with defensive extensions etc, it may not work correctly with some websites. Since Windows 10 already includes Edge, you can adopt a two-browser strategy by downloading Firefox or Chrome or Vivaldi, whichever you prefer. Download two and you will have three rendering engines, which is a good thing. For normal use, I don’t think there’s much to choose between Firefox and Chrome/Vivaldi at the moment. My preference for Firefox is based on its ability to handle a ridiculous number of tabs, plus the fact that it’s not written with user-exploitation in mind. YMMV.

Since he created his personal @petesouza account on 21 January, Pete Souza has attracted 800,000 followers on the back of his intimate images taken behind the scenes of the Obama presidency. The snaps he has selected, and the moments at which he has chosen to post them, have been interpreted by observant Instagrammers as throwing subtle shade at the new president. For instance, late last month, after Trump signed an executive order banning entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries, Souza shared an image of Obama talking to a Muslim refugee in Kuala Lumpur: When Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court, Souza reposted a photo of Obama with his pick, Merrick Garland, who Republicans refused to consider for the role last year: The same day, as reports emerged that Trump told Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto over the telephone about sending troops south of the border to take care of “bad hombres”, Souza shared a photo of Obama and Peña Nieto enjoying a tequila: After Trump’s acrimonious phone call with Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, was reported as evidence of the deteriorating alliance between the two countries, Souza shared a photograph of Obama conversing with Turnbull at the Asean gala dinner in Laos last September: And after a report by the New York Times on Sunday of meetings being conducted in the dark because White House aides were unable to find the light switches, Souza shared a photo of Obama conducting a meeting beneath at least five light sources: More generally, Souza has highlighted the paucity of women in Trump’s cabinet: Souza lists his occupation in his Instagram bio as “TBD” – to be decided. He expands on his website that he “is currently a ‘free agent’, hoping that the Boston Red Sox need a utility player in the coming season”. His previous Instagram posts as chief photographer have been archived to the @petesouza44 account, maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration along with all other digital records of Obama’s time in office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/16/india-big-data-election-pollsters-target-age-caste-religion-uttar-pradesh","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-16T04:59:59Z","webTitle":"India's 'big data' election: 45,000 calls a day as pollsters target age, caste and religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/16/india-big-data-election-pollsters-target-age-caste-religion-uttar-pradesh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/16/india-big-data-election-pollsters-target-age-caste-religion-uttar-pradesh","fields":{"headline":"India's 'big data' election: 45,000 calls a day as pollsters target age, caste and religion","bodyText":"Every day since September, the basement of a suburban Lucknow mansion has buzzed with the voices of hundreds of young women, enquiring, cajoling, and occasionally pleading into headsets. “Please, please,” one begs a reluctant villager down the line, “I only need five or 10 seconds.” Crammed around tables, powered by an unending stream of tea, the women are combing lists of voters across Uttar Pradesh, an Indian state so populated it could be the sixth-largest country in the world. As the answers flow, they carefully fill in boxes, reading “caste”, “voting pattern” or “preferred chief minister”. Upstairs, the details are fed into spreadsheets that form a database of 75 million voters. Around 45,000 calls are made each day. This is “big data”-gathering, Indian-style, and on an Indian scale. This past Saturday, the first of Uttar Pradesh’s 140 million voters cast their ballots in India’s most-anticipated state elections. In the 2014 national elections the state delivered a landslide win to Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister. How his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fares over the next month’s voting is viewed as a crucial test of whether Modi still has that magnetic appeal, with almost two years until he himself faces voters again. Along with the upstart Aam Aadmi party that now controls Delhi, Modi was among the first to employ the data-driven campaigning techniques that helped propel Barack Obama to the White House twice, and which contributed to Donald Trump’s upset win in November. But the frenetic dialling and number-crunching underway in the Lucknow suburbs is the most sophisticated data operation yet deployed in Indian politics, says its co-founder, Adwait Vikram Singh, the deputy campaign director for the ruling Samajwadi party (SP). “Other parties wouldn’t believe we have this,” the 29-year-old says, flicking through an app his team has distributed to SP candidates, showing voter preferences down to the level of individual booths, and along caste, gender and literacy lines. Unlike in the US or UK, where firms such as Cambridge Analytica could rely on Facebook quizzes to create detailed “psychographic” profiles of voters, data gathering in Uttar Pradesh – one of India’s poorest states, with a reputation for lawlessness – still requires a human touch. “There’s no way around it. Facebook, the digital ecosystem, it’s not so deeply rooted. India is a place where you have to dirty your hands and feet,” Singh says. One problem is that phone numbers are not always active for long in poorer areas of the state. An itinerant labourer or farmhand might be charged 20 rupees for call credit. Buying an entirely new sim card, pre-loaded with call credits, could cost five rupees less. Singh and his colleagues had to send field teams into all 403 seats in the vast state. They returned with not just detailed lists of voters, but also relationships with local “influencers”, he says. Well-connected people such as village chiefs, postal workers or teachers can help report popular sentiment – or pass on new phone numbers when someone has changed their sim card again. Making the task harder, too, is that India makes available far less digital information about its citizens than governments or corporations in the west. “In the US and UK, because of their credit bureaus, because of the digitalisation that happened 20 or 30 years back, they’ve figured out laws around data usage, and a lot of that data is available for you to analyse,” says Milind Chitgupakar, the chief analytics officer at Modak Analytics, a Hyderabad-based data research firm. In 2013 the firm embarked on a larger-scale – though less granular – task than Singh’s, combining census and election rolls to create a database of 810 million Indian voters. “It was a huge challenge, because of the way language has evolved in India, and created its own phonics,” he says. “We found out the word ‘Srinivas’ has 430 different variations. “Or take the area Najafgarh,” he says. “It’s spelt differently in NSSO [National Sample Survey Office] data, central government data, in polling-level data. If a human reads it he’ll say, yeah, it’s all the same. But to train a computer to learn that these two names are the same … A lot of the analytics we did was trying to solve these hiccups.” The final result threw up trivia – the most common woman’s name in Uttar Pradesh is Sunita; the oldest voter is, according to official records, aged 7,982 – but also paid dividends for one major party. “The data showed that the highest number of registered voters in India were aged 27,” Chitgupakar says. But India’s population skews much younger. “So we knew there was this huge missing gap of people not registered to vote between 18 and 27. “There was extensive polling done and we found that this age group, because they were very aspirational, were planning to vote for a certain political leader and his party, who I can’t name,” he says, citing contractual agreements – though the profile clearly fits Modi. “As soon as we got that information, the party launched a massive voter registration drive to bring those young people in. From opinion polls we figured out that regardless of socioeconomic status, age, even religion, the overriding factor was that this leader had a 10% greater chance of being voted for by this young group. “In Uttar Pradesh in 2014, in that one year, there were one crore [10 million] additional voters because of this campaign, and 70% of them were below the age of of 35. That was because of data analytics,” he says. Mining huge datasets might be the newest phenomenon in Indian politics, but for the SP, it was nearly outdone by one of the oldest. Just as data gathering was getting underway in September, a bitter dynastic fight between the chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav, and his uncle and father, also prominent party figures, spilled out into the open. Yadav was dumped as the party’s state president, briefly losing access to party money he hoped to use to build the database. With the system now up and running, Singh says candidates can “micro-target” messages they know appeal to young, college-graduate, Muslim women, for example, in booths that skew towards those demographics. More detailed information, to which access is more restricted, allows Singh and his colleagues to track almost every family in around 200 seats. He declines to discuss specifics while the campaign is ongoing, but says in theory, he could advise a candidate to call a particular, influential member of a village whose support is wavering, according to their research. “That’s an integral part of my campaign,” Singh says. Not all party stalwarts are enamoured with the Harvard graduate’s attempt to “disrupt” their methods. “They tell me, ‘We know what our people want’,” he says. “But there’s a reason why no government has been re-elected in Uttar Pradesh since 1984. “You don’t know what people want. If you don’t have great feedback, it’s not going to work.” In a state notorious for its thuggish politics, with an unprecedented number of candidates accused of crimes, gathering such sensitive information might also present a security risk. Singh maintains confidential information is never passed on to party figures, though “on occasion” phone numbers are shared. Generally, India is “quite perilously placed in terms of privacy protection”, says Apar Gupta, a technology lawyer. “There’s an absence of protections in law, the constitutional right to privacy is under doubt, and even an expectation of privacy from state instrumentalities is absent,” he says. Politics along caste and religious lines is still blatantly practised in Uttar Pradesh. As data analytics pushes Indian political campaigns into the 21st century, there is also the risk that it drags divisive caste politics with it. But Singh says he believes otherwise: that the flood of new information about voters’ incomes or literacy rates will actually push political campaigns to go “beyond caste”. In a rapidly changing India, “caste is a diminishing return”, he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/18/kate-grenville-helen-razer-neil-gaiman-literary-highlights-for-australia-in-february","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-17T21:05:07Z","webTitle":"Kate Grenville, Helen Razer, Neil Gaiman – literary highlights for Australia in February","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/18/kate-grenville-helen-razer-neil-gaiman-literary-highlights-for-australia-in-february","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/18/kate-grenville-helen-razer-neil-gaiman-literary-highlights-for-australia-in-february","fields":{"headline":"Kate Grenville, Helen Razer, Neil Gaiman – literary highlights for Australia in February","bodyText":"One Leg Over by Robin Dalton (Text) Ninety-five-year-old Robin Dalton (née Eakin) has had an interesting life, to say the least – her short-lived first marriage made the front pages during the second world war, she was an intelligence agent for the Thai government, a literary agent to four Booker prize-winning novelists as well as playwrights Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, and a film producer with credits including Oscar and Lucinda and Country Life.

Getting Away With Murder by Duncan McNab (Vintage) From the late 70s to the early 90s a spate of attacks on gay men, and men suspected of being gay, occurred throughout Sydney. About 80 men disappeared or died during this period; some of their deaths were ruled as suicide or misadventure, others left unexplained. In 2016 88 cases from this era became the focus of review by New South Wales police as part of Operation Parrabell, with the objective of determining whether they were gay-hate crimes. The attacks were also the subject of a wide-ranging investigation by SBS’s Deep Water project, which included documentary media and a fictionalised TV miniseries based on the events. Duncan McNab was a member of the NSW police force during the late 70s and early 80s, working in criminal investigation. Getting Away With Murder is McNab’s personal and procedural reflection on these crimes from the point of view of an insider on many of the investigations, but it’s also an analysis of prejudice and the shifting perspectives on sexuality and society across the past three decades. – SC Available now. The Circle and the Equator by Kyra Giorgi (UWAP) Kyra Giorgi’s first interest is history: the researcher and Perth native (and daughter of the highly regarded Australian writer Gail Jones) has a PhD in the subject, and it is perhaps this enthusiasm that is the driving force behind this collection of 13 stories, which cross eras, oceans and cultures. The Circle and the Equator is Giorgi’s first book of fiction, and with her careful, eloquent prose (which has occasionally made an appearance in local literary journals) Giorgi interrogates the experiences – and ethics – of war, medicine, science and identity, and what it might feel like to live through the turning points of history. – SC Available now. Testosterone Rex: Unmaking the Myths of our Gendered Minds by Cordelia Fine (Icon) Cordelia Fine’s writing is marked by an impressive synthesis of feminist politics, clarity of vision and scientific rigour. Fine’s 2010 release, Delusions of Gender, was a comprehensive analysis and systematic dismantling of “neurosexism” – the idea that there are hardwired differences between “male brains” or “female brains” or that they have anything to do with a natural predilection for things like empathy, mathematics, doing laundry or running a country. In Testosterone Rex, Fine turns her own excellent brain to examining the narratives around the supposed king of hormones. The Guardian reviewer Sarah Ditum writes: “Fine is a sure guide to the science, building up complexity without sacrificing clarity. By the time she’s finished, any lingering confidence that hormones exert a simple dose-response influence on our behaviour is thoroughly done for … Testosterone Rex is a debunking rumble that ought to inspire a roar.” – SC Available now. The Case Against Fragrance by Kate Grenville (Text) Kate Grenville was very young when she started getting headaches from perfume, but it wasn’t until a run-in with a virus during middle age that her sensitivity to scent really took over her life. Finding herself accosted by fragrance at every turn – even needing to tape up the cracks around hotel doorways and run through perfumed lobbies and shopping centres with a scarf covering her face – Grenville embarked on a quest to discover what exactly is in these fragrances with which we cloud ourselves, and why does even the slightest hint of them send some people spiralling into ill health? “Using fragrance is a choice,” Grenville argues, “and my hope is that this book might give people the chance to make that choice an informed one.” – SC Available now. Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders (Bloomsbury) When Abraham Lincoln’s 11-year-old son Willie died in February 1962, as the civil war gathered steam, the president was devastated. According to some historical accounts, after the sun had set on the day of the funeral, Lincoln – racked with grief – returned to visit the corpse that lay in a marble vault locked behind an iron gate. Such is the jumping off point for Lincoln in the Bardo, George Saunders’ first novel – although novel isn’t really the right word for it. At this point in his innovative career, no one would expect Saunders to go by the book. Set on that one night, the text is presented in part as a script: a dialogue between the ghostly forms – dead people, from different ages – who haunt the graveyard where Willie’s spirit is also trapped. This is interspersed by whole chapters which quote from historical texts (made up by the author), which highlight that underlying tension of history: it’s pretty much always subjective. This odd format – which has polarised the Guardian Australia office – gives Saunders an opportunity to flex his greatest muscle: inhabiting the minute idiosyncrasies of a diversity of characters, and painting them so vividly that the ghosts become real. His second greatest muscle, of course, is his humour – and if you can sink into its style, this becomes a very funny, deeply original book. – SH Available now. Fear by Dirk Kurbjuweit (Text) The German journalist and author Dirk Kurbjuweit provocatively poses the question “can anyone become a murderer?” in his latest novel, based on his family’s personal experience with a stalker. Eight years ago Kurbjuweit and his wife and his two children were terrorised by a neighbour, a hellish time which he has revisited for dramatic effect in this book, his first to be translated into English. Kurbjuweit plumbs his own family’s terror but takes it a step further into the realm of violence and revenge and the question: how far would you go to protect your family? – LC Available now. The Refugees by Viet Thanh Nguyen (Hachette) Viet Thanh Nguyen follows up his Pulitzer prize-winning novel, The Sympathizer, with this collection of short stories about those people who cross cultural, national and emotional borders to escape – and to come home. The Guardian reviewer Yiyun Li writes that Nguyen’s stories “do not aim to surprise us with new twists or shock us with sensational details, as war and refugee stories could easily choose to do. Rather … Nguyen’s characters tell these stories because they are the only ones known to them … Nguyen has breathed life into many unforgettable characters, and given us a timely book focusing, in the words of Willa Cather, on ‘the slow working out of fate in people of allied sentiment and allied blood’.” – SC Available now. Idaho by Emily Ruskovich (Chatto &amp; Windus) It’s very hard to write about the debut author Emily Ruskovich’s novel Idaho without giving away something you don’t want to know yet. What you want, what is best, is to come to it with little knowledge; to have the story unfold according to Ruskovich’s plan and pace. From the first page it is clear that Ruskovich’s poetic, spare writing would be enough to compel on its own, but this extraordinary story of a violent event that decimates a young family in northern Idaho is the true engine here. It’s a puzzle that enthrals from the outset. – LC Available now. Why I Am Not a Feminist: A Feminist Manifesto by Jessa Crispin (Black Inc) Jessa Crispin, founder and editor of the online literary magazine Bookslut, has issues with feminism – but it’s not the fighting for women’s rights part, it’s that feminists so often seem to not be fighting for much at all. Too busy trying to make itself universal, feminism, Crispin argues, has made itself redundant. “Crispin is telling us that we have to imagine something better in order to build it,” the Guardian reviewer Suzanne Moore writes. “Feminism as self-absorption, as an add-on label to a new lifestyle, has got us … where exactly? Where we are now. Stalled. Look how quickly we can go backwards. When did feminism get so small? When it became polite, unthreatening and marketable. Crispin blasts through all this by asking us to think big, properly scarily big.” “If by declaring myself a feminist,” argues Crispin, “I must reassure you that I am not angry, that I pose no threat, then feminism is not for me. I am angry, and I do pose a threat.” Why I Am Not a Feminist certainly pulls no punches; it is short, sharp and polemical, and will be a guaranteed conversation starter among feminists for the foreseeable future. – SC Available 21 February. Audacity: How Barack Obama Defied His Critics and Transformed America by Jonathan Chait (HarperCollins) The legacy left by the first African-American president of the United States will be much debated, and one of the first out of the gates with the political eulogies is Jonathan Chait, writer for New York magazine and former senior editor at the New Statesman. Obama’s legacy is stronger than Trump, Chait argues, in policy as well as in perception. Whether this is the case remains to be seen, but one of the hallmarks of Chait’s writing is that he is persuasive, even when you don’t agree with him, and has an enviable talent for making complex ideas readable. Chait’s optimism in the face of Trump-era pessimism may feel a bit jarring for some, but for others might be precisely the kind of reassurance they need right now. – SC Available now. Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman (Bloomsbury) A book about Norse mythology by Neil Gaiman is one of those ideas that seems so bleedingly obvious that it’s a wonder it took so long to make it happen. After all, the English author is no stranger to myth: from the Sandman comics to that modern classic, American Gods, his books are so chock-full of mythological references and reimaginings that one suspects he could probably fill an entire library with just his own research notes. “The halls of Valhalla have been crying out for Neil Gaiman to tell their stories to a new audience,” writes the Guardian reviewer Natalie Haynes. “Hopefully this collection will be just the beginning.” – SC Available now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/09/brexit-labour-jeremy-corbyn-changes-concessions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T09:59:02Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit: Labour will push for concessions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/09/brexit-labour-jeremy-corbyn-changes-concessions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/09/brexit-labour-jeremy-corbyn-changes-concessions","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit: Labour will push for concessions","bodyText":"The government does not have “a blank cheque” to push through its vision of Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn has said, despite the overwhelming Commons vote to pass the article 50 bill without a single amendment. The Labour leader said there was little his party could have done about the bill, given its limited scope, but he would continue to push for concessions and changes as the Brexit process continued. “There was a referendum,” he told BBC1’s Breakfast programme. “There was a decision by the people of this country and we support the result of the referendum, and have to carry it out. “It doesn’t mean we agree with the government on the economy for the future. It does mean we have to build good relations with everybody across Europe.” Insisting the government had already made concessions over both the fact of the article 50 bill and over a parliamentary vote on the final Brexit deal, Corbyn said there was scope to shape the process. “The government does not have a blank cheque to set up an offshore tax haven in Britain,” he said. “All that it has is authority to proceed with negotiations, which is what the referendum was about.” The bill was passed by 494 votes to 122, and will now go to the House of Lords, where Labour and Liberal Democrat peers will press for concessions on key issues including the status of EU citizens living in the UK. Ministers will place significant pressure on peers not to obstruct or amend the bill, even threatening this could otherwise see the end of the upper chamber in its current form. A government source said: “If the Lords don’t want to face an overwhelming public call to be abolished they must get on and protect democracy and pass this bill.” Clive Lewis resigned as shadow business secretary after deciding to go against the three-line whip. He became the fourth shadow cabinet member to step down rather than vote in favour. Corbyn denied there was a crisis in Labour over the issue. “It’s not a disaster,” he said. “The majority of Labour MPs voted to trigger article 50. Fifty-odd voted against it, mainly on the basis of a strong message from their own constituents. On all the other votes there is unity, on all the other campaigning there is unity.” Asked about his statement in a tweet that the “real fight” for Brexit starts now, Corbyn argued there was little that could have been achieved with the article 50 bill. “Do you not understand? This was a one-clause bill,” he said. “A one-clause bill that authorised the government to start negotiating, and recognised the result of the referendum.” Corbyn also dismissed reports that he had set a timetable to step down, calling it “fake news”. “I’m really surprised the BBC is reporting fake news,” he said. “There is no news. There is no news.” There was, however, anguish among some Labour MPs about amendments not being passed. Harriet Harman, who had proposed guarantees for overseas EU nationals in the UK, said the failure of this meant these people were being used as “human shields” for Brexit negotiations. “There’s now going to be months if not years of uncertainty; we could have ended that. There’s clear evidence that gangmasters are exploiting people,” she said. Brexit supporters welcomed the bill’s passage through the Commons. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who campaigned for decades for an EU referendum, said: “I never thought I’d see the day where the House of Commons overwhelmingly voted for Britain to leave the European Union.” The Brexit secretary, David Davis, said: “We’ve seen a historic vote tonight – a big majority for getting on with negotiating our exit from the EU and a strong, new partnership with its member states.” Lewis was one of 52 Labour MPs who rebelled against Corbyn’s three-line whip to vote against the legislation, which authorises the government to trigger article 50, the formal process for exiting the EU. Lewis represents Norwich South, a constituency that voted strongly to remain in the EU, and had been openly agonising about whether he could bring himself to support the legislation. In his resignation letter, sent before he voted against the whip on Wednesday, Lewis thanked Corbyn for discussing the issue of Brexit in an “open and comradely way”. But he added: “When I became the MP for Norwich South, I promised my constituents I would be Norwich’s voice in Westminster, not Westminster’s voice in Norwich. I therefore cannot, in all good conscience, vote for something I believe will ultimately harm the city I have the honour to represent, love and call home. “It is therefore with a heavy heart that I have decided to resign from the shadow cabinet.” He said he felt he could not vote for the article 50 bill, since Labour had not succeeded in amending it. “Our party, the Labour party, was right to attempt, through parliament, to win the protections the people of this country need. Unfortunately, despite the progress we did make, we have been unable to secure them,” he wrote. Widely seen as a rising star on the left of the party, Lewis voted for the bill at its second reading last week, but made it clear that if Labour failed to amend the legislation he could not do so again. When the last potential amendment failed on Wednesday night, Labour issued a statement saying he had stepped down. Some see him as a potential leadership candidate, who could act as a bridge between the Corbynite wing of the party and the so-called soft left. But in the corridors MPs were being quite disparaging about what some called his “flip-flopping” in recent days about whether he could back the bill. Diane Abbott, the Hackney North MP who was absent from last week’s second reading, citing a migraine, voted in favour of the bill despite speculation she was concerned about the reaction of her overwhelmingly pro-remain constituents. In her official response to the vote she said that while she accepted the result of the referendum, “this does not mean that we have to accept Brexit in the haphazard way in which it is being handed to us”. She continued: “This passage of this bill has been a challenge for Labour. Our MPs represent the top six most passionately pro-leave constituencies, and the six most passionately pro-remain constituencies … I voted for the bill as a loyal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and a loyal member of the shadow cabinet.” She later said Brexit was not the leftwing idea imagined by Labour stalwart Tony Benn but a situation more akin to the politics of the US president, Donald Trump. She told BBC2’s Newsnight programme: “I respect the result of the referendum and no one wanted to thwart it in a perverse kind of way. But we need to be clear, this is not a Tony Benn Brexit, this is Donald Trump Brexit, and it’s got a very ugly side.” Corbyn will now have to embark on a reshuffle, and must also decide how to treat frontbenchers outside the shadow cabinet, including three of his own whips, who rebelled. Labour sources said decisions would be made in the next few days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/09/peter-dutton-says-tougher-citizenship-test-may-be-on-the-way","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T09:04:26Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton says tougher citizenship test may be on the way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/peter-dutton-says-tougher-citizenship-test-may-be-on-the-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/peter-dutton-says-tougher-citizenship-test-may-be-on-the-way","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton says tougher citizenship test may be on the way","bodyText":"Peter Dutton has signalled a new, tougher citizenship test could consider behaviour including whether or not parents sent their children to school in the country they lived in before they applied for permanent residency in Australia. In an interview on Sky News on Thursday, the immigration minister said a tougher citizenship test, which remains in gestation inside the government, could consider questions beyond whether or not the person had a criminal record. “It could go beyond that,” Dutton said. “We could look at whether or not somebody has been involved in an outlaw motorcycle gang, we could look at whether somebody has been involved, for example, in domestic violence, we could look at whether or not somebody had children that were of school age, but had not attended school for extended periods over that preceding three or four years.” Dutton said there were 65 million people in the world who “would set up in Australia tomorrow, and I don’t think we should be embarrassed to say that we want the best of those people”. He said finding out whether or not children had been to school “could be part of a bigger picture that you could paint to say if your kids are breaking the law, if they’re involved in gang violence, if members of your family have been involved in distributing drugs. “I mean, it’s a complete picture that we need to look at and I don’t think we should be ashamed … in this country to say that we are a great country, we are built on migration, people for generations have come here, worked hard and the vast majority do the right thing.” Asked whether or not command of English was also in the mix for a revised test, Dutton said “there are people that would suggest” language proficiency went to the question of whether someone was integrating or not. “Well, I think there are people that would suggest that over a period of time if your English language doesn’t improve, that that goes to the question of integration or the ability to work or to work with your community or with your school or whatever the case might be,” Dutton said. The minister said the government was continuing to work through the detail of any change to the current system. “We’ve obviously got a security intelligence aspect to it as well, so we’re having a look at the practical way that it might work and then if it’s something we decide to proceed with we’ll make an announcement,” he said. Dutton said he was considering moving away from the current question-and-answer test “to something which is more objective”. That would involve looking at conduct in the years before residency in Australia was sought. In the broad, Dutton said the test was about ensuring people wanted to share Australian values. “If you want to live in this country you need to abide by the law and if you’re not going to abide by the law, or you’re not going to work if you’ve got a capacity to work, if you’re going to spend your time on welfare, or your kids are involved in Apex gangs in Victoria, for instance, then really we need to question whether that person is the best possible citizen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/09/trump-china-letter-no-phone-call-xi-jinping","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T09:44:03Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump keeps China on hold with letter but no phone call for Xi Jinping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/09/trump-china-letter-no-phone-call-xi-jinping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/09/trump-china-letter-no-phone-call-xi-jinping","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump keeps China on hold with letter but no phone call for Xi Jinping","bodyText":"Donald Trump has reportedly yelled down the telephone at Australia’s prime minister and veered off into rants about China and Nato with French leader François Hollande. So the leader of the world’s second largest economy, Xi Jinping, may feel he got off lightly with nothing more than a letter. Almost three weeks after Trump’s inauguration, that was how the US president decided to engage with his Chinese counterpart, in what observers described as a further indication of the dark clouds now gathering over US-China relations. In a statement, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump had used the missive to tell Xi he was looking forward to working with him “to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China”. Trump also wished the Chinese people a happy Year of the Rooster, although those tidings came almost a fortnight late. Eyebrows have been raised by the fact that Trump has not held a conversation with Xi since his inauguration, despite finding time to speak to at least 18 world leaders and post 112 tweets on his @realDonaldTrump account. “It’s a sign that bad times lie ahead in the US-China relationship,” said Nick Bisley, an international relations expert from La Trobe University in Melbourne. “China is very much being lined up by Trump’s people as not quite enemy number one but something approximating that.” Bisley said he believed Trump’s failure to line up a phone date with Xi was part of a deliberate ploy to annoy and publicly embarrass Beijing. “That’s just the way Trump likes things … This is not, ‘Oh, crap! We forgot about the Chinese!’ This is a considered cocking of the snook.” Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, rejected the suggestion that the lack of phone contact was a snub. “This kind of remark is meaningless,” said Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing, claiming that Trump’s holiday greetings had been “highly appreciated”. In a report released on Tuesday, some of the world’s leading China experts warned that the combination of Trump’s volatility and Xi’s increasingly aggressive and autocratic rule threatened to plunge already precarious US-China relations into a dangerous new era. Both before and after his shock election Trump has repeatedly signalled he will take a hard line with China, which he has accused of currency manipulation, militarising the South China Sea and not doing enough to help the US rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. In his campaign manifesto, Great Again: How To Fix Our Crippled America, the tycoon wrote: “There are people who wish I wouldn’t refer to China as our enemy. But that’s exactly what they are.” Trump’s letter to Xi follows a “congratulatory note” sent by the Chinese president to his US counterpart on the day of his 20 January inauguration. China’s foreign ministry has been coy about revealing the contents of Xi’s note, which was not widely reported in the Chinese media. Asked to divulge Xi’s message to Trump, spokesperson Hua Chunying would say only that it had been a congratulatory note that had said congratulations. She declined to comment further. Chinese academics gave Trump’s letter a tepid reception. “It’s better than nothing, but it’s only a very small gesture,” Shi Yinhong, a Renmin University professor and government foreign policy adviser, told Bloomberg. Shi said Trump’s policy on China was still unclear but “all the signs so far point to a combative approach”. China specialists believe the US billionaire president and Xi, a member of China’s so-called red nobility, are unlikely to hit it off. In a recent interview, Winston Lord, Ronald Reagan’s former ambassador to Beijing, told the Guardian he believed it was essential for the US president to engage in continual one-on-one strategic discussions with China’s leader. But the veteran diplomat, who helped reestablish diplomatic relations with Mao’s China in the early 1970s, said he doubted such a relationship was possible “because Trump is not a reflective strategic thinker”. “Ideally, I would like the leaders to have this. But if it didn’t work out that well with someone as thoughtful and cerebral and strategic as Obama, I don’t know how it could possibly work out with Trump,” Lord said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/09/government-launches-bid-to-stop-centrelink-staff-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T05:50:46Z","webTitle":"Government launches bid to stop Centrelink staff strike","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/government-launches-bid-to-stop-centrelink-staff-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/government-launches-bid-to-stop-centrelink-staff-strike","fields":{"headline":"Government launches bid to stop Centrelink staff strike","bodyText":"The government is attempting to stymie plans by Department of Human Services staff to strike next week, arguing the protests are purely designed to pressure the ministers over its automated debt recovery system. The strikes, announced on Monday, are designed to protest against job cuts, the protracted enterprise agreement negotiations, and problems with the automated debt recovery system. The Department of Human Services has now lodged an application in the Fair Work Commission attempting to halt the planned strike action. The department said the industrial action had nothing to do with enterprise bargaining, and was instead designed to ramp up pressure over the debt clawback system. “The applicant alleges that the CPSU has organised the action to pressure the department and the government ... in relation to the operation of its online compliance intervention system,” the application said. Union national secretary Nadine Flood said the department’s claim was false, and vowed to fight the move in the Fair Work Commission. “This is an extraordinary attempt by DHS to stop our members from striking or letting their customers know what’s happening,” Flood said. “It’s patently ridiculous for the department to claim strike action is just about robo-debt when our members have been taking similar industrial action for 18 months over the government’s attack on their rights.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services said the union’s publicly stated reasons for the industrial actions were “unrelated to the current enterprise bargaining process”. “The basis of our complaint is that the union’s reasons for the industrial action are unlawful as they do not comply with the Fair Work Act 2009,” the spokeswoman said. “The act specifies that protected industrial action must relate to enterprise bargaining,” she said. The department’s debt recovery system is now the subject of two separate inquiries, initiated after serious concerns were raised about its accuracy and fairness. The first is being conducted by the commonwealth ombudsman, and the second by the Senate’s community affairs references committee, which is expected to report back by May. Centrelink staff have promised to use that inquiry to expose the dysfunction of the system and the department more broadly. Flood said the department’s attempts to stop the protest followed a pattern of trying to “hide problems instead of fixing them”. “Enterprise bargaining has been an absolute disaster as DHS bosses have applied the Turnbull government’s failed public sector bargaining policy,” she said. “This Fair Work challenge is solely aimed at the symptom not the cause of this mess.” Industrial action was to take place across six days in February, and involve Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support workers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/09/june-oscar-named-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-social-justice-commissioner","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T06:57:34Z","webTitle":"June Oscar named Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/june-oscar-named-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-social-justice-commissioner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/june-oscar-named-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-social-justice-commissioner","fields":{"headline":"June Oscar named Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner","bodyText":"June Oscar, a Bunuba woman from Western Australia who has fought successfully for alcohol restrictions in remote communities and for the preservation of ancient languages, is the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner. She will replace Mick Gooda, who resigned from the position in August to work for the royal commission into youth detention in the Northern Territory. Oscar has been praised as a tireless and courageous advocate for the rights of Indigenous Australians. In 2007 she was instrumental in the community-led campaign to restrict the sale of full-strength takeaway alcohol in the Fitzroy Valley, where she is from. In 2009 she and other community leaders invited researchers to the region to study the prevalence of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder among the local population. The study, by the George Institute for Global Health, found one in eight children born in the Fitzroy Valley region of the Kimberley in 2002 and 2003 had the syndrome, which impairs brain development – the highest level recorded in Australia. It was the first study in Australian history into the prevalence of FASD and Oscar and her community were later applauded for their response to the problem. Oscar said her appointment was an honour. “What a privilege it is to be the first Aboriginal woman to occupy the role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner,” she said on Thursday. “I come to the position from working in community with people who are challenged with so many issues. “In this role I believe that with the partnerships with government, and other stakeholders, we can make some serious inroads into the solving and addressing those challenges.” The attorney general, George Brandis, praised Oscar on Thursday for her determined and pragmatic advocacy. Her appointment will be for five years, beginning on 3 April 2017. “Her experience in Indigenous policy spans across language revitalisation, native title, health, women’s issues and, most notably, FASD,” Brandis said on Thursday. “Ms Oscar’s appointment demonstrates the fundamental role Indigenous women play in fostering social change, at a community, national and international level. “She will bring deep knowledge and experience in dealing with the problem of alcohol abuse in Indigenous communities, and strategies to mitigate the effect of that abuse on women and children in particular. “The government looks forward to working closely with Ms Oscar and the contribution she will make to the work of the commission.” Oscar is the chief executive of the Marninwarntikura Women’s Resource Centre in Fitzroy Crossing. She was made an officer of the Order of Australia in 2013 for distinguished service to the Indigenous community of Western Australia, particularly through health and social welfare programs. She was awarded the Menzies School of Health Research medallion in 2014 for her work with FASD."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/feb/09/whistleblower-i-knew-people-would-misuse-this-they-did-to-attack-climate-science","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"Whistleblower: ‘I knew people would misuse this.’ They did - to attack climate science | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/feb/09/whistleblower-i-knew-people-would-misuse-this-they-did-to-attack-climate-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/feb/09/whistleblower-i-knew-people-would-misuse-this-they-did-to-attack-climate-science","fields":{"headline":"Whistleblower: ‘I knew people would misuse this.’ They did - to attack climate science","bodyText":"This weekend, conservative media outlets launched an attack on climate scientists with a manufactured scandal. The fake news originated from an accusation made by former NOAA scientist John Bates about a 2015 paper by some of his NOAA colleagues. The technical term to describe the accusation is ‘a giant nothingburger’ (in this case, a NOAA-thing burger) as Bates clarified in an interview with E&amp;E News: The issue here is not an issue of tampering with data, but rather really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was. Bates later told Science Insider that he was concerned that climate science deniers would misuse his complaints, but proceeded anyway because he felt it was important to start a conversation about data integrity: I knew people would misuse this. But you can’t control other people. “Misuse” is the understatement of the year Misuse it people did – and how! Bates’ complaints boiled down to the fact that the paper didn’t have “a disclaimer at the bottom saying that it was citing research, not operational, data for its land-surface temperatures.” The Mail on Sunday (just banned by Wikipedia as an unreliable source) warped that minor procedural criticism into the sensationalist headline “Exposed: How world leaders were duped into investing billions over manipulated global warming data.” The story then spread through the international conservative media like a global warming-intensified wildfire - to Breitbart, Fox News, Drudge Report, Rush Limbaugh, The Daily Caller, The Washington Times, and more. Scott Johnson summed up the fake news story perfectly in an article at Ars Technica: At its core, though, it’s not much more substantial than claiming the Apollo 11 astronauts failed to file some paperwork and pretending this casts doubt on the veracity of the Moon landing. At the same time, real science journalists who investigated the story quickly determined that it was fake news and published stories reflecting that reality. Readers of legitimate news outlets like The Guardian, The Washington Post, Carbon Brief, E&amp;E News, Ars Technica, Science Insider, RealClimate, and numerous other science blogs were accurately informed, while consumers of biased right-wing news outlets that employ faux science journalists were grossly misinformed by alternative facts and fake news. Smith uses the fake scandal to advance anti-science agenda Lamar Smith (R-TX) is the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. Not long after the 2015 NOAA paper was published, Smith launched an inquisition aimed at the agency and scientists who were involved in the study. This weekend’s faux scandal was conveniently timed for Smith’s hearing two days later, entitled “Making EPA Great Again.” Although the scandal had already been thoroughly debunked, Smith nevertheless featured the story front and center, and pleaded with attendees to believe that “it may be more serious than you think.” The hearing appeared to be aimed at helping to advance the Secret Science Reform Act. The bill would limit the EPA to using only data that can be replicated or made available for “independent analysis.” While this sounds reasonable at first blush, research that’s relevant to the EPA often relies upon confidential personal information that can’t be made public, or studies of one-time events like oil spills, or decades-long data collections that can’t be replicated. In short, the Secret Science Reform Act would make it extremely difficult for EPA to implement science-based regulations. The bill comes straight out of the tobacco industry playbook. It’s thus unsurprising that two of the three Republican witnesses in Smith’s hearing have worked for the coal and chemical industries. Bates’ complaints It’s worth spending a bit more time examining the details of Bates’ accusations. He claimed that the 2015 NOAA paper correcting for known biases in the global surface temperature record was “rushed” for political reasons without proper data archiving, but the editor-in-chief of the journal Science in which the paper was published noted that the peer-review process actually took longer than average for this paper. The paper was not rushed in any way. It had an exceptional number of reviewers, many more than average because we knew it was on a controversial topic. It had a lot of data analysis. The lead author of the study, Thomas Karl responded to Bates’ complaints in an interview with the Washington Post: The term ‘archive’ means a lot of different things to different people. … In this case, the data were available if anyone asked for it, and then they were archived further down the line after the paper was published. While NOAA’s data archiving protocols are an internal matter, some outside scientists argue that the process to correct for known biases already takes too long. For example, global temperature data expert Kevin Cowtan told me: The paper by Karl and colleagues corrected two known problems with the temperature observations: poor coverage of the Arctic, and a change from ships to buoys. Both had been known about since 2008. It took NOAA seven years to produce a paper correcting their temperature data, and even now their monthly updates still omit much of the Arctic. The agencies face an impossible dilemma - on one hand they have to slowly and carefully evaluate new results, and on the other they have to provide an up-to-date temperature record. Rather than rushing out corrections, they appear to have been extremely conservative. It’s particularly absurd that biased media outlets tried to manufacture a scandal out of this story, because just one month prior, Zeke Hausfather, Kevin Cowtan, and colleagues had published a paper demonstrating that the data corrections in the NOAA paper are accurate. Moreover, the corrections themselves were quite small and inconsequential in the grand scheme of long-term human-caused global warming. House Science Committee is part of the war on science It’s disturbing that the House “Science” Committee is launching inquisitions against scientists, spreading fake science news, and trying to prevent the EPA from issuing science-based regulations. Sadly, that’s the era we now live in. Lamar Smith has also written many editorials for Breitbart and said that for accurate information we should rely not on scientists or the media, but solely on Donald Trump. 90% of Republicans agree, believing the Trump administration is truthful and the media is untruthful. It’s a dangerous situation when so many people place their trust in untrustworthy sources that admit to peddling alternative facts. It’s critical that the public not rely on Donald Trump, Lamar Smith, biased media outlets, or fake science journalists. There is an objective reality; we have to maintain a grip on it lest we be sucked into the Twilight Zone of alternative facts and fake news being peddled by those with an anti-science agenda, for whom doubt is their product."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/feb/09/supportive-social-networks-can-mitigate-lgbti-mental-health-risk-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T06:57:57Z","webTitle":"Supportive social networks can mitigate LGBTI mental health risk, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/09/supportive-social-networks-can-mitigate-lgbti-mental-health-risk-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/feb/09/supportive-social-networks-can-mitigate-lgbti-mental-health-risk-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Supportive social networks can mitigate LGBTI mental health risk, study finds","bodyText":"Sexuality poses no risk to mental health, a new study has found, challenging a common perception that homosexual and bisexual people are at risk of poor mental health and suicide because of their orientation. The research, carried out over eight years and led by the Australian National University, found that the risk commonly attributed to sexual orientation was driven by other factors, including negative social interactions, the absence of support, adversity in childhood such as sexual trauma, and even smoking. Homosexual and bisexual people did experience more of these risk factors, which leader researcher Dr Richard Burns said may be a consequence of their orientation, particularly at the time of their coming out. People of bisexual orientation were found to be at more at risk of poor mental health than those of homosexual orientation, but the study concluded the risk was mitigated “when all individuals are provided with positive and supportive social networks and they have lower risk factors”, said Burns. He said a heterosexual person feeling unsupported in a stressful or traumatic situation “would be at just as much risk as a homosexual who is reporting negative social support ... It’s these other risk factors that are driving people’s risks, not their sexual orientation.” Burns added that social support and negative health behaviours were “modifiable”. The study was informed by interviews conducted over eight years with 5,000 young and middle-aged adults of homosexual, bisexual and heterosexual orientation participating in the Personality &amp; Total Health (PATH) Through Life longitudinal study. Homosexual and bisexual people’s risk of poor mental health and suicide was held up by marriage equality campaigners in Australia as a case against holding a plebiscite on the issue. Burns said an absence of support from family, friends and the wider community was a known risk factor for poor mental health, and that could include discrimination under legislation or in public discourse. Micah Scott, chief executive officer of the Minus 18 organisation for same-sex-attracted and gender-diverse young people, said the findings reinforced concerns that the conservative campaign against legalising same-sex marriage would be harmful to gay and bisexual Australians. “The study really reinforces what we’ve been saying for a long time now: members of the LGBTQI people experience discrimination and abuse that’s really unique from what we see in other demographics.” An “extraordinarily high” 75% of all LGBTI young people experience discrimination or abuse, said Scott, with the majority of that occurring at school. Scott said young people experiencing discrimination because of their race could often seek support from their family members. “But a young gay man who’s being bullied at school may not have a supportive family to go home to, and rarely one that’s shared that experience. The experience of growing up and coming out is really unique to this generation of LGBTI people.” The study’s finding that lack of acceptance or support was a risk factor for poor mental health came as no surprise to Scott. “Those experiences from the get-go, from the beginning of your life, frame your way of thinking and your feelings of self-worth. “It’s the experience of discrimination, like being told by your government that your relationship is lesser or that you can’t get married, those are the things that contribute to poor mental health outcomes ... It’s really the rest of the world’s perceptions, the stigma and other people’s negativity that impact gay and bisexual people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/09/nsw-power-shortage-warning-after-revelation-sa-blackouts-forecast-hours-beforehand","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T06:42:07Z","webTitle":"NSW could face power shortages as temperature rises on energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/nsw-power-shortage-warning-after-revelation-sa-blackouts-forecast-hours-beforehand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/nsw-power-shortage-warning-after-revelation-sa-blackouts-forecast-hours-beforehand","fields":{"headline":"NSW could face power shortages as temperature rises on energy policy","bodyText":"New South Wales is facing a possible power blackout on Friday as the state’s electricity system struggles to cope with soaring temperatures. As Coalition and Labor frontbenchers sparred over the latest blackouts in South Australia, the power market operator warned on Thursday that Australia’s most populous state will run out of electricity between 3-5pm on Friday unless generators step in with the offer of more supply. NSW faces a shortfall of 264 megawatts on Friday, the Australian Energy Market Operator warned, putting the power supply of hundreds of thousands of households and businesses at risk amid forecast temperatures well above 40C in many parts of the state. An electricity shortage in South Australia on Wednesday caused blackouts for 40,000 people. Ameo said it issued an appeal for more supply six hours in advance of the cuts but the warnings failed to motivate gas generators in the state to meet the demand, leading to claims they are gaming the system. The blackout prompted the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, to renew their attacks on the Weatherill government, and on the use of renewable power in the state. At question time in Canberra, treasurer Scott Morrison brandished a piece of coal at the Labor bench to amplify the Coalition’s claims that Labor-run South Australia put the power supply in jeopardy. “The South Australian Labor government is switching off jobs and switching off lights and switching off air conditioners and forcing Australian families to boil in the dark as aresult of their dark ages policies,” Morrison declared in question time on Thursday. But power cuts in Liberal-run NSW, which has the least renewable capacity in the country, could shift the focus onto how the market functions. Aemo first announced the forecast for NSW at 4.43am on Thursday, forecasting a 19MW shortfall for half an hour on Friday, and requesting the market to offer more supply. At 12.57pm, Aemo issued another level three alert – its highest level – forecasting a two-hour shortfall of 264MW, again asking the market to respond. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, it said: “High temperatures across the eastern states is increasing electricity consumption levels in South Australia and New South Wales, placing additional strain on the national power system. This has resulted in reduced generation reserves within these two states. “Aemo is in discussion with a number of generators within New South Wales and the New South Wales government to mitigate the need for local load shedding. Load shedding can sometimes be required when there is an imbalance between electricity demand and electricity supply. When there is a shortfall in the electricity supply, there can be a need to reduce demand very quickly to an acceptable level, or risk the electricity network becoming unstable.” The South Australian energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, on Thursday blamed gas generators and failing market rules. Energy experts have also said the blame lies with gas generators and market rules. “You’ve got Pelican Point sitting there – the most efficient gas generator in the national electricity market – and it’s very much underutilised,” said Dylan McConnell from the Melbourne Energy Institute at the University of Melbourne. “That’s a commercial decision. Engie decided not to re-contract as much gas, as a result of the impact of the export market market on gas prices,” he said. Bruce Mountain, an energy economics consultant at CME, said the underlying cause of the blackouts on Wednesday were the same as those behind what happened in July last year, when low supply led to massive spikes in wholesale electricity prices. “When the renewables are not operating flat out or making enough electricity, the fossil fuel generators have the market to themselves. And as we know from studies that I’ve done from 2008 onwards they can and do corner the market,” Mountain said. After the July price spikes, Mountain’s analysis showed electricity generators were withholding supply in order to push up prices. “This is just classical market cornering,” he said. “If you decrease your output by half but as a consequence increase your price by a factor of ten, you’re better off decreasing your output.” In South Australia, when Aemo put out the first of their warnings at 12.47pm on Wednesday, they said they were expecting to be about 100MW short of their required contingency capacity. Throughout the afternoon, Aemo released increasingly urgent notices, eventually directly asking the market to respond just before 5.15pm. In a statement released today, an Aemo spokesperson said the market did not respond, causing the blackout. “AEMO did not receive sufficient bids into the market to maintain the supply/demand balance in South Australia,” the spokesperson said. As a result, Aemo ordered the transmission networks to cut supply to avoid damage to the network. Engie, the operators of Pelican Point, said the second unit at the generator “is not able to provide a market response under the current rules of the National Electricity Market”. A spokesman for AGL, which operates another gas power plant in South Australia said: “During the load shedding on 8 February, AGL was running the seven available units to the maximum of their capacities at the Torrens power station.” The prime minister has argued that ideology needs to be removed from the energy debate, and all technologies, including coal, need to be on the table in order to supply secure reliable baseload power at reasonable prices. But the federal government last year ruled out the policy mechanism that most experts believe will deliver technology neutral emissions reductions at least cost to households – carbon trading – because of ideological opposition to that mechanism inside the Coalition party room. The government has also been emphasising the importance of gas in the energy mix, and has been critical of state moratoriums on coal seam gas, but the Nationals have also been significant opponents of CSG development because of the encroachment on prime agricultural land. On Thursday, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said opposition to CSG development in the bush would ease if “a fair return goes back to the landholder”. He said farmers should reap a percentage return from the gross earned at the wellhead. “And that means that farmers have a huge financial benefit if they are basically in partnership with the resources that come off their place,” Joyce told the ABC on Thursday. “So if you cut a good deal with the farmers, then I think – as long as you’re not destroying aquifers and you’re not destroying prime-ag land – then I think you can find a happy medium in this debate. Because everybody wants to make a buck. Talk to them where they listen most and that’s through their wallet.” This article was amended on 13 February, 2017 to clarify a quote about the reasons Engie does not contract as much gas as it used to."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/feb/08/steve-mcclaren-fa-cup-replays-derby-leicester","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-08T23:31:59Z","webTitle":"Steve McClaren questions FA Cup replays after Derby lose at Leicester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/08/steve-mcclaren-fa-cup-replays-derby-leicester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/feb/08/steve-mcclaren-fa-cup-replays-derby-leicester","fields":{"headline":"Steve McClaren questions FA Cup replays after Derby lose at Leicester","bodyText":"Steve McClaren called on the Football Association to consider abolishing replays after Leicester City’s extra-time victory over Derby County followed the two managers making 18 changes between them. Leicester won 3-1 to give Claudio Ranieri a much-needed victory, yet the way both clubs approached the fourth-round replay made it clear their priorities lay elsewhere. “We’ve got a lot of games in the Championship,” McClaren said. “Our main focus is a play-off place, our main focus is the Championship. We didn’t need this replay. I don’t think Leicester needed this replay and I think maybe the FA have to look at this competition and say, ‘Let’s just have one tie,’ because nobody wanted this replay. You could see that. “We had a game at Pride Park two weeks ago – what an occasion. It was a great game, imagine that going to extra-time or penalties – it would have been a classic FA Cup tie. Instead 10 days later and it’s two completely different teams. Leicester have got priorities and we’ve got priorities and there was no way we could not make eight changes with the schedule that we’ve got coming up, so I think that’s disappointing and something that should be looked at.” Leicester will now face Millwall in the last 16 on Saturday week but Ranieri, who made 10 changes to the side that lost against Manchester United, said that he would happily swap victory over Derby for three points against Swansea City on Sunday. “For us [Swansea] is one of the main matches because we have to get a result,” Leicester’s manager said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2017/feb/09/tropfest-saved-itself-financially-but-can-the-film-festival-save-its-soul","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T01:06:52Z","webTitle":"Tropfest saved itself financially but can the film festival save its soul? | Luke Buckmaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/09/tropfest-saved-itself-financially-but-can-the-film-festival-save-its-soul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/feb/09/tropfest-saved-itself-financially-but-can-the-film-festival-save-its-soul","fields":{"headline":"Tropfest saved itself financially, but can the film festival save its soul?","bodyText":"How can one describe the story of Tropfest? What genre or narrative structure might we put it in? Perhaps it is a David and Goliath battle. The world’s largest short film festival on one hand, and penny-pinching, rights-relinquishing artists on the other. Film-makers who try their hand at Tropfest have long abided by a harsh condition of entry, surrendering ownership of their work, granting the organisation “an exclusive license throughout the universe, in perpetuity”. Or perhaps the evolution of the once-modest festival founded by John Polson in the early 1990s is a rags-to-riches tale, its journey moving from the cozy confines of a Sydney cafe to a rock concert-style national event, satellite-beamed to every Australian capital city with a collective audience of more than 150,000 people. In that case, it would need a trouble-in-paradise, Rome-is-burning, fall-from-grace final act where everything goes down the crapper. Or at least it seems to, before things get back on track, leaving space for a potential happy ending. And this is where we tune in. Late 2015, things looked diabolical for Tropfest, which was mismanaged so comprehensively that Polson discovered a six-figure hole in the ledgers. The future of the event was immediately cast in doubt, with prophecies that the end was nigh. A benefactor, however, jumped on board to square the damage and save the day: CGU Insurance, for whom six figures is a fart in the wind. So maybe this is the story of Lazarus: a resurrection from the dead for the not-so-little festival that could. Tropfest’s near-fatal experience has created a moment of existential reflection for the actor/film-maker/founder. John Polson has made it clear the event will not be continuing business as usual. To his credit, Polson has not only acknowledged many of the criticisms levelled at his event over the years (including that it is too big, too commercial and too WTF in its choice of winners) but is actively working to counter them. A recently uttered mea culpa may sound a little Gillard-esque (a good event has “lost its way”). But it made clear mistakes were made and lessons learned – there is dignity in that, and it ought to be recognised. Now, as Tropfest contemplates its second coming this weekend, the festival has a chance to achieve the greatness it once had (or at least hinted at). To do that there are certain challenges it needs to address, and some are easier to achieve than others. Here are four of the key challenges. Giving fair rights to artists John Polson recently said: “When you hear the words ‘exclusive in perpetuity’, it sounds terrible.” Well, yeah. Not to mention what it sounds like when you throw in “across the universe”. And it didn’t just sound terrible; it was terrible. This condition applied not just to Tropfest finalists but the many hundreds of people who entered each year (paying $45 a pop for the privilege) and were unsuccessful. Polson has said Tropfest now requires non-exclusive rights and is exploring whether it is legally possible to release rights to films in its back catalogue. Not being primarily driven by profit For a long time Tropfest was the McDonald’s of short film festivals, its menu unashamedly favouring work palatable for mass consumption. Fair enough. There’s a place for everything, and this has never been the forum for black and white films with subtitles. That much seems to have remained the same (though one of this year’s finalists appears to be a film about Kytherian beekeepers). A significant change, however, is that Tropfest is now a not-for-profit organisation. Pursuing what’s important for the Australian film industry Some change seems to be happening on this front. Maybe. Half a year ago Tropfest declared it would focus on women film-makers. This year half the finalists are women, marking the first time in its history this has happened. But that isn’t focusing on women; it’s making the gender divide of applicants 50/50. Given how dramatically the scales of Australian film production are – and always have been – tilted in favour in men, how good would it have been if Tropfest declared: every finalist is female from now on until the industry sorts itself out? Making better decisions when dishing out prizes This is a big one, given the winning short films understandably command the lion’s share of attention. In this capacity, Tropfest has a long history of bad decisions. From 2008 to 2013, three of the six winning films were accused of plagiarism. In 2014, the winner was outrageously transphobic: a nasty piece of work called Bamboozled. Polson recently addressed it, saying “We’re not perfect. I know [with] that film, if we had our time again it might have gone down very differently.” In a sense, the world’s largest short film festival does have its time again. This weekend is all about its comeback story (or whatever kind of narrative you wish to frame it with) and, in typical Tropfest style, its return is bolstered with a bit of star power – including the addition of George Miller to its board. If Tropfest can meaningfully address its problems – and there’s everything to suggest it can and will continue to – who knows? Its near-death experience might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to it. • Tropfest is showing at Parramatta Park, Sydney, on Saturday 11 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/09/malcolm-turnbulls-expenses-authority-to-have-weaker-powers-than-many-civil-regulators","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T01:51:21Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Turnbull's new expenses authority to have weaker powers than many civil regulators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/malcolm-turnbulls-expenses-authority-to-have-weaker-powers-than-many-civil-regulators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/09/malcolm-turnbulls-expenses-authority-to-have-weaker-powers-than-many-civil-regulators","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Turnbull's new expenses authority to have weaker powers than many civil regulators","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has introduced legislation to create a new independent parliamentary expenses authority to advise, audit and rule on politicians’ use of taxpayer-funded entitlements. Turnbull committed the government to implement recommendations of the Conde review of expenses, a further bill to fix the expenses framework and revealed an interim body established by executive order would police politicians until the new authority is set up. But the bill included a number of measures that may shield parliamentarians in breach of rules, including not requiring them to produce evidence that incriminates themselves or others and a discretion for the body not to give a public report where it might cause “serious harm” to any person. Turnbull announced the independent authority in January after Sussan Ley resigned as health minister over several controversial taxpayer-funded travel claims, including charging for a trip to the Gold Coast in which she bought a $795,000 apartment. In a speech to the House of Representatives on Thursday, Turnbull said the authority would ensure that parliamentarians’ work expenses are “accountable, transparent and fair”. Its core functions are to advise parliamentarians on expenses, monitor their use, process and audit claims and make rulings about expenses, including making orders for politicians to pay back claims in breach of rules. Turnbull said the modernisation of the expense system would have the greatest impact, promising to speed up disclosure from six-monthly to monthly reports in an “accessible and searchable format”. The bill specifies only that reporting must be “regular” because, as the accompanying memorandum explains, reporting will transition first to quarterly then monthly reporting. The bill gives the independent expenses authority the power to publish reports on parliamentarians’ use of entitlements. In January Turnbull refused to release the report of the investigation into Ley by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, citing the fact it was a report to himself and the cabinet governance committee. Section 60 of the bill provides a number of instances in which the authority is forbidden to publish reports, including when it or the attorney general believes a report would harm security, defence or international relations. A further exemption is where the authority believes disclosure is “likely to result in serious harm to the individual, or any of the individuals, to whom the information relates”. The explanatory memorandum says that is limited to “physical or mental harm” and is designed to prevent “misuse” of information. Parliament and its committees cannot compel the authority to release a report in those circumstances. The bill gives the authority power to order politicians or others to give it documents, but section 55 allows them to refuse the order if the information “might tend to incriminate the person or expose the person to a penalty”. That means the authority will have weaker powers than many civil regulators including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Tax Office and the Australian Building and Construction Commission whose regimes don’t allow people to refuse on the basis of a privilege against self-incrimination. At a press conference in Canberra on Thursday, Bill Shorten said he would study the bill but Labor had offered bipartisan support for the expenses authority. Shorten said expenses are an issue for everyone because people “turn off politics ... when they think that the politicians are in it for themselves and not the people”. Turnbull said an independent board and decisions made at arm’s length from the government would give the public confidence in its decisions. The board will be made up of a chair, the president of the remuneration tribunal, a former judge, a former member of parliament, and a person with substantial experience in auditing. When the bill is passed the expenses authority will be established on July 1. In the meantime an advisory body established by executive order will provide advice on expenses."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/09/georgia-non-citizen-drivers-license-immigration","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T14:42:02Z","webTitle":"Georgia bill would allow 'scarlet letter' marking of non-citizen driver's licenses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/09/georgia-non-citizen-drivers-license-immigration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/09/georgia-non-citizen-drivers-license-immigration","fields":{"headline":"Georgia bill would allow 'scarlet letter' marking of non-citizen driver's licenses","bodyText":"Georgia lawmakers are advancing a bill that would allow the state to add “non-citizen” to the driver’s licenses of legal residents and green card holders living in the state. While some states have similar demarcation on the licenses of undocumented immigrants, activists say the breadth of Georgia’s proposal is unprecedented. “[This] is the first time that I’ve heard of any state considering … passing this kind of divisive action,” said Naomi Tsu, referencing the bill’s focus on immigrants living here entirely lawfully. Tsu is the deputy legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s (SPLC) Immigrant Justice Project. “We’re pretty concerned about this idea of branding some residents with a ‘scarlet letter’.” Representative Alan Powell, who sponsored the provision, cited preventing non-citizens from registering to vote as one of the bill’s merits. “I don’t care if you’re a regional vice-president for Mercedes,” Powell said before the motor vehicles committee passed the bill, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Powell noted that for non-citizens in the US that are able to get a driver’s license, “it at least ought to have on there ‘non-citizen’”. Georgia’s department of driver services already issues distinct licenses to non-citizens that have the words “limited term” printed on the card, according to the department. (Twelve states allow undocumented immigrants to have driver’s licenses. Georgia is not one of them.) Tsu said: “We’ve just got to ask ourselves, ‘What good is going to come of this bill?’ … It only exists to put up differences between people.” This isn’t the first time this sort of branding has been threatened against immigrants, though previous legislation has focused on undocumented immigrants. In 2013, the North Carolina legislature considered placing a pink stripe across licenses held by undocumented persons, but faced pushback by immigrants’ rights advocates. The bill “calls into question” Georgia’s reputation as being a welcoming state –including toward businesses, said Tsu. The proposed legislation comes amid groundless concerns about widespread voter fraud. Trump blamed his loss of the popular vote in last year’s presidential elections on fraudulent votes cast against him by undocumented immigrants. In Georgia, where more than 4m votes were cast, officials have opened investigations into only 25 cases. One-third of the almost 900 reports of harassment and intimidation the SPLC received in the 10 days following the election were directed towards immigrants, said Tsu. “With President Trump’s Muslim ban and other executive orders that affect immigration, it’s continuing to play out this real sense of ‘us versus them’, when really here we’re talking about people who should be part of ‘us’,” said Tsu. “They’re people who are here lawfully … and yet there’s this sense that they need to be labeled and divided and pushed out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/feb/08/neil-gorsuch-donald-trump-tweet-federal-judge","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-09T01:43:40Z","webTitle":"Supreme court nominee Neil Gorsuch calls Trump judge attacks 'demoralizing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/08/neil-gorsuch-donald-trump-tweet-federal-judge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/feb/08/neil-gorsuch-donald-trump-tweet-federal-judge","fields":{"headline":"Supreme court nominee Neil Gorsuch calls Trump judge attacks 'demoralizing'","bodyText":"Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump’s nominee to the supreme court, called the president’s tweet attacking the federal district court judge James Robart “disheartening and demoralizing”, his spokesman has confirmed. Gorsuch criticized Trump in a private meeting with Senator Richard Blumenthal on Wednesday. Gorsuch’s spokesman, Ron Bonjean, confirmed to the Guardian that the supreme court nominee called Trump’s tweet attacking Robart “disheartening and demoralizing”. On Thursday, the president attacked Blumenthal for “misrepresenting” his conversation with Gorsuch, which he equated to Blumenthal’s prior mischaracterization of his military record. “Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?” Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. The “major lie” that Trump was seemingly referring to regards Blumenthal’s time in the Marine Corps reserves. During his 2010 bid for the Senate, Blumenthal was forced to apologize for saying he had served “in” the Vietnam war, when he had only served “during” the Vietnam war, having never been deployed overseas. Trump has never served in the military and was given five draft deferments. The president slammed Robart’s decision to issue a stay blocking his executive order on residents of seven Muslim-majority countries entering the United States in a series of tweets, including one in which he labeled Robart “a so-called judge”. Robart was nominated to the United States district court for the Western District of Washington by George W Bush in 2003 and was confirmed unanimously by the Senate. Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said: “[Gorsuch] said very specifically that they were demoralizing and disheartening and he characterized them very specifically that way.” The statement potentially leaves Gorsuch open to criticism from Trump, but helps in his effort to woo Senate Democrats who have pushed for the federal appellate judge to distance himself from the man who nominated him to the supreme court. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, raised specific concerns about whether Gorsuch would be sufficiently independent of the president if confirmed. When asked if he was qualified, Schumer replied: “It depends on what you mean by qualified. Does he have the education and temperament to be a judge? People will make their own judgment. But that’s not what’s in question. What’s in question is what type of judge he’s going to be.” Schumer went on to raise the question about whether Gorsuch would be “a barrier to the president, who has shown a tendency to overreach”. Currently the filibuster still applies to supreme court nominees, which means barring a change of the rules via the so-called “nuclear option”, Gorsuch would need the support of eight Democrats to achieve the necessary supermajority and receive a confirmation vote by the Senate. The judge’s comments met immediate criticism from one prominent Trump ally. Talkshow host Laura Ingraham tweeted that they were “concerning” and suggested that William Pryor and Thomas Hardiman, the two other finalists for the supreme court nomination, would not have made them. However, it met some optimistic reaction in the Senate. Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, told reporters that Gorsuch’s statement “certainly shows his independence”. Flake added that he thought it would help Gorsuch’s chances in the Senate. Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, expressed continued skepticism about Gorsuch’s remarks. “Given the president’s comments, that’s a very milquetoast response,” House said. “Anyone can be disheartened, but the judge has refused to condemn the comments privately or publicly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/10/british-officials-drop-plans-donald-trump-address-parliament-queen-elizabeth","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T16:50:30Z","webTitle":"British officials drop plans for Donald Trump to address parliament","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/10/british-officials-drop-plans-donald-trump-address-parliament-queen-elizabeth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/10/british-officials-drop-plans-donald-trump-address-parliament-queen-elizabeth","fields":{"headline":"British officials drop plans for Donald Trump to address parliament","bodyText":"The government has abandoned the idea of Donald Trump addressing the joint Houses of Parliament when he comes to Britain for a state visit later this year after objections by MPs led by the Commons Speaker John Bercow. The US president’s controversial visit is now expected to run from a Thursday to a Sunday in late summer or early autumn, with officials trying to ensure that Trump is not in London at a time when parliament is sitting, in order to avoid a formal snub. According to Westminster sources, a weekend visit at the very end of August or in September is now under discussion between the government, Buckingham Palace and the White House. A source described such a plan as “the preferred option at our end”. Parliament will be in summer recess until 5 September and adjourns again for the party conferences on 15 September for nearly a month. Such an arrangement would mean that Trump would not be invited to address parliament at all. The approach follows Bercow’s statement this week that he would not give his consent either to a speech by the president in Westminster Hall or in the royal gallery, both of which have traditionally been used for addresses by visiting statesmen and women. Officials are also said to be keen to limit the president’s public exposure more generally during the visit, in order to reduce the opportunities for protests and disorder on a state occasion. Hundreds of thousands of protesters could be expected in any large city, causing major headaches for the emergency and security services. This suggests that the president will spend relatively little time in London, while the majority of the visit will be conducted behind as strict a security cordon as possible. A further issue that has still to be resolved is the extent to which the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be involved in a visit of which, officially at least, she is the host. The couple, who are both now in their 90s, normally spend late August and September at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire and only rarely return to London during their stay. One possibility is that Trump could be invited to a state banquet at Windsor Castle, rather than at Buckingham Palace. This would be easier to guard against protesters and would cause less disruption, while satisfying the necessary protocols. Trump might be encouraged to spend a significant part of his visit in Scotland, perhaps visiting the Queen at Balmoral rather than in England, and enabling him to visit the Isle of Lewis, where his mother, Mary MacLeod, was born in 1912, before she left for the US as an immigrant. Trump also owns two golf courses in Scotland, Turnberry in Ayrshire and a purpose-built course at Balmedie north of Aberdeen. Any visit to Scotland would raise delicate political issues for the nationalist government in Scotland led by Nicola Sturgeon, which would have to decide whether to boycott Trump or not. Scottish National party MPs at Westminster broke into applause at Bercow’s statement this week, But Scotland’s former first minister Alex Salmond told an LBC radio phone-in this month that he favoured the president coming to Balmoral. Invitations to deliver an address in the royal gallery normally require the Speakers of the Commons and the Lords, currently Bercow and Lord Fowler, to agree, while invitations to Westminster Hall also involve the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Marquess of Cholmondeley. On Monday Bercow made clear he would not support an invitation at either venue, triggering calls from some backbenchers for him to step down. Two of Trump’s modern predecessors as president, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, have addressed the joint houses in the royal gallery. Only Barack Obama, in 2011, has made a speech in the 11th-century Westminster Hall. Even before Bercow’s intervention, government ministers are believed to have concluded that the level of objection among MPs of all parties after Trump’s executive order banning arrivals from seven mainly Muslim countries made a parliamentary invitation too politically hazardous to justify. The leader of the Commons, David Lidington, is said to have reached this conclusion before the Speaker made his own opposition public in the chamber on Monday. A White House spokesperson told the Guardian “we have no further details to share at this time”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T16:04:22Z","webTitle":"How Steve Bannon captured America's spirit of revolt | Thomas Frank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up","fields":{"headline":"How Steve Bannon captured America's spirit of revolt","bodyText":"So our billionaire president hangs a portrait of Andrew Jackson on his wall, spits on his hands, and takes a sledgehammer to the Dodd–Frank Act. The portrait is of the banks’ all-time arch-enemy; the reality is that the banks are going to be deregulated yet again. And in that insane juxtaposition we can grasp rightwing populism almost in its entirety: fiery verbal hostility to elites, combined with generous government favours for those same elites. Donald Trump’s adviser Stephen Bannon presents an even more striking combination. A former executive at Goldman Sachs, Bannon is also the product of what the Hollywood Reporter calls a “blue-collar, union and Democratic family” who feels “an unreconstructed sense of class awareness, or bitterness – or betrayal”. Bannon is a founding member of the objectionable far-right website Breitbart and an architect of Trump’s unlikely victory, the man at the right hand of power. And yet almost no one in Washington seems to understand how he pulled this off. Let me propose a partial explanation: that one of the reasons Bannon succeeded is because he has been able to unite the two unconnected halves of American populist outrage – the cultural and the economic. Start with the latter. In a 2014 interview on the recent financial crisis, Bannon proclaimed: “The way that the people who ran the banks and ran the hedge funds have never really been held accountable for what they did has fuelled much of the anger in the Tea Party movement in the United States.” Fair enough. I myself am outraged that financiers were not held responsible for the many obvious mistakes and even acts of fraud they appeared to commit. But when we turn to the specifics of Bannon’s indictment, accountability gets a little blurry. In 2010 Bannon wrote, directed and produced a documentary film about the 2008 financial crisis called Generation Zero – a documentary that explicitly tries to get laissez-faire capitalism off the hook for this colossal capitalist disaster. Remember the roll-back of banking rules under Bill Clinton and George W Bush, or the hapless regulatory agencies filled with former bank officers and lobbyists? Evidently none of that really mattered. As one of the movie’s many experts intones, “Deregulation is not the problem.” The first sentence in the promotional copy on the back of the DVD case is just as blunt: “The current economic crisis is not a failure of capitalism, but a failure of culture.” What culture do you think Bannon means? The buccaneering culture of the Wall Street traders? The corrupt culture of the real estate appraisers or the bond rating agencies? The get-rich-quick culture of the mortgage originators? No, no and no. He means … the counterculture of the 1960s. Bell bottoms. Drum solos. Dope. That’s the thing to blame for the financial crisis and the bailouts. Not the deregulation of derivatives in 2000. It was those kids having fun at Woodstock in 1969. I am not joking. This really is Bannon’s argument, illustrated again and again in Generation Zero with 40-year-old footage of hippies dancing and fooling around, which is thrown together with stock footage of dollar bills being counted, or funny old cartoons, or vacant houses, or really mean-looking sharks, and then back to those happy hippies again. One way of assessing this is that Generation Zero is the transition from the culture wars to Trumpism. What Bannon is doing is bringing the strands of outrage together. He’s saying that the culture wars and the financial crisis both share the same villain: the bad values that supposedly infected our society in the 1960s. The same forces that made the movies and pop music so vulgar also crashed the economy and ruined your livelihood. Here is how Roger Kimball of the New Criterion makes the case in Generation Zero: “A lot of what we have just seen is a kind of a real-world dramatisation of those ideas that became popular in the 60s and 70s, and that had a dry run then. And that, I think, has been a prescription for disaster in some very concrete ways. Take, for example, the financial crisis. What we have just seen in the irresponsible lending by banks and the irresponsible leveraging by many hedge funds is an abdication of responsibility.” That gives you a taste of how Bannon’s logic unfolds. The decade of the 60s supposedly introduced Americans to the idea of irresponsibility and self-indulgence, and now that we are suffering from an epidemic of irresponsibility and self-indulgence a mere 50 years later, it’s obviously the fault of people from that decade long ago. Blame is thus offloaded from, say, the captured regulators of the Bush administration to the pot-smoking college students of the Vietnam era. Unfortunately, just because something makes moral sense doesn’t mean it’s true. Take the phenomenon of “stated income” or liar’s loans, the fraud that came to symbolise so much of what went wrong in the last decade. One of the movie’s experts, Peter Schweizer (later the author of Clinton Cash), seems to blame this dirty business on … Saul Alinsky, an author and community organiser who died in 1972. Alinsky, he maintains, “applauded activists who used lying effectively. You end up where applicants lie on their applications, mortgage lenders lie when they pass that to the underwriters, and then these mortgages are sold as mortgage-backed securities on Wall Street ... It’s a chain of lie after lie after lie, which eventually undermines even the most effective system.” Schweizer is right that loans based on lies undermined the system. By 2005 they had become an enormous part of the mortgage market, and the story of how that happened is a really fascinating one. Many books have been written on the subject. But filmmaker Bannon shows no interest in any of that. He makes little effort to find out who was issuing such loans, what kind of houses they were used to purchase (McMansions?), who packaged them up into securities, or why regulators didn’t do anything to stop it. Instead, the movie just implies that the diabolical Alinsky had some vague something to do with it and then walks away. This is not history, it’s naked blame-shifting. In fairness, Bannon’s movie also makes plenty of valid points and has some fine moments. The director obviously cares about the working-class people who were ruined by the recession. He correctly portrays the Democratic party’s love affair with Wall Street in the 90s (although he downplays the amorous deeds of Republicans). He understands the cronyism between government and high finance, and one of his sources aptly describes the bailed-out system as “socialism for the wealthy but capitalism for everybody else”. Which kind of sounds like something that old 60s radical Bernie Sanders might say. The putative moral of Generation Zero is that we all need to grow up and take responsibility for our actions; and yet as I watched it I was bowled over by how profoundly irresponsible this documentary is. Other than a single quote from Time magazine circa 1969 and the old TV footage of hippies doing their dance, Bannon doesn’t really try to nail down what “the 60s” stood for or meant. None of the leading participants in that decade’s bacchanals are interviewed. Skipping ahead to the financial crisis, we never learn whether it’s the dishonest home-buyers who were hippies, or the fly-by-night mortgage lenders or the Wall Street traders who were hippies. Which set of hippies are we supposed to crack down on? We never find out. All we know, really, is that there was once a dreadful thing called the 60s, and then there was a terrible financial crisis four decades later, and because the one came before the other, it somehow caused it. The effort to bridge that evidence gap is almost nonexistent. In a typical moment, Bannon shows us Republican treasury secretary Hank Paulson desperately trying to stop the money haemorrhage in September 2008, and then cuts immediately to footage of the Black Panthers, holding a rally many decades ago. Why? What is the connection? Does Paulson, the devout Christian Scientist, the teetotalling college football star, have some secret affiliation with 60s radicalism? Worst of all is the former presidential adviser Dick Morris (Bill Clinton’s Steve Bannon, come to think of it), who appears throughout Generation Zero blowing hard about this outrage and that. Here is what Morris tells the camera about the threat of hyperinflation, which loomed so large in the rightwing mind back in 2010: “The real catastrophe is going to come in about a year, a year and a half, or two years, when all of this money that the Fed has been printing comes out of hiding all at once and causes explosive inflation.” The movie’s most far-fetched proposition is also its most revealing. Generation Zero asserts that history unfolds in a cyclical pattern, endlessly repeating itself. Historical crises (such as the Depression and second world war) are said to give rise to triumphant and ambitious generations (think Levittown circa 1952), who make the mistake of spoiling their children, who then tear society apart through their decadence and narcissism, triggering the cycle over again. Or as the movie’s trailer puts it: “In history, there are four turnings. The crisis. The high. The awakening. The unravelling. History repeats itself. The untold story about the financial meltdown.” In a word, the theory is ridiculous. It is so vague and squishy and easily contradicted that the viewer wonders why Bannon included it at all. And then it hits you. He included it because this rainy-day Marxism is pretty much the only way you can do what Bannon set out to do in this movie: get deregulated capitalism out of the shadow for the financial crisis and blame instead the same forces that the family-values crowd has been complaining about for years. Blame the hippies for what arch-deregulator Phil Gramm did 40 years later and call it a high-flown theory of history: the “fourth turning”, or some such nonsense. Of course Bannon’s fans believe it. It makes perfect sense to them. A funny thing about Bannon’s stinky pudding of exaggerations and hallucinations: in the broadest terms, it’s also true. The counterculture really did have something to do with both our accelerated modern capitalism and the Democratic party’s shift to the right – it’s a subject I have written about from The Conquest of Cool to Listen, Liberal. The Clinton administration really did strike up an alliance with Wall Street, and this really did represent a new and catastrophic direction for the Democratic party. Trade deals really did help to deindustrialise the US, and that deindustrialisation really was a terrible thing. The bankers really did get bailed out by their friends the politicians in 2008 and 2009, and it really was the greatest outrage of our stupid century. And there really is a lot of narcissism mixed up in modern capitalism. Just look at the man for whom Bannon presently works. Generation Zero acknowledges these visible facts but connects the dots by means of a vast looping diagram of confusion and blame evasion. It is a fantasy of accountability that actually serves to get the guilty off the hook. Then again, another way to judge this alternative theory, with its alternative facts, is to set it off against what the Democratic establishment was saying at the time. Which was pretty much nothing. Centrist Democrats simply don’t talk about their alliance with Wall Street – it’s like the party’s guilty secret, never to be discussed in a straightforward way. Try asking former President Obama or former treasury secretary Geithner or former attorney general Holder why they were so generous with the bankers and why they never held them responsible, and see what kind of answer you get. And that, in short, is the story of how the right captured the spirit of revolt in this most flagrantly populist period in modern times. Want to take it away from them, liberal? Start by understanding your history."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/shortcuts/2017/feb/10/gigi-hadids-zayn-malik-white-bandana-political-statement-or-fashion-accessory","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T15:48:19Z","webTitle":"Gigi Hadid’s white bandana: political statement or fashion accessory?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/feb/10/gigi-hadids-zayn-malik-white-bandana-political-statement-or-fashion-accessory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/feb/10/gigi-hadids-zayn-malik-white-bandana-political-statement-or-fashion-accessory","fields":{"headline":"Gigi Hadid’s white bandana: political statement or fashion accessory?","bodyText":"Name: Bandana AKA: Kerchief, hanky.

This week Bercow found himself in the eye of the biggest political storm of the many that have marred his eight years in the Speaker’s chair of the House of Commons. Or, rather, in this case he very deliberately placed himself there. On Monday afternoon Bercow stood up in parliament and, for two and a half minutes, explained to MPs why he would oppose any proposal to invite Donald Trump to address parliament during the US president’s planned state visit later this year. It was an explosive act. The Speaker, whose office is historically impartial, distant and above controversy, was plunging into the political fray to take sides on a challenge to Britain’s most important international relationship. To his supporters it was bold and brave, an exceptional act for the exceptional times created by Trump’s election. Scottish nationalist MPs burst into applause at the end of his speech. The Speaker’s postbag has bulged with approving messages ever since. Owen Jones wrote in the Guardian that Bercow spoke for Britain. To Bercow’s detractors, on the other hand, it was another step too far. In a formidable tirade, the Daily Mail’s sketchwriter Quentin Letts described the intervention as a “red-eyed rant” from a “vicious, careerist, small-minded martinet” who wanted to get something “off his preening chest”. Others, unwilling to go on the record, were almost as scathing. Bercow was “a very, very nasty man,” said one. Monday’s attack on Trump was proof, said another, that Bercow’s Speakership was “an endless display of solipsism. It’s always all about him.” On Thursday the Tory MP James Duddridge tabled a motion of no confidence. Nothing will come of it, but it reflects a mood. In retrospect, friends of Bercow now say, he probably expressed himself with avoidable directness. Bercow certainly opposes a Trump address to parliament, but his main objection is to Trump being invited to address the joint houses in the historic 11th-century surroundings of Westminster Hall, a special honour reserved in recent years for Nelson Mandela, the pope, Aung San Suu Kyi and Barack Obama. “If he had had notice, he would have tried to focus on the Westminster Hall issue and to speak more explicitly on behalf of colleagues rather than just himself. He would have said the same thing somewhat differently,” said a longstanding ally. Yet Bercow’s outburst has a significant backstory. As soon as Trump was elected, last November, there was speculation that Theresa May would go to Washington as soon as possible and would offer a state visit to a man the UK government both fears and needs. MPs on all sides of the Commons, including the Tory grandee Sir Nicholas Soames, were appalled. Several got in touch with Bercow’s office late last year to signal their alarm at the possibility of a Trump address to parliament forming part of the visit, especially in Westminster Hall. As a result, Bercow’s office wrote to May to warn her in writing of such feelings and to remind her of the issues, which included the fact that the Speaker was one of three officials whose permission is required for a Westminster Hall invitation. “We were concerned that a fairly new team in No 10 might feel they had to put Trump on a par with Obama, which was not the case since Obama is the only US president to address parliament in Westminster Hall,” said a Bercow supporter. No 10 acknowledged the Speaker’s letter well before May’s Washington visit in late January, during which the state visit invitation was offered and accepted. When Trump issued an executive order within hours of May’s visit banning entry from seven mainly Muslim nations, hostility towards the visit spiralled. More than 200 opposition MPs signed a motion denouncing it, and 1.8 million people signed a petition for a debate in parliament. As a result, the May government – notably the leader of the Commons, David Lidington – began to have second thoughts about the Westminster dimension of the Trump visit and are now planning to avoid it altogether. Although a final schedule has not yet been agreed with the White House, official thinking in London is now for a three-day Trump visit to take place largely over a weekend, from a Thursday to a Sunday and probably at a time when parliament is in recess. Possible dates are in late August or September. At present, planning for the visit now anticipates no address by the president to parliament in any form. If that proves to be so, it will be game, set and match to the tennis-loving Speaker. Yet the repercussions of this week’s intervention by Bercow are likely to continue. No Speaker in modern times has changed the ancient role as much as the reforming Bercow, the first Jewish Speaker of the Commons. His achievements include the revival of the urgent question and a much more prominent educational role. Yet none has made so many personal enemies either, and not just because of his approach to the job. In his Daily Mail diatribe this week, Letts compared Bercow unfavourably, to put it mildly, with the 17th-century Speaker William Lenthall. Lenthall’s finest hour came in 1642 when the autocratic Charles I came to the Commons in an attempt to arrest five MPs for treason. Lenthall went down on his knees and told the king: “May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me whose servant I am here.” In fact, Lenthall may not have been the paragon Speaker that these oft-quoted words imply. He was attacked by critics for “a strange mixture of fearfulness and indecision”, and by his enemies for being “the grand braggadocio and liar of the age he lived in”, and it was alleged that “he mostly minded the heaping up of riches”. Bercow’s critics accuse him of many things, including braggadocio, but not in the main of being fearful, a liar or corrupt. It’s the bias and the bombast that the critics dislike. “The deal for any Speaker is that you have a lot of powers and authority, in return for which you are absolutely impartial,” said one. “This Speaker clearly is not impartial and he shoots from the hip, as he did on Monday.” Bercow definitely has his favourites in the Commons, whose chances of catching his eye are strong. On the Tory benches, these include Julian Lewis, Andrew Mitchell and Charles Walker, the latter of whom may want to succeed Bercow. On the opposition side, Labour’s Chris Bryant, Margaret Hodge and Keith Vaz are favourites, as is the SNP’s Alex Salmond. One of the most striking features of Bercow’s recent Speakership has been the care he has devoted to treating the SNP well. The animus against him on the Tory benches comes from Bercow’s career journey from the far right of the party to the soft centre-left. Many see him as both a traitor to the cause and a Labour Speaker in all but name. Yet Bercow has worked hard to build good relations with some of the Conservative awkward squad, such as John Redwood, Philip Davies and Philip Hollabone. David Cameron and Michael Gove were sworn Bercow enemies, but May is not. It is striking that this week’s no confidence motion had at the time of writing only a single signatory, its mover, Duddridge. When he was elected Speaker in 2009 – Simon Hoggart wrote in the Guardian at the time that Bercow was “dragged most willingly to perch on his new throne” – Bercow promised he would quit within a decade. His current intention is to stay on through the Brexit process, for which he thinks his experience is needed. He is working on the assumption that the last votes in the article 50 process for which MPs voted this week will take place in late 2018. That suggests a departure in two years’ time, with Walker, Bryant, Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle and perhaps even the Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg among the contenders to succeed him. After that, Bercow would expect to go to the House of Lords, as all other recent Speakers have done. If the late Tony Benn had had his way, though, the Commons Speaker would be the head of state in a British republic. That, one suspects, would be a role Bercow would not wish to give up for anyone. Potted profile Born 19 January 1963 Career The son of a north London taxi driver, Bercow was a talented junior tennis player who abandoned the sport for rightwing Conservatism – early in his career he was a member of the anti-immigration Monday Club. The MP for Buckingham since 1997 has held several shadow ministerial posts. High point Seeing off a crowded field of candidates to succeed Speaker Michael Martin, who had been obliged to step down amid the expenses scandal. Low point Enduring lurid media coverage of the difficulties in his marriage to his wife, Sally whose relationship with Bercow’s cousin was detailed at length in some newspapers. The couple since reconciled. What he says “After the imposition of the migrant ban … I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.” What they say “He has overstepped the mark a number of times but this most recent incident … is wholly inappropriate.” Conservative MP James Duddridge • This article was amended on 13 February 2017.

However, criticism that the goals of the marches were too vague, the perennial complaint that attends protests, has no validity. Protest should not be confused with lobbying, proposing terms to circumscribe its goals. Gandhi’s genius was to recognise that non-violent resistance challenges the legitimacy of authority: there’s your purpose. I recall the frustration we felt as marchers in Washington, New York and San Francisco (where I was) protesting the Vietnam war: the response we got was never anything but bad. Seen from this distance, it’s different. All that protest that had seemed only to ignite more repressive responses did in fact discredit the US government. A government that provokes protest is in danger of losing its right to govern. Far from not working or being useless, protest is vital. Resistance pursued with persistence can work, at least to the extent that our society is a functioning democracy. How about some protests about corruption, not unconstitutionality or a smoking gun or any of the myriad other distractions that can confuse and deflate the issue? The corruption of the Republican party – and its poster boy. Felix Prael San Diego, California, US • Our broken democracy is debased precisely because it has no base (3 February). Without some foundation in direct democracy, people deciding and acting together for themselves on what they know best, we have no basis for understanding or counteracting the political and economic institutions that bear down on us. As George Monbiot suggests, it’s a matter of architecture. Not just better listening and fairer party funding, but reshaping a mighty pyramid of bureaucratic ladders that extends far beyond party politics and government, sustaining prodigious wealth and excluding the majority on whom it rests. Across private and public sectors, members of relatively prosperous professional hierarchies can count on some measure of security and the prospect of advancement. They do better out of their jobs than most of those they may wish to serve: the majority who live on less than the average wage and never reach the bottom rungs. What we need is not a refinement of top-down listening devices or tick-box policy choices but effective self-determination wherever we live and work. It’s in our everyday employment that we are likely to be most effective. Until we begin to reconnect – hand to hand and face to face, and take hold of what we know best, how can we make sense of a wider world, exert some leverage on the powers-that-be and know what to expect from those we send away to represent us? Greg Wilkinson Swansea, UK Corbyn wrong on Brexit vote As a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the British Labour party, I beg to differ with him on the Brexit vote and the use of a three-line whip (10 February). The majority of Labour voters voted remain. Younger and future voters overwhelmingly support remain. Yes, blue-collar Labour voters in the north-east of England voted for Brexit. They are still suffering from Thatcherite de-industrialisation and the impacts of capitalist globalisation. Labour members in the northeast would have been within their rights to vote in favour of Brexit. However, by trying to bind all Labour MPs to vote for the Brexit bill, Corbyn created another excuse for his internal opponents to destabilise his leadership. Make no mistake: the Brexit debacle is the result of the Tories’ internal squabbling for a generation and their desire to appease the little Englanders in their base. Scottish Labour made the wrong call on the Scottish referendum. British Labour has made the wrong call on the Brexit bill. It’s the Tories’ mess; leave them to sort it out. Paul Pearce Bronte, NSW, Australia Let China have its way I am continually surprised by the arrogance of activists who believe they have the right to subvert the authority of governments to further their own ideas. Peter Dahlin, in Lifting the lid on a Chinese “black prison” (20 January), is a case in point. The Chinese run their country their way; we may not like it and we have every right to say so, but we do not have the right to break their laws. If we do so and get caught, we must expect the penalties that their regime imposes, not those that we might expect under our own laws. His incarceration for three weeks without significant abuse was hardly the stuff of black prisons – if anything, this would rank as one of the least rigorous penalties imposed by a totalitarian regime for the type of breach for which he was arrested. It is extremely naive to think that we can change such regimes by covert activities such as those conducted by Dahlin in China. Far better, if less dramatic, to continuously publicise better ways of conducting our affairs that can be applied by others as they see fit. But first we have to be able to demonstrate that our methods do indeed have better outcomes. We can hardly criticise another country’s failure to create a just society if our own includes serious disadvantages. David Barker Bunbury, Western Australia Chickens can bring change I took great interest in the article on chickens changing the world (27 January). Before retiring many years ago, I was the director of R&amp;D for a major poultry incubation company. We set up a research project at the University of Guelph (Ontario) to see if we could improve hatchability in artificial incubation by utilising all of the vocalisations made between chicks still confined within their eggs, coupled with the vocalisations of the brooding mother hen. We allowed the hen to sit on the eggs in isolation for the complete cycle. During the last three days we started to record all the sounds under the hen. We then played back the recording inside a hatcher containing about 10,000 eggs. To our great delight, we not only increased hatchability, but we also compressed the hatch into a shorter time frame. A hen will lay eggs over many days before starting to sit on them, and yet they all hatch in a relatively short time. Hatching late may well mean that a chick will be abandoned as the others leave to forage. Now we can better understand how they can hatch together. Matthew Foster Cambridge, Ontario, Canada Legislating public behaviour I do sympathise with Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett (27 January, Watching porn in public is not OK). And yet, there’s something troubling in trying to regulate public behaviour. I’ve always had a problem with laws that set a boundary that is then open to interpretation. “Outraging public decency”? Would kissing in public do that? Or two gay men holding hands? Wearing a burka? What about a child using a mobile phone to play a violent computer game involving gratuitous killing? I know which one offends my sense of decency most, but I accept that your sense might be different. So the writer’s calling for a change in culture seems right on. I’d like to see people less accepting of porn and violence, but more accepting of nudity (for example). Steve Cassidy Tábua, Portugal Briefly • In trying to understand the problems we face – for example, climate change (27 January), loss of biodiversity, environmental destruction etc – is it too simplistic to consider that this state of affairs is the expected result of evolution? Through our intelligence, competitiveness and exploitation of the environment we have survived and reproduced more successfully than most other species. Without these attributes we would not have reached our present status and perhaps the world would not be in such dire straits. Richard Pickering Christchurch, New Zealand • The article by Robin McKie (27 January) reports a study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, concluding that “… eating less meat could reduce global mortality by 6-10%”. Amazing. I would think that global mortality, for whatever species, has been and will be … 100%.

Then Madonna posted that she has adopted twin girls. Now the Clooneys have let it be known that they’re expecting twins. What on earth is going on? Hannah, by email OK, so the most pressing issue to deal with here is to correct a mistake in your question. “First Beyoncé announced she is having twins”? “First”? I don’t think so. Look, I don’t know if I’ve told you this already, but the very first person ever on this planet to have twins is most certainly not Bey. Obviously not! No. It was me. What? I’ve mentioned that I have twins before? Well, lucky you – everyone knows that readers love nothing more than journalists writing about their kids, because they are literally the only people on this planet to have procreated. Indeed, the whole publishing world is eagerly looking forward to the launch of my new column Twinning Is Winning!!!, which will be full of hilarious anecdotes about amusing things my kids have said/done/thrown up. Yes, I think we can all agree that this will Save Journalism (#savejournalism). Anyway, as I was saying, first there was me, then, as happens every single day of my life, the celebrities came a-copying. Well, to be strictly accurate, a few celebrities had twins before me (Angelina, Celine, J-Lo, Mariah, etc), but who’s the one who inspired Bey, Madge and Dr Doug Ross to follow suit? I mean, come on. So, now that we know exactly why all these celebrities are having twins (because they’re copying me – have I mentioned that enough yet?), what amazing twin-based wisdom can I impart? Given that Madonna has adopted her girls, this first tip is more for Amal and Bey: get ready, ladies, for complete strangers to ask you straight out the most astonishing questions about your sex life. Come to think of it, maybe this is normal for a celebrity, but for the rest of us, it really is quite something how total randoms think it is perfectly acceptable to demand you tell them how you got pregnant, just because you have twins. “IVF?” “IVF?” “IVF?” is the ringing cry you will hear from strangers every day, for, as far as I can tell, the rest of your life. Personally, I find shouting back in their face, “NO, JUST REALLY HOT SEX” is a good way to shut them up, but that is possibly not a viable response if you’re a mega celebrity. So maybe just hit them? Next, the flavour of the twins. Now, you might think that conceiving two actual human beings simultaneously is an achievement in itself. You would be wrong. As soon as you tell people you are pregnant with twins, you learn there is a twin combo hierarchy and having boy/girl twins is considered the alpha of combos, because we now live in a world so astonishingly privileged that it is no longer enough for people to have a healthy baby, or two. No, the babies must tick both gender boxes “for variety’s sake”, people say, as if they were pick’n’mix. And so, as a general rule of thumb, the same people who think it appropriate to ask whether a penis or medical science impregnated you, then follow up by asking the gender of your twins, and their face falls ever so slightly if the answer is anything other than “boy/girl”. Try harder next time, woman pregnant with two babies at the same time! Obviously, celebrities never knowingly miss a chance to seize alpha-status, and so through, I presume, sheer force of celebrity will, the majority who have twins have boy/girl ones (Mariah, J-Lo, Julia Roberts, etc). Given that they are the alpha-most celebrities on the planet, I fully expect Bey and Jay to follow suit, although they are so alpha that for all I know perhaps they have discovered an entirely new gender to produce. Finally, here’s the real secret joy of twin parenthood: no one can give you any crap. Incredibly, there are people on this planet who see childbirth and parenthood not as a possible rite of life you muddle through as best you can, but as some kind of masochistic one-upmanship. So all that nonsense about how women are now expected in some wildly overprivileged quarters to prove how good they are by declining pain relief during birth, refusing a recommended C-section, shunning sleeping and feeding routines, breastfeeding for years, etc? Well, ha ha, you are fully opted out of that rigamarole, because you’re having twins, and no one can give you any nonsense about anything. Obviously, in a perfect world, no one would give any pregnant woman any nonsense, but we live in an imperfect world, and anything that saves you from any unnecessary crap should be celebrated. So there you go, Amal, Bey and Madonna: welcome to twin parenthood. It is entirely possible that none of this advice has any relevance to you whatsoever, but as all fashion journalists know, two’s a coincidence but three’s a trend, and with three celebrity twin parenthoods at once, we got a trend on our hands, folks. Which means, of course, only one thing: bring on the Kardashian-West triplets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/feb/10/arsenal-hull-city-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T15:44:56Z","webTitle":"Arsenal v Hull City: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/10/arsenal-hull-city-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/feb/10/arsenal-hull-city-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal v Hull City: match preview","bodyText":"Here we go again.

But these aren’t ordinary times. Shortly after taking office, President Donald J Trump unleashed pandemonium by suddenly announcing a temporary ban on travel into the United States from seven Muslim-majority nations, in addition to a temporary ban on all refugees. Experts cried foul, warning that Trump’s order violated the constitution and made America less safe. Amid vigils and protests, federal courts issued a flurry of rulings against Trump’s order. The broadest ruling was issued by Judge James Robart, who Trump promptly denounced on Twitter. On Tuesday, the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit heard oral argument on an emergency motion to overturn Judge Robart. More than 130,000 people live-streamed the hearing. The Department of Justice represented Trump in the court of appeals and took several astonishing positions. Most remarkably, it warned that “judicial second-guessing of the President’s national security determination in itself imposes substantial harm on the federal government and the nation at large.” Trump (through his tweets) and his lawyers (in their briefs) thus argued not only that Trump should win on appeal, but that judges would cause grave harm merely by questioning his order. On Thursday night, a three-judge panel of the ninth circuit unanimously ruled against Trump in a powerful, well-reasoned opinion. The panel held that Trump’s demand for judicial abdication “runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy”. As the court explained, “it is the role of the judiciary to interpret the law”, even in cases involving national security. Indeed, that is a settled, fundamental principle of our separation of powers: “Courts routinely review the constitutionality of – and even invalidate – actions taken by the executive to promote national security, and have done so even in times of conflict.” It was here that the panel cited Endo, a case imbued with tragic, enduring significance. To cite Endo is to invoke the memory of Japanese-American internment – a dark chapter from our past, in which the political branches cloaked bigotry in baseless claims of lurking peril, and in which the judiciary abandoned for too long its obligation to stand sentinel against tyranny. The ninth circuit amplified Endo’s message by linking it to cases from the civil war, cold war and Guantánamo Bay, where judges kept faith with the constitution against claims of exigency. All of these citations led the ninth circuit to Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s ringing declaration in Hamdi v Rumsfeld (2004) that the constitution “most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake”. The ninth circuit’s reasoning is forceful, elegant and necessary. It provides a respectful answer to Trump’s call for judicial silence, and teaches that checks and balances are essential to freedom. This is a lesson that Trump, a former business tycoon, must come to appreciate as he wields the awesome power of the presidency. Turning to the underlying question, the panel first addressed whether Trump is likely to prove that his order is constitutional. It concluded that he is not likely to do so, at this preliminary stage. Much of the court’s reasoning focused on whether the executive order complies with the fifth amendment, which requires due process of law (such as fair notice and a hearing before suffering travel restrictions). The Department of Justice largely based its defense on the ground that persons covered by the order – foreign nationals located abroad – lack constitutional rights. But as the panel observed, there are gaping holes in this defense. Most notably, the order applies to lawful permanent residents, or green card holders, who are protected by the constitution. While the White House counsel has purported to exempt green card holders, the court noted that his interpretation is neither authoritative nor binding. In addition, even if lawful permanent residents were not covered, Trump’s order might well violate the due process rights of other groups, including unlawful migrants present in the United States, non-immigrant visa holders who have been in the United States but temporarily departed or wish to temporarily depart, and visa applicants who have a protected relationship with a US resident. Turning to the claim that Trump’s order discriminates on the basis of religion – thereby violating the Establishment Clause and Equal Protection Clause – the panel noted only that there are “serious allegations” and “significant constitutional questions”. Based on the oral argument, this non-answer probably reflects a compromise among the judges, who may have different views. But still, the panel made clear that claims of religious discrimination can rest upon evidence of improper purpose. This ruling will come back to haunt the Trump administration, which has made anti-Muslim and pro-Christian comments in spades. The panel then considered whether blocking Trump’s order would cause irreparable injury. Here it tackled Trump’s most alarmist statements, emphasizing that “the Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.” In fact, the government had presented no evidence at all, relying instead on broad and non-specific assertions of national security. The only relevant evidence was an affidavit by a bipartisan group of former officials, warning that the order made us less safe. This was a striking departure from the executive’s standard practice of offering factual support for its security claims. Finally, the panel saw public interests pointing both ways: “On the one hand, the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies. And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination.” Taking all of these considerations into account, the panel refused to reverse Judge Robart’s decision blocking Trump’s order. Trump has spent the past few days railing against, bullying and seeking to delegitimize the federal courts. True to form, within minutes of the ninth circuit’s opinion, he tweeted, “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” The contrast between Trump’s tweets and the ninth circuit’s 30-page reasoned opinion speaks for itself. Trump now has three options. He can allow his executive order to remain stayed while proceedings continue in the trial court. He can seek immediate rehearing before the full ninth circuit. Or he can file an emergency application for relief at the supreme court. If Trump pursues this last route, he must convince five justices in order to prevail. That may prove challenging. In all events, while Trump’s order will probably remain blocked for the time being, the path ahead is long and steep. The ninth circuit’s order is admirable, but preliminary. Legal battles will rage in courts across the land. Further fact-finding and real-world developments may change hearts and minds. And Trump could decide to revoke, revise or replace the executive order. Still, the ninth circuit has rendered the nation a great service. Its hearing exemplified the rule of law in a democratic society. And its fine opinion displays the judicial courage our era requires."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/feb/10/why-the-price-could-be-right-for-craft-beer","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T19:24:36Z","webTitle":"Why the price could be right for craft beer | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/10/why-the-price-could-be-right-for-craft-beer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/10/why-the-price-could-be-right-for-craft-beer","fields":{"headline":"Why the price could be right for craft beer","bodyText":"It might be a good idea for Bob Proctor (The dangers of jumping on a craft beer bandwagon, Letters, 4 February) to check with his local pub’s landlord and find out what container this “overpriced craft beer” comes in.

Beer is delivered in a cask or keg, both either steel or, more recently, hard plastic. These are both expected to be returned to the brewery, which will reuse them. KeyKegs are non-returnable, so the cost of packaging must be passed on to the pub, which then passes the cost on to the consumer.

Those sponsors include Annabel’s, the Berkeley Square nightclub frequented by generations of louche toffs and posh totty, and Coutts, long known as the Queen’s bankers, where you need a cool million in investable assets (not including property) to open an account and her majesty’s statements are probably still written out by a man in morning dress with a quill pen. The list of those contributing to the campaign also includes an establishment billed as “the last remaining family-owned hotel in Belgravia”, and a “quintessential lifestyle brand” purveying “year-round luxury resort apparel”. This is very much the world of the sort of ultra-high-net-worth individuals who shuttle between Monaco and St Barts in their mega-yachts, a rarified environment summed up in the New York Times this week by a property developer hawking a brand-new home in Los Angeles – complete with a 40-seat movie theatre preloaded with 7,000 movies, 130 “bespoke art installations” and a garage already containing a dozen classic cars worth a couple of million apiece – at a giveaway price of $250m. “This house is more like a land yacht,” he told the New York Times. “It didn’t make sense to me that somebody would spend $300m on a boat that they use eight weeks a year and live in a house that only cost $20m or $30m.” Quite so. And anyone answering to that description will very likely be among those moored at the quayside in Bermuda in June when the holders of the 166-year-old cup, Oracle Team USA, face their challengers. Yacht racing is and always has been a sport for the rich; nothing is about to alter that, even a change in the rules since the last edition in 2013, bringing down the size of the foiling catamarans from a length of 72ft to 45ft in order to reduce the astronomical costs of a campaign. As economies go, that one is like asking Larry Ellison, whose software company gives its name to the US boat, to do without one of his many mansions. Ellison was rated as the world’s fifth richest individual even after blowing more than $200m on Oracle’s bid to win the cup four years ago, a follow-up to his first victory in 2010. But enough of the class warfare. The fact is that Oracle’s triumph in the 2013 event was arguably the best piece of televised international sport – and certainly the greatest comeback – so far this century, thanks largely to Ainslie. The US boat was 4-1 down to New Zealand, the challenger, when the winner of four gold medals at consecutive Olympic regattas jumped aboard to take over as tactician. The skipper of the 11-man crew, Jimmy Spithill, had played the postponement card, allowing them a 48-hour time-out and the opportunity to recalibrate their tactics. They lost the next four races while Ainslie got his bearings, and at 8-1 down they stood just one more loss away from losing the cup. Then, from a position even more seemingly hopeless than the one Liverpool faced at 3-0 down to Milan after 45 minutes in Istanbul in 2005, Oracle suddenly started winning. The winds were lighter and with Ainslie calling the shots, their modified approach started to pay dividends. It was then that many with no previous interest in sailing started to make it a daily priority. What helped feed that unfamiliar enthusiasm was the quality of the television coverage, which came from NBC, the host broadcaster. The setting certainly helped: the boats were racing in San Francisco Bay, with the city providing a spectacular backdrop and the glowering mass of Alcatraz Island, site of the notorious former prison, as an unusual feature. But most persuasive of all was the discovery that NBC’s producers had found a way to make the racing absolutely enthralling, using all the data-tracking and predictive devices at their disposal, expressed through an array of graphic overlays, to keep the viewer completely informed about the state of the contest. Over the three-week battle between Emirates Team New Zealand and Oracle Team USA, those digital tools were used to give the viewer a clear vision of the course, of the paths of the two boats, and of the constantly changing effects of wind and wave – without which the pictures would have been meaningless to the lay person. Clear and informative commentary helped, too. Funnily enough, the race organisers virtually had to bribe NBC to show it. The network had been on the brink of dropping it from its schedules altogether when the America’s Cup bought the airtime, selling advertising to their sponsors to meet the costs. That’s probably not going to happen again, and the ratings success of the 2013 America’s Cup should give hope to all sports that feel in danger of obsolescence and neglect. If yacht racing can force its way back into public favour, then anything can. And if Ainslie’s Land Rover BAR team get through the elimination rounds from 26 May-12 June, when they compete against boats from New Zealand, Sweden, France and Japan for the right to meet the holders, we can expect the final races from 17-27 June to provoke an outbreak of enthusiasm to match the best years of the Ryder Cup. In his attempt to become the first man to break a British losing streak going back to an American victory in the very first America’s Cup, held off the Isle of Wight in 1851, Ainslie has drawn on relevant expertise from the world of Formula One. Martin Whitmarsh, the former boss of the McLaren team, is the chief executive. A company run by Dave Richards, once head of Benetton and BAR-Honda, supplies some of the boat’s complex control systems. Red Bull’s Adrian Newey, arguably the most successful racing car designer of all time, and also a sailing enthusiast, lent his knowledge. In an era of belated successes for British sport, from the Tour de France to the Davis Cup and the Olympic gymnastics, Ainslie might well be the next to break a painfully protracted hoodoo. If he pulls it off, the cheers will ring far beyond the vaults of a private bank and the nightclubs of Mayfair.

That’s shocked me’","bodyText":"Both the house and the man are smaller than you would expect, a result of the diminishing effects of old age that come to us all, if we are lucky enough to live that long. Kirk Douglas, now 100 years old, and Anne, his wife of 62 years, moved into the small bungalow in Beverly Hills about 30 years ago when they downsized from the multiple mansions where they had entertained friends such as Fred Astaire, Lauren Bacall and Ronald Reagan while Frank Sinatra knocked up Italian meals in their kitchen. But if their current home looks unprepossessing from the outside, there are extraordinary treasures within: a Roy Lichtenstein, personally inscribed to Douglas, hangs in the front hallway, while a Picasso and Robert Rauschenberg hang in the living room. The house is filled with modern masterpieces, a testament to the riches accrued by the man originally known as Issur Danielovitch – born so poor that he regularly went hungry until his mid-20s – through his own talent and self-forged toughness. When Douglas himself enters the living room, he is leaning on a walker and accompanied by one of the various nurses who care for him and his wife around the clock. There is no question that reaching your centenary takes it out of a man: every movement suggests effort. Most frustrating for him, his tongue hangs heavy in his mouth, the result of a stroke in 1996, and the once-ringing diction is now slurred. Yet to judge the interior by the exterior proves to be a mistake. When Douglas starts talking not even the muffling layers of age can hide his still charmingly boyish personality, even if his body occasionally lets him down. He is, he says, “a little tired today”, but he makes sure to look a lady straight in the eye when he smiles. “How do I feel in general? Ahh,” he says, with a decidedly Jewish shrug, and during our time together he asks, anxiously and often: “Do you understand what I’m saying?” I do, mostly. That famously pugnacious chin is a little receded, but those familiar close-set eyes, which he passed on to his eldest son, Michael, are bright. Michael, as it happens, is currently staying in the guesthouse by the pool, visiting for a few days, as he does every month. “He comes to visit the old man,” Douglas says with pride. “I never, ever thought I would live to be 100. That’s shocked me, really. And it’s sad, too,” he adds. There are so many friends he misses, the downside to being the last legend standing from the golden age of Hollywood. “I miss Burt Lancaster – we fought a lot, and I miss him a lot. And John Wayne, even though he was a Republican and I was a Democrat,” he says. Wayne was similarly fond of Douglas – they made a handful of movies together – but he was a little baffled by him. In The Ragman’s Son, one of Douglas’s several beautifully written memoirs, he recounts that Wayne attended a screening of Lust for Life, Douglas’s heartfelt 1956 biopic of Vincent van Gogh, and was horrified. “Christ, Kirk! How can you play a part like that? There’s so few of us left. We got to play strong, tough characters. Not those weak queers,” Wayne said. “I tried to explain: ‘It’s all make-believe, John. It isn’t real. You’re not really John Wayne, you know.’ He just looked at me oddly. I had betrayed him,” Douglas writes. It is understandable that Wayne would see Douglas as a fellow tough guy: built like a small angry bull and with the furious focus to match, he was perfectly cast in films such as 1949’s Champion as the ambitious boxer Midge Kelly, and 1962’s Lonely Are the Brave – still Douglas’s favourite – as a noble cowboy. His reputation offscreen as a stubborn so-and-so who would fight with everyone from Stanley Kubrick to Otto Preminger contributed to this image. But Douglas was always more interested in what lay underneath. His acting theory, he has written, was “when you play a weak character, find a moment when he’s strong, and when you play a strong character, find a moment when he’s weak”. You can see this in his best performances, such as 1951’s Ace in the Hole, directed by Billy Wilder, in which he played an amoral journalist who realises too late he has gone too far, and also, of course, in 1960’s Spartacus, in which he gave humanity to a legendary hero. To watch Douglas’s performances now, some of them more than 70 years old, it is striking how modern he seems, often more so than many of his contemporaries, who now look rather stagey. Douglas, with his famously intense stare juxtaposed with his relaxed delivery, looks like the precursor to Tom Cruise at his best. “I was not a tough guy [in real life],” he laughs. “I just acted like one.” Never did he need more of this toughness than when he famously, if not quite single-handedly, broke the Hollywood blacklist (whereby those thought to have communist sympathies were denied work in the entertainment industry). The story has been told often: Douglas hired the blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo for Spartacus. “It was that movie,” he starts, but then trails off, unable to remember the name of his most famous movie. Getting old really is a bitch. “Spartacus! Yes,” he says, back on track. Wasn’t he scared that he might be destroying his own career? “No!” he scoffs. “It would have been very different if I’d been older, but I was stubborn then.” When Douglas arranged for Trumbo to have a parking pass on the studio lot under his own name, and then included Trumbo’s name in the film’s credits, the blacklist was effectively broken. Some, including Trumbo’s family, have said Douglas has glorified his role a little in his frequent retelling of the tale. When Douglas published a book on the subject, I am Spartacus: Making a Film, Breaking the Blacklist, Trumbo’s daughter, Melissa, said she “threw it across the room”. But whatever the full truth, there is no doubting Douglas’s courage in letting himself be the public face of the blacklist rebellion. So, given his famously liberal politics and abhorrence of political bullies, what does he think of the new US president? He reels back as if I’d smacked his cheek. “That’s an unfair question,” he says. Too cruel to ask that of a lifelong Democrat? “Let’s just say I didn’t vote for him,” he replies. Douglas, born when Woodrow Wilson was president, was one of seven children and the only son of illiterate Russian Jewish immigrants. He grew up speaking Yiddish at home in Amsterdam, New York in almost unimaginably deprived circumstances; the family’s income came from Douglas’s father’s daily attempts to sell scraps from a horse and buggy. Douglas fought his way out of his circumstances with his wit and wiles: he talked his way into a college scholarship and then baggsied another for acting school in New York, where he became lifelong friends with another Jewish student, Betty Perske, later better known as Lauren Bacall. Along the way, he had to contend with an enormous amount of antisemitism. When he started to become successful in Hollywood, he was invited to join an exclusive tennis club. The actor Lex Barker warned him at the time: “Of course, Kirk, you understand we can’t run a club the way we do back east. Here we have to let in a few Jews.” “I am a Jew,” Douglas snapped back: he shed his Jewish name early on, but not his roots. Today, a mezuzah is affixed to the frame of his front door, and he credits his Jewish sense of responsibility for the fact that he has became one of the most generous philanthropists in Hollywood (he recently donated a further $50m (£40m) to, among others, his old college, St Lawrence University, to help students from minority backgrounds.) Yet, Douglas has said that it is too simplistic to say, as many have done, that his childhood toughened him up. It was the reverse, if anything. If he seemed like a hard-ass when he was younger, it is because he was overcompensating: he was well into middle age before he stopped seeing himself as the scared and bullied little boy he once was, and his famous womanising, he thinks, was part of that. He had, he writes, “a mother complex”: “I constantly sought from the women around me a mother substitute.” His search certainly was constant: from Rita Hayworth to Marlene Dietrich, it is hard to name a famous actress from the mid-20th century who wasn’t seduced by Douglas. At one point he fretted to his analyst that he thought he might be impotent after a disappointing encounter the night before. “You tell me that you had sex 29 nights in a row with different girls. On the 30th, you say you’re impotent,” his doctor replied drily. “You know, even God rested after six days.” Douglas has been married twice, first to Diana, with whom he had Michael and Joel, and then to Anne, with whom he had Peter and Eric. But it took a while for matrimony to break his stride. “I was a bad boy,” he admits, a little sorrowfully. “But Anne knew how to handle me.” Indeed. Even before they married, Anne invited all the women she knew he had slept with to a party for him in Paris. “I couldn’t believe it when I walked in and saw the guests,” he says, laughing. “Ah! She knows everything.” In his multiple memoirs, he writes with self-flagellating frequency about how his distant father let him down and how he feels he in turn let down his four sons. “I am so proud of Michael because he never followed my advice. I wanted him to be a doctor or lawyer, and the first time I saw him in a play I told him he was terrible,” Douglas laughs. “But then I saw him a second time and I said: ‘You were wonderful!’ And I think he is very good in everything he’s done.” Did he ever feel competitive with Michael? “No! Only proud,” Douglas insists. This isn’t totally true. He was, he admits, a tough father, one who wouldn’t even let his son win a race in the pool when he was 45 and Michael was 16. “Geez, Dad, you were so tense, so uptight,” Michael recalled in adulthood. “Michael didn’t like me much after his mother and I got divorced. It was only when he started acting that we became close,” Douglas says regretfully. This is also almost certainly an exaggeration – Douglas’s books are full of stories that suggest a lifetime of closeness between him and his boys – but Michael certainly found a way to assert himself when he started acting. For years, Douglas’s dream film project was One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, but he could never get it off the ground. “So Michael asked me if he could try to produce it, and I said: ‘Sure!’ Next thing I know, he has a director lined up and it’s all go. So I said to him: ‘Great! When do we start rehearsing?’” “Not you, Dad,” his son replied, devastatingly. “You’re too old.” “I couldn’t believe it!” Douglas says, eyebrows shooting up into his hair. “So I said: ‘Who’s playing my part? Jack Nicholson? Never heard of him. Well, at least it will be a flop …’” By the 1980s, when young women approached him, it was no longer because he was Kirk Douglas but because he was Michael Douglas’s father. He laughs about this now, but I suspect that, for the once legendary swordsman, it stung a little at the time. Michael Douglas is probably the most shining exception to the rule that children of famous actors rarely end well if they try to follow in their parents’ footsteps. “[Celebrities’] children, surfeited with every indulgence, are having miserable childhoods. The daughter of a television personality jumps out a window. A movie star’s son shoots himself. Why? To the rest of the world it looks as if these kids were brought up with everything,” Kirk wrote in 1988. Over the next two decades, he would have all too many occasions to ask himself this sad question. His youngest son, Eric, who had acted a little and struggled with addictions for years, overdosed and died in 2004 at the age of 46. Today, when talking about his sons, Kirk can’t quite bring himself to say Eric’s name. Did Douglas ever find an answer to his question? “Hollywood is make-believe, and that’s confusing,” he says, but he is starting to drift and tire. History seemed as if it was repeating itself when Michael’s oldest son, Cameron, who had also tried acting, was arrested a few years after his uncle’s death on drugs charges. He was released last year after seven years of incarceration. “Cameron is OK. He is doing so much better now and he says he will come visit next month. He’s working on a book, you know,” Douglas says, perking up. Douglas himself has just published his 12th book, Kirk and Anne: Letters of Love, Laughter, and a Lifetime in Hollywood, a collection of letters between the couple during their marriage. Not bad to still be publishing at the age of 100, I say. “Yes, that’s right,” he agrees, stoutly. One of the most frustrating things about getting older, he says, is how out of touch he feels. “I don’t know who any of the new stars are, and they probably don’t know me,” he says. Oh, I bet they know you, I say. That makes him smile: “Well, maybe …” Surely he’s happy he was a star back in the golden age, not now when Hollywood is all about special effects and sequels. He nods vigorously. “Yes, yes. I was so lucky. Now it’s all different. Yes, very, very lucky.” He asks if I mind if we stop now as he is getting weary, and, of course, I say no, although I wish we could talk all day. He gets up slowly, and with some assistance. But before he disappears he pats my arm and looks up at me. “We’ll talk longer next time,” he promises. I can’t wait."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2017/feb/10/sam-allardyce-crystal-palace","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-10T22:41:13Z","webTitle":"Sam Allardyce calls on psychologist to rid Crystal Palace of Selhurst fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/10/sam-allardyce-crystal-palace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/feb/10/sam-allardyce-crystal-palace","fields":{"headline":"Sam Allardyce calls on psychologist to rid Crystal Palace of Selhurst fears","bodyText":"Sam Allardyce has hired a sports psychologist to help his Crystal Palace players overcome the fear they experience when playing at Selhurst Park. Lee Richardson, a psychologist who was also a professional footballer and a former manager of Chesterfield, has been brought in to consult individually with the squad as they fight to avoid relegation from the Premier League. Palace travel to Stoke on Saturday having won only two league games since September and are 19th place in the table. “I’ve employed Lee Richardson, because I do feel we’ve got to try to help the lads focus mentally,” Allardyce said. “If we can do that, then they will perform better because when you play at this level your mind has got to work in an efficient way. “At the moment, with the fear we’ve got at home, they’re losing their concentration when they should be focused. If they’re not responding to the psychologist, then they’re not helping themselves because these guys are superbly trained to allow you to function better on the field.” Sports psychology is not new to Palace; the former manager Alan Pardew employed the former England cricketer Jeremy Snape in that role. Neither is it new to Allardyce, who has embraced sports science in his career as a manager. He made clear he hopes Richardson’s interventions will prove instrumental over the coming months. “Looking at our home results for many months, there’s an underlying deep problem that we’ve got to try to work out and get rid of. What better than a man more qualified than me,” Allardyce said. “I’ve been using them since 1999. The coping skills I got taught by psychologists since becoming a Premier League manager is the reason I’m still here and why I can sit back and deal with the pressure in this particular situation.” Palace are certainly under pressure. Their 4-0 defeat against Sunderland at Selhurst Park, where they have taken seven points from 12 games this season, led to the chairman, Steve Parish, addressing the players in the dressing room after the match. Allardyce confirmed he had been “fine” with the intervention and he had made the players report for training at 7am the following day. He has been pleased with the players’ response. “What the chairman said is a behind-closed-doors scenario,” Allardyce said. “That was him releasing his frustration on the basis he’s a Crystal Palace fan and he wanted to talk to the players. It was fine by me. We addressed the situation, one with the chairman, two with me on the Sunday morning and then that was it, it was nailed. We covered everything we needed to cover, we spoke deeply about it. They had Monday off to reflect and then on Tuesday we started to build for this very important game at Stoke City. “I think the players’ reaction this week, especially in training, has been exceptionally good but it’s something we don’t want to do again. I don’t want to bring them in at seven on a Sunday. “I thought we’d turned a corner [in the 2-0 win] at Bournemouth, because out of possession Bournemouth probably could have played for two days and didn’t look like scoring. Against Sunderland it was the same players but it looked like different teams.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2017/feb/12/populism-power-press-cant-hold-down-brexit-trump-grillo","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-12T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"The power of the press can’t hold populism down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/12/populism-power-press-cant-hold-down-brexit-trump-grillo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/feb/12/populism-power-press-cant-hold-down-brexit-trump-grillo","fields":{"headline":"The power of the press can’t hold populism down","bodyText":"Every so often the old power-of-the-press refrain gets another airing. It might be because the great gods of Murdoch have visited Downing Street 10 times in a year. It might be because David Cameron made crass advances to the latest Viscount Rothermere, or because Steve Bannon (in loco Trump) calls the media his “opposition party”. In any case, there’s an assumed clash of titans and rival estates. But step back and watch the contest shrivel. Consider just a few of the upheavals of the past few months, plus upheavals pending. Where was press “power” in the election of Trump? Nowhere. He only contrived a handful of newspaper endorsements, even from long-standing Republican editorial pages. Faithful proponents of Bush and Reagan deserted him. Maybe Fox News rallied around once Rupert Murdoch ditched Ben Carson and settled for the inevitable. But cable news as a whole – and CNN as a vital part of that whole – tried to stand straight. Perhaps social media and fake news played a big role (though latter-day researchers are having a tough time proving it). Shock jocks inveighed as usual. But big media – big newspapers, big TV – were overwhelmingly pro-Clinton and vehemently anti-Trump. Yet the force was not with them. People, if they listened at all, still did their own thing. And so it is in Europe too. Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement, the wildest card in the Italian pack, seems populist with a capital P, echoing many of Trump’s diatribes against the press. It lives, like Grillo himself, on the internet. It is self-taught and self-secured. Did any major Austrian news provider support Norbert Hofer’s Freedom party bid for the presidency? No. Is any major French newspaper or TV channel backing Marine Le Pen to succeed François Hollande in April? No. And next month’s election in the Netherlands? Surely some battalions of media power must have propelled Geert Wilders, with his own “Freedom” party’s view on Islam and immigration, into the lead? But no, yet again (although, as in other cases, you can begin to sense the occasional rightwing paper bending in the wind: following, not leading). Nor, of course, is the phenomenon limited to one side of the political spectrum. Spain’s Podemos burst into life without much in the way of drum rolls from the established media, and still finds its most fervent support on the web and from one TV station. The selfsame media, remember, failed to see Jeremy Corbyn coming. And you’ll inevitably recall all those Broadcasting House mouths dropping open when the first Brexit results came in. The same mouths, curiously enough, who didn’t have the time of day for Ukip when Nigel Farage began his long march. All of which may be because self-absorbed editorial masters failed to see something coming; or because people, ordinary people more individual than ever before, now operate below the radar, joined together in ideological rebellions by laptops and smartphones. It’s the great bottom-up-not-top-down memorial lecture. And perhaps that lecture arrives with two necessary appendices. One, alas, echoes Michael Gove’s disdain for “experts”: signal evidence that the more you think you know, the more you risk looking red-faced wrong. Appendix 2, though, stretches above and beyond. It tells every pundit over and over again that history is not dead, but live and convulsive. Maybe the media can ruin a few reputations along the way, make a few politicians dance to an accommodating tune. But power? Better ask the people. • When is a lie something a little more nuanced, not to say obscure? When the editor of the Wall Street Journal struggles to define it for his restless staff. “If we are to use the term ‘lie’ in our reporting, then we have to be confident about the subject’s state of knowledge and his moral intent. I can see circumstances where we might. I’m reluctant to use the term, not implacably against it.” Not so much fakery, more contextual mis-statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/19/once-we-were-sisters-sheila-kohler-1950s-south-africa-review-extraordinary-memoir-of-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T06:59:01Z","webTitle":"Once We Were Sisters by Sheila Kohler review – an extraordinary memoir of loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/19/once-we-were-sisters-sheila-kohler-1950s-south-africa-review-extraordinary-memoir-of-loss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/19/once-we-were-sisters-sheila-kohler-1950s-south-africa-review-extraordinary-memoir-of-loss","fields":{"headline":"Once We Were Sisters by Sheila Kohler review – an extraordinary memoir of loss","bodyText":"For 30 years, the death of her sister, Maxine, driven off the road on a spring night by her abusive husband, has haunted South African novelist Sheila Kohler.

I ended up in A&amp;E where every staff member I came into contact with was patient, kind, and calm, even though the department seemed busier than usual. I was treated with compassion and respect, and one nurse even succeeded in making me laugh on what was the worst day of my life. I could feel the support all around me. They made me feel less alone and I can’t thank them enough.Even though a couple of years have passed, I still think about how fantastically I was treated in my vulnerable state, and how different my life could have turned out if it hadn’t been for their kindness and understanding. Without them, I don’t think I’d be here. Student, Gloucestershire I’ve lived in the US. I’ve seen what worse care for more money looks like The first time the NHS saved my life I was trapped under a car after an accident with a fractured pelvis, skull and three crushed vertebrae as well as a haemorrhaging liver. The eight days I spent in hospital would have bankrupted my family if I had been living in the US. I was 13 and by the time I was discharged I didn’t even want to leave. The care was so good they even brought in school work so I didn’t fall behind in class. The second time my appendix burst and I underwent an operation. I missed the first day of my finals but the surgeon gave me the smallest appendectomy scar of anyone I’ve ever seen. They obviously took immense pride in it and I thought that was very cool. I’ve lived in the US. I’ve seen what worse care for more money looks like. I’ve seen people die of preventable cancers because they were too poor to go to a doctor. Huw Gildon, 40, marketing professional It’s amazing when patients that have nearly died several times walk out of hospital I love the NHS because every day I see people who are at their most vulnerable and the sickest they will ever be. The standout stories for me are when patients have been through the biggest fight of their lives, have nearly died several times, have been hooked up to a ventilator for months on end and they then walk out of our unit and hospital. Jenny, ITU nurse, 32, Liverpool My consultant came in to operate on me on his day off I had a radioactive plaque fitted into my eye five days after a diagnosis of eye cancer. A while later, I was lying on a theatre trolley waiting for surgery to remove it. The consultant who had fitted the plaque previously warned me that he had a day off and so would not be doing the removal. Obviously all surgeons are perfectly qualified; I had no need to be fearful. But, it had been a stressful week so I lay having a silent sob about how I was about to die and only one person could save me but they weren’t here. Just as I was being pushed into theatre, someone touched my arm; it was my original consultant. “I’ll be doing your operation today Mrs Dimmock,” he said. Those words are now up there with my husband saying “I do” and my kids first saying “mumumum”. Victoria Dimmock, 41, Brighton As a doctor it is marvellous to be able to treat everyone without worrying about them having to pay I remember about 30 years ago a baby was born in severe heart failure. She was transferred to a specialist heart hospital and then had to be transferred to another hospital in Scotland. Sadly the treatment failed and the doctors explained that the baby was going to die. The parents asked if they could be transferred back to their hometown so the grandparents could see the baby before she died. She was accordingly helicoptered back to where her family was and she died surrounded by them. The marvellous thing was no one argued about financial matters – it just happened. As a doctor, it is marvellous to be able to treat everyone without worrying about them having to pay. Anonymous Woe to the British citizen who doesn’t vigorously defend the NHS My favourite story is the birth of our third child which was our first to happen through the NHS. Our eldest were born in the US and even though we had “good” health insurance we still received bills for about $1,300 after each child was born. And the NHS has midwives who have the goal of making birth as easy and humane as possible for mum and baby. In the US, birth is much more an assembly line situation that feels like some sort of costly corporate emergency. In the UK, our son swam out into a big birth tub while my wife sucked on some gas and air (which they don’t have in the US). It was just a kinder, gentler experience and while there were doctors nearby if we needed one, we never even had to see one. My wife was coached through labour by a lovely young woman while I tried to stay out of the way and shout nice things or grab a flannel when asked, that type of thing. Woe to the British citizen who doesn’t vigorously defend the NHS. You do not know how lucky you are. Do NOT take it for granted and fire politicians who you think don’t take care of your nation’s most precious achievement, the NHS. Rob Delaney, 40, comedian, from the US but lives in London Sometimes there are wonderful stories of survival When I was an intensive care nurse, I looked after a patient for several weeks who had a number of setbacks along the way to recovery. One day, it was decided by the doctors that he had reached a stage where survival was unlikely and that, should the time come, he should be allowed to die with dignity. It was agreed to transfer him to a hospice. I ensured that I was his nurse on each day. He started in a catatonic state. I made enquiries about transferring to a hospice nearer his home, but none of them had any beds. We were told to try again in a few days. Three days later, he had made a strong recovery and was sat out in a chair eating breakfast when his family came to visit. Nurse practitioner, 40, Cheshire I have seen HIV go from a death penalty to chronic manageable illness in my time working in the NHS I worked on a HIV ward in London in the early 90s. We cared for patients who were slowly dying as their immune systems were attacked by the virus and they succumbed to various infections. It was a heartbreaking time with so many people affected and no hope in sight. There were various drugs being trialled, and the patients were happy to be guinea pigs – they had nothing to lose. There was a breakthrough in the late 90s and I witnessed the introduction of triple therapy. I saw the illness go from a death penalty to chronic manageable illness.
