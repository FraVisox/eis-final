I see they’re cutting the grass now,” the Stoke City manager said, smiling. “They should have done it before the game, but there you go.” It was a little dig that is in keeping with the sort of needle that surrounds this fixture, in particular the relationship between the two managers, who have little time for one another. Asked whether keeping the grass long had been designed to counteract Stoke’s passing game, Hughes replied: “Quite possibly. I don’t know. You’ll have to ask the people involved.” The expression on Tony Pulis’s face said it all when that comment was put to him moments later. Albion’s head coach yawned, made the point that the grass was the same length against Bournemouth in their opening home game, and then got in a jab of his own. “We’re still unbeaten against them,” Pulis said, referring to the fact that he has yet to taste defeat in seven Premier League matches as a manager against Stoke City since he left the club in 2013. Five of those games have ended in victory and it would have been six but for Peter Crouch’s late header cancelling out Jay Rodriguez’s first Premier League goal for Albion since his £12m summer transfer from Southampton. Pulis signed Crouch for Stoke in 2011 – the same year that the club reached the FA Cup final – yet the chants that emanated from the travelling supporters suggested they have little time for the Welshman and his achievements across his seven years in charge. “Tony Pulis, your football is shit,” rang out on several occasions. Pulis chose his words carefully in response. “I think that’s the way the world is. I don’t think that matters at all,” he said. “There’s a person in the stand called Peter Coates [the Stoke chairman] and his family, who respect what I did there more than anybody else. And they are the people I respect more than anybody else.” On the pitch things were nothing like as entertaining. The game was desperately dull – a point that Hughes was quick to make. “I have to say I didn’t particularly enjoy it as a spectacle, or even being involved at management level,” said the Stoke manager, who is set to complete the signing of Kevin Wimmer from Tottenham Hotspur for £15m. “It was frustrating to say the least. But maybe we shouldn’t have expected anything different; it’s always difficult when you come here. Those are the type of games that you have to face more often than not.” In the end a draw felt like a fair result, yet Albion’s disappointment at the final whistle was understandable given the poor goal they conceded to allow Stoke back into the game. Ahmed Hegazi, who had scored on his debut in the previous home match, got in a terrible tangle trying to clear a cross from Ramadan Sobhi, the central defender slashing wildly at a ball that Ben Foster, Albion’s keeper, had come off his line to gather. Crouch, loitering at the far post, accepted the gift, nodding home his 104th Premier League goal and his 51st with his head. “Probably the easiest headed goal that Crouchy has ever scored,” Hughes said. Although Hughes took satisfaction from the fact that two of his substitutes combined to haul Stoke level, there was a glaring lack of conviction about Stoke’s offensive play before their introduction. Kurt Zouma’s 20-yard deflected shot, which was expertly tipped over the bar by Foster, was the sum total of their attacking threat prior to Crouch’s header. Everything looked a little disjointed with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting leading the line and Jesé Rodríguez drifting out onto the left. Albion, in fairness, were no better going forward, and it was a goal totally out of the blue that gave them the lead on 61 minutes. Allan Nyom broke on the right side of the pitch and delivered a fine cross that ran through to the far post, where Rodriguez reacted much quicker than Zouma and Geoff Cameron, who were both caught on their heels. Stooping to meet the ball with a diving header from about six yards, Rodriguez beat the goalkeeper Jack Butland. “Jay adds another goalscorer to this team but we need more,” Pulis admitted as the lawnmowers ploughed on in the background."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/aug/28/pep-guardiola-england-manchester-city-clique-gareth-southgate","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T09:11:30Z","webTitle":"Pep Guardiola’s circular dressing room offers one way to split up team cliques | Barry Glendenning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/aug/28/pep-guardiola-england-manchester-city-clique-gareth-southgate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/aug/28/pep-guardiola-england-manchester-city-clique-gareth-southgate","fields":{"headline":"Pep Guardiola’s circular dressing room offers one way to split up team cliques","bodyText":"The butt of much public mockery when Sky’s cameras captured assorted well-heeled corporate clients peering through its walls of two‑way glass last Monday night, Manchester City’s Tunnel Club is the most amusing but not necessarily most interesting renovation to have been undertaken at the Etihad Stadium during the close season. Moving on from the well fed and watered supporters staring in slack-jawed wonder at the exhibits as they prepared for battle, the cameras also gave us a glimpse of an inner sanctum that, for the time being at least, remains closed to prying eyes on match days. The stadium’s home dressing room is as opulent as you might expect for such a wealthy club, but it is its sheer roundness that is most striking. Returning for his early plunge in the state-of-the-art hydrotherapy pool after being sent off on his home debut, Kyle Walker will no doubt have been struck by the rotational symmetry of his surroundings as he angrily flung his shin pads into one of the corners that aren’t there, before being enveloped in the life-affirming chi that feng shui experts tell us a 360-degree dwelling space provides. Harmonising his players with their surroundings may not have been uppermost in Pep Guardiola’s mind when he signed off on the summer redesign of the home dressing room, but the decision to make it circular was a very conscious one. Much like the knights who convened around the famous table of Arthurian legend, all men who sit in Guardiola’s similarly shaped sanctuary enjoy equal status and the Spaniard is understood to have encouraged the design as a way of discouraging that most pernicious and malign of influences on team morale: the dressing room clique. Far from exclusive to football and regularly held up as one of the root causes for the poor performances of sports teams who fail to live up to the sum of their parts, these exclusive close-knit groups within groups are the bane of managers whose desperation to eliminate them in the interests of team or squad harmony occasionally extends to actually fretting over meal-time seating arrangements for grown adults like a bride and groom meticulously plotting to minimise the potential for internecine strife at their wedding reception. England’s football squad has long been renowned for its cliquishness and as the players gather for the first international break of the season, we can only speculate as to how damaging division among the ranks has been for morale in a national team that has consistently come up short since 1990. It would be naive to assume more inclusive England squads might have enjoyed greater success at international tournaments, or to imagine more successful teams – hello France, Germany and Spain – have not also been adversely affected by internal divides. For all that, the ease with which England habitually qualify for major tournaments compared with the horror show that invariably unfolds once the players have been confined to barracks for five or six weeks does little to dispel the notion that the more time they spend cloistered together, the less cohesive their performances tend to be. In a newspaper column he wrote before England’s doomed Euro 2016 campaign, Rio Ferdinand mentioned the cliques which were immediately apparent upon his introduction to the England squad as a teenager. “You had [Alan] Shearer’s table and all his mates,” he said. “You had the Liverpool table and all the dregs like a couple of Arsenal and a couple of West Ham like me. Then there was the United table.” His description of a squad divided was more or less confirmed by his fellow West Ham alumnus Dean Ashton, who seemed genuinely baffled by arrangements when he was called up by Steve McClaren in 2006. “I was warned beforehand that it [the squad] could be a bit cliquey – with the Liverpool boys sticking together, Manchester United, Chelsea and it very much was like that,” he recalled. “There was very much a feeling of when you first go into a classroom and no one really wants to talk to you. I mean, I was there for a few days, and there were some senior players that didn’t speak to me for the whole time I was there, which I just found totally bizarre.” In an interview published in the Guardian last year, the former England rugby team psychologist Jeremy Snape cited Leicester City’s unlikely march to the Premier League title as the very antithesis of a team suffering from the adverse affects of a tribe being rent asunder by internal cliquishness. “The excitement of doing something special would have galvanised their individual differences, focused their minds on strategies and roles, and maintained their physical training until the very end of the season,” he said, before warning that future difficulties would lie in “maintaining that hunger and selflessness when so much in their lives will have changed”. Sure enough, shortly into the following season the cracks began to appear. A thoughtful man and manager, Gareth Southgate will be aware of the need to abolish cliques in his squad while simultaneously treating his players like the grown men they are. In 2015 as head of the England youth team set-up, he was forced to deny allegations of racial divisions in the under-20 squad in the face of fairly incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. In photos published by several newspapers, either through accident or design the boys in question happened to be dining at a couple of round tables. All equal as squad members, the white players were seated together around one of them while their black team-mates occupied the other."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/28/brexit-talks-hardliners-eu-money","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T05:00:25Z","webTitle":"The real problem with Brexit talks is there are hardliners on both sides | Charles Grant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/28/brexit-talks-hardliners-eu-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/28/brexit-talks-hardliners-eu-money","fields":{"headline":"The real problem with Brexit talks is there are hardliners on both sides","bodyText":"Will the October summit of EU heads of government deem that “sufficient progress” has been made in the UK’s talks on leaving the EU? Britain hopes for a positive answer, so that negotiations can move on from the exit process to the future relationship. But the EU institutions expect a negative. The main blockage is that the two sides are so far apart on money. The EU, though asking for the British to pay up to €100bn (£90bn), would be happy to receive around €60bn – most of which would be the UK’s share of the EU’s unspent budgetary commitments. Britain accepts that it must pay something but has made no offer. The EU does not want a precise number at this stage, but an agreement on how to calculate the bill, so that it can be sure of getting most of what it hopes for. Behind the scenes, top UK and EU officials have discussed a compromise that could unblock the separation talks. Yet hardliners on both sides are preventing the negotiators from moving towards a deal. The key to the compromise is that the UK must ask for a transition, to cover the period between when it leaves the EU and when the new trading and other arrangements take effect. The EU insists any transition be “off-the-shelf” rather than bespoke – meaning that it will resemble membership, except that the UK will have no vote. It would stay in the customs union and the single market, accept rulings of the European Court of Justice and pay money to the EU. If the UK asked for a three-year transition and agreed to pay €10bn a year (roughly what it pays today), that would cover a large part of its share of unspent EU budgetary commitments. That would also ensure no hole in the EU budget in 2019 and 2020, the last two years of the current seven-year budget cycle – which would be a great relief to the European Commission. The other bones of contention – such as Britain’s share of the EU’s contingent liabilities and pensions commitments – could be handed to expert committees, while the talks moved on to the future relationship. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, back the principles of such a deal. So do some of the EU’s most senior negotiators and the French government. But there are difficulties with the sequencing. The UK cannot make a generous offer on money – which will be controversial at home, even if sold as “buying access to the single market” – without being sure the EU will immediately respond with talks on a free trade agreement and a transition. But the EU will not consider that until it sees a solid offer from Davis. The sequencing can be fixed with a bit of creativity and goodwill from each side. The real problem is that both teams of negotiators have to contend with hardliners in their own camps. May’s government is not yet ready to make a significant offer on money. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, is not the only minister reluctant to sign away tens of billions of pounds as the price for Brexit. Nor can the government agree on the kind of transition it wants. The realist ministers know that any transition will be on the EU’s terms. But ardent Brexiters are unwilling to swallow several more years of free movement, ECJ rulings and the EU rulebook. May seems to be taking her time to knock heads together (or to work out what she herself wants). And even if Britain were to make a generous offer in September, there would be no guarantee of a favourable response from Michel Barnier, the commission’s chief negotiator. One faction in the commission says that if the British are ready to pay €30bn towards their outstanding obligations, very good. But then if they want access to the single market during the transition, they must pay extra for that privilege – just like Norway pays for it (almost as much as the UK, per capita). This appeals to a number of governments, including Belgium. Many of them will find it hard to compromise on money: Brexit means that net contributors will have to pay more into the EU budget, and net recipients are likely to receive less. British diplomats believe the EU’s rigid decision-making procedures will make it hard for Barnier to respond positively to a serious British offer. The European council may need to intervene. Their problem is that May has no close friends among the heads of government in that body. She and her senior ministers lack warm relationships with the influential French and German governments. In the long run, both sides’ moderates are likely to win. Otherwise there won’t be a deal, which would be bad for the EU (it would get no British money) and disastrous for the British economy. If May wishes to move the Brexit talks forward, to discuss the future relationship, she needs to back the realists in her cabinet and make some bold offers to encourage the more moderate EU governments. • Charles Grant is director of the Centre for European Reform"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/aug/28/online-identity-theft-fraud-security-password","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T11:00:32Z","webTitle":"Your online identity is precious.

Here’s how to protect it","bodyText":"You’ll never have more ideas about how to protect your identity than the minute after you realise it’s been stolen. Suddenly, you can see in painful detail all the doors left unlocked and breadcrumbs scattered across the internet for a hungry thief to find. It’s a strange reality that there are people who will lock, alarm, and stress about their front door at home but blithely post sensitive information online that is in effect the key to their accounts. We should all be guarding our information with the feverish paranoia of a top-ranking politician with a whole family of skeletons in the closet. Because no matter who you are, there are people who’d benefit from stealing your identity, and right now they know a lot more about it than you do. Admittedly, some of the holes in online information security are absolutely not your fault. Surprising numbers of household-name companies use poor or even actively unhelpful security protocols. But this is zero comfort when you’ve been hijacked, so while it’s not always your fault, it’s still your responsibility to protect yourself. Fiercely. 1. Don’t play social media games One of the most notorious information security holes is the secret question and answer. What was your first rabbit’s middle name? Which footballer did you least want to be when you grew up? These kinds of checks are very weak in terms of security, and are often the tool used to crack open people’s accounts. You could have the most secure password in the world, but if you’ve filled in the name of your high school on your LinkedIn profile and that’s one of your security answers … we have a problem. Predictably, your secret answers are a common target for ID thieves – and the ways they go about getting them are so sneaky they’re almost impressive. For instance, it’s a common game on social networks to post your “porn-star name,” “Brexit name” and so on, which usually involves combining something like the name of your first teacher with the place you met your partner. While “Hagrid McDonald’s” might seem hilarious to you, the criminals are also laughing – because you’ve just given them the answers to two commonly asked security questions. 2. Don’t take dodgy online quizzes People love to take online tests that say something about them, and post the results on their social media. It’s easy to see why: they have intriguing titles like “What will your last words be?” These require you to log in or “authenticate” using one of your accounts, usually Facebook. It’ll be explained as “we just need to see your posts to guess your last words” – but connecting the site to your Facebook account gives them (limited) access. Do you know who runs the site? Because you’ve just handed them a bunch of your information. One way to check trustworthiness is to look at the URL (internet address) the quiz came from before you click it – if it’s not a recognised, reputable name (like Buzzfeed), don’t take the risk. But malicious sites can also disguise their web addresses, so if you can avoid it, it’s best not to do those quizzes at all. 3. Don’t accept friend requests from strangers Every time you accept a friend request on Facebook, you’re giving them access to every status update you’ve ever made. If you don’t know the person, or not well, that could cause problems for you if they ever turn malicious. LinkedIn is particularly bad for requests from random people. Even if you have no rogue agents in your connections, five years from now a vengeful ex with too much time on their hands could sift through your Facebook posts – or, even easier, search them for relevant keywords – and find what they need to get their hands on your identity. So give your friends list a severe pruning, then go to the security settings and set all previous posts to “friends only”. This ensures there aren’t any public posts lurking about that a dedicated thief could find. 4. Delete old posts In a perfect world, it’d be great to go through all your past Facebook updates and delete anything that could be used against you – bearing in mind that even something like a screenshot of an ancient tweet where you called someone an offensive name can be problematic – but since most of us won’t find the time, there’s a lower-effort fix. Facebook has a daily memories feature called On This Day that shows you what you posted on this day every year since you started using the site. Take this as your daily prompt to review your posts: every day, check for things that might – in the most paranoid possible light – become problematic later. Then delete them. 5. Use a password manager We all know not to use the same password for every site, but we’re still humans who have trouble remembering scores of random character strings – and that puts us at risk. Brianna Wu, a well-known coder and games developer, who has had to get very good at protecting herself online after being targeted countless times, says that “everyone should download either 1Password or LastPass and start making random passwords for every site. My suggestion is, next time you get a phone or a computer, start fresh and change account passwords as you add them. “If you’re a person of any degree of prominence, you have to get very paranoid about who you give information to,” says Wu. “I was one of the primary targets of Gamergate, a hate group targeting women speaking out for inclusion in the videogame industry. Gamergate was the prototype for what became the alt-right. “I’ve had hacking attempts on my bank account. I’ve had my Apple ID hacked, and had to work with Apple to get it back. I’ve had people send me links to spoofed websites, trying to get me to enter personal information. Even if you’re not a target today, you never know where you’ll be in five years. It’s best to start these habits now.” 6. Turn on two-factor authentication It might have an awkward name, but two-factor authentication (or 2FA, or TFA) is a way of adding an extra layer of security to your accounts. When you log in, you get a one-time passcode sent to your mobile phone – or even better, an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator (people’s phones are sometimes hijacked to steal the code – Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson was a target, for example). Alternatively, some people use a separate phone or number to receive the code: Wu says: “I carry two cell phones. One is the number I give people – the second is my two-factor authentication phone, which I have never shared with anyone.” If you lose the phone or no longer have access to the app, you can get backup codes from all the services that offer 2FA (which is most of them: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and so on). Since you may not have access to your online services in the event of a hack, don’t store the backup codes there. It’s best to print them and hide them somewhere physical that no one else can access. 7. Don’t be scared out of doing anything All this security doom-mongering can be very off-putting, because it sounds big and scary and unfixable. But realistically, it’s rare for people to fall victim to persistent targeted attacks – they’re usually more opportunistic (unless, of course, you’re prominent or controversial in some way, or have a desirable username on a popular service). • Holly Brockwell is a freelance technology journalist and editor of Gadgette, an online magazine about tech"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"crosswords/2017/sep/04/annotated-solutions-for-genius-170","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-03T23:01:03Z","webTitle":"Annotated solutions for Genius 170","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2017/sep/04/annotated-solutions-for-genius-170","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/2017/sep/04/annotated-solutions-for-genius-170","fields":{"headline":"Annotated solutions for Genius 170","bodyText":"* The middle letters of the central down solution, followed by the seven words running clockwise round the circumference of the grid from the top left-hand corner spell out Puck’s words in A Midsummer-Night’s Dream: ‘I’ll put a girdle round about the earth …’ 1 aeon A/E/ON 2 airs AIR/S(oprano) 3 babushka B(ishop)/A/BUSH/KA(te) 4 Barr BAR/R(un) [Epstein-Barr virus] 5 Bissau chihuahUA’S SIBkings (hidden rev) 6 brio B(I/R)O 7 emergent GENT(s) after E  R 8 enamelware MEL in AREA/NEW (anag) 9 Esau E(astern)/(bis)SAU 10 even-handed EVE/N(ame)/HANDED 11 ghat G(ood)/HAT 12 hoax HO(ur)/A(nswer)/X 13 honorarium (f)OR 1 MAN-HOUR (anag) 14 inched (p)INCHED 15 invalidate IN + TV L(icenc)E AIDA (anag) 16 keen KE&lt;(needl)E&gt;N [Barbie’s boyfriend] 17 letter bomb LETTER + BO  B 18 marmot TOM/RAM (rev) 19 moot M(edical)O(fficer)/O(ld)T(estament) 20 nutshell NUTS/HE’LL 21 politician Polly/Titian (hom) 22 Real warwickshiRE ALlegedly [Real Madrid] 23 RICO eccentRIC Only (hidden) [1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] 24 televisual LEVIS in A LUTE (anag) 25 terminated (Hilary)TERM + END IT A (anag) 26 tierce C(hurch of)E(ngland)/ after TIER 27 trio T(ennis)/RIO 28 unlit UN  IT 29 uxorious (l)UXOR/(p)IOUS 30 Villa double def + VILLA(in) [Aston Villa]"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2017/aug/27/england-emily-scarratt-final-tv-peak-audience-black-ferns-rugby-union","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T20:59:15Z","webTitle":"England’s Emily Scarratt calls for TV to capitalise on final spectacle | Gerard Meagher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/27/england-emily-scarratt-final-tv-peak-audience-black-ferns-rugby-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/aug/27/england-emily-scarratt-final-tv-peak-audience-black-ferns-rugby-union","fields":{"headline":"England’s Emily Scarratt calls for TV to capitalise on final spectacle","bodyText":"If the gloom that surrounded England’s World Cup final defeat by New Zealand was inescapable, solace can be found in the silver linings that followed. A first women’s final to be broadcast on free-to-air TV attracted a peak audience of 2.6 million viewers, who were treated to a spectacle so high on drama and skill, not even Madison Avenue’s finest could have dreamt up a better advert for the game. Eleven tries, two yellow cards and a lead that repeatedly changed hands were the headlines in a final that meant England were deposed as world champions, New Zealand returning to the throne. It was bitterly disappointing for England, who were rampant in the first half, leading 17-5 at one stage and by seven at half-time but who were unable to deal with the Black Ferns’ second-half blitz. There was however, defiance in defeat. If this was women’s rugby’s day in the sun, it must not become another false dawn – soon to fade into the shadows until the next World Cup. Saturday’s prime-time slot must not go down as England’s 15 minutes of fame. It is a familiar refrain but Emily Scarratt, England’s heroic full-back who contributed just as much as anyone to their first-half ascendancy, went further and led calls for free-to-air broadcasters to demonstrate their long-term commitment. “The World Cup final was live on free-to-air TV and it would be awesome for that to start to happen with all our games, not just the biggest one there is,” she said. “I know that is a leap and we have to take the small steps in between but it is growing. This was the biggest springboard we could possibly have had and we have to make sure we push on from it and that it keeps getting driven and doesn’t drop off until the next World Cup when it spikes again. That’s the challenge. “It’s not something we’re totally in control of – that’s the people behind the desks doing the posh jobs.” The climax to a World Cup often feels like the end of the road but for this England side it is doubly so. Much has been made of the RFU’s decision to end a number of XVs contracts and instead shift the focus to sevens with the Commonwealth Games, Rugby Sevens World Cup and the Tokyo Olympics all on the horizon. It leaves a number of players with uncertain futures and Saturday night’s defeat all the more difficult to stomach – in the World Cup bubble, headaches like that can be put to one side. “Everyone knew where they stood. Some people still don’t know what they are doing yet,” said Scarratt. “People need some time to go away on holiday and reflect on what has been an immensely intense competition and look at what they want next season to look like for them. We had our blinkers on and things didn’t distract us.” On the night, England can have few excuses with what is now a fourth World Cup final defeat by New Zealand. They may have been the only professional side in the tournament but as the New Zealand captain, Fiao’o Faamausili, said, “we breathe rugby back home”. It was the Black Ferns who struck first down the right through their full-back Selica Winiata but England roared back, first with a penalty try, then with Lydia Thompson’s score in the corner. New Zealand’s loosehead prop Toka Natua ended up with a hat-trick, the first of which was pivotal considering it came just before the break. Her second brought New Zealand level and the Black Ferns were ahead when Charmaine Smith drove into the right-hand post. England edged back in front with a remarkable wing’s finish from Thompson but Natua soon had her third before Kendra Cocksedge and Winiata put the result beyond doubt. “From a coaching point of view there were things you’d rather not be happening,” said the England head coach, Simon Middleton. “But the buzz in the stadium, that is absolutely critical for the women’s game. In the World Cup final you need a game of that quality to really engage the crowd and people watching on TV.” Izzy Noel-Smith added some respectability late on to the 41-32 scoreline but, truth be told, England could not live with New Zealand after the break. They refused to entertain the idea that their semi-final against France – a more energy-sapping contest that New Zealand’s against the USA – was to blame but Scarratt did say that four days off in between, as part of a schedule in which all sides played five matches in 18 days, was far from ideal. “I think it will be tough, obviously more time would be amazing,” she said. “But it’s tough in terms of how our game is run at the moment, we get on with it. We’re well used to it but I think everybody would like a bit more time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2017/aug/27/real-madrid-v-valencia-la-liga-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T22:09:10Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid v Valencia: La Liga – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/aug/27/real-madrid-v-valencia-la-liga-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/aug/27/real-madrid-v-valencia-la-liga-live","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid v Valencia: La Liga – as it happened","bodyText":"So, there we go; thanks all for your company, enjoy what’s left of your weekend, and goodnight.

But Neto leaps right and pushes the ball against the post! 90 min There shall be four added minutes. 88 min What a miss Benzema! Vasquez scampers down the right and crosses towards Asensio; he fancies himself a hat-trick, but Vezo blocks well and then, from eight yards, in front of goal, Benzema passes wide! He has missed four sitters tonight! 88 min Rodrigo departs; I didn’t quite see who arrived. Ah, it was none other than Santi Mina. 87 min Asensio has been quiet this half, but my days he’s making up for it now. He leaps, flicks out a leg, and somehow transfers the ball from waist-height into his stride, streaks away down the left, and crosses low towards the near post; Benzema arrives and turns over the top. 86 min Looking at that free-kick again, Asensio hit just hard enough; the ball bounced almost immediately it crossed the line. He gauges distance, angle and power brilliantly. 84 min Soler trips Kovacic and is booked. Valencia must keep the heid now. Mayoral replaces Kroos, who’s had better nights. Another brilliant hit! He smacks a sidefooter around the wall, just over the head of Soler who shows it his arse, and the ball speeds past Neto and inside the far post. What a talent this kid is! 81 min Kovacic eases away from Rodrigo, who trips him just outside the box; he’s booked. Free-kick, 22 yards out, right of the D; will it be Kroos or Asensio? 80 min Modric, given time on the ball, slides down the right to Vasquez, but his cross is cut out and cleared. 79 min Madrid don’t look like scoring, but they probably will because that’s what they do. Well! Another raid down the left, Gaya crossing low and hard, and when Zaza worried Nacho the ball broke to Kondogbia following up on the edge of the box. He composed himself and passed a left-footer low into the corner; that’s a fine finish, and well-earned rewards for Valencia’s discipline and enterprise. 75 min Change for Valencia: Vidal on for Montoya. 74 min Lucas Vasquez replaces Bale; he’s been disappointing, and won’t be in the side when everyone’s available. 73 min ...Parejo doesn’t waste any time, smacking a sidefooter towards the far top corner, which Navas flies after, palming behind. The corner comes to nowt. 72 min Carvajal is late on Gaya, and is booked; free-kick Valencia, 25 yards out, left of centre... 71 min Soler arcs a cross into the box, finding Zaza at the near post; he heads ineptly over the top, believe it or not. 71 min Carvajal slings over a dangerous cross, which Neto dives into; good keeping. 69 min Lovely ball down the channel for Rodrigo, and he’s got Zaza in the middle! He looks to pivot and square, but Casemiro does just enough. Valencia look threatening almost every time they attack; they’re just not getting to attack very often. 67 min Parejo looks to challenge Kroos, sticking out a leg from an upright position but with studs showing. This earns him a yellow card, which seems harsh to me; not in England, etcetera etcetera. 66 min Another delectable cross from Marcelo, this time picking out Bale. He soars into the air, looks for all the world like he’s about to score, then glances his header wide. 64 min Valencia send Madrid shuttling backwards and forwards. They’ll take that. 62 min Gaya crosses well from the left, Zaza can’t reach the ball, but Kondogbia can! He heads downwards, but towards his feet downwards, and has a right result when the flag goes up. 60 min Soler runs across Casemiro, who scissors him; he’s booked, which looks a little harsh. It was a foul, but not a dangerous one and 40 yards from goal. 59 min Kroos diddles Soler by the left by-line, so Soler ploughs through him; he’d already committed to the slide. The free-kick is aimless, and headed away. 58 min Madrid are all over Valencia now, but not creating much clear-cut. Which is to say that Valencia are well-drilled and composed; look, there’s Zaza heading yet another corner away! 56 min Brilliant from Modric, ghosting into the box between Lato and Kondogbia and collecting Carvajal’s pass on his chest before lashing over the top. 54 min Nacho is booked for jumping in the back of someone; my picture fuzzed out, so I didn’t quite see who, but you get the gist. 53 min As so often, Marcelo is Madrid’s outlet, and he arcs a lovely cross into the box which Benzema tries to allow across his foot so that he can guide into the far corner. He doesn’t judge it right, though, and that’s another chance missed. 51 min Marcelo wins a corner down the left, but again Kroos’ delivery is careless, the ball pumped into the box and headed clear. 50 min Casemiro ambles forward and with no one mithering to mither, hits a shot which hops and skips past the far post; Neto barely rouses himself to interfere. 50 min I think Kovacic replaced (Let’s All Have An) Isco. 49 min Marcelo races past Montoya who trips him; he’s booked. 48 min In the bit of time I didn’t have a picture, we learnt that Kovacic came on; I’m not quite sure who for, but bear with me. 46 min We start again, just as Sky dips out, skips some times and returns. That was a very nice bit of the old soccer, featuring two lovely goals. It looked a bit easy for Madrid to begin with, well though Valencia acquitted themselves, but the equaliser gave them a boost and an end-to-end game ensued. The second half should be just as good. 45 min Isco finds space on the right and lays back to Kroos who, from the edge of the box floats over a lovely cross for Benzema! He’s in bare hectares! But he takes his eye off the ball and glances wide! 44 min Somehow that Sky glitch which took about two minutes appears to have stolen eight minutes of football. Apologies. 43 min Bale shows up on the left and curls in a cross which Murillo goes to clear, missing; Benzema expected him to, though, so can’t adjust his feet when the ball arrives at them, kneeing wide instead. 35 min I’m sticking this in because my Sky helpfully cut out. I’m imagining an outside of the foot stroke. 32 min Madrid have upped it again, Asensio skating down the left and snapping a cut-back for Marcelo; he winds up big, wipes his foot across the ball, and smashes high and wide. 32 min Nice from Isco, winning a corner off Vezo; Zaza heads it clear. 31 min Also, if Bale joined one of the top few Premier League teams, he’d turn whichever it was into champions. 31 min “Re: Bale. A fine player, but his greatest strength at Spurs was the regularity with which he could pop up in the 89th minute and pop a screamer in the top corner to win a game 2-1,” reckons Matt Loten. “Particularly in that final season. A wonderful skill to have, to be sure, but less of a necessity in his current team.” That’s true, and he also needs space in behind, ideally - not so much of that, playing for Madrid. I’m sure he’d be better on the left, though, problem being the others in the road. 30 min I’d add a “parabolic” to this. 28 min Marcelo slides a pass down the left for Modric, who crosses low, but can only pick out Neto. 27 min Valencia are a really quick, enterprising team, and they play with the conviction of youth. Can’t wait for the patter about which “bigger club” will ravage them first. 25 min “2009 Man United, the team that scraped a CL final penalty win, as the standard of comparison? The one that the next two times they reached a CL final were utterly outclassed by Barcelona? The Mods should scold you for trolling an MBM.” So says Gene Salorio, who seems to have forgotten that they won three titles in a row when the Premier League was good, beating the Chelsea team who Barcelona only beat with the help of an avant-garde refereeing performance, beat an excellent Chelsea team to win the Champions League, reached three Champions League finals in four seasons, had Cristiano Ronaldo and one the finest defences that the competition has ever seen. But I actually mentioned them because they were the team that Guardiola’s Barcelona beat to win their two Big Ears. 23 min I’m not sure if this is permanent or temporary, but he has the makings of a player. I’m surprised United are letting him away; there’ll be games Herrera will get that he could’ve had. 21 min This is pretty nifty game now, and Benzema zips towards the box, left-hand side, and finds Bale by the penalty spot, whose one-touch return is guided into his stride. But the angle is tight, and he lashes high into the side netting. 20 min Madrid are annoyed, and Marcelo bounds down the left, crosses, and Murillo concedes a corner. Kroos’ cross is better this time, but Kondogbia heads away nonetheless. As I was saying, Gaya does really well down the left, moving away from goal then sliding a pass outside him to Lato. His cross is low and hard, allowing Soler to fly into the box, allow the ball across his body, and punch home the equaliser. 17 min Sometimes you see a team who are just so confident it’s ridiculous; I’m thinking of Arsenal at the start of 2002-03, when they just mullered everyone and everything they tried came off. That’s Madrid now. 14 min Valencia are trying their best. 13 min What’s incredible about Asensio isn’t just his technical ability, but his decision-making. And he’s so natural in possession. 12 min I wonder for how long Asensio will accept not being first choice. Or who will make way for him. Assensio is so, so good! He picks up the ball in midfield when Rodrigo makes an error, sashays inside Kondogbia, and with men either side, leans right and shoots with his left to smash-caress a curling sidefooter into the far corner that’s so perfect it almost looks like it’s missed. 8 min Watching Bale for Madrid minds me of watching Tevez for Manchester United. He’s good, obviously, but technically he’s a level below his team-mates. 7 min Bale, who always looks awkward on the right, takes the ball off Modric and wins a corer off Montoya. Kroos’ corner is headed clear at the near post. 6 min Valencia raid down the left, briefly. Lato crosses, directly into the midriff of Carvajal, two yards away, and Madrid clear. 3 min Back to the greatest discussion I was having with myself, you judge a team in part by the standard of its opponents, and Madrid haven’t beaten anyone as good as the United of 2009 and maybe not as good as the Madrid of that era either. 2 min Asensio bothers Vezo, who knees the ball into his arm. He does very well to avoid conceding a penalty - I’d have given one, and what other standard is there? 2 min So where do this lot stand in the pantheon? are they the best of the Champions League era simply by virtue of what they’ve achieved? I’d say not... 2 min Big news chums! Madrid are knocking the ball about confidently! 1 min Away we go! Ramos and Marcelo lift the La Liga trophy, this being the first hoe game since it was won; Mr Bolam or anyone else, does that work? Or is it the Liga trophy? I do not know. Also, it seems that Kylian Mbappe is going to PSG. Who says romance is dead? I just read that Liverpool are trying to buy Renato Sanches. He’s not really what they need - though I guess if he’s as good as he’s threatened to be he’s what any team needs - and he’s a lot of fun. “Nuestros (plural, agrees with noun in both gender and number) equipos,” chides David Bolam. I wondered about that, my Spanish being non-existent. Thank you. Whenever I see Getafe written down, I think of this. Elsewhere, Sevilla have taken a late lead at Getafe. You won’t believe it but it’s true: the only goal in that win was scored by Simone Zaza. Valencia, who beat Las Palmas last week, leave out Vilda and Cancelo; they’re replaced by Kondogbia, freshly borrowed from Inter, and Murillo. In the absence of Ramos, Zinedine Zidane shoves Casemiro into the back-four, allowing Isco to play in midfield rather than off the flank. In the absence of Ronaldo, Bale and Asensio fill those roles, so that might just be ok. Real Madrid (4-3-3, 4-2-3-1, whatever they fancy): Navas; Carvajal, Casemiro, Nacho, Marcelo; Kroos, Modric, Isco; Asensio, Benzema, Bale. Subs: Casilla, Theo, Lucas Vasquez, Llorente, Mayoral, Kovacic. Valencia (a Nevillian 4-4-2): Neto; Montoya, Vezo, Murillo, Lato; Carlos Soler, Parejo, Kondogbia, Gaya; Rodrigo, Zaza! Subs: Jaume, Garcia, Maksimovic, Vidal, Gil, Medran, Mina. It’s been a quiet start to the domestic season, so of course we’re all even more amped than usual for international weekend. But before we surf our buzz, first we must harsh it; such is life. So eyes down for the small matter of the world’s best side, competing against a long-standing rival. These things are sent to test us.

The Belgian Grand Prix was yet another chapter that added fascinating depth to the rapidly approaching finale. Lewis Hamilton won the race, continuing the sequence this season that has seen no single driver take back-to-back wins. Proof in itself how the advantage has swung between the lead protagonists Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, who was second in Spa. But while the pair went wheel to wheel only twice over the 44 laps, their battle was absolutely intense, lasted the full distance and, crucially, was telling in how the remainder of the season might unfold after Hamilton narrowed the gap to his rival to just seven points. The pair had not engaged in a duel that saw them repeatedly exchanging places but it had been very much a hard-fought battle that was appreciated by the crowd of 100,000 in the Ardennes. Hamilton, in his 200th grand prix, had led from pole to take his 58th career win and that pole – equalling Michael Schumacher’s record of 68 – turned out to be absolutely crucial given how closely matched the pair were. Vettel remained within a second and a half of Hamilton for almost the entire race, demonstrating a pace that puts the Ferrari much closer to Mercedes on a circuit that was expected to strongly favour the characteristics of Hamilton’s car. On the opening lap Vettel almost made it tell, coming alongside Hamilton on the Kemmel Straight but the British driver held his nerve and a defensive line, keeping the lead into Les Combes. After a safety car restart Vettel tried again in the same place but once again was thwarted. He could stay with the British driver but not pass. Hamilton acknowledged how tough a meeting it had been. “They have put in a fantastic fight,” he said. “The speed and pace they had was very strong. There was no point at which I was comfortable. Both of us were pushing for every single lap. It was like a sprint race, no room for error or the smallest mistake. There were strengths and weaknesses on both sides, we were constantly exchanging times.” Vettel also enjoyed their tense tussle at the front. “It was a very good race, good fun,” he said. “The quality was very high but I never really had a chance. Maybe half a chance, quarter of a chance but the positive thing is that we had very good race pace. Overall the car was very good.” The low-downforce, high-speed and sweeping fast corners of Spa had been expected to benefit Mercedes with their car designed to be optimal on such circuits, as they proved at Silverstone. But Ferrari have clearly moved forward since the British Grand Prix. Vettel stayed with Hamilton from the flag, ultimately leaving the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo, who was third, fourth-placed Kimi Raikkonen and fifth-placed Valtteri Bottas in their wake. Vettel had his second chance after a safety car prompted by yet another clash between the two Force India drivers, Sergio Pérez squeezing Esteban Ocon into the wall on the run down to Eau Rouge, prompting Ocon to warn that the Mexican driver had risked their lives. The free pit stops it afforded were opportune for both the leaders, with Vettel able to take the quicker ultrasoft tyres, having an unused set. Hamilton had criticised race control for the deployment, accusing them of trying to engineer a closer battle but he later admitted that this had been prompted by frustration because of the five laps spent behind the safety car. But the stop was also beneficial for Mercedes who had been concerned about a blister on his right rear tyre, an issue solved with the stop. They were also confident that could he survive the restart in front of Vettel, the soft compound tyre would be stronger to the end and so it proved. Having seen off the attack at Les Combes once more, Hamilton took the flag by 2.3 seconds. There was ultimately nothing to choose between them as Hamilton acknowledged and he expected the same for the remaining eight races. “It was fun to be racing against Sebastian at his best and the car at its best,” he said. “I think they had the better pace today but fortunately I was able to just stay ahead. From today it looks like it is going down to the wire, the difference could be in the pendulum swinging a millimetre either way.” He will take heart that the gap in the championship is but a chink, while F1 heads to Monza next week, another track at which Mercedes could expect to be strong but where they can take nothing for granted, as Vettel noted. “We were nearly a second off in Silverstone. So it’s a big step. I’m very, very happy. I think we are on the right track and I don’t think we have a circuit we should fear from now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/27/toddler-found-dead-at-manchester-house-a-day-after-domestic-incident","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T13:16:07Z","webTitle":"Toddler found dead at Manchester house a day after 'domestic incident'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/27/toddler-found-dead-at-manchester-house-a-day-after-domestic-incident","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/27/toddler-found-dead-at-manchester-house-a-day-after-domestic-incident","fields":{"headline":"Toddler found dead at Manchester house a day after 'domestic incident'","bodyText":"A toddler has been found dead 24 hours after police were called to a “domestic incident” at his home in Manchester. Police launched a murder investigation on Sunday after officers discovered the boy’s body at a house in Wythenshawe, in the south of the city. Officers responded to a report of a domestic disturbance just after midnight on Sunday, police said, but when they arrived a man and woman had left the house and gone to hospital. When they entered the property on Beaford Road, officers found the boy’s body. A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody. A woman was being treated for serious injuries in hospital. It was understood that detectives had not yet been able to speak to her. Supt John-Paul Ruffle, of Greater Manchester police, said officers had previously been called to a domestic incident at the property on Friday, 24 hours before the boy was found dead. Ruffle said: “We’ve had one previous domestic incident there, which was reported on the 25th of August. That investigation is still ongoing. “We have informed our professional standards branch and a referral will be made to the IPCC [Independent Police Complaints Commission], so I’m not going to be able to comment on that much further.” He said he could not say whether anyone had been arrested over that incident but added that it was an ongoing investigation. Ruffle said detectives were in the early stages of investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing. He did not confirm the age of the boy, saying only that he was a “young toddler”. Formal identification and a Home Office postmortem were yet to take place, police said. Supt Denise Worth said: “I know the community will be horrified and saddened to hear this tragic news this morning, and our thoughts at this time are with the family, friends and all others within the local community who may be affected by this incident. “I want to offer my assurances that we have launched a full murder investigation and have a team of detectives working to establish exactly what led to this young boy’s death. “Although we have made an arrest, the investigation is at the early stages and I would urge people not to speculate on this deeply distressing incident.” A cordon was in place around the modern semi-detached house in a quiet residential area. Neighbours said the family had lived there for about three months. A police van was outside the address, which appeared to be a rental property. A Volkswagen Polo car was parked on the drive of the house, inside the police cordon. Neighbours said they were woken by the sounds of sirens from police cars and ambulances shortly after midnight. One said: “I have seen a little boy play outside from time to time but I have never spoken to anyone who lives there. It’s a shock because this is a really quiet street.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/aug/27/police-and-support-staff-accused-of-racist-sexist-and-sectarian-tweeting","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T17:56:25Z","webTitle":"Police and support staff accused of racist, sexist and sectarian tweeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/27/police-and-support-staff-accused-of-racist-sexist-and-sectarian-tweeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/aug/27/police-and-support-staff-accused-of-racist-sexist-and-sectarian-tweeting","fields":{"headline":"Police and support staff accused of racist, sexist and sectarian tweeting","bodyText":"Around half a dozen police officers and support staff are under investigation in Northern Ireland over allegations that they posted racist, sexist and sectarian messages on Twitter and potentially prejudiced criminal inquiries, the Guardian has learned. The group is also being investigated for allegedly tweeting pictures of bottles of urine from inside a police vehicle and showing off their private parts beside guns. The Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed that an inquiry is under way in relation to the tweets, which have been running on the social media network for a year. PSNI assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton, who is in charge of the force’s professional standards department, told the Guardian: “I can confirm that PSNI is examining material posted on personal social media accounts by persons who may be serving police officers. “In response PSNI professional standards department has instigated disciplinary proceedings against one individual who has been identified as a serving officer. The review of the material is ongoing at this stage.” It is understood the six PSNI officers or civilian support staff under investigation are all based in the greater Belfast area. The tweets include wholly unfounded fake rumours of a sex tape involving a Northern Irish journalist with references to oral sex taking place in a doorway. Another journalist from a local Belfast radio station is referred to as a “cunt” in a different tweet. In another tweet, one of those alleged to have sent the messages brands the Catholic Lower Falls-Divis district of West Belfast as a place where “thieves operate... like fucking rabbits”. Beneath the message is a map of the district with a red circle drawn around it. Another post relating to the same district includes a photograph of a man alleged to have mugged a foreign tourist earlier this year. Security sources in Northern Ireland said that this tweet was sent out before any arrest was made in connection with the crime. In tweeting the suspect’s face, those responsible were in danger of prejudicing any upcoming trial in connection with the mugging, the sources said. There is also concern in security circles that those allegedly engaging with women online for sexual encounters could fall for “honey traps” set by armed republican dissident groups determined to kill PSNI members. Some of those behind the messages even engage in Twitter exchanges with Saoradh – the new political party that supports prisoners belonging to the New IRA terror group. The republican dissidents are taunted and told that “my colleagues sit in on your meetings &amp; private chats anyway. They fill me in.” The tweet end with the hashtag #C3, which is a reference to the PSNI’s anti-terrorist branch. A security force veteran based in Northern Ireland, who brought the tweets to the attention of the Guardian, said those behind this particular message had openly admitted to the republican dissidents that they are being monitored via electronic surveillance. Pictures of the interiors of heavily-fortified PSNI stations, including a CCTV monitoring station in Belfast, have also been tweeted in the stream being investigated. Other pictures of alleged crime suspects and convicted criminals sent include a message urging a prisoner to “put the rope up” and “hang yourself”. One security source said: “It’s wrong of me to use the term officer when talking about these individuals with multiple personalities, it’s an insult to the good and honourable officers who serve the community of Northern Ireland in a professional manner.” The organisation representing rank and file PSNI officers said the ongoing inquiry was a lesson for its 6,500-strong membership to be extremely cautious about using social media networks. Mark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, said: “We are fully aware of the advantages of using Twitter to communicate with others and, indeed, the wider community. It is a public forum, and we would urge our officers to exercise great care and caution in their use of all social media platforms. “There are dangers and pitfalls. There is also still a ‘severe’ threat to our officers and it’s essential for their own safety, and the safety of their colleagues, that officers realise the risks and take all necessary precautions to avoid unnecessary attention.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/27/tobe-hooper-appreciation-texas-chainsaw-massacre-american-family","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T11:57:44Z","webTitle":"Tobe Hooper: the director who took a chainsaw to wholesome family life | Peter Bradshaw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/27/tobe-hooper-appreciation-texas-chainsaw-massacre-american-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/27/tobe-hooper-appreciation-texas-chainsaw-massacre-american-family","fields":{"headline":"Tobe Hooper: the director who took a chainsaw to wholesome family life","bodyText":"Perhaps it was Wes Craven who offered the definitive comment on Tobe Hooper’s macabre masterpiece from 1974, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Craven called it “Mansonite” and in a spirit of dark humour he applied the adjective as much to the film’s creator as the thing itself. The director had invaded our minds with this diabolically horrible film and very much moved the furniture around in our skulls. This was the nightmarish story of a man called Leatherface who wears a gruesome mask and kills people with a variety of implements including a chainsaw. Like Norman Bates before, and Dr Hannibal Lecter afterwards, the grisly, skin-crawling, skin-flaying Leatherface had been taken from the real-life story of Ed Gein, the 50s serial killer who made trophies out of human remains. But it is not merely that Leatherface is an implacable, irrational and essentially motiveless killer: he is part of a secret family or cult within whose enclosed society these horrendous acts have become normalised as part of an evolved ritual. The point is that the “family”, so readily evoked as the benchmark of wholesome American normality, can be anything but. Families are private; families keep their own secrets; families mind their own business. In the wilderness, where outsiders are rare, where neighbours are 30 minutes’ drive away, and the uniformed forces of law and order further still, this can mean a great many things. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre became a locus classicus of the censorship and screen violence debates here when it was refused a certificate by the British Board of Film Classification upon its first release, and then in the 1980s, as the era of VCR and video rental dawned, had its brief video release cancelled along with many other ultraviolent provocations such as Hooper’s next film Eaten Alive (1977), Ruggero Deodato’s Cannibal Holocaust (1980), Wes Craven’s Last House On The Left (1972) — notably inspired by Ingmar Bergman’s Virgin Spring — and Meir Zarchi’s I Spit On Your Grave (1980). These became the much-feared, much-gloated-over “video nasties” and were refused certificates for two decades after this. But then, inevitably, the rules were relaxed and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre progressed to being a cult classic, a movie revered by new generations of directors. The masked figure became a staple of horror and of course The Texas Chainsaw Massacre featured that strangely persistent trope: the final girl, the young woman who achieves a queasy, Pyrrhic victory of survival, balanced against the monster’s own survival, an undiminished threat which, quite unlike any other movie genre, flavours the closing credits with that sense of non-ending, and open-ended fear and possible sequel. Tobe Hooper learned — or rather taught — a lesson which had been imbibed by other film-makers like George A. Romero and belatedly by Hitchcock himself. Pure low-budget horror can be a liberating challenge, and for a technically gifted director it offers the chance to unleash electrifyingly powerful forces within an audience. Another kind of film might hope, with a cleverly composed series of shots, to make its audience sigh, or laugh, or cheer or choke up with tears. A horror director, with approximately the same skillset, can get a colossally bigger payoff: a scream of horror, a yelp of fear that you will remember for the rest of your life. And a brilliant low-budget horror picture can turn huge profits, despite or because of the restrictions on distribution. The economics of horror, particularly in that era, created masterminds of genre cinema — like Tobe Hooper. As for censorship and violent movies, it has been many years since this was a hot-button issue, long since replaced by cyberbullying and grooming on social media. The most strident newspapers in the UK prefer now to pursue winnable campaigns and it has dawned us that these films are now readily available and civilisation as we know it has not come to an end. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, for all its guignol gore, actually showed less explicit horror than people imagined. Many people have ineradicable memories of first having seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as teenagers. I in fact saw it much later, as a student, so had maybe become a bit hardened — or liked to think so. The Tobe Hooper films which really did cause the evacuation of my living daylights were The Funhouse (1981) and Poltergeist (1982). Poltergeist is a brilliant, but atypical Tobe Hooper film about the ghosts in a brand new house belonging to a real estate developer. But the auteur-ist bragging rights arguably belong to Steven Spielberg who wrote and produced, and was himself in touch with the forces of B-movie darkness. The authentic slash of Hooper nastiness belongs to The Funhouse which I saw on video, and creeped me out most royally. Four attractive teens get trapped in a carnival, pursued by a horribly deformed killer. The scene in the ghost train in which one of them takes an axe to what they think is their pursuer is one of the most purely horrible, perhaps even evil things I have ever seen in a film. My callous friends all laughed heartily at it. I pretended to do the same. Perhaps I was not a natural audience for Hooper’s genius. But it has only just occurred to me that my friends were pretending too.

The move, worth tens of millions of pounds, is expected to be announced this week when the government launches its industrial strategy for the sector in Birmingham on Wednesday. However, there will not be an expansion of manufacturing. The investment will fund technical improvements at the packing site in Macclesfield, Cheshire. AstraZeneca’s £150m factory in Macclesfield produces breast cancer drugs such as Zoladex, one of the firm’s biggest-selling products. About 1,800 people work across the Macclesfield site. An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the move was “part of our ongoing investment in the UK”. Mene Pangalos, who runs its innovative medicines and early development biotech unit, is expected to announce the firm’s plans in Birmingham. AstraZeneca is not committing to manufacturing expansion in the UK as it waits for clarity on the government’s Brexit plans. Last month, its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said the company would “wait to see” before committing itself to further investment in Britain because of uncertainty in the pharmaceutical industry following the vote to leave the EU, in particular over the regulatory regime for new medicines. Drugmakers are worried that the approval of new drugs could take longer after Brexit, to the detriment of patients. The EU regulator, the European Medicines Agency, will relocate from London, with Amsterdam tipped as the most likely new base for the agency. Nineteen countries have applied to host the agency once the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, and a decision on the winner is due in November. In another blow to Britain, two major UK research organisations will lose much of their business to Amsterdam if the Netherlands is successful in its bid. Soriot said last month that AstraZeneca would carry on investing at its new £500m headquarters in Cambridge, where it will open a biomedical campus next year, which will be its biggest centre globally for cancer research. AstraZeneca’s latest plans will be announced when Sir John Bell, a Canadian-British immunologist, geneticist and Oxford University professor, lays out his proposals for the life sciences industry this week. His report, backed by the government, is expected to recommend new tax breaks and other support for the sector to boost research and exports of medicines, including an apprenticeship scheme. Last week, Britain’s pharma industry called on the government to fund the creation of four new centres of excellence for medicines manufacturing in Britain, at a cost of £140m. The Medicines Manufacturing Industry Partnership (MMIP) argued this would help plug gaps in areas such as diagnostics and packaging, advanced therapy production and small molecule processing, and create highly skilled jobs in the regions. Andy Evans, head of AstraZeneca’s Macclesfield operations, who chairs the MMIP, said: “The UK is already one of the best places in the world to research and develop exciting new medicines for hard-to-treat diseases, but needs to improve when it comes to manufacturing and packaging them ready to go to patients.” GlaxoSmithKline, Britain’s biggest drugmaker, recently said it would scale back its presence in Britain, the first major move by the company’s new chief executive, Emma Walmsle. The firm said it would sell its Horlicks UK brand, shut the Slough factory where the malt drink is made, ditch plans for a new biopharmaceutical factory in Cumbria, and outsource some manufacturing from its Worthing site in West Sussex, with the loss of 320 jobs in Britain. AstraZeneca has moved all its research and development from the Alderley Park laboratories in Macclesfield to Cambridge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/aug/27/notting-hill-carnival-begins-ceremony-remember-grenfell","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-27T11:36:33Z","webTitle":"Notting Hill carnival begins with ceremony to remember Grenfell victims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/aug/27/notting-hill-carnival-begins-ceremony-remember-grenfell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/aug/27/notting-hill-carnival-begins-ceremony-remember-grenfell","fields":{"headline":"Notting Hill carnival begins with ceremony to remember Grenfell victims","bodyText":"The victims of the Grenfell disaster have been remembered as Notting Hill carnival got under way in the shadow of the tower. White doves were released into the sky as a mark of respect and a multi-faith prayer was held at the beginning of the UK’s biggest street festival. The ceremony, held by survivors of the fire and local residents, was described as a “small act of remembrance” at an event taking place within a few hundred metres of the scene of the tragedy. Hamid Ali Jafari, whose 82-year-old father, Ali Yawar Jafari, died in the fire, was among those who participated and said he was glad to be at the carnival. Asked how it felt to release one of the doves, he said: “It’s the pain of remembering my dad, because he was there.” The survivors were joined by the new leader of the local council, which has been heavily criticised for its handling of the disaster, and the Labour MP Emma Dent Coad, in whose parliamentary constituency it took place. She addressed the audience, calling them the “Grenfell generation”. Dent Coad said: “Today is a day to set aside our burden of sadness, and enjoy some real joy with our families, our friends and our amazing community, which the world now knows about – though it’s always been here, we know that. “Today, carnival is for you. Set aside your sadness and worries, smile, dance and sing along. And we will have the most wonderful, musical, colourful and lovable carnival ever. Remember you are the Grenfell generation, and you are special.” London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, met some of the survivors in a specially reserved area, shaking their hands and hearing about their housing situations 10 weeks after the fire. “Over this carnival weekend, we pledge to redouble our efforts to support this community,” he told the crowd. “We make sure we have in our thoughts and our prayers all of those affected by the awful Grenfell Tower tragedy. Part of that pledge is making sure we get justice, we find out exactly what happened, we make sure those responsible are held to account, and also so this never, ever, ever happens again.” Elizabeth Campbell, who took over as leader of the council after Nick Paget-Brown resigned, was among those to release a dove into the air. The bishop of Kensington, the Right Rev Dr Graham Tomlin, helped lead the prayers at the official opening ceremony of the two-day event. He offered three prayers of hope, harmony and healing. “My prayer is that, in these two days, God will give us his rest, his hope, his harmony and his ear.” The crowd fell silent during a performance of Bridge Over Troubled Water by Brenda Emmanuel. Another musical tribute, by Alexander D Great, included the lines: “Pray for mothers, pray for babies, pray for all whose cries are in our ears.” Handmade green hearts and streamers adorned the judging area, while spectators were decked out in green following a campaign encouraging people to go “green for Grenfell”, which organisers said they hoped would symbolise “reverence and respect amidst the revelry”. Posters have been put up at spots where the tower can be seen, asking the public not to take photographs “at the site of our great loss” – an activity that has distressed locals. At 3pm on both Sunday and Monday, the crowds are expected to pause and observe a minute’s silence. In the quiet reflection zone, performers have been encouraged to lower their music volume and walk respectfully in memory of those who died in the inferno. Police have also said a dedicated area will be available for people to leave tributes without obstructing the carnival flow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2017/aug/28/deadpool-star-ed-skrein-quits-hellboy-reboot","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T19:58:36Z","webTitle":"Deadpool star Ed Skrein quits Hellboy reboot after whitewashing controversy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/28/deadpool-star-ed-skrein-quits-hellboy-reboot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/aug/28/deadpool-star-ed-skrein-quits-hellboy-reboot","fields":{"headline":"Deadpool star Ed Skrein quits Hellboy reboot after whitewashing controversy","bodyText":"Deadpool actor Ed Skrein has quit the upcoming Hellboy reboot after his casting was met with controversy. The 34-year-old British rapper turned actor, also known for a role in Game of Thrones, was set to play Major Ben Daimio in the latest adaptation of the cult comic series. But the news was met with an outcry as the character had been drawn as Asian and the move was seen as another example of a Hollywood whitewash. “I accepted the role unaware that the character in the original comics was of mixed Asian heritage,” Skrein wrote in a statement released on Instagram and Twitter. “There has been intense conversation and understandable upset since that announcement and I must do what I feel is right.” In the same statement, Skrein explains that he has a “mixed heritage family” so is aware of the importance of representation within media. “It is clear that representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people and to neglect this responsibility would continue a worrying tendency to obscure ethnic minority stories and voices in the arts,” he writes. “I feel it is important to honor and respect that.” Hellboy producers Larry Gordon and Lloyd Levin have since made a joint statement with backers Lionsgate and Millennium to add their support. “Ed came to us and felt very strongly about this. We fully support his unselfish decision. It was not our intent to be insensitive to issues of authenticity and ethnicity, and we will look to recast the part with an actor more consistent with the character in the source material.” Skrein’s decision to leave the project arrives after a number of similar casting choices have led to upset, such as the choice to cast Tilda Swinton as Tibetan mentor the Ancient One in Doctor Strange and Scarlett Johansson leading manga adaptation Ghost in the Shell. After the news of his initial casting was revealed, Hellboy executive producer Christa Campbell came under fire for angrily responding to those who were displeased with the news. In a now-deleted tweet, she wrote: “Someone comes and does a great audition to get the role. Stop projecting your own shit onto us. We are all one. We don’t see colours or race.” The latest iteration of Hellboy will reboot the saga originally brought to the screen by Guillermo del Toro. The cast includes Stranger Things star David Harbour, Ian McShane and Milla Jovovich while The Descent’s Neil Marshall will direct. Skrein will next be seen in manga adaptation Alita: Battle Angel, produced by James Cameron."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/aug/29/morning-mail-disaster-unfolds-in-texas-and-louisiana","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T20:29:05Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: disaster unfolds in Texas and Louisiana","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/29/morning-mail-disaster-unfolds-in-texas-and-louisiana","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/aug/29/morning-mail-disaster-unfolds-in-texas-and-louisiana","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: disaster unfolds in Texas and Louisiana","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Mike Ticher, standing in for Eleanor Ainge Roy, bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 29 August. Top stories The full scale of the flooding disaster unfolding in Houston and across large parts of Texas and Louisiana is still emerging, as authorities warned that 30,000 people would be forced to seek shelter from an epic deluge of historic proportions after Hurricane Harvey. The death toll has now reached eight but fears remain for many more. The Houston police chief, Art Acevedo, told reporters on Monday 2,000 people had been rescued from flooding in the city, with many distress calls still waiting to be answered. Fears of destructive flooding have now also switched to the neighbouring state of Louisiana, where Donald Trump has issued a federal state of emergency. Trump is preparing to visit Texas and faces a major test of his presidency in how he reacts. Residents who escaped the rising waters have recounted terrifying stories of a flood beyond all their past experience, with “alligators coming up through the bayous”. Jennifer Shardlow told the Guardian how she had decided it was time to evacuate when water poured through the walls of her house and a snake swam through the kitchen. “I was sitting on a stool with the water up to my ankles when this snake swam by me. It ended up by the stove.” Follow further developments throughout the day on our live blog. The Law Council of Australia has hit back at Peter Dutton for describing lawyers who provide pro bono assistance to asylum seekers as “un-Australian”. The president of the council, Fiona McLeod SC, said she “utterly rejected” Dutton’s comments. “The Australian legal system reflects fundamental Australian values, including the right to have your case heard, the right to not be arbitrarily detained and the right not to be subjected to cruel or inhumane treatment,” McLeod said. Malcolm Turnbull’s government is at loggerheads with lawyers and refugee organisations over plans to strip several hundred asylum seekers and refugees of all government support before forcing them to return to Manus Island or Nauru, or their country of origin. The number of children’s bicycles imported into Australia for sale has fallen by 22%, prompting concern about children’s activity levels. Bicycle Industries Australia’s general manager, Peter Bourke, said the drop from 492,000 in 2007-08 to 382,000 in 2016-17 was concerning when considered alongside data from the Australian Cycling Participation survey, which found cycling participation among children under 10 declining. Prof Chris Rissel from the University of Sydney’s school of public health said the dramatic drop in sales was most likely caused by concerns about safety. A journal to be distributed at the Western Australian Liberal party’s state conference includes claims that the push for Indigenous recognition risks “more than 60% of the Australian continent”. The claim is made by the conservative historian Keith Windschuttle, who writes in an article titled “The Break-Up of Australia” that the long-term agenda of the Indigenous “political class” is to form an independent Indigenous government, or governments, that will control most of Australia. The journal also includes claims that feminists are relying on an “unholy trinity” of lies – about the gender pay gap, domestic violence and male privilege – to weave a web of misplaced victimhood. A British family of four have been rescued after the catamaran they were sailing in ran aground in heavy seas on a remote reef in the south Pacific Ocean, hundreds of kilometres north-east of New Zealand. The family, including two children aged 13 and 11, were rescued by the only other boat in the area, which was on its way to the remote island of Niue as part of a whale study. The skipper of the boat that came to their aid, Martin Vogel, said: “They were pretty distressed but they’re all sleeping now. Honestly, they’re coping remarkably well.” Sport In the first Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka, Australia continued to struggle on day two, reaching 217 in reply to the hosts’ 260 only thanks to dogged resistance from Ashton Agar and Pat Cummins. Bangladesh will resume on 45-1, having lost Soumya Sarkar just before the close to a memorably comic catch by Usman Khawaja. Follow our live blog of day three in what is building to a gripping Test match from 1.30pm AEST (2pm start). The US Open is under way at Flushing Meadow, with Australia’s Ashleigh Barty due on court later today against the 21st seed, Ana Konjuh of Croatia. Bryan Armen Graham has written a delightful hymn of regret to the Open’s main show court, Arthur Ashe Stadium, “the worst major sports venue in America”. Don’t be seduced by the aerial shots beaming glamour around the world, Graham writes. “Clumsy design, tepid atmosphere and just plain bad luck have all conspired to hasten Ashe’s life cycle from sparkling newcomer to loathsome dinosaur.” Thinking time The author Harriet McKnight argues that writers and other artists are drawn to the subject of dementia because it is the absolute unknowable. “What is it like to feel your brain give out beneath you? Where’s the final edge between the present and the past?” McKnight writes about her mother’s experience of her grandmother living with Alzheimer’s, which she used to inform her novel Rain Birds. “My mother says the real tragedy of the illness is that a person is stripped of all the details they know about themselves and left a shell on to which we project our own memories of them. They are suddenly only what other people think they are.” Micah White, co-creator of Occupy Wall Street, says protest in its current form is dead. How can Occupy, Black Lives Matter, Standing Rock, Charlottesville and countless other protests be celebrated as victories despite never achieving their avowed objectives? If activists want to bring about social change, they have to fundamentally rethink strategy and find a new way to engage in politics – electoral politics. As season seven of Game of Thrones ends, it has become commonplace to mock the increasing speed and improbability of events (even within the context of a fantasy that includes dragons and the living dead). The story is getting bigger, but it is not at all clear that it is getting better, writes Archie Bland (warning: article contains spoilers). “Principals are brought together with clanging expedience; deaths that would once have been show-stopping, or at least episode-ending, instead simply herald an ad break.” Yet for most it has not relinquished its hold – has it become too big to fail? What’s he done now? Donald Trump, no doubt preoccupied with the crisis in Texas and Louisiana, has found time only to retweet the thoughts of the rightwing commentator Dinesh D’Souza about the sources of violence on the streets of the US. “Finally, as if by accident, the @washingtonpost breaks down &amp; admits the truth about where the violence is coming from”, D’Souza tweeted, referring to a Washington Post story about antifa activists attacking rightwing protesters in Berkeley. Media roundup The Daily Telegraph claims that the Labor senator Katy Gallagher may be a citizen of Ecuador (a “tiny country famous for exotic Galapagos Island fauna” it adds, for no apparent reason). Gallagher has denied that she is. Fairfax papers say the proposed purchase of the Ten Network by CBS still has many hurdles to cross, with the US giant needing to convince creditors, courts and a federal regulator its bid is the best option for the company. And the Advertiser reports that an Adelaide school has banned students from ordering lunchtime food via Uber Eats on the grounds of potentially unsafe “interaction with adults without appropriate supervision or screening”. Coming up The federal court in Brisbane will hear a class action led by Hans Pearson, the uncle of the prominent Indigenous figure Noel Pearson, to reclaim the wages of hundreds of Indigenous people “stolen” by the Queensland government up until the early 1970s. About 300 claimants are requesting the payment of wages held in government trust accounts under laws controlling the earnings of Indigenous men, women and children between 1939 and 1972. Several of the accused in the alleged $165m tax fraud are expected to appear in court in Sydney. Among them are the former ATO deputy commissioner Michael Bede Cranston and his son Adam Cranston.

Over the past five decades no other urban area in the country has experienced as many casualties and property loss from flooding. In 2015, eight people died in what local media described as “historic flooding”. In 2016, what became known as the “tax day floods” saw three waterways in the city exceed their “500-year flood levels”. Six people died. The size of tropical storm Harvey – some experts estimate it has already dumped 12tn gallons of rain in Houston and south Texas – is unusual. But there is no single reason for the extent of the impact it has had at street level. “It’s a combination of factors,” said Sam Brody, a professor in the department of marine sciences at Texas A&amp;M University. “It’s a very low-lying coastal plain, with clay-based soils that do not drain very well. The city is subject to very heavy rainfall, as well as flooding from tidal events. “You take that flood-risk landscape and you put 6 million people on top, with prolific amount of pavement and roadways and a lack of collective and regional thinking about what that does to the natural drainage of that landscape, and you end up with disasters.” Brody – who himself has been trapped in his western Houston home for the past three days – said Houston’s rapid expansion is part of the problem. The city has added hundreds of square miles of pavement and vastly increased its housing stock, but the flooding infrastructure has, in some areas, not kept pace. “Many neighborhoods are still using roadside ditches as drainage. It’s like the Middle Ages almost,” Brody said. When the city experiences heavy rain – which happens a lot due to its humid subtropical climate – the water has nowhere to go. In new developments where modern drainage systems are installed, Brody said they are often “treating the symptoms, not addressing the underlying problem”. Those developments themselves might have systems in place to prevent them flooding. But those systems can involve channelling additional water into streams or bayous already at capacity. In severe storms that water can gush downstream and threaten older neighborhoods that traditionally may have been less prone to flooding. “We hear a lot from folks who have lived in one neighborhood for 20 or 30 years and they say: ‘I have never flooded before, I’m flooding,’” said Lisa Gonzalez, president and chief executive officer of the Houston Advanced Research Center – a not-for-profit which analyses energy, air and water issues. “When we’re making these development decisions in the Houston region we tend to think of it project by project, and they don’t really think of the cumulative impact of development as they’re making these decisions.” One of the reasons for the lack of joined-up thinking is that the metropolitan area of Houston is governed by nine different local county governments. Gonzalez said much of the tax income generated by local authorities comes from property tax – “so the economic incentive is to allow development to occur basically where development wants to occur”. The sheer scale of Harvey – some parts of Texas may experience a year’s worth of rainfall in just over a week – has undoubtedly contributed to the extent of the flooding. The storm has become wedged between two weather systems, one trying to push it north, the other trying to push it south, which means it is likely to continue to pour on Houston for days. And with that rain the storm is essentially feeding itself, according to the Scientific American. Hurricanes normally pull in moisture from the ocean. But Harvey has dumped so much on Houston that at this point it is reabsorbing that water from the flooded city and hurling it back down. But experts say that even less volatile storms in the future will cause widespread damage to Houston. The city’s impermeable roads and sidewalks are built on the coastal prairie and wetlands of the western Gulf, and its topography is flat, with no run-off area for excess water. At the same time, the changing climate means these heavy storms are becoming more frequent. “Houston is going to flood,” Gonzalez said. “What we need to do is identify those areas that are prone to flood. And we need to work to make sure we don’t develop in those areas, and if we do have housing in those areas we may want to think about a buyout program.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/aug/28/houston-harvey-texas-motels-diners","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T18:46:10Z","webTitle":"'We weren't sure we'd make it': Texans forced to flee take refuge in motels and diners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/28/houston-harvey-texas-motels-diners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/aug/28/houston-harvey-texas-motels-diners","fields":{"headline":"'We weren't sure we'd make it': Texans forced to flee take refuge in motels and diners","bodyText":"Jennifer Shardlow figured it was time to evacuate when water poured through the walls and a snake swam through the kitchen. “We still had a yard at midnight,” she said. “Then at 5.30 this morning the water started coming up through the boards and through the walls. I was sitting on a stool with the water up to my ankles when this snake swam by me. It ended up by the stove.” Shardlow, 35, huddled over a coffee in an iHop diner along with other families who had fled homes in and around Houston, all trying to make sense of a world rendered alien. The torrents unleashed by Hurricane Harvey, now a tropical storm, had turned the familiar unrecognisable on Monday. Furniture was floating, homes were traps, the I-45 highway was an escape route and its string of motels and diners were refuges. “We haven’t seen the sun in four days,” said Erin Miles, 46, a bread distributor. “Alligators are coming up through the bayous,” said her husband, William. “You have to be careful where you sit.” Hurricanes and storms are a way of life in this part of Texas, their names etched in memory. Allison (2001), Katrina (2005), Isaac (2008). But this one is in a class of its own. An event which to many feels biblical and which will divide their lives into before and after Harvey. “We never had to evacuate before,” said Shardlow, a business studies graduate, fighting back tears. She was still digesting the reality that her home, the one she and her husband Pete moved into just a few months ago, was now flooded. They were in Conroe, a community just north of Houston. It had initially escaped flooding but early on Monday authorities released record amounts of water from a nearby dam to avert uncontrolled, disastrous breaches. Lake Conroe received an average of 18in of rainfall during the storm’s first 72 hours, raising water levels more than 4ft above normal. Flooding from the dam was rising in feet and not inches, Conroe fire chief Ken Kreger told Eyewitness News, and floodwaters were moving fast. Authorities issued a mandatory evacuation order for one neighbourhood, McDade Estates, and urged residents in six other districts to leave. The Shardlows and their neighbours watched the water rise – a man-made surge – with a sense of helplessness and hurt. “We don’t understand how they can do that,” said Pete, a consultant originally from England. So, like thousands of others, the Shardlows loaded valuables and food – and their two cats – into their car and hit the I-45. The highway is an eerie experience at night. You cannot see the moon or the stars, just the pale glow of headlights which puncture the black, pounding rain. At the rain’s heaviest on Sunday night, the only vehicles still on the road were towing boats. Neon signs warned of flash floods and implored motorists to retreat if they sensed trouble. “Turn back, don’t drown.” Motels filled with families, all with tales to tell. Trees toppled on to homes, cars floating down driveways, frantic searches for pets, power cuts, dead phones, rain beyond imagining. “We hit a hole,” said one man, who, with his wife, was checking into a Motel 6 early on Monday, nabbing the last room. “We could hear something cracking. It was too dark to see anything. We weren’t sure we’d make it here.” For Jimmy Jones, working the front office, there was a sense of ritual: a storm hits, people flee homes, his motel fills up. “Last year it was the same thing. Then it was Ike and before that Katrina. You end up selling out pretty quick.” He was philosophical. “Acts of nature. Bad things.” Adjacent to the motel was the Ark church. It was shut. “All services of the Ark church are canceled for Sunday. Please stay safe and in your homes,” said its website. With most public spaces closed, roadside diners serving pancakes and omelettes became de facto sanctuaries. “We left our home 30 minutes ago,” said Trey Taylor, 36, a telecommunications worker sipping a Coke at iHop with his wife Charlotte, also 36. “We’re just trying to figure out what to do.” Mandatory evacuations had been ordered a mile from their home so after moving all their possessions more than 3ft above the floor – a level which should be safe, a Red Cross friend told them – they decided to join the exodus. Parts of Texas resembled the set of Waterworld but for Taylor old world rules still applied. “Can I see some credentials?” he asked. He feared looters posing as journalists could take advantage of abandoned properties. Houston so far has no fiasco to compare with the day the levees failed New Orleans in 2005 but some of the iHop patrons bristled with recrimination. “It’s ridiculous that we’re having to evacuate people in dump trucks,” said William Miles. He blamed the mayor, Sylvester Turner, for cutting fire department resources. He understood, however, why authorities told Houston residents to stay put rather than flee. “In hindsight, yeah, they should have evacuated, but they were going with what they had.” At least six people had been confirmed to have died by Monday morning and some 2,000 had been rescued. Miles took a swig of coffee and frowned. “Want to see what my front yard looks like?” He held out his phone: a picture of a whale leaping out of the ocean. His friends guffawed. “Sorry man,” he grinned, “but in times like this you gotta find humour where you can.” Kevin and Kelly Moncus, both 48, sat at a nearby table with their son, devouring pancakes. There was no power at home, rain hammered on the diner’s window and flash flood warnings crackled over the radio. Would they consider living elsewhere? Kevin’s eyes widened. “I love Texas. Born and raised here. We’re not moving.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/aug/28/davy-russell-punching-horse-serious-blow-horse-racing-image-tramore-kings-dolly","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-28T15:54:46Z","webTitle":"Davy Russell punching his horse was a serious blow to racing’s image","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/28/davy-russell-punching-horse-serious-blow-horse-racing-image-tramore-kings-dolly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/28/davy-russell-punching-horse-serious-blow-horse-racing-image-tramore-kings-dolly","fields":{"headline":"Davy Russell punching his horse was a serious blow to racing’s image","bodyText":"When the Irish Turf Club announced on Saturday that the jockey Davy Russell had received only a caution from its disciplinary panel for punching his horse before a race at Tramore earlier this month there was widespread astonishment on racing’s social media and internet forums. Russell, one of jumping’s most experienced riders, was banned for 14 days last year for being rude to the stewards at Clonmel and got five days for grabbing a fellow jockey’s whip in mid-race in 2014. A petulant right hook to his own mount’s head, however, somehow incurred no meaningful punishment at all from the authorities. Had he been rude to a horse and punched a steward, Russell’s ban from the sport might have been measured in months, if not years. But since it was the other way round – and despite the constant assurances from every racing authority, Ireland’s included, that “the welfare of the horses is paramount” – Russell did not get so much as a fine, despite being guilty of “behaviour prejudicial to the integrity, proper conduct or good reputation of horseracing”. According to the official report on the hearing, published on Monday, Russell told the panel that “he managed to get the horse pulled up and used his fist to hit the horse on the soft part of her neck, just behind the head to make the horse concentrate. He had his stick in his hand when he did this. He said he would have slapped the horse if he hadn’t had the stick in his hand. He accepted his actions were inappropriate.” By the time Russell gave an interview to At The Races a couple of a hours later, though, he seemed to have forgotten about his whip and described his punch instead as a “slap”. Surprise at the leniency of Russell’s penalty was compounded when Denis Egan, the Turf Club’s chief executive, suggested afterwards that he had “absolutely no doubt [Russell] won’t do it again”. Should the regulator not be more concerned about whether any other jockey will be discouraged from doing something similar, having seen such a senior rider effectively escape without sanction? There was never any chance that Russell would receive an extended ban for punching the mare Kings Dolly, who briefly threatened to either unseat Russell or jump the “show” hurdle before her race but was standing still in front of it when Russell landed his blow. While there was no clear precedent for the Irish panel to consider, Shane Foley was banned for seven days (reduced to five on appeal) earlier this year for hitting a horse twice with his whip before entering the stalls. In Britain, meanwhile, Kieren Fallon and Sean Levey both received five-day bans for hitting horses on the head before races, in 2012 and 2014 respectively. Had Russell been charged under the “disrepute” rules in Britain it would have been a clear sign that the British Horseracing Authority considered it a serious offence, as the current entry point penalty would have been a £2,000 fine or three-month ban. Even with an expensive lawyer to argue a case for mitigation his penalty would have been significant. The fact that Russell received only a caution suggests that Ireland’s regulator lags behind its British counterpart when it comes to understanding the importance of perception in an incident such as this. Racing is a conservative sport in many ways but it has been quite adept at moving with the public mood in recent years, the Grand National and the whip being two particular issues. There is no way to uninvent the internet and a five-second clip of a jockey punching a horse before a race can now go viral before the race itself has finished. It can also be expected to pop up in racing-related Google searches for years to come, and it would at least do something to minimise the damage if the same search highlighted a suitable punishment for the rider concerned. If such a high-profile and experienced jockey as Russell can punch a horse in the head and to all intents escape without sanction it does a disservice to the sport not only in Ireland but beyond."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/gardens-dahlias-sage-avocado","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-23T10:00:13Z","webTitle":"Gardens: what to do this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/gardens-dahlias-sage-avocado","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/23/gardens-dahlias-sage-avocado","fields":{"headline":"Gardens: what to do this week","bodyText":"Visit this Your starter for 10: cactus, ball, decorative and fimbriated are all types of what?

The species were assumed to be one and the same. However significant morphological differences between the Lord Howe Island stick insects collected in the early 1900s and stored in museum collections, and the phasmids discovered in 2001 on Ball’s Pyramid (a remnant volcano about 23km off the main island), created a suspicion the latter could be a related species – rather than the original back from the dead. That suspicion prompted scientists to map the genome from descendants of the Ball’s Pyramid phasmids, which were bred in captivity at Melbourne zoo. They compared it to DNA extracted from museum specimens held by the CSIRO. The result was a less than 1% variance, within the range of difference for a single species. Despite their different looks, both are confirmed to be the critically endangered Dryococelus australis. The results of the study were published in Current Biology on Thursday. Its lead author, Sasha Mikheyev, said researchers had not been able to make the comparison when the first two breeding pairs were collected off Ball’s Pyramid and taken to Melbourne zoo in 2003 because they did not have the technology to extract and sequence the DNA of long-dead specimens. “We are now able to get DNA out of things that we considered impossible,” he said. “We took a leg from each of the specimens and we extract the inside part that contains a lot of DNA.” The stick insects now held in museums were collected on Lord Howe Island (in the Tasman Sea, 600km east of the New South Wales coast) when it was settled as a whaling colony in the 19th century. The animals were abundant on the island until the introduction of black rats, which arrived on ships in 1918 and swiftly hunted the insects. In 2001 a small colony was found on a rocky ledge of the largely barren Ball’s Pyramid. The isolated outcrop and Lord Howe Island are not believed to have ever been linked by land and it is unclear how the phasmids, which are sometimes called “tree lobsters”, came to be living on the former. Now that they are confirmed to be the same species, Mikheyev said the animals could potentially be rereleased on Lord Howe Island, provided the rats were eradicated. This year the Australian government approved a mass rat-baiting plan which will begin in mid-2018. Mikheyev said it was not clear why the descendants of the Ball’s Pyramid colony look so different to the earlier specimens but it could be due the harshness of that habitat compared with the lush surrounds of Lord Howe Island. “We won’t know for sure until these animals are back in their natural habitat on Lord Howe Island,” he said. Female Lord Howe Island stick insects grow to about 12cm long, while males mature to just over 10cm. They are not the largest stick insect in Australia – that honour goes to Ctenomorpha gargantua, which can grow to 50cm – but their unlikely survival is a cause for celebration. “When we think about stories we hear about extinction events, more often than not the history [shows that] things get worse,” Mikheyev said. “Very rarely there’s a chance to go and fix something.” Kate Pearce, the invertebrates manager at Melbourne zoo, suggested the morphological differences between the four insects that formed the foundation of the captive breeding program and the museum specimens could be a false impression caused by selective collection by the 19th-century zoologists. “The specimens in the museum collections were always a lot bigger,” Pearce said. “The legs were a lot chunkier and they had much bigger spurs. “Now that we have answered that question [of whether they are the same species], we think that what happened with the museum specimens is they were collecting the biggest, meatiest specimens that they could find.” Pearce said some stick insects bred in Melbourne zoo, of which there are now 800, grew to a similar size. The entire captive population of Lord Howe Island stick insects, which are also kept at Museums Victoria, on Lord Howe Island itself, and in San Diego and Bristol zoos, are descended from the two breeding pairs collected in 2003. This year another female, named Vanessa, was collected to join Melbourne zoo’s breeding program. Her eggs are due to start hatching this week. Pearce said the results of the study, which Melbourne zoo requested, would guide the future conservation of the species. “We can look at pushing for their reintroduction back on to Lord Howe Island without that question of whether we are just introducing a new invasive species,” she said. “We now know for sure that it’s the same species.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/04/vaginal-mesh-lawsuit-executive-denies-prioritising-johnson-johnson-interests","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T04:41:31Z","webTitle":"Vaginal mesh lawsuit: executive denies prioritising Johnson & Johnson interests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/vaginal-mesh-lawsuit-executive-denies-prioritising-johnson-johnson-interests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/vaginal-mesh-lawsuit-executive-denies-prioritising-johnson-johnson-interests","fields":{"headline":"Vaginal mesh lawsuit: executive denies prioritising Johnson & Johnson interests","bodyText":"A senior Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) executive has denied placing corporate interests ahead of traumatised transvaginal mesh patients when he advised against referring a serious complaint to health regulators. More than 700 Australian women launched a federal court class action against the medical giant three months ago, alleging their lives were all but destroyed by flaws with J&amp;J-produced medical implants. The J&amp;J devices, transvaginal mesh and tape, were used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence – common complications of childbirth. But in a large number of cases worldwide, flaws with the meshes left women in debilitating pain. Sexual intercourse was made impossible and many women suffered the breakdown of relationships. J&amp;J is accused of playing down the risks of the products and, instead, using aggressive marketing on surgeons, focusing on the cheap and easily replicable nature of the surgery. The company is also alleged to have sought to avoid the scrutiny of regulators and suppress unfavourable data. On Wednesday, a vice-president of medical affairs, Piet Hinoul, was forced to defend the approach taken to one complaint that J&amp;J and its product development arm, Ethicon, became aware of in 2009. A woman in the UK had suffered two infections related to sinus complications after having the tape implanted in 2002. The first infection occurred 12 months after the implant and the next occurred three years later, the court heard. But the court was shown emails in which Hinoul described those complications as a “transitory foreign body response”, a normal reaction that was contemplated in the company’s instructions for use to surgeons. The company only has an obligation to report adverse reactions if they are not included in a product’s instructions for use. Hinoul recommended against reporting the case to the UK’s medical products regulator. Barrister Tony Bannon SC, who is acting for the 700 women on behalf of Shine Lawyers, accused Hinoul of using “word games” to avoid reporting the case. Bannon said the infections, occurring so long after the initial operation, were obviously not transitory. “Do you say you are comfortable in forming a view, when you wrote this email, that an affliction that occurred three years after – three years after – the implantation of this device was the result of a transitory foreign body response? Is that your evidence?” Bannon asked. Hinoul said the transitory foreign body response in the patient had become “sustained”. “I don’t play word games,” Hinoul said. Bannon later pressed Hinoul on the issue: “You were putting the company’s interests ahead of the patient’s interests. Do you agree with that?” Hinoul responded: “Not at all.” Bannon asked: “Do you agree you took an unreasonable approach to the [instructions for use] in order to protect the company’s interests?” Hinoul said: “No, certainly not.” Later on Wednesday, Hinoul was forced to agree the company knew its products, as a matter of certainty, would not be suitable for some patients. But Hinoul said that was the same for all medical interventions and there was no way of knowing which patients would have adverse reactions to the implants. “The answer, as I said, is yes, but that is the same as any kind of intervention in medicine … Unfortunately, medicine isn’t perfect and that is the same of surgery,” Hinoul said. “Certain surgeries, unfortunately, go wrong and have complications – we’re not denying that.” The case continues before Justice Anna Katzmann in the federal court on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/04/afl-jeff-kennett-returns-as-hawthorn-president","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T01:32:03Z","webTitle":"AFL: Jeff Kennett returns as Hawthorn president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/04/afl-jeff-kennett-returns-as-hawthorn-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/04/afl-jeff-kennett-returns-as-hawthorn-president","fields":{"headline":"AFL: Jeff Kennett returns as Hawthorn president","bodyText":"Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett has returned as Hawthorn president after Richard Garvey suddenly resigned from the role at the AFL club. The decision was taken at a board morning on Wednesday morning and comes just days after the sacking of chief executive Tracey Gaudry. In a statement, the club said Garvey will continue as a board member. “The board of the Hawthorn football club met early this morning where the president, Richard Garvey, indicated that he was resigning as president of the club accepting responsibility for a recent board decision,” the statement said. “The board ratified that former president Jeff Kennett assume the presidency subject to a members’ vote at the AGM in December, which has been accepted. “Richard Garvey will continue as a director. The transfer of authority will commence on Monday 9 October 2017.” Kennett had an eventful term as Hawks president from 2006-11. There was frequent tension with coach Alastair Clarkson and Kennett is a trenchant critic of the AFL. Kennett’s stunning return continues a period of massive change at one of the AFL’s strongest clubs. In the past 18 months, Andrew Newbold has handed over to Garvey, chief executive Stuart Fox has gone to the role as CEO at the Melbourne Cricket Club and football director Chris Fagan has gone to coach Brisbane. Clarkson is the only key club leader remaining from their 2013-15 premiership winning sides. Gaudry took over from Fox, but the first female chief executive at an AFL club only lasted five months. Immediately after the Hawks sacked Gaudry, the pressure went onto Garvey. On the field, the Hawks dropped out of the top eight for the first time since 2009, with club legend Luke Hodge and star defender Josh Gibson retiring at the end of the season. Hodge has since indicated he could keep playing at the Lions. At the end of the 2016 season, as it became clear Hawthorn’s premiership era was ending, Clarkson moved on key veterans Sam Mitchell and Jordan Lewis.

The ABC’s director of news, Gaven Morris, is so appalled by the prominent ad in the community paper he has written to the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, calling on him to curb the Victorian MP’s attack. The advertisement, which Danby paid for in part with electoral funds, features a photograph of McNeill wearing dark glasses flanked by a Palestinian family on her left and a Jewish family on her right. Danby claims McNeill provided “extensive” coverage of the eviction of the Palestinian Shamasneh family and “minimal” reportage of the stabbing of the Salomon family. “Contrary to Mr Danby’s assertion, Ms McNeill gave due prominence to the fatal stabbing attack of the three Israelis with stories on television, radio, [ABC] News Digital and Twitter,” Morris said. “The coverage included graphic accounts of the attack from witnesses and first responders.” Morris said all ABC News content was produced in accordance with ABC editorial policies and under the supervision of experienced editorial managers. This is not the first time Danby has taken aim at McNeill, an award-winning foreign correspondent. She has been a particular target and the Israel lobby has also openly campaigned for the ABC to cancel her posting. In 2015 former managing director Mark Scott strongly defended McNeill from attacks by Liberal senator Eric Abetz. “The ABC strongly rejects allegations made by Mr Michael Danby MP in a paid advertisement in the Australian Jewish News that the coverage by ABC Jerusalem correspondent Sophie McNeill of a series of killings of Palestinians and of Jewish Israelis on 21 July was biased and unbalanced,” Morris said. “This advertisement is part of a pattern of inaccurate and highly inappropriate personal attacks on Ms McNeill by Mr Danby. The ABC has complete confidence in the professionalism of Ms McNeill. Despite unprecedented scrutiny and obvious pre-judgement by Mr Danby and others, her work has been demonstrably accurate and impartial.” Danby told Guardian Australia he often placed ads in the AJN for different issues like marriage equality and penalty rates, and declined to say how much he paid. “Yes, Sophie McNeill should have given the Salomon family, who were stabbed to death at their Friday night Shabbat dinner, at least the same human-interest coverage she gave the Shamasneh family, who were evicted after the Israeli supreme court ruled in favour of the property’s owners,” he said. “With all my ads, I negotiate and get the best deal. “Contrary to the ABC director of news [response], nowhere in the reporting of the brutal slaying of the Salomon family were they mentioned by name. Nor was there any profile of the family or footage interviewing other family members. By contrast, Ms McNeill personally visited and profiled the Palestinian Shamasneh family.” In July former Middle East correspondent for the Australian John Lyons revealed that pro-Israel advocacy groups in Australia targeted McNeill, fellow ABC correspondent Peter Cave and himself. Lyons said he was subjected to consistent pressure from the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council while based in Jerusalem for the Australian for six years. In his Middle East memoir, Balcony Over Jerusalem, Lyons said there was a campaign against McNeill before she set foot in the Middle East."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/04/trump-puerto-rico-emperor-pomp-hurricane-maria","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T10:41:54Z","webTitle":"Trump came to Puerto Rico like an emperor: with pomp and little sympathy | Susanne Ramirez de Arellano","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/trump-puerto-rico-emperor-pomp-hurricane-maria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/trump-puerto-rico-emperor-pomp-hurricane-maria","fields":{"headline":"Trump came to Puerto Rico like an emperor: with pomp and little sympathy","bodyText":"President Donald Trump arrived in Puerto Rico like an emperor, coming to scold his uncooperative subjects. “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack,” he said during a visit to the island on Tuesday. He might as well have blamed us for throwing ourselves in the path of a hurricane. Apart from the cost, the worst part about this catastrophe for Trump seems to be how damn ungrateful these Puerto Ricans are. The president called the mayor of San Juan, the capital, a “politically motivated ingrate” over the weekend. Then, on Tuesday, he suggested the island was exaggerating its woes. Puerto Rico isn’t facing “a real catastrophe like Katrina” the president said. Just grow up and stop all your whining, in other words. Trump arrived on the island more than two weeks after Hurricane Maria hit. Despite what he claims, the situation is still devastating. Only 5% of the electrical grid has been repaired; only 17% of the cellphone towers are working and more than half the island has no running water. Most of Puerto Rico’s 3.5 million citizens have to stand every day in hellish lines for food, water, gas and medicines. This is the new normal for us and our families. Yet, the president spent much of his time on the island patting his administration on the back for how well it is handling everything. “You can be very proud. Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what’s been taking place in Puerto Rico,” he said. During a “press conference” at the Luis Muñiz air national guard base in San Juan – in which he took no questions from the press – Trump praised the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, military commanders and a half-dozen members of his cabinet, who accompanied him to Puerto Rico. He reserved nothing, not one word of encouragement and empathy for the Puerto Rican people, who are the ones that have shouldered the brunt of this tragedy all by themselves. Many don’t agree at all with Trump’s rosy self-assessment. On Tuesday, Oxfam America released a rare statement criticizing the administration for its response to the disaster: “The US has more than enough resources to mobilize an emergency response but has failed to do so in a swift and robust manner.” And if all of this wasn’t enough, after his pompous speech, Trump was taken to see the devastation in one of the wealthiest municipalities of the whole island: Guaynabo. Even in forgotten, neglected Puerto Rico, Trump reminds us that there is a pecking order – and it’s the rich and powerful living in gated communities who come before all others. And what did Trump do in Guaynabo? He threw out rolls of paper towel and bags of rice to the well-heeled Puerto Ricans. It was a pathetic performance, and deeply offensive, especially as people in the interior of the island have next to nothing. As I write this, a dear friend from Puerto Rico messages me to say: “It’s bewildering to hear the president joke about how much this tragedy is costing him while I’m scrapping to pack a flat rate box with sausages, batteries and lanterns to my family, some of whom I haven’t spoken to in two weeks.” “That while he’s throwing paper towels to a crowd like a five-year-old at a carnival basketball game, I try to keep a straight face for the next customer at work, while looking up prices for a small generator to ship to my aunt who is now living in the darkness of the San Sebastián mountains.” Hurricane Maria was not enough to bring the Puerto Rican people to its knees. I doubt that Tuesday’s farce will dent our resolve. It has only served to make us more aware of the truth – which is that we must save ourselves.

The company, now part of Verizon Communications, said last December that data from more than 1bn user accounts was compromised by hackers in August 2013. Yahoo included the finding in an update to its account security update page. The company said it will begin alerting accounts that were not previously notified of the attack. However, the company said the latest investigation indicated that the stolen information did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. “It is important to note that, in connection with Yahoo’s December 2016 announcement of the August 2013 theft, Yahoo took action to protect all accounts. The company required all users who had not changed their passwords since the time of the theft to do so. Yahoo also invalidated unencrypted security questions and answers so they cannot be used to access an account,” Yahoo said on Tuesday. The latest disclosure of the massive hack came on the same day that the former boss of credit agency Equifax was grilled in Congress over a breach in its systems that compromised the social security numbers, credit card details and other personal information of 145.5 million people. The hack has been a costly one for Yahoo and its executives. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s former chief executive, gave up her 2016 cash bonus following the incident and the company’s top lawyer, Ronald Bell, resigned in the wake of the hack and the other breaches. Some 43 consumer class-action lawsuits have been filed against the company, Yahoo said in a May filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Verizon in February lowered its original offer by $350m for Yahoo assets in the wake of two huge cyber-attacks at the internet company. The closing of the deal, which was first announced in July, had been delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from two data breaches that Yahoo disclosed last year. The company paid $4.48bn for Yahoo’s core business.

The island of 71,000 people was the first to bear the brunt of the category 5 hurricane when it struck in mid-September. “My roof is gone,” Roosevelt Skerrit, the island’s prime minister, wrote on Facebook as the storm made landfall. “I am at the complete mercy of the hurricane. House is flooding.” Skerrit, who was rescued shortly after, described the physical damage left in the wake of the storm as “mind-boggling”, adding that winds had swept away the roofs of almost everyone he had spoken to. “We will need help, my friend, we will need help of all kinds.” His appeal was followed by silence. Dominica’s communication towers snapped as the storm barrelled through the island, cutting the island off from the world as it struggled to cope with the destruction left by its strongest and most ferocious storm on record. A UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination team was among the first to arrive on the island, hours after the storm passed. “We saw everything totally destroyed,” said team leader Sergio Da Silva, who left the island on Monday. Cars sat flipped over on the streets, their wheels facing the sky and the island’s lush farmland – planted with crops such as bananas and sweet potatoes – had been decimated. “People were really lost,” Da Silva told the Guardian. “You could see the trauma in people’s eyes and how they were really affected and still a bit scared.” Debris from trees and roofs littered the streets. “We flew over the island, and this island that used to be all green with leaves and trees was totally brown. All the trees were on the ground, there were no leaves left any more.” Officials in Dominica said the hurricane left 27 people dead and more than 50 people missing. About 90% of the structures on the island have been either damaged or destroyed. Amid severe shortages of food and water, the number of thefts across the capital city of Roseau began to rise, prompting the government to impose a nationwide curfew from 4pm to 8am. Days later, things are slowly improving, said Da Silva. The fallen trees and landslides that had clogged roads – hampering the delivery of aid – are being cleared, while power has been restored to critical buildings such as the hospital. In the capital city, a few pharmacies and banks have managed to open this week. But much remains to be done. Many parts of the island still lack electricity and running water, while destroyed bridges and washed-out river valleys have left rescuers unable to reach the island’s more remote communities. “With food, water, telecommunications and access cut off since 18 September, the situation in Dominica is growing more difficult every day,” Joel Millman of the International Organization for Migration told reporters this week. Assistance has poured in from around the world, enabling authorities to distribute nearly 200,000 litres of water, along with 5,000 tarpaulins and 17 tons of high energy biscuits. But more is needed, said Chamberlain Emmanuel of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. “Whatever is coming is consumed quickly,” he said, pointing to the fact that almost every store on the island remains shuttered. “So they’re really at the mercy of aid.” Hurricane Maria was one of three devastating hurricanes to sweep through the region in recent weeks, and the unusually active Atlantic hurricane season has left its mark across the region. Some 95% of houses in Barbuda – whose 1,600 residents were evacuated to neighbouring Antigua ahead of Hurricane Jose – were affected by the hurricanes, while electricity remains down in many parts of Anguilla. “It’s easy to forget, two to three weeks later,” said Emmanuel. “But the situation continues to be serious across the islands.” As Dominica embarks on a recovery process that officials have said could take several years and cost billions of dollars, some of the prime minister’s focus in recent days has been on addressing the root cause of the destruction. “I come to you straight from the frontline of the war on climate change,” Skerrit told the UN general assembly in New York in the days following Hurricane Maria. “Before this century, no other generation had seen more than one category 5 hurricane in their lifetime,” he said. “In this century, this has happened twice. And notably it has happened in the space of just two weeks.” Warmer air and sea temperatures, he said, were supercharging small storms into a devastating force. “We as a country and as a region did not start this war against nature. We did not provoke it. The war has come to us,” he said. “While the big countries talk, the small island nations suffer.

Victory over Slovenia at Wembley on Thursday will book England’s place at the tournament in Russia next summer, with Rashford expected to line up on the left of an attack-minded selection which could also see Raheem Sterling recalled after recent impressive performances for Manchester City. A win will render the final qualifier in Vilnius meaningless and in that scenario José Mourinho is understood to be keen to see Rashford rested. The 19-year-old has already played in 13 games for club and country this season, including matches in Macedonia, Malta and Moscow. United face seven games in 22 days when the Premier League resumes. While Gareth Southgate has consistently stated he will make choices he deems best for the players rather than their clubs, those within the England setup will be conscious of the risk of burnout with the World Cup to come at the end of the season. Should qualification be secured before the match in Vilnius, they may be more open to the idea of resting players like Rashford. Southgate, who is without Dele Alli owing to suspension, is expected to field a front three of Rashford, Harry Kane and Sterling against Slovenia at Wembley, with the latter recalled having been substituted at half-time in Malta last month and unused in the subsequent win over Slovakia. Sterling has revived of late with City, scoring four goals and starting their past three matches. Pep Guardiola suggested on Saturday the player had taken the ignominy of his withdrawal against Malta in his stride. “These kinds of players have to know that, when you win, you should be happy,” said the City manager. “Then if they play badly the next time, there will be a new chance a few days later. Football is marvellous for that. So improve in the good things and bad things and do it again. He’s young, Raz. Like everybody, we try to help him, to try to understand the game, his strong points, to benefit the team.

The scrum-half is only the fourth Castleford player to win rugby league’s highest individual accolade in its 40-year history. He saw off competition from his Tigers and England team-mate Zak Hardaker and the Hull half-back Albert Kelly to win the award on Tuesday night in Manchester. The Wigan centre Oliver Gildart was named Super League’s young player of the year. Gale, who kicked the winning goal in last Thursday’s play-off semi-final against St Helens only 16 days after emergency surgery to remove his appendix, is hoping to add a Grand Final success to his growing list of accolades when Castleford face Leeds in their debut appearance at Old Trafford. And how fitting it is that Leeds will be the opponents on Saturday. The 29-year-old was released by Leeds as a teenager in 2007, and with no professional offers on the table he settled at third division Doncaster. “When you grow up there – and I’d been at Leeds since 12 years of age in the scholarship system – it was hard,” he recalls of his time at Headingley. “But you’ve got to keep on trying.” For Gale being recognised as Super League’s best player, an award won following a vote of his peers, is a far cry from how he began his career a decade earlier. “I worked part-time with my dad. I did some manual labour and it was only six weeks. I say six weeks but my dad says I lasted six days! I told him it’s not for me and I’m playing rugby. “It just made me more determined, if I’m honest. But Doncaster was good. You were playing against adults and it taught me how to run a team at a young age. I think it gave me a good grounding, really.” Gale’s connections with Leeds and some of the existing members of the Rhinos squad are just one of several subplots in the Grand Final. He quickly impressed in the lower leagues with Doncaster, eventually earning a move back to Super League with London in 2009. The man who gave Gale his first opportunity to prove he could play at the highest level is the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott. “There’s some interesting stories about this weekend, isn’t there,” Gale says, laughing. “He was good at London, Brian; really good. He was straight with his ways but he helped me massively and gave me my first shot, so I owe him a bit.” With his reputation burgeoning, his form in London brought a move back north, to the former Super League champions Bradford. When the Bulls were relegated in 2014 Gale was forced to look elsewhere to keep his top-flight career alive. His next move proved to be an inspired one. “I remember meeting the Castleford coach, Daryl Powell, for a coffee in his big mansion,” Gale says. “We spoke about rugby for an hour, and I got out of there, rang my agent and said: ‘I want to sign for Cas.’ The rest is history.” After three years of progress, Gale and Castleford are on the verge of something special. They have finished top of the first division for the first time in their 91-year existence but they have never been crowned champions – a record they are 80 minutes away from laying to rest on Saturday when Gale aims to ruin the fairytale finale of one of his boyhood heroes from his time in the Leeds academy. “He’s an absolute legend, is Maggsy,” Gale says of the Leeds captain, Danny McGuire, who will play his 424th and final game for the Rhinos at Old Trafford before embarking on a new challenge at Hull Kingston Rovers next season. “I’m just pleased I reached a Grand Final and he’s going to be part of it as well,” Gale says. “He’s a great lad and what he’s done at Leeds shouldn’t ever be overlooked. I used to look up to him as a kid and I still do. He’s still got it. We’ll need to be at our best but we’re not just content with being there. We want to win.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/oct/03/royal-mail-dispute-christmas-strike-pensions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T19:00:58Z","webTitle":"Royal Mail looks set to deliver a long and bitter dispute | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/oct/03/royal-mail-dispute-christmas-strike-pensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/oct/03/royal-mail-dispute-christmas-strike-pensions","fields":{"headline":"Royal Mail looks set to deliver a long and bitter dispute","bodyText":"Sir Vince Cable, business secretary in the coalition government, was right about Royal Mail being a risky investment at privatisation in 2013. The biggest risk – industrial action – is now arriving and looks serious. Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) have voted overwhelmingly to strike over the company’s proposal to cut pension benefits. The City had anticipated the outcome and the shares closed on Tuesday at 384p, down 17% this year and not far above the float price of 330p. The heady post-flotation days of 600p feel like another age. The alarming part of this dispute is that Royal Mail’s room for manoeuvre looks to be limited. While the state guaranteed the pre-privatisation pension liabilities, the cost of the post-privatisation defined-benefit scheme has been deemed unaffordable after next March. That assessment looks correct, sadly. Royal Mail estimates its annual contributions would more than double from the current £400m to as much as £1bn. At a business generating £420m of free cash flow, something has to give. The dispute, then, is about what replaces the current arrangements. Royal Mail has made three offers with the aim of keeping contributions at about £400m. All have been rejected. The last proposal involves offering the 88,000 members of the defined-benefit scheme either a “cash balance scheme” that pays a guaranteed lump sum on retirement or the opportunity to join a conventional contribution scheme. Yet it is also hard to see how CWU’s alternative idea (which also covers defined-contribution members) can be spun into a form Royal Mail’s management could accept. First, the annual cash cost would be about £500m, according to analysts at Jefferies. Second, the structure looks too risky from the point of the view of the sponsor: it too closely resembles a defined-benefit scheme with a heavy exposure to shares and thus volatility. A negotiating gap of £100m a year – plus a disagreement over structure – is enormous, as are the stakes on both sides. The proposed cuts in retirement income for workers would be substantial in many cases – up to a third, says the CWU. Yet Royal Mail management, with pressures on revenue from all sides, can’t stray far from its definition of a “manageable” pension cost. Royal Mail has not had a strike since 2009 and the postal climate is different these days. Amazon delivers one in 10 parcels in the UK and the gig economy, where they don’t do pensions like Royal Mail’s, creeps closer. In the meantime, letters volumes continue to fall. An optimist might say a settlement is bound to emerge precisely because the stakes are so high. Well, yes, in time – but a thumping 89% majority in Tuesday’s CWU ballot on a big turnout, and talk of renationalisation in the air, makes the plot difficult to predict. The first skirmish will be over the timing of any strike, with the company desperate to avoid Christmas. It says the CWU, under an agreement from 2013, is obliged to go to external mediation, which could take until “close to Christmas to be completed, and may be longer.” This dispute could become very long and bitter. Royal Mail has fallen out of the FTSE 100 index. Prospects for a quick return are poor. Fidelity should spell out how it will pay for performance Now that the giant BlackRock is driving its passively-managed juggernaut across the investment landscape, active fund managers are obliged to contemplate their role in life. Some, like Aberdeen and Standard Life, are combining in search of cost savings and smarter technology to combat the appeal of cheap tracker funds. Here’s a different solution from Fidelity, the £233bn investment house: it will charge investors less when its funds underperform their benchmarks, and charge more when they do. It’s not an original idea since it is borrowed from the land of hedge funds. But, for a mainstream manager with a big retail following, it’s fresh. Fidelity calls the sliding scale a “fulcrum fee” and one can understand the logic – it feels clean to pay active fund managers by results. There’s just one problem: Fidelity didn’t bother to say what the base and success fees under this new model will be. The details for all 400 funds are still being worked out, it says. In that case, don’t talk about “a significant announcement”. The punters want to know what they’ll be paying. Until you tell them, it’s impossible to judge if this is a revolutionary moment for the industry, or just window dressing. Ryanair row gives tax probe new wings Michael O’Leary will be satisfied. Despite the chaos of cancelled flights, Ryanair carried 11.8 million passengers in September, up 10% on a year ago. So far, so good. But here is one way in which the cancelled flights may cause complications: more people want to know about your business model. As the Guardian reported today (Tuesday 3 October), Ryanair pilots are being investigated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs over their complex employment structures. HMRC’s inquiries, it should be said, started a couple of years ago.

Little is yet known about Stephen Paddock and his motives. But the apparent ease with which he acquired his arsenal – 42 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition, according to police – has renewed the urgency of a perennial American question: why can’t the United States effect sensible gun control? Look at Australia, which enacted a ban and mandatory buyback of more than 600,000 long guns following a mass shooting in 1996, effectively ending the problem of mass shootings (already rare) and halving gun deaths. Why can’t the United States do that? From one angle, the answer is complicated. It involves the powerful gun lobby, political partisanship, the hundreds of millions of guns already in US civilian hands, the fact that mass shootings, while horrifying, represent only a sliver of US gun deaths, and a national mythology attached to guns. From another angle, the answer is simple. The United States could, in fact, adopt gun control – if the public felt strongly enough about it. “If public opinion does not demand change in Congress, it will not change,” Barack Obama said in June 2014. A majority of US gun owners – 74% – say the right to own a gun is “essential” to their freedom, according to Pew Research, while only 44% believe that the ease with which people can legally obtain guns contributes at least a fair amount to gun violence. The disagreements only expand from there. In the wake of the most deadly mass shooting in the United States, here are key features of the American gun control debate. How outrage fizzles Opponents of gun control feared new restrictions after the killing of 20 six- and seven-year-olds at Sandy Hook elementary school in December 2012. The national outrage was intense, and legislators who previously were not interested in gun control measures suddenly were. Two senators, Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey, sponsored a bill that would have imposed universal background checks for commercial gun purchases, including at gun shows and over the internet. Eighty-four percent of Americans favor such a law. But after participating in initial negotiations over the bill, the National Rifle Association came out in strong opposition and falsely claimed the bill would lead to a national gun registry. Four Democrats defected, not enough Republicans came onboard and the legislation went down. “The gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,” Obama said in a furious Rose Garden speech. ‘Successes’ at gun control The last major gun control legislation passed by the US Congress was the 1994 assault weapons ban, which had a 10-year sunset clause and was allowed to expire in 2004. The ban is widely seen as having failed to make a dent in gun deaths in the United States, where more than 30,000 people are killed with guns each year, including more than 20,000 suicides. Rifles, including assault weapons, are used in only 3.55% of gun murders annually, according to FBI statistics. While the national focus on gun control always intensifies after mass shootings, mass shootings account for only a small proportion of US gun deaths annually. Gun violence instead is concentrated in the country’s poorest, most racially segregated neighborhoods, with African Americans, who represent 13% of the total population, making up more than half of overall gun murder victims. Is it all the NRA’s fault? As the 2013 failure of universal background checks illustrated, the NRA is a powerful lobby. “It came down to politics – the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections,” Obama said of senators who had not dared to support the bill. The NRA has more than a half-dozen full-time federal lobbyists and claims a grassroots membership of 5 million. More importantly, NRA members are known for being politically active – showing up at public meetings, bombarding congressional offices with telephone calls, and for voting. However, the NRA isn’t even in the top 50 in terms of spendingand their influence may be eroded by the increasing assertiveness of Democratic politicians and gun control campaigners who now challenge their arguments and organisation. What kind of gun control? One hurdle to effective gun control measures in the United States is a disagreement over what kind of action is needed. Focus on a new military-style weapons ban may detract from a potential ban on high-capacity magazines, which may be the more effective measure to limit the terrible toll of mass shootings. Researchers also call for more investment in threat assessment and intervention programs. Community advocates urge more funding for local programs that have been shown to reduce gang-related murder. Health experts urge the public to recognize that mental health is a serious factor in gun suicide. Are there simply too many guns are out there? There were about 265m, at last count – more than one for every adult American. That means that any new gun control measure in the United States advances against an ominous reality, of a country already flooded with guns. That reality is the core of gun advocates’ claim that new legislation to limit gun ownership would not increase public safety while funneling gun possession toward lawbreakers. The American gun mythology Books like American Gun: the history of the US in 10 firearms begin to articulate a feature of the US gun debate that may be elusive to the outside observer. Debate rages as to whether the framers of the constitution drafted the second amendment, which enshrines the American right to bear arms, as a hedge against private militias; as an affirmation of the country’s revolutionary roots; as an acknowledgment of a divine individual right; or as all of the above. From the revolutionary war to the genocide of Native Americans to the taming of the western wilderness to the ratification of the code of anti-government American individualism, US history is filled with guns. The future may be, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/03/cancer-obesity-weight-us-study","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T18:47:36Z","webTitle":"Cancers linked to excess weight make up 40% of all US diagnoses, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/03/cancer-obesity-weight-us-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/03/cancer-obesity-weight-us-study","fields":{"headline":"Cancers linked to excess weight make up 40% of all US diagnoses, study finds","bodyText":"Cancers associated with being overweight or obese account for 40% of all diagnoses of the disease in the United States, an increasing share of all cancer diagnoses nationwide. Although new cases of cancer have fallen since the 1990s, diagnoses of overweight- and obesity-linked cancers increased between 2005 and 2014, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being overweight is associated with increased risk for 13 types of cancer. “When we step back and lump together all the types of cancer associated with overweight and obesity, we saw a direction upwards,” said Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the CDC. “That’s not a smoking gun, but it’s a note of caution for us.” Researchers at the CDC used data from the US Cancer Statistics database from 2005 to 2014, looking specifically at cancers the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies as linked to being overweight. The study looked at cancers more likely to occur in people who are overweight or obese. These cancers are linked to being overweight, but are not necessarily caused by being overweight. The study found that between 2005 and 2014, the rates of overweight-linked cancers increased 7% (not including colorectal cancer), while rates of cancers not associated with obesity declined 13%. In effect, increased rates of overweight-associated cancers slowed the trend of decreasing cancer cases nationally. “Our report found an increase in a number of types of cancers associated with obesity and overweight, at a period when the prevalence of obesity and overweight has increased substantially in the middle ages,” said Schuchat. “The prevalence of obesity and overweight is starting to show up in our cancer statistics.” The rate of Americans who are considered overweight by the CDC has steadily climbed since the mid-20th century and now stands at two out of three. In 2014, roughly 630,000 people in the US were diagnosed with overweight- or obesity-linked cancer. Two-thirds of those cases were in Boomer-generation adults, between 50 and 74. Women also faced a disproportionate risk of being diagnosed with such cancers. More than half (55%) of all cancers diagnosed in women are linked to being overweight, compared with a quarter (24%) in men. A handful of overweight-linked cancers occur only in women, including cancer of the ovary or endometrium lining of the uterus. The risk of breast cancer, which occurs overwhelmingly in women, is also linked to being overweight. While researchers found strong links between cancer risk and being overweight for 13 cancers, not all risks are equal. For example, endometrial cancer is particularly linked to being overweight. For every increased kilogram per square meter, the standard measurement of body mass, a woman’s risk of developing endometrial cancer is increased 8%, compared with 5% for kidney cancer, and 2% for breast cancer. Researchers are still exploring why the risk of some cancers increases with being overweight, and whether the cancer-linked forces unleashed by being overweight are reversed once people lose weight. “The question is whether the mechanisms that are turned on in the process of overweight and obesity can be turned off,” said Schuchat. While rates of obesity-linked cancers rose overall, rates of colorectal, ovarian and meningioma cancers declined. In the case of colorectal cancer in particular, researchers credited improved screening. Increased screening rates have been linked to free colonoscopies made available to seniors under the Affordable Care Act. Previously, colonoscopies cost seniors $275. Schuchat cautioned the causes of increasing cancer rates are complex. For example, increased rates of the viral liver disease hepatitis C could account for some increase in rates of liver cancer, as could fatty liver disease, which is associated with both alcohol use and obesity. Nevertheless, she said the trends are “concerning”. Theodore Brasky, a professor and researcher at the Ohio State University, not associated with the study, called America’s obesity problem “massive”. “It’s interesting when we talk about cancer in this country, we talk about beating cancer and the cancer moonshot initiative, but all of these things are focused on treating cancer, curing cancer,” Brasky said. “What we need to talk about is preventing cancer, eating better.” “Those approaches are cost effective and have a bigger impact. It’s so much easier to not get cancer than to have to deal with treating it,” he said. CDC researchers said the risk of 13 cancers is increased by being overweight or obese, including cancer of the thyroid, gallbladder, liver, kidney, colon and pancreas. Being overweight also increases the risk of a blood cancer called myeloma, a spinal cancer called meningioma, a type of esophageal cancer, and a type of stomach cancer. In women, being overweight is linked to cancer of the uterine lining called the endometrium, ovarian cancer and breast cancer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/03/theresa-may-to-tell-tories-its-time-for-brexit-infighting-to-cease","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T21:30:10Z","webTitle":"Theresa May to tell Tories it's time for Brexit infighting to cease","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/03/theresa-may-to-tell-tories-its-time-for-brexit-infighting-to-cease","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/03/theresa-may-to-tell-tories-its-time-for-brexit-infighting-to-cease","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May to tell Tories it's time for Brexit infighting to cease","bodyText":"Theresa May will issue a call for unity within the Conservative ranks on Wednesday as a string of cabinet ministers told the Guardian they were deeply frustrated with Boris Johnson for creating days of headlines about party division. The prime minister will use her centrepiece conference speech to demand an end to the infighting, declaring a “duty to Britain” to shift the focus from the job security of senior Tories to that of ordinary working people. The call will be made as at least 12 cabinet colleagues – more than half of the total number of cabinet members – expressed their frustration with the foreign secretary in a series of private and public conversations during the conference. They said they were angry that his two recent Brexit interventions, including an interview seen as laying down his red lines for negotiations, caused the party’s annual conference in Manchester to be dominated by questions of loyalty and leadership. “A lot of people are very, very frustrated, including me,” said one senior member of the team, who suggested Johnson should have phoned colleagues to express his views rather than publish them in newspapers. A second said the foreign secretary had not won any friends on the backbenches, while a third rolled their eyes and remained tight-lipped when asked about him, refusing to defend their colleague. Others expressed similar views. Their comments came alongside public criticism from health secretary Jeremy Hunt, home secretary Amber Rudd, first secretary of state Damian Green and Scottish secretary David Mundell. May will warn that “beyond the gossip pages of the newspapers, and beyond the streets, corridors and meeting rooms of Westminster, life continues – the daily lives of ordinary working people go on”. “And they must be our focus today,” she will say. “Not worrying about our job security, but theirs. Not addressing our concerns, but the issues, the problems, the challenges, that concern them. Not focusing on our future, but on the future of their children and their grandchildren – doing everything we can to ensure their tomorrow will be better than our today.” In her speech, May will conclude: “So let us do our duty by Britain. Let us shape up and give the country the government it needs.” However, May was on Tuesday night facing further controversy and calls for Johnson to be sacked, after he remarked that a Libyan city could be the next Dubai if it would “clear the dead bodies away”. Sources revealed that May will also use the speech, which is likely to be policy-heavy with at least one major new announcement that was still being hammered out on Tuesday night, to give a more personal take on her life and politics. She hopes that highlighting stories that help explain her motivations could chip away at a somewhat frosty reputation that has seen her nicknamed the Maybot. In an attempt to reach out to younger voters, housing will feature as a key part of the speech with a promise to undertake the first major council house building programme in decades. Downing Street aides insisted that the prime minister’s call for the party to stop looking inward and unite was not aimed at any individual but May did admit in broadcast interviews that there had been too much focus on Johnson’s career hopes. Asked by the BBC if he had undermined her by publishing his vision of Brexit in a newspaper article and doing an interview that was seen as him laying down his own red lines for negotiations, May said: “It doesn’t undermine what I am doing at all. There is a lot of talk about Boris’s job or this job or that job inside the cabinet. “Actually, what people are concerned about – they don’t want us to be thinking about our jobs, they want us to be thinking about their jobs and their futures.” However, she also defended the decision not to sack the foreign secretary by saying she did not want to be surrounded by “yes men”. The Guardian can reveal that allies of Johnson used a WhatsApp group of Tory MPs to support his Brexit article and newspaper interview. They encouraged colleagues to share the pieces, arguing that it was refreshing to see someone making the positive case for leaving the EU. However, Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, poked fun at Johnson from the conference stage, mentioning the controversial £350m claim of Vote Leave and suggesting military equipment was the real lion roaring – in a joke about the title of his speech. The foreign secretary used his set-piece address to protest his loyalty to May, after suggesting that his interventions were in line with government policy. Johnson, whose speech won a short standing ovation from grassroots delegates but was only attended by one cabinet member, Michael Gove, mocked the buoyant mood of Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. He said: “He didn’t win. You won – we won. Theresa May won. She won more votes than any party leader and took this party to its highest share of the vote in any election in the last 25 years, and the whole country owes her a debt for her steadfastness in taking Britain forward as she will to a great Brexit deal. “Based on that Florence speech on whose every syllable, I can tell you, the whole cabinet is united.” Allies of Johnson insisted that they were not involved in advising him about his interventions, with some suggesting he ought to go quiet. But he was given a hero’s welcome by grassroots Tories across conference, who also clamoured to hear Jacob Rees-Mogg speak at a series of fringe events."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/03/donald-trump-gun-control-discuss-las-vegas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T17:00:42Z","webTitle":"Gun control: Trump says lawmakers will discuss issue 'as time goes by'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/donald-trump-gun-control-discuss-las-vegas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/donald-trump-gun-control-discuss-las-vegas","fields":{"headline":"Gun control: Trump says lawmakers will discuss issue 'as time goes by'","bodyText":"Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that the time for a national debate on guns would come at some point in the future, after a lone shooter with an extensive arsenal turned a country music festival on the Las Vegas strip into a warzone, leaving 59 people dead, including the gunman, and at least 527 injured. “We’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes on,” Trump told reporters outside the White House as he prepared to fly to storm-damaged Puerto Rico. He offered no further details. When asked about legislation winding its way through Congress that would make it easier for people to buy gun silencers, Trump said: “We’ll talk about that later.” Although police have not described the shooter’s mental health at all, the president called him “a sick man, a demented man, a lot of problems, I guess”. Trump said: “We’re looking into him very, very seriously. We’re dealing with a very very sick individual. “What happened in Las Vegas is in many was a miracle. The police department has done such an incredible job, and we’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.” Despite the increase in mass shootings in recent years and the easy availability of weapons due to the second amendment to the US constitution, even minor attempts at gun control have proven political impossible in Congress. Lawmakers came closest to making substantial change after 20 children and six adults were murdered in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, but legislation was defeated after campaigns by the NRA and pro-gun Republicans. After 49 people were killed by a gunman in an Orlando nightclub last year, Republicans blocked measures to ban people on the federal terrorism watch list from buying weapons and to close background-check loopholes. As Las Vegas began to recover from the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, lawmakers in Washington are once again engaging in the grim ritual of sending “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of a mass shooting. While Democrats amplified their calls for congressional action on gun control measures that they believe will prevent – or at least reduce the number of casualties – of a future mass shooting, Republicans blamed them for politicizing the moment, arguing that mental health – not firearms – is the underlying factor in such deaths. “We cannot banish evil or madness from the earth. But we must do what is within our power to make our country a safer place to live. We need common-sense reforms,” Democrat Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said in a floor speech on Tuesday. He called on Trump to bring together congressional leaders to address the “epidemic that costs the lives of more than 30,000 Americans a year”. Republicans dismissed Democrats’ calls for action, saying that now was a time for “unity”. House speaker Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress, said mental health reform is crucial to preventing future mass shootings. Ryan said: “It’s important that as we see the dust settle and we see what was behind some of these tragedies, that mental health reform is a critical ingredient to making sure that we can try and prevent some of these things from happening in the past.” Beside him on the podium was majority whip Steve Scalise, who returned to Congress this week after being shot at a morning baseball practice in June. On Monday, Democratic senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012, forcefully denounced his colleagues “cowardice to act” and implored Congress to “get off its ass and do something”. In a floor speech later that evening, Murphy said: “We have become normalized and regularized to 50 people losing their lives. This is a uniquely American problem. “The hurt is deep, the scars are wide in Newtown, but they are made wider by the fact that this body, in four and a half years, has done absolutely nothing to reduce the likelihood of another mass shooting. There’s an unintentional endorsement that gets sent to these mass murderers when after slaughter after slaughter, Congress does nothing.” Authorities are still searching for a motive for the murders committed by Stephen Paddock, 64, who orchestrated the attack from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. Paddock had amassed an arsenal of more than 40 weapons, 23 of which were recovered from the hotel room where police found him dead, according to Las Vegas police. Police said Paddock used multiple rifles during the attack and transported 10 suitcases into his hotel room during his stay there. Officials told the Associated Press that Paddock also had two “bump stocks” that can be used to modify weapons to make them fully automatic. In pursuit of the gunmen, police scoured the hotel floor by floor before reaching the luxury suite where Paddock was stationed. Paddock fired through the hotel room door, striking a security guard in the leg. Swat officers stormed into room after the guard – who is expected to recover – was shot. There they found Paddock dead, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. Police said they retrieved 19 firearms plus explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition from Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nevada, a town near the border with Arizona. In Las Vegas, victims arrived in droves to University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, one of many hospitals that were overflowing. “I have no idea who I operated on,” said Dr Jay Coates, a trauma surgeon. “They were coming in so fast, we were taking care of bodies. We were just trying to keep people from dying.” He told AP: “Every bed was full. We had people in the hallways, people outside and more people coming in.” He said the huge, horrifying wounds on his operating table told him this shooting was something different. “It was very clear that the first patient I took back and operated on that this was a high-powered weapon,” Coates said. “This wasn’t a normal street weapon. This was something that did a lot of damage when it entered the body cavity.” The Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/05/kelela-take-me-apart-review-future-facing-glitchy-rb-with-traction","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T21:00:34Z","webTitle":"Kelela: Take Me Apart review – future-facing glitchy R&B with traction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/kelela-take-me-apart-review-future-facing-glitchy-rb-with-traction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/05/kelela-take-me-apart-review-future-facing-glitchy-rb-with-traction","fields":{"headline":"Kelela: Take Me Apart review – future-facing glitchy R&B with traction","bodyText":"When Washington-born singer Kelela released her first mixtape, Cut 4 Me, in 2013, her fusion of sumptuous R&amp;B vocals and harsh, avant garde electronica made a splash. But in the four years since, alternative R&amp;B has gone from bleeding edge to genre du jour: in a class now crowded with thoroughly modern divas, has anyone has been saving Kelela a seat? As her debut album opens, the idea that the singer may have been left behind by the sound she helped establish doesn’t seem outlandish: Frontline is funky but plodding and retro in its staccato style. Thankfully, Take Me Apart soon proffers tracks that are both pop-minded and gratifyingly future-facing. Producer Arca may be her not-so-secret weapon in the latter regard, creating sublime but techy sonic hellscapes among the ambient synths and skittering beats.

You did – in some numbers. These generous contributions form the heart of the latest edition of We Need to Talk About …, our podcast featuring supporters’ voices, in which your concerns are addressed by a panel of Guardian journalists and experts. As a starting point, we used a Guardian article with an arresting headline: Want to fight climate change? Have fewer children. In the podcast, we hear from one of the academics who produced the research which this article refers to, but equally interesting were your responses to this issue, and the discussions they prompted in our studio. That’s why we’ve decided to publish some of them here. While we aim to hear from lots of voices and include differing points of view on the podcast, a lack of time means we sometimes have to cut people short, or use one person to represent the views of several who have contacted us making similar points. Here, we can give members a bit more space to air their views. You can listen to the panel respond to them – our line-up is Damian Carrington, the Guardian’s environment editor; Lucy Lamble, the Guardian’s executive editor for global development, who often writes on and takes part in debates on global inequality; John Vidal, the multi-award winning former Guardian environment editor and Afua Hirsch, a writer and broadcaster for the Guardian and SkyNews among others, who has also worked in international development and the law. But first gain a flavour of the concerns of your fellow readers below. Many of these questions appear in the podcast, while others influenced the direction in which we headed. Poor allocation of resources is the problem – Kevin, Canada The issue isn’t overpopulation – it’s poor resource allocation. We do not live in a world of lack, but of extreme waste and inefficiency. This is true of food, energy, land use and the financial system. The overpopulation argument is a way to once again deflect from real societal change that is needed, and instead focuses the discussion on families, usually poor families, having too many children. While it is likely that the Earth does have some sort of maximum carrying capacity, even that is not guaranteed with recent technological advancements such as vertical farming. The question is whether those technological advancements will be put to use to raise the standard of living for every human being on the planet, or are put towards continuing to line the pockets of the wealthiest individuals and their investors. We consume without asking where these things come from – Cristina, Brazil To my mind, it is not the countries in Africa, or groups with a more traditional and much simpler way of life – such as Native people in North and South America, for instance – that have caused so many environmental problems, but the irrationality and consumerism of our western society. It is the fact that we consume without truly asking ourselves where all these goods come from, how they were produced, what the environmental impact is of producting all these mostly useless things. Unless we seriously address these questions, I cannot see any significant change or serious solution to climate change. A convenient way to blame others – Marc, France I‘ve often noticed that some westerners, who have no agenda at all on any environmental question, are keen to invoke “overpopulation” as the main and only threat to survival on Earth. Is overpopulation just a convenient way for westerners to put the blame on Africans for the environmental threats we face? Entitlement to reproduce - Clare, UK How can those with the largest carbon footprint be encouraged not to reproduce, when they are ones who make the greatest impact and have the greatest sense of entitlement? Access to contraception faces a barrier: the church – Angela, UK Pope Francis recently condemned climate change sceptics. He is passionate about protecting the planet and has called on everyone to care for creation, particularly as climate change disproportionately impacts the poor. The Catholic church runs 25% of health and education systems worldwide and therefore, through its direct teaching and management, significantly reduces safe access to contraception for millions of women. No debate on controlling population growth and subsequent pollution can therefore exist without tackling this institutional barrier to action. Last year over 170 theologians issued a statement saying there was no reason for the Catholic church’s position against “artificial” contraception. How does the panel feel the church can continue to do great work on this issue, yet continue to block safe access to contraception for some of the world’s poorest women? Women are being denied choice about pregnancy – Sally, Hong Kong I am a gynaecologist working in Hong Kong, occasionally counselling women considering having another child. If someone is ambivalent about doing so, I add into the decision-making the idea that having more children impacts climate change. Since I was a teenager in the 1970s, I have believed it is a woman’s right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy. Working as a volunteer in an African country where abortion is illegal, I have seen women saved from death after trying to procure an abortion themselves. They were lucky – the hospital was nearby, there were good doctors, antibiotics, surgery, and blood transfusion. In African countries where abortion is often illegal, an unmet need for contraception is also common. I applied for a volunteer job in northern Uganda where women having five to six children is the norm; when asked, they say they would have preferred three or four . Donald Trump’s global gag rule which removes US aid from any NGO providing contraceptive advice, is a huge problem. Not only because maternal mortality due to abortion deaths will rise in Africa, but also because the UNFPA [UN population fund] will stop training midwives, and the resulting reduction in maternal mortality will diminish. In addition, there will be greater unmet need for contraception. With good information couples will do the right thing – Dave, US Do you think our society can reach the point where choosing to have fewer children as an essential carbon-cutting strategy is as widely understood as conserving energy? As a parent I would take a bullet for either of my two children. I’m certain almost all parents would do just about anything to ensure their kids have a decent life. Knowing this, I cannot help but feel that if young couples around the world have good information they will do the right thing. If they understand the ramifications of their family-size decisions on the quality of life – chance of survival even – of their children, then they will make the most loving, compassionate decision possible: to conceive no more than one child. We are failing to get the family-size issue across – Alison, UK I joined Population Matters, an organisation that promotes smaller family size and reduced consumption, to find like-minded people and put my energies into a worthwhile organisation. I appreciate the impact we are having on the environment, and am mindful of that. However, I have found people around me such as family, friends and colleagues are largely not interested, or suggest they should have the freedom to do as they please. How do we start making a difference? Also we seem to have failed with high-profile individuals, royals and celebrities in particular. So what happens now? What will persuade people? Money? – Gwyneth, UK We have to reduce the population, hopefully not by severe climate change, war or disease. China’s one-child solution would not be accepted by most people. What do experts suggest? It seems money has the only power over most people. Should we pay people not to have children? Politicians don’t talk about this – Mike, UK How do we get politicians to talk seriously about the links between population and climate change? The last three elections in the UK have barely mentioned the environment. Is there an agreement between the political parties to avoid this discussion? Childless lifestyles need promoting – Michelle, UK I like children, but have never felt that I would like to have my own. I am very regularly treated as odd for this decision, and feel that if we don’t open up the discussion about not having children, people will never consider this decision thoroughly, whether for the environment or other reasons. In the past three years, I have made a number of lifestyle changes in order to reduce my carbon footprint – which has only further cemented my feeling that I don’t want children. I often feel like I need to keep having what can be sometimes difficult conversations with people about this choice, so as to build conversation momentum around the subject. Alternative lifestyles need to be promoted. I would like to focus on supporting and improving the lives of people already on the planet. Can we ditch our pro-reproduction stance? – Tet-Wo, New Zealand I have made the decision to be childfree, largely due to environmental reasons. As a childfree person, I am constantly surprised how this decision is commonly questioned by others as being a poor or “selfish” choice when the evidence suggests that it is anything but. Given the evidence that having fewer children isthe greatest decision one can make to combat climate change, do the panel think that society can switch from having a pro-reproduction stance, where policies promote reproduction and society views having children as the “correct” choice, to a neutral stance, where having children is considered optional and policies are made to promote other means of having a fulfilled life?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/03/virgil-van-dijk-southampton-holland-liverpool-transfer-no-regrets","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T17:39:26Z","webTitle":"Virgil van Dijk has ‘no regrets’ over transfer request and open to January move","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/03/virgil-van-dijk-southampton-holland-liverpool-transfer-no-regrets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/03/virgil-van-dijk-southampton-holland-liverpool-transfer-no-regrets","fields":{"headline":"Virgil van Dijk has ‘no regrets’ over transfer request and open to January move","bodyText":"Virgil van Dijk has risked his “reintegration” at Southampton by insisting he has “no regrets” over his failed move to Liverpool and reiterated his desire to leave, possibly in January. The Holland centre-half handed in a transfer request in August and made it plain he wanted a move to Anfield. Southampton reported Liverpool to the Premier League for an alleged illegal approach as the transfer collapsed and the Merseyside club were forced into a grovelling apology. In a bid to defuse the situation, they also promised they would back away from the former Celtic player. Southampton refused to buckle during the summer window and the 26-year-old, who signed a new six-year contract in May 2016, was ordered to train alone in July. Since then he has made his way back into the first-team picture, finally making a start on Saturday but giving away a penalty in a 2-1 defeat at Stoke City. However, Van Dijk seems to have reopened old wounds with the Southampton supporters while on international duty. “Halfway through the season, maybe we can see what’s possible,” he told Fox Sports. On the failed switch to Merseyside, he added: “I have no regrets. I wanted to go one step up, but eventually Southampton did not want to let me go. You’re a professional, so now I’ll give everything to the club.” Liverpool’s current defensive resources are stretched with Dejan Lovren admitting he is taking painkillers to get him through games and is unable to train because of back and achilles problems. He will miss Croatia’s World Cup qualifier with Finland on Friday. The Croatia manager Ante Cacic confirmed that the centre-half will be unavailable for the crucial Group I qualifier. “Lovren is playing without training with the help of injections and pills. After every game it takes time for recovery,” Cacic said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/29/sasha-velour-drag-is-darkness-turned-into-power-rupaul-drag-race-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-29T09:00:23Z","webTitle":"Sasha Velour: ‘Drag is darkness turned into power’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/29/sasha-velour-drag-is-darkness-turned-into-power-rupaul-drag-race-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/29/sasha-velour-drag-is-darkness-turned-into-power-rupaul-drag-race-interview","fields":{"headline":"Sasha Velour: ‘Drag is darkness turned into power’","bodyText":"Sasha Velour is the drag persona of Alexander Hedges Steinberg. Born in Berkeley, California, Steinberg studied modern literature at Vassar College, was a Fulbright scholar in Moscow, and in 2013 received an MFA in cartooning. This summer Velour was crowned winner of season nine of RuPaul’s Drag Race. Presented by drag queen, musician and entrepreneur RuPaul Charles, the Emmy award-winning reality TV show is a competition to find “America’s next drag superstar” in which drag queens compete in various challenges, including fashion design, acting, comedy, and lip sync performances. Available on Netflix in the UK, the show is broadcast on American cable television network VH1; the season nine premiere, with a guest appearance by Lady Gaga, attracted close to a million viewers. Sasha Velour was praised for her avant garde runway looks, highbrow humour, and in-depth knowledge of LGBT history. Before you won, your style was described as too intellectual for drag. Is that a misunderstanding of you, of drag, or of intellectualism? A little bit of all those things. Drag has always has been very intellectual: it observes the world and comments on it in really sharp ways, culturally, politically and philosophically. I was raised by intellectuals so I have that quality a little bit, but I’m a big believer in entertainment first – I want to do great drag that’s creative and clever and observational. I think sometimes, especially in America, education and learning have a bit of a bad reputation. People are put off by it, which is a problem, because information is the ultimate weapon that queer people need to arm ourselves with. What has drag meant to you over the years? As a little kid I felt most represented by femme characters in pop culture, so I would dress up as Cinderella or Lady Macbeth or little orphan Annie – I wanted to explore those identities and my own femininity. But as an adult I’ve turned to drag more to deal with real sadness at times, with real suffering, and then translate it through all the glamour and glitter into something that is empowering for me. There were times when coming up with drag performances was the only thing that gave me optimism. After my mum passed away, for example, I threw myself into drag because it gave me hope and joy. That’s why people connect with drag on such a personal level: it’s all that darkness turned into power. How is Sasha different from Alexander? Sasha represents some of the most vulnerable parts of myself – there’s the femininity I hid for many years, the really sensitive and emotional side of myself that I’ve protected a lot – but it also represents this constant strength of being fabulous, which is something I think queer and gay people often turn to when they need strength. And that’s maybe not something I know how to access as Alexander all the time, but Sasha always represents that. What were you like at school? Lost in books and in my head. I was a loner, and spent most of my time drawing in notebooks. But at the same time I took school very seriously. Doing well in school was a way that I protected myself in the social hierarchy of school. Because I wasn’t just very gay, I was also very very small, so being book-smart was my protection a lot of the time. What was it like when your mother was diagnosed with cancer? It was right after I’d finished university and had returned from studying in Russia. I was in New York, she was in Illinois, where I grew up, and I spent a lot of that year visiting her. It was such a transitionary moment – we both were in these strange moments in between things, not knowing what the future would hold – that it sparked a lot of conversations between us and our relationship deepened in many important ways. We became much closer than I ever thought we would be. Which was especially important because I wanted to share what I was learning about drag and about myself with her. She was really open-minded to it in a lot of ways that were really wonderful. And I learned about her experience with cancer in ways that have informed me ever since, in the way I think about beauty and health. It was a very difficult and also very impactful time. She went in and out of health for about five years before she passed away. And she is the reason you’re a bald queen… We had so many conversations about hair and baldness. At first we thought, “Oh, it’ll be so much fun, we’ll go pick out wigs together.” But later on in her treatment she decided to shave all her hair off, and not be afraid of what it looked like, even though that had been her first instinct. That really inspired me, and I saw the beauty and glamour of being bald. I think that was very important for her confidence and for her health, to be able to see that side of it. I wanted to honour that with my representations of beauty through drag. You have a very supportive father, known as Papa Velour, then there’s Boyfriend Velour and your greyhound Vanya Velour. How important is it to have that network? It’s so important. My dad has recently become part of the family of Velour – in the drag community people talk about “chosen family” – which was part of my second childhood growing up as a drag queen. My dad was so supportive that he joined my chosen family as well as being part of my biological family. That is really beautiful, because not everyone has parents who want to be involved in their queer adult lives. What do you think the impact of Drag Race has been since it started in 2009? I watched it on TV for the very first season and was blown away by how entertaining it was. If I’d seen it on television as a little kid, as a teenager, it would have changed my life: seeing queer people succeed, win things, and nail challenges. Or struggle and then come through it in the end. Touring the country I meet young queer people with their parents, which is a new phenomenon: they watch the show together and it changes what they see as possible for their own lives. It’s also a great platform for talking about issues, for example eating disorders in the LGBT community… They don’t shy away from serious topics. People speak to me about being gay in Russia, or dealing with eating disorders, or personal loss, or cancer. These are real things that we have to deal with in our lives. Not just queer people but all people. But then the show is also so full of life and happiness, so it’s a really safe space to have those conversations. Your lip sync performance to Whitney Houston’s So Emotional in the final – fans will know it as the “rose petal moment” – was incredible. How did you come up with the idea? When I perform I like to tell a story on a lot of different levels, with dancing, acting, with the costume, and I love it when there are almost drag magic tricks – surprises, reveals, twists and turns. It helps the lyrics of the song take on their meaning. So I thought of rose petals, because roses are such an important signifier of emotion. I had only been able to practise it one time in the hotel room the night before, and then I had to re-harvest all the rose petals off the carpet because I only had a limited supply. It was really an experiment. I’ll never forget the experience of walking off the stage afterwards, in disbelief. It was a whirlwind of an evening. What are the biggest challenges facing drag today? It’s still difficult to make it as a drag queen if you have not been on the show – and the future of drag needs to be a lot more than just RuPaul’s Drag Race. I hope local drag starts getting appreciated more, so that drag performers can support themselves. And I’m still shocked to discover there are people who think of it as a mental illness. There’s still a lot of ignorance and hate out there. How can drag help bring about political change? I think about that all the time. We need actual change, such as more legal and structural protection for queer people – especially people of colour and trans people. The first step in accomplishing anything is organisation, and drag does bring people together in a really powerful way: it’s a way to get the queer community passionate, get us talking, get us listening. And drag pushes against conservative ideas, over and over again: about gender, success, family. It directly challenges a lot of ideas about what normal American life should look like. You lived in Russia for two and a half years. What was that like? It’s difficult to be gay in Russia, especially in a major city: to feel it’s scary or dangerous to be yourself is a strange feeling. But it’s something a lot of people have to deal with around the world. I guess I took for granted how many freedoms and how much openness we have here. And it’s important we don’t move backwards – having lived in Russia I can see what that would look like. At the same time I was so inspired by how queer people in Russia do find ways to live their lives, how they get dressed in drag and have parties and laugh and have their inside culture. That’s inspiring, that even under horrible conditions they still find a way to live vibrant lives. That gave me hope in a small way. Your research there was about LGBT activism – how did you hide that? I didn’t disclose that at all. I did talk in my proposal about wanting to see the way art has an effect on politics; what I didn’t tell them was that what I was interested in was LGBT activism. It was interesting, because Russians love political art – they love the idea that art is rebellion and resistance. Even today the art world in Russia is full of critiques of Putin and war, but there’s not much dialogue about sexuality. Now that you have a higher profile would you be able to go back safely? That’s something I’ve thought a lot about. I still have my visa, so I certainly can try. I’m curious whether Drag Race has made it to Russia yet. I know it has to a small extent because I interact with people on Twitter. But I think I would still probably stay quite under the radar in Moscow. You are also a comic artist, and have done comics about Stonewall and about your mother… what do you like about them as a medium? Comics are kind of like drag in the sense that you can start with absolutely nothing and create a whole world. They’re almost like a film you can create just with ink and paper, and you see the entirety of an artist’s vision on the page: story and world and characters. Drag does that too: we also build worlds to stage our emotions and the fantasies we want to share with people. How do you feel about Trump as president? It’s horrible and embarrassing and dangerous for our country. We’re already seeing the way it’s inspired people with hate and violence in their hearts to act in his spirit and do real, real harm. I love that drag performers have spoken out against him very specifically. We have to keep doing that. What do you make of his transgender military ban (blaming “tremendous medical costs”)? It’s horrible: it places money above human life. It’s very disturbing, because there are thousands of trans people who have served this country and deserve to be protected. How long do you think the current administration will last? It’s hard to know, unfortunately. A lot of us have given up predicting, because we were confident we knew what the limits of hate were in this country, and were disappointed to discover that we were not right. The challenge is to keep observing, stay informed, and help other people be informed. Earlier this year John Oliver said RuPaul should run for president with the slogan “Make America fierce again”. Would you ever contemplate a future in politics? I’d love it if RuPaul went into politics. But I don’t know if I know any drag queens, myself included, who could deal with the bureaucracy. One of the things that defines drag queens is we don’t put up with bullshit – we’d start complaining as soon as it stopped making sense.

A comfortable win for the US, who are one win (against Trinidad &amp; Tobago on Tuesday) from reaching next year’s World Cup finals. Panama, meanwhile, must quickly regroup if they are to gain a play-off spot ahead of Honduras, who play Costa Rica tomorrow. 87min: Dempsey needs one more goal to break Landon Donovan’s US scoring record but it does not appear he will get it tonight. 78min: A final sub for the US. Alejandro Bedoya replaces Darlington Nagbe. An attendance of 25,303 is announced. 76min: The game is drifting now, with the result in no doubt at all. 70min: And the fans get their wish. On comes Clint Dempsey, replacing Altidore. 67min: “We want Dempsey,” cry the Orlando crowd. Moments after hitting the ball just wide, Bobby Wood makes no mistake with a classy effort. This game is over. 60min: Another change for Panama. Abdiel Arroyo is on for Blas Perez. 56min: Pulisic, sensibly, comes off and is replaced by defensive midfielder Dax McCarty, who hails from the Orlando area. 47min: Pulisic is hacked again by a Panama player.

Surely they will try to bring on some more defensive minded players to ensure the lead. Jozy Altidore makes it three with a cheeky Panenka. Outrageous! 42min: The US have the chance to make it three just before the break as Bobby Wood is brought down inside the Panama area. 36min: Landon Donovan, meanwhile, has boarded the Pulisic hype train. He might be the driver, in fact. 35min: A highly promising stat for the US. 31min: Panama are very much still in this game, though, with the US still somewhat shaky at the back. You would think the home side need at least one more to ensure victory. 26min: Substitution for Panama – and a tactical one, too. Armando Cooper is on for Edgar Bárcenas. 24min: Pulisic was featured in a ‘60 Minutes’ special early this week. He needed just eight minutes to make a mark here, though. 23min: Bobby Wood should have made it three for the US. Arena’s men are all over Panama. Pulisic this time turns provider, expertly beating his man down the left and crosses to Altidore who has the simplest of tasks to tap home. Tensions ease for the US. Pulisic is some player – he deserves to play on the biggest stage and he is doing everything to make sure he will be in Russia next summer. 11min: Pulisic again threatens the Panama defence on the break but he runs out of options and the ball goes out for a corner. The early pressure pays of for Bruce Arena’s men and Christian Pulisic scores a brilliant solo goal, flicking the ball on and rounding the keeper to give US the lead. 6min: Bobby Wood – the hero against Honduras with his late equalizer – expertly controls the ball in the Panama area but shoots just wide. 2min: An early chance for the US. Pulisic dazzles, squares the ball to Altidore whose shot from outside the box is blocked by a defender. 1min: Peep! Panama get us under way. Should Dom Dwyer, who now plays for Orlando City, be playing tonight in front of his home fans? Something to chew over before kick-off. The players are coming out onto the pitch. Kick-off is fast approaching. “This game is monumental for Panama,” says Ian Darke. “Can they grab the chance after their hearts were broken by the US four years ago?” Altidore will start, say ESPN. The president of Panama (Juan Carlos Varela) is at Orlando City Stadium and virtually the entire country back at home, we are told, are watching tonight as Los Canaleros look to reach the World Cup for the first time. Jozy Altidore is limping on the pitch in the pre-match warm-ups, ESPN note. Oh dear! The good people at Sports Illustrated note that nine US players will miss Tuesday’s qualifying finale at Trinidad &amp; Tobago should they pick up a yellow card tonight: Kellyn Acosta, Paul Arriola, DaMarcus Beasley, Alejandro Bedoya, Matt Besler, Michael Bradley, Geoff Cameron, Clint Dempsey and DeAndre Yedlin. Of note, Honduras’ match against Costa Rica has been postponed until Saturday due to severe rainfall caused by tropical storm Nate, meaning the qualifying scenarios will not be fully known tonight. USA: Howard; Yedlin, Gonzalez, Besler, Villafaña; Arriola, Bradley, Nagbe, Pulisic; Wood, Altidore. Panama: Penedo; Murillo, R. Torres, Baloy, Ovalle; Barcenas, Gomez, Godoy, Quintero; G. Torres, Perez. Bruce Arena has – to much surprise – brought in former USA national coach Bob Bradley (now in charge of MLS newcomers LA FC) to help out for tonight’s game. Steve Brenner will be reporting on tonight’s game from Orlando. You can read his splendid preview here. Syria – whose World Cup run has captured the imagination amid a bloody civil war – came from behind to grab a controversial first-leg draw against Australia in Malacca on Thursday. The second leg is in Sydney on Tuesday, on the same day the US face Trinidad and Tobago in their final Concacaf qualifier. Nervous? Many United States supporters certainly are ahead of tonight’s World Cup qualifier against Panama in Orlando. After dismal performances against Costa Rica and Honduras in their previous two qualifiers, Bruce Arena’s men still have their fate in their own hands but now there is almost no margin for error. The US are one of only seven countries who have reached every World Cup since 1990 but a place in an eighth consecutive tournament is far from certain, with just two Concacaf qualifiers to go. It is, to quote Sir Alex Ferguson, squeaky bum time. With the US leading a joint bid with Mexico and Canada to host the 2026 World Cup – and overwhelming favourites to be named hosts by Fifa next year – missing out on Russia 2018 would be devastating for the growth of the game in North America. So there is understandable pressure on Arena to secure victory against Panama tonight. A draw or defeat means the best the US can hope for is a two-legged play-off against either Australia or Syria. And even that is not guaranteed, with Honduras still in the running for qualification. Panama, for their part, can qualify for the World Cup for the first time in their history by beating the Americans so there is plenty at stake tonight. Bob will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s what Alexi Lalas had to say about the US’s woes last month: The former USA international Alexi Lalas launched a tirade against Bruce’s Arena’s team on Sunday, calling the players “underperforming, tattooed millionaires.” After a string of mediocre results, the US could face a playoff against Syria or Australia to qualify for next year’s World Cup – if they make it that far in the first place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/05/david-virellesroman-diaz-gnosis-review-cuban-pianist-and-drums","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T17:45:30Z","webTitle":"David Virelles/Roman Diaz: Gnosis review – inclusive grooves from deft Cuban pianist and drums guru","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/david-virellesroman-diaz-gnosis-review-cuban-pianist-and-drums","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/05/david-virellesroman-diaz-gnosis-review-cuban-pianist-and-drums","fields":{"headline":"David Virelles/Roman Diaz: Gnosis review – inclusive grooves from deft Cuban pianist and drums guru","bodyText":"The 34-year-old Manhattan-resident Cuban pianist David Virelles can sound like a 21st-century jazz heir to Herbie Hancock in other people’s bands (Tomasz Stanko’s, Chris Potter’s) – but his own preferences are for avant-grooving, as on last year’s Antenna and the broadly sourced contemporary classical music that informs a good deal of Gnosis.

Breezy dance rhythms then guide left-hand piano vamps driving right-hand free improv.

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) announced on Tuesday that a majority of its 111,000 members in Royal Mail had voted for industrial action, the first since the company was privatised four years ago. The union said 73.7% of its members had turned out to vote, with 89% of them backing a walkout. Its executive will meet this week to determine any potential strike dates, which are likely to come before the end of the year. Some reports suggested that they could be timed to coincide with the so-called “Black Friday” sales on November 24 and 25, when many people do their Christmas shopping online. The vote was a major test for the union after the introduction of the government’s controversial Trade Union Act, which requires strike ballots to have a 50% turnout. It comes amid a flurry of union activity this autumn as public sector and health workers discuss the possibilities of industrial action. Dave Ward, the CWU general secretary, said: “This is an important moment and we can go forward into any action knowing we have secured the numbers required. We have seen an unprecedented response from our members, and we are taking a lot of confidence from this result. “Our members are under attack. They are being asked to work faster, harder and cheaper while losing benefits. This has nothing to do with driving growth and innovation. It is all about a lack of forward thinking and asset stripping.” Royal Mail said it was very disappointed by the ballot result, which did not necessarily mean a strike would take place. “There are no grounds for industrial action. We want to reach agreement. Royal Mail is committed to further talks as a matter of urgency, to reach agreement with the CWU,” the company said. Royal Mail said contractual dispute resolution procedures agreed to by the company and the CWU meant the dispute would be escalated to independent external mediation, “which we expect will take close to Christmas to be completed, and maybe longer”. It added: “We believe these dispute resolution procedures must be followed. The union cannot take industrial action until they have been completed.” The CWU announced last month that it would be balloting members who worked for Royal Mail group and claimed there were plans to worsen terms and conditions of existing employees and introduce a two-tier workforce. However, it is the pensions row that is at the heart of the dispute, after Royal Mail announced it wanted to end the defined-benefit scheme. In April, the company announced that the pension plan, which has 90,000 members and assets of £7.4bn, was in surplus, but said the scheme would soon become unaffordable. The company, which was privatised in October 2013, pays £400m a year into the fund but it says this could rise to more than £1bn in 2018. The scheme, which was closed to new members in 2008, guarantees a pension based on a postal worker’s average salary. Royal Mail is thought to have plans to replace it with a less generous defined-contribution scheme. In a move that may be copied by other unions, the vote followed a campaign by the CWU called the “four pillars”, which calls for a decent wage in retirement, a shorter working week, a redesign of the company’s methods and an extension of current agreements. The union has held a series of “gate meetings” outside sorting offices to gain support among members before the ballot. Royal Mail argues it is operating in the most competitive delivery market in the world, with 16 major competitors including Amazon, which handles one in 10 parcel deliveries. Letter volumes have declined 40% in the past 10 years as people increasingly prefer email. Royal Mail says it has spent £1.5bn on upgrading its IT systems to cope with the new world of technology. After 12 months in the job, postal workers earn £22,764 a year. Royal Mail says under its proposed scheme, someone aged 50, earning £25,000 a year and retiring at 65 would retire on an annual pension of £12,300 and a tax-free lump sum of £81,800. It says this compares favourably with most other retirement deals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/03/a-new-way-to-study-our-universe-what-gravitational-waves-mean-for-future-science-nobel-physics","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T16:22:47Z","webTitle":"'A new way to study our universe': what gravitational waves mean for future science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/03/a-new-way-to-study-our-universe-what-gravitational-waves-mean-for-future-science-nobel-physics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/03/a-new-way-to-study-our-universe-what-gravitational-waves-mean-for-future-science-nobel-physics","fields":{"headline":"'A new way to study our universe': what gravitational waves mean for future science","bodyText":"You wait 100 years for a gravitational wave and then four come along at once. Or so it must seem to those who spent decades designing and building the exquisite instruments needed to sense the minuscule ripples in spacetime that Albert Einstein foresaw in his 1915 theory of general relativity. The first gravitational wave bagged by physicists reached Earth on 14 September 2015 and sent a quiver through the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo). The second hit three months later, on Boxing Day, followed by a third in January this year. When the fourth wave arrived in August, both Ligo and a second observatory in Italy, named Virgo, recorded the moment. Each of the gravitational waves had been set in motion by violent collisions between black holes more than a billion years ago. But while detecting the waves was feat enough to land the Nobel prize in physics for Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne, what excites astronomers now is what they stand to learn about the universe. “This is a story in two parts,” said Sheila Rowan, director of the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow. “The first part was the quest to make these instruments sensitive enough to make the first detection, but that’s the end of one story and the start of another. We are really on the threshold of a whole new way to study our universe and that’s hugely exciting.” Until now, astronomers have mapped the heavens almost exclusively with telescopes that gather light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Optical telescopes, such as Hubble, have allowed scientists to gaze deep into the history of the universe, but these observations hit a hard limit at about 400,000 years after the big bang: back then, the universe was opaque to light. Gravitational waves are not so easily blocked. Although they are weak, they are hard to mask, and so future observations of the waves could allow scientists to break through the optical limit and see what the universe looked like moments after the big bang. “At some point, not with the detectors we have now, we hope to be able to look at the beginnings of the universe,” said Rainer Weiss, the physicist at MIT who shared Tuesday’s Nobel prize in physics with other members of the Ligo team. “There are calculations that indicate that the very earliest instants of the universe, right after the universe gets born, there is an enormous amount of background radiation of gravitational waves generated. That would be one of the most fascinating things man could [see] because it will tell you very much how the universe starts.” The earliest gravitational waves were probably emitted a fraction of a second after the big bang, when the universe went from being smooth and structureless to clumpy, at which point spacetime became “bendy”. Professor Andreas Freise, a Ligo project scientist at the University of Birmingham, said: “One of the mysteries is how we get from there to now where everything is clumpy.” The transition is thought to have left a gravitational wave imprint on the entire universe, which might be visible with future detectors more sensitive than Ligo. There are plenty more phenomena scientists hope to spot sooner. Gravitational waves spread out from cosmic events that accelerate huge quantities of matter. This happens when a star explodes, but until now, all astronomers have seen is the bright flash of light that marks a star’s death. By studying gravitational waves, scientists hope to learn for the first time what happens inside a collapsing star. “It should produce a gravitational wave signal and it’s a signal that would give us information that currently we can’t get any other way, because it’s about what’s happening inside a collapsing star,” Rowan said. When Ligo switched on, scientists thought that the first waves they spotted were likely to come from collisions between neutron stars, some of the most exotic entities in the universe. Neutron stars form when massive stars die. They have crusts and crystalline cores and are incredibly dense: a teaspoon of neutron star weighs as much as Mount Everest. “Some supernovae explode and end up as black holes, but others end up as neutron stars,” said Pedro Ferreira, professor of astrophysics at Oxford University and author of the 2014 book The Perfect Theory: a century of geniuses and the battle over general relativity. “The thing the Ligo scientists expected to see, and might see soon, are two neutron stars orbiting each other and coming together. If you can see these events you start learning about fundamental physics, and that is pretty amazing.” Other countries, including Japan and India, have plans to build their own gravitational wave detectors. More ambitiously, the European Space Agency intends to send an observatory into space in 2034. Known as Lisa, for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, the mission aims to detect far weaker gravitational waves than is possible on Earth. “Many of us who were in this thing fully expect that we’re going to learn things that we didn’t know about,” said Weiss. “We knew about black holes other ways, and we knew about neutron stars. We hope that there are all sorts of phenomena that you can see mostly because of the gravitational waves they emit. That will open a new science.” • This article was amended on 13 December 2017 to correct the date Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity from 1905 to 1915."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/04/factory-farming-destructive-wasteful-cruel-says-philip-lymbery-farmageddon-author","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T10:36:51Z","webTitle":"Why factory farming is not just cruel – but also a threat to all life on the planet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/04/factory-farming-destructive-wasteful-cruel-says-philip-lymbery-farmageddon-author","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/04/factory-farming-destructive-wasteful-cruel-says-philip-lymbery-farmageddon-author","fields":{"headline":"Why factory farming is not just cruel – but also a threat to all life on the planet","bodyText":"The world desperately needs joined-up action on industrial farming if it is to avoid catastrophic impacts on life on earth, according to the head of one of the world’s most highly regarded animal campaign groups. Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) and the author of Farmageddon and more recently Deadzone, said: “Every day there is a new confirmation of how destructive, inefficient, wasteful, cruel and unhealthy the industrial agriculture machine is. We need a total rethink of our food and farming systems before it’s too late.” His comments came on the eve of Compassion’s Livestock and Extinction conference in London which will bring together scientists, campaigners, UN representatives and multinational food corporations including Compass, Tesco and McDonalds. The conference aims to bring together a wide ranges of voices and connect up the many impacts that factory farming has on our planet. The conference comes against a backdrop of alarming exposés of industrial farming. A week ago a Guardian/ITV investigation showed chicken factory staff in the UK changing crucial food safety information on chickens, while a month ago the European commission admitted that eggs containing a harmful pesticide may have been on sale in as many as 16 countries. In the US in August, meanwhile, campaigners identified the world’s largest ever “deadzone” – an area in the sea where pollutants from farms create algal blooms that kill off or disperse marine life – and singled out the US’s heavily industrialised factory farm system as a major cause. In an interview with the Guardian, Lymbery said that when he began campaigning on farm animals in 1990, it was still largely seen as a cruelty issue rather than something that went far beyond that. Since taking over as chief executive of CIWF in 2005, Lymbery has focused on “moving the issue out of being a technical niche to get people to understand industrial farming as a big, global problem”. “We need to go beyond an isolated approach,” Lymbery says. “Not just looking at the technical problems around welfare, not just looking at the technical issues around the environment, not just looking at food security in isolation, but putting all of these issues together, then we can see the real problem that lies at the heart of our food system – industrial agriculture.” Lymbery argues that factory farming is not – as some contend – an efficient, space-saving way to produce the world’s food but rather a method in which the invisible costs are actually far higher than the savings. “Factory farming is shrouded in mythology,” he said. “One of the myths is that it’s an efficient way of producing food when actually it is highly inefficient and wasteful. “Another [myth] is that the protagonists will say that it can be good for the welfare of the animals. After all, if hens weren’t happy they wouldn’t lay eggs. “The third myth is that factory farming saves space. On the surface it looks plausible, because, by taking farm animals off the land and cramming them into cages and confinement you are putting an awful lot of animals into a small space. But what is overlooked in that equation is you are then having to dedicate vast acreages of relatively scarce arable land to growing the feed. “The crops fed to industrially reared animals worldwide could feed an extra four billion [people] on the planet.” As the global demand for cheap meat grows, the expansion of agricultural land is putting more and pressure on our forests, rivers and oceans, contributing to deforestation, soil erosion, marine pollution zones and the global biodiversity crisis, he said. “The UN has warned that if we continue as we are, the world’s soils will have effectively gone within 60 years. And then what? We shouldn’t look to the sea to bail us out because commercial fisheries are expected to be finished by 2048 … “The rainforest homes of the likes of jaguars and the critically endangered sumatran elephants are being razed to make way for intensive crop production and plantations that are feeding factory farm animals ... the mixed farm habitats of once common farmland birds such as barn owls, turtle doves and skylarks are being stripped away, and ... vast quantities of wild fish are being scooped up to feed industrially reared farmed fish and chickens and pigs, leaving the likes of penguins, puffins and other species starving.” Antibiotic use is another red flag area. “There is now overwhelming evidence that the routine prophylactic use of antibiotics is leading to the rise of antibiotic resistant superbugs, and the World Health Organisation has issued warnings that if we don’t do something to curb antibiotic use in both human and animal medicine we will face a post-antibiotic era where currently treatable diseases will once again kill.” Although some countries, the UK and the US for example, are now trying to cut back, antibiotic use is totally unregulated in other parts of the world: in China the farmers can just prescribe and administer antibiotics for themselves. Lymbery believes that we already know the answer to this problem. Compassion advocates a reduction in meat-eating (Lymbery himself is vegan) but is not “anti-meat”. In the long term regenerative farming – a broad term that includes all sorts of practices such as rotational grazing, tree planting, improving soils, reducing chemical inputs, silvopasture and increasing biodiversity – is, Lymbery believes, our only hope and a movement whose time has come. “Hilal Elver, the UN rapporteur for the right to food, has talked about the need to move away from industrial agriculture towards agro-ecological models. There is a groundswell – it’s almost starting to be a zeitgeist as key thinkers in civil society start to join the dots and see that actually we do need a new style of agriculture which goes beyond industrial agriculture, which goes beyond simple sustainability, which brings us to a point of regeneration.” On the whole national governments have shown little interest in radical farming reform. But there have been a few notable exceptions such as India, Rwanda and Kenya, and the international community and the corporate world is increasingly interested in financing and supporting these models (USaid is funding a fantastic agroforestry project, although they may be hoping that Trump doesn’t realise this). And in the last few months there has been some support from surprising quarters, such as Michael Gove, the UK’s environment secretary, and his recent statement that US-style industrial farming will not be copied here. In the recent lead-up to the appointment of the head of the WHO, more than 200 scientists and campaigners signed a letter asking the appointee to promise to look at the “global health challenge” of factory farming which was widely circulated on social media and led to an editorial in the New York Times. So how likely is it that we will get global action on food and farming? “I am sure that 20 years ago people calling for a solution to climate change were being asked exactly that question,” says Lymbery. “I believe that nothing less will be needed if we are to secure the future for our children.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2017/oct/12/tonights-live-music-acts-will-mostly-be-male-only-whats-holding-women-back","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T05:00:31Z","webTitle":"Live music acts are mostly male-only.

What's holding women back?","bodyText":"From the moment a woman takes an interest in music, she enters a culture that is dominated by men – whether it’s the staff in record shops, the bands in your local pub or the roadies for stadium gigs. In the UK, women make up just 5% of all sound engineers, according to industry group SoundGirls. The Music Producers Guild estimates only 6% of its members are women. Tonight, more than two-thirds of the live music acts performing in the UK will feature no women on stage, according to a Guardian analysis. Of the 370 gigs listed for 12 October on the Ents24.com listings website, 69% of the acts (255) are made up entirely of men, while just 9% (33) are female-only (half of these are solo artists). Of the 82 mixed-gender acts, just under three-quarters contain no more than one woman in the line-up. Ents24 says this pattern is consistent for the year: 74% of tickets sold via the site in 2017 have been for all-male acts. Leading female musicians and industry figures say the intimidation and exclusion begins in childhood, with girls not being encouraged to play guitar or join bands. Many shared anecdotes of the frustrations and vulnerabilities they’ve felt as female artists: “An old manager told me that he wouldn’t be sending out my music, he would just send out my photo to labels,” recalls writer and musician Emma-Lee Moss, known as Emmy the Great. “But you just have to battle through that.” “If you prevent women from seeing any examples of them achieving, then it prevents them from believing they can achieve it,” says guitarist and singer-songwriter Laura Marling, who addressed gender inequality and its effects in her podcast Reversal of the Muse. “In my experience there are surface visible things, like touring on my own and then realising that all the people I perform with are men. Or that I wasn’t encouraged as much to play the guitar as men,” says Marling. “For women to achieve they have to go around that bump; they have to be as good, if not better, than their male counterparts.” Predictably, this gender disparity is evident right up to the highest levels of the industry. Of this summer’s festival headliners in the UK, eight out of 10 were male; on the business side, just 30% of senior executive roles are occupied by women. “It’s a misrepresentation of our own identity, as we have a society where 50% of the population are women,” says Vanessa Reed, CEO of the PRS for Music Foundation, a leading music charity. “If you’re underrepresented in an industry, you’re going to feel like you have less reason to put yourself forward or less chance of getting support. You need to see it if you’re going to be it,” she says. Hip hop artist Shay D, one of the acts performing in London tonight, says female performers are still treated as a “novelty” by promoters. “I’ve had so many issues with promoters who want to book you because ‘they need some female energy’,” she says. “What’s so annoying is that it’s only when they need to fill a quota or to look as if they’re being fair.” The Guardian analysed the gender split of music performances listed for the 12 October on the Ents24 website as of 4 October. The analysis focused on contemporary popular music categories such as rock, indie, electronic and folk, excluding classical music and tribute acts. In a few instances the gender breakdown of acts was unclear, for example solo artists who may perform with a backing band, and could not be confirmed. Shopping for a boyfriend? The lack of female representation is even present at music stores, one of the first places you go when you start playing an instrument. The experiences of women in these male-dominated spaces have sparked widely shared anecdotes – from being asked if they’re shopping for a boyfriend, to the assumption that they have no knowledge of instruments or equipment. “My personal biases are certainly there – my experiences have tainted me in a way – but you check yourself in those environments because you’re alien there,” says Marling. “There’s a stereotype of a curmudgeonly man [in guitar shops] who collects things he doesn’t want anyone to touch. But it’s a different intimidation women feel.” Marling can only recall buying a guitar from a woman once, at Fanny’s House of Music in Nashville, Tennessee. The shop’s owners, Pamela Cole and Leigh Maples, met studying music in the 1980s as the only two female bassists in their class. They founded and manage Fanny’s together, to create an inclusive space for women. “We’ve tried to be comfortable for everybody, including men,” says Cole. “I don’t think there’s another guitar shop in the world that does it our way – that has only women [guitarists] on the walls and is run by women. Which is daunting.” Marling says she never felt intimidated in Fanny’s music shop. “It must be what it feels like for men,” she adds. “Women are completely readjusting our idea of what our futures will be – and men are also readjusting. But it’s hard, and it takes time.” Buying your first instrument is “a huge moment for a person who wants to be a musician”, says Moss. “It’s a real shame when someone is interested in music and is put down by someone behind a counter. The way to combat that is to make sure there’s enough of a support network around everyone so that when you go to a friend and say, ‘I couldn’t buy the guitar I wanted because I felt embarrassed’, they will tell you that’s bullshit.” In the UK, the PRS Foundation launched Women Make Music in 2011, a programme to encourage more female songwriters and composers to come forward for music-related grants, after they discovered just 16% of applications were from women. Dice, a gig listings app, started Girls Music Day in 2016: a series of talks to inspire young women to get involved in the music industry. And this year, PRS Foundation and Festival Republic launched ReBalance: a Leeds-based programme to offer studio time for female-led bands, and promote female producers and engineers. Sadie Dupuis, of the band Speedy Ortiz, says she tries to only work with promoters who prioritise gender diversity. “Promoters should do the same thing; look at the bills you’re booking and make sure you’re creating an environment on stage that can make the crowd feel safe and like they’re welcome at the show,” she says. For music journalist Jen Long, inspiring the next generation is paramount. “How do you change people’s perceptions? By putting on events, raising awareness that girls can do this, and giving girls positive female role models,” she says. According to Moss, “When powerful organisations like PRS start trying to make movements and conversations happen, that’s when the rules change and that’s when grants are created. “The most important thing for helping women is to give them the means and space and the channels to do that, so it would be great if the music labels followed suit,” she says. “That – and just telling every women you know who wants to be a musician that yes, she can.” If you have experiences relating to this article that you’d like to share, email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com Follow the Guardian’s Inequality Project on Twitter here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/07/mum-at-24-judged-by-friends-family-strangers","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T05:45:13Z","webTitle":"Why do we assume young mums are ‘troubled’?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/07/mum-at-24-judged-by-friends-family-strangers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/07/mum-at-24-judged-by-friends-family-strangers","fields":{"headline":"Why do we assume young mums are ‘troubled’?","bodyText":"“So, does Freddy’s mum work full time, then?” It’s the nursery summer picnic, and it has happened again. Another mum thinks I’m the au pair. “Well, actually she does, but she took the day off today and here she is!” I humorously explain to quickly avoid any awkwardness. Seeing a woman under 30 with a child made her think I could only be hired help. Not that I blame her. The only time we see a mother under 30, they are portrayed as “struggling” or “troubled” in some way. They certainly aren’t sharing your Laura Ashley picnic rug at the nursery. When I revealed I was pregnant, my news was received with disbelief by my peers. Some even laughed and one said: “Well, it’s quite shocking because, y’know, you aren’t from a council estate.” I was 24, not 14, and my choice to keep my unplanned baby was condemned from the outset. Being pregnant and looking young felt like being under a microscope. The bigger the bump grew, the more I feared the judgment of strangers. I felt so out of place that I didn’t join an NCT group, something I later regretted when I found I had no friends with babies. But having to constantly explain my pregnancy, especially after his dad opted out when I was two months gone, was exhausting. “First-time mum? But you look so young to have a baby!” was said to me almost daily. A thinly veiled judgmental weigh-up was usually followed with: “Was it a surprise?” Turn the tables for a second and imagine asking a stranger: “Aren’t you a bit old to be a mum?” Every time someone says, “You’re doing so well, considering everything,” what it really means is: “I didn’t expect you to be doing so well.” The subtext is that because my life hasn’t imploded, I am an exception to the rule. Anyone of any age or circumstance has the aptitude to be an incredible parent whether they are 15 or 40. Being younger doesn’t remove the capacity to love your child unconditionally. “I’m so proud of what you’ve managed to do,” friends will say, with the implication being that young mothers don’t achieve, they don’t reach their goals and when they do, it’s a surprise. “You can tell me it’s a struggle,” health visitors offer sympathy where it really isn’t needed, prodding away, convinced there must be some cause for concern that could eventually be prized out and presented to social services. Meanwhile, strangers assume I stay in, funded by the state, being suffocated by motherhood and dirty nappies while my social and employment opportunities evaporate. People in their 20s tell me they “just have so much to do” that they “couldn’t possibly have a baby yet”. I was recently on a flight to Spain on my own with Freddy, struggling to settle him into his seat, when an older man called me a “silly little girl” and told me to control my child. My son had just turned one when an older mum told me to leave a queue in the supermarket. She said that in her experience it could harm him being left to cry. He wasn’t screaming or in distress and I was doing everything I could to appease him. She went on to leave the queue herself – the crying was upsetting her baby she said. If you are or look young, on your own, with a tantrumming toddler, the instant assumption is that you have lost control and your parenting is questioned. It can’t just be that you have a tired toddler. Although there is no wrong time to have children, and your children really don’t know or care how old you are, the media seems hellbent on the idea that all women work through their 20s and 30s, freeze their eggs and settle down in their 40s. Meanwhile, men are too busy being babies to want to have them. I was socialised to see my 20s as a time to explore myself, drink, travel, be irresponsible and selfish. Having children was seen as “settling down”, and it was drilled into me that I couldn’t possibly be ready and actively seek this in my 20s. Possibly a byproduct of the “don’t get pregnant” sex education hammered into me through adolescence, early motherhood meant career suicide, boredom, getting fat, saggy boobs, the end of romance, sleep and joy, generally dumbing yourself down, depression, poverty and exhaustion. I felt the stigma from myself, especially during pregnancy, so when everything worked out fine, even I was surprised. I now know that life doesn’t end because you have a baby in your 20s. Instead, having a child has given me tenfold motivation and confidence to accomplish goals and set new ones. While I establish myself, my son and I are maturing and growing up together. Now a single mum, I recently had a boyfriend whose family couldn’t understand the fact I had a child at 27 and were saddened by my “plight”. “What on earth did your mother have to say when you came home and said you were pregnant?” the older relation said, aghast. My mum said what you would expect to a self-sufficient 24-year-old living on her own: “It’s your decision.” It was hardly teenage-pregnancy territory, after all. This same relation later said: “I’m sure we will come to terms with it. It’s just such a shame.” I thought once I became a mother, I wouldn’t care about what other people say. But I’ve quickly realised that I do care, because I’m still me – just also a mum. Motherhood hasn’t transformed who I am. Unfortunately – or perhaps fortunately – the mum bit is an add on. I still get embarrassed, take knocks, I get shy and self-conscious. Only now, I’m not just representing me, I’m also representing two people – meaning criticism hits where it hurts the most. Parenting is tough, exhausting, mentally and physically draining however many years you have been on the planet and the last thing anyone needs is someone asking how old you are. Rearing a human is difficult regardless of how many candles were on your last birthday cake. It should be commonsense that a mother who feels encouraged in her parenting abilities will always do a better job than one who feels judged by those around her. Every parent needs support instead of judgment, no matter their age. The year you were born isn’t what makes a great parent. There are rubbish young mums, there are rubbish older mums – your ability as a parent is not defined by age."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-active-shooter-harvest-country-music-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T14:53:37Z","webTitle":"Mandalay Bay attack: at least 59 killed in deadliest US shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-active-shooter-harvest-country-music-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-active-shooter-harvest-country-music-festival","fields":{"headline":"Mandalay Bay attack: at least 59 killed in deadliest US shooting","bodyText":"At least 59 people were killed in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history on Sunday night, when a gunman opened fire on an open-air music festival from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino on the Las Vegas strip. A further 527 people were injured, Las Vegas police said, as casualty figures continued to rise. The death toll surpassed the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, when 49 people were killed. The suspected gunman was identified as Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old local man who police believe booked into the Mandalay Bay on 28 September. He was found dead after officers stormed his room, where they recovered 17 guns. A brother of the suspect living in central Florida, Eric Paddock, said he was “dumbfounded”. “He’s not an avid gun guy at all,” the brother said. “The fact that he had those kind of weapons is just … he has no military background or anything like that.” Speaking at the White House, Donald Trump called the attack “an act of pure evil”. He did not discuss possible motives for the attack, saying federal and local authorities would provide updates. Nor did he call for new gun control measures or other government action to confront the US epidemic of mass shootings. “America comes together as one and it always has,” Trump said. “We call upon the bonds that unite us: our faith, our family and our shared values.” Trump said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday and directed that flags outside government buildings be flown at half-staff. He still planned to visit hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico on Tuesday. The FBI said it had found “no connection with an international terrorist group”. The Clark County sheriff, Joe Lombardo, said police had found nothing to suggest a motive for the attack. “We’ve checked all the federal databases and Nevada databases and we have no knowledge of this individual,” he said. “I can’t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.” The Mandalay Bay hotel sits across Las Vegas Boulevard from the Route 91 Harvest country music festival site, where people were watching the final performances on Sunday night when the attack began. Two off-duty officers were among the dead, and the overall toll could rise, Lombardo said. Quick-response police teams found the gunman’s room when a smoke detector was activated by the gunfire, police said. The suspect had used a hammer or similar device to break hotel room windows to clear his line of fire, Lombardo said. Police said the suspect killed himself before they entered the room. Witnesses who fled the scene described seeing muzzle flashes from the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay and hearing what they described as sustained automatic gunfire. “It was very obvious it was gunfire coming down into the crowd,” said Jackie Hoffing, who lives in Las Vegas. “It was hysteria. There were people trampled. I was with my husband. He stayed with me. We jumped walls, climbed cars, ran for our lives. I’ve never run that hard or been that scared in my whole life.” Desiree Price, who was visiting from San Diego, had blood on her shirt and trousers. “We heard shots like firecrackers,” she said. “I helped someone who was bleeding. Two girls hid behind a car with us right outside the concert. One girl was shot in her leg, the other in her shoulder. It didn’t stop so we all ran – we kept going.” Marilou Danley, a 62-year-old Australian woman identified as Paddock’s room-mate and elsewhere as his girlfriend, was initially named as a person of interest, but police later said she was out of the country at the time of the attack and cleared her of any involvement. Local officials urged residents to make blood donations. “We need blood, so if anybody could contribute blood, anybody in the Las Vegas area or locally could do that,” said Nevada’s governor, Brian Sandoval. Guests at the hotel were allowed to return to their rooms late on Monday morning after being sheltered overnight in a large arena nearby. The shooting began during a performance by the country music star Jason Aldean. As the 22,000 people in the crowd began to run, the music stopped temporarily and started up again before another round of gunshots sent the performers ducking for cover and fleeing the stage, a witness told the Associated Press. Jake Owen, a country music star who played the set before Aldean’s, wrote on Twitter that “gun shots were ringing off of the stage rigging and road cases”. He suggested that the gunman was aiming at the stage at times. “No one knew where to go,” he said. Many of those who ran from the festival site sought refuge in nearby motels, parking garages and apartment complexes. At a gas station across the street, survivors reunited with friends. Some were teary-eyed and still shaking with fear. Kevin Kropf, from Orange County, California, said: “I stayed in the venue for a long time until there was nobody else there. I saw a Swat team go in and a Swat team go out. I didn’t want to get up because I didn’t want to get mistaken for a bad guy and get shot. So I was just huddling behind a table. “I saw a couple [of] people on the street covered up with sheets and them loading one girl into the back of a truck. She was definitely dead … Whoever she was with was in the back of the truck too. He was a mess.” Flights resumed at the city’s McCarran international airport on Monday morning after all planes were temporarily grounded on Sunday evening. Las Vegas city hall said it was a “very sad night for Las Vegas” and warned members of the public to stay away from the south end of the Vegas strip, where the Mandalay Bay is located. The music festival has been held for the past four years on a 15-acre lot across the strip from the hotel and casino."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/02/tony-abbott-renews-attack-on-macklemore-and-reveals-preference-for-savage-garden","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T04:09:37Z","webTitle":"Tony Abbott renews attack on Macklemore – and reveals preference for Savage Garden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/tony-abbott-renews-attack-on-macklemore-and-reveals-preference-for-savage-garden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/02/tony-abbott-renews-attack-on-macklemore-and-reveals-preference-for-savage-garden","fields":{"headline":"Tony Abbott renews attack on Macklemore – and reveals preference for Savage Garden","bodyText":"Tony Abbott has attempted to reignite his feud with Macklemore – despite the rapper being on a plane back to the US – by saying that an Australian artist should have been chosen to perform at the NRL grand final and also revealing that he prefers Savage Garden, a band whose lead singer is gay and in a same-sex marriage. The former Australian prime minister created international headlines last week when he used Twitter to criticise the league for choosing the US performer to play at Sunday’s final because he’s a supporter of same-sex marriage, stating: “Footy fans shouldn’t be subjected to a politicised grand final.” Abbott is a prominent voice for the no campaign in Australia’s non-binding voluntary postal survey on same-sex marriage. His tweet prompted a bizarre week in which the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, suggested that an anti same-sex marriage song should also be performed at the game in the interest of balance and Abbott’s daughter Frances used social media to express her support for Macklemore. Macklemore himself responded to Abbott’s criticism by saying he would “go harder”. At Sunday’s game performed his song Same Love and ended the emotional performance with a call for “equality for all”. But in an interview with the 2GB broadcaster Ray Hadley on Monday, Abbott refused to move on from his criticism of the choice of the US rapper. He said it was a “good question” why John Farnham hadn’t been chosen to perform instead and revealed he’s a fan of the Traveling Wilburys and Savage Garden. The lead singer of Savage Garden, Darren Hayes, and his partner, Richard Cullen, have had three marriage ceremonies as a way of advocating for same-sex marriage rights. Hayes responded on Twitter, saying he was “no fan” of Abbott. But Abbott denied that he was pushing for a ban on Macklemore performing, telling Hadley: “We could have got someone who was A, Australian and, B, not going to be contentious on this current issue.” Macklemore’s performance was greeted with applause at the game and on social media but was boycotted by 2GB and Hadley in their coverage. Instead they broadcast a parody song written by Hadley in 2013 in which he raps about his inability to make it as a professional footballer to the beat of Same Love. Referring to his career as a match caller, the song includes the line: “Maybe that’s why I’m still in this position, 58 years old and still on air gibbering.” On Melbourne’s 3AW, Neil Mitchell said the broadcast was “unprofessional and embarrassing”. “Really, I was appalled,” he said. “It’s nothing to do with censorship, it just sounded awful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/02/attacks-on-the-credibility-of-abuse-survivors-are-not-justified-by-research","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T02:18:49Z","webTitle":"Attacks on the credibility of abuse survivors are not justified by research | Michael Salter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/02/attacks-on-the-credibility-of-abuse-survivors-are-not-justified-by-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/02/attacks-on-the-credibility-of-abuse-survivors-are-not-justified-by-research","fields":{"headline":"Attacks on the credibility of abuse survivors are not justified by research","bodyText":"For a quarter of a century, the concept of “false memories” has provided a scientific fig leaf for sceptics of child sexual abuse allegations. The “false memory” argument is deceptively simple: children and adults are prone to invent false memories of child sexual abuse that never occurred, particularly if encouraged by a therapist or some other authority figure. So-called “recovered memories”, in which adults recall sexual abuse in childhood after a period of amnesia, have been a particular focus of disbelief. In fact, scientific studies find that children are far less suggestible than we have been led to believe. Brain imaging studies have identified the neurological mechanisms involved in the process of forgetting and then recalling sexual abuse as an adult. Delayed disclosure and amnesia are now understood as normal coping mechanisms in response to abuse. However, for those uncomfortable with the social and legal reforms required to address child sexual abuse, the idea that large numbers of allegations are the product of “false memories” remains attractive. This argument underpins recent reporting in the Australian, which has called into question the findings of the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, on the basis that sexual abuse survivor testimony cannot be trusted. Two lengthy articles have raised doubts about the recent prosecution of a mother and father for the prolonged sadistic abuse of their daughter, and challenged the trauma history of anti-abuse campaigner Dr Cathy Kezelman. This reporting links therapy to the spectres of false memories and false allegations. The implication is that any child or adult who makes allegations of abuse after receiving mental health care may be suffering from therapy-induced delusions. The “false memory” argument arose in the early 1990s. During this period, adults began pursuing criminal and civil actions for sexual abuse in childhood in large numbers. These legal proceedings were complex, since the alleged offences had often taken place decades ago. Many adults had sought mental health care for the effects of abuse prior to court action. In response, people accused of abuse claimed that therapy was the cause of the abuse allegations. They paid psychology academics to testify in court about the fallibility and suggestibility of memory. Their theories of “false memories” were widely covered in the mass media by journalists who were dubious of the sudden increase in reports and prosecution of sexual abuse. Of course, no memory is a pristine record of facts. From the moment it is produced, memory is shaped by interpretation as much as experience, and the meaning and availability of any given memory changes over time. However, the new science of trauma and memory has shown that the assertions of “false memory” advocates were exaggerated. Overwhelming experiences of abuse are encoded differently in the brain than other memories, and can produce amnesia and forgetting. My research has found that many perpetrators of severe abuse deliberately traumatise children in order to take advantage of this mechanism and prevent victims from disclosing. It is vital that abused children and adults receive therapeutic support to address the psychological changes caused by sexual abuse, and their testimony should be taken seriously by law enforcement and the criminal courts. Nonetheless, the imperative to deny and suppress these allegations is as strong as ever. Sexual abuse is a crime of the status quo. Offenders get away with abuse because they are camouflaged within their legitimate roles (as parents, relatives, friends, clergy, teachers and so on) in the lives of children. As a result, allegations of sexual abuse are always a challenge to authority, revealing the weaknesses and failings of treasured social institutions. In response, many are driven to reject the allegations outright, rather than examine the uncomfortable truths they reveal. For instance, church representatives have accused journalists of pursuing clergy abuse as part of a secular attack on Christianity. Conservatives are suspicious that feminists and the state have exaggerated the problem of sexual abuse to expand control over the family and intimate life. Many progressives frame public concern over sexual abuse as a “moral panic” driven by unfounded anxiety over child safety. For those who see hidden agendas driving abuse allegations, the “false memory” theory remains as compelling as ever. They find their suspicions reaffirmed by those academics who earn significant sums promoting “false memory” theories in court on behalf of men accused of sexual abuse. This practice has been criticised as a “conflict of interest”, since objectivity is compromised when academics have such a large financial stake in interpreting research findings in specific ways. In this light, attacks on the credibility of abuse survivors and advocates, and on the findings of the royal commission, need to be placed in political context. Despite their appeals to scientific expertise, such attacks are not justified by research on sexual abuse and traumatic memory; far from it. The royal commission has revealed the pervasiveness of sexual abuse in child-focused institutions. Recent prosecutions, and the brave testimony of survivors such as Cathy Kezelman, highlights how family dynamics are manipulated by perpetrators of incest, to the point where non-abused siblings may be entirely unaware of the plight of the victim and groomed to disbelieve them if they disclose. Perpetrators have many ways of drawing naive bystanders into a position of collusion or collaboration. Responding to the needs and rights of sexual abuse survivors will always prompt resistance from those wedded to the status quo, whether for personal, financial or ideological reasons. The success of this resistance is evident in ongoing epidemic levels of abuse, and low rates of reporting and prosecution. Abuse needs our complicity. Due process and fair treatment of survivors, as well as the accused, requires a clear minded assessment of how facts and science are often distorted by the relations of power that make abuse possible.

Of course the Pats try to win their first four games but the winning sometimes seems secondary to the bigger goal of trying to build a champion at season’s end. “They are definitely a better second-half team,” former NFL general manager and current NFL Network analyst Charley Casserly told me a few weeks ago. “It seems the players learn the system more then and Bill Belichick learns more about the players and then they get better and better as the games go on.” This is why New England’s 2-2 start after Sunday’s 33-30 loss to the Carolina Panthers shouldn’t be seen as proof that the Patriots are falling apart. The 2011 lockout produced a collective bargaining agreement that cut offseason and training camp practice time. Ever since, Pats coach Belichick has tried to experiment in September and early October, testing players in certain situations and showing plays that will complicate the preparation of coaches who have to plan against them later in the year. Often, Belichick’s early tinkering leaves the Patriots looking sluggish and leads to early- and mid-October storylines of the “What’s wrong with the Patriots?” variety. Usually, they turn out to be just fine, storming through November and December to division titles and deep postseason runs. Already this season Tom Brady has thrown for 1,399 yards and 10 touchdowns against zero interceptions. He is playing as well, at the age of 40, as he has in his career. Even with Julian Edelman out for the season with a torn ACL, he has found ways to find his other top targets, including tight end Rob Gronkowski and receiver Danny Amendola. The Pats offensive line continues to give him time to fire passes all over the field. But New England’s defense is struggling. A lot. Brady might be great, but as his wife, Gisele Bundchen screamed after dropped passes cost the Pats Super Bowl XLVI: “My husband can’t fucking throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time!” In this case, Brady can’t throw the ball and stop opposing offenses. Going into this season, the defense was expected to be a weakness but few would have predicted New England would give up more than 30 points a game. No matter how great Brady looks, no team can give away that many points each week and expect to go to the Super Bowl. In Sunday’s loss the Pats defenders missed tackles and blew coverages in allowing the Panthers to put up 444 yards. Carolina quarterback Cam Newton had 316 yards passing and four touchdowns (three passing and one running). Newton, of course, is less than two years removed from an MVP season; there is little shame in having him dominate a game. Still, New England are known for adapting week-to-week to the other team’s best player and the Patriots appear to be adapting to no one right now. Maybe everything will turn out to be fine. Maybe this September glitch that has bled into October is nothing. Maybe January ends with the Patriots heading off to another Super Bowl in a blizzard of confetti. Something doesn’t seem quite right with the Pats defense, however. Something that might not be fixed with a few magical film sessions and a snap of Belichick’s fingers. And that should be the worry today for the team that was supposed to go undefeated. Fantasy player of the week Deshaun Watson. It seems hard to imagine there was a time, just weeks ago, when the Houston Texans thought quarterback Tom Savage gave them their best chance to win. That absurd thought lasted about two dismal quarters before top pick Deshaun Watson took over. All he has done is play like a first-round pick should play. In Sunday’s 57-14 trampling of Tennessee, Watson completed 25-of-34 passes for 283 yards and four touchdowns. He also ran for another score. His 125.0 passer rating might have been higher were it not for an interception. He is looking like anything but a rookie. Stat of the week 7-7. Years ago the then-St Louis Rams had a great find in kicker Greg Zuerlein. He showed up in the spring of 2012, a sixth-round draft pick from Missouri Western and started nailing very long field goals – accurately. The Rams have wallowed at the bottom of the NFC West but Zuerlein has thrived. He even earned a nickname, Greg The Leg. Now with the team in Los Angeles, Greg The Leg remains one of the league’s top kickers. On Sunday he helped the Rams pull out a huge 35-30 win at Dallas. He hit all seven of his field goal attempts including a career-best 49 yards on a line drive with room to spare. Quote of the week “When I was bringing him down, I just see my teeth in the air for like two seconds. I was like ‘Holy Crap.’” - Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Carl Lawson had a decent day against the Cleveland Browns in his team’s 31-7 victory. The only problem was he left without two of his teeth. As he told ESPN’s Katherine Terrell he was trying to tackle Browns quarterback DeShone Kizer when he noticed two of his teeth leaving his mouth. Unlike most of his peers, Lawson does not wear a mouthpiece, and apparently paid a heavy price for not doing so. The game stopped as Lawson crawled around on the turf looking for his missing teeth, which were eventually collected. While the Bengals offense finally found some bite, Cleveland’s remained toothless generating just 215 yards. Image of the week Here is Marshawn Lynch walking into Denver’s Sports Authority Field before Sunday’s game against the Broncos. His “Everybody vs Trump” shirt his own silent protest against a president who brought much of the league to their knees last weekend. Though the mass protests of last week were not there this time, several players did make their own statements, including Newton holding up a fist in the Patriots end zone after a touchdown. But Lynch always has a profound way of expressing himself even if he rarely grants interviews. We could probably reserve this space for him every week and he will provide. Elsewhere around the league -- Very quietly, the Detroit Lions are 3-1 after grinding out a 14-7 victory at Minnesota. It was a dutiful win for Detroit who held onto the ball for almost a quarter longer than the Vikings and forced Minnesota into three turnovers. --Like the Patriots, the Seattle Seahawks often start the season slowly and they were sluggish in the first half of their Sunday Night Football match-up with the Indianapolis Colts, as they trailed 15-10. But a big third quarter, in which they piled on 22 points, helped them to a 46-18 victory. Russell Wilson was picked off twice but also threw for two touchdowns and ran in another. -- Don’t look now but the Jets are as good as the Patriots with matching 2-2 records after New York’s 23-20 overtime victory. The Jets got a combined 256 yards from Bilal Powell and Elijah McGuire. Bet you didn’t have those two on your fantasy team. -- Another AFC East team that was supposed to struggle this season are the Bills. Instead they top their division with a 3-1 record and they’re not just beating up bad teams either.

But problems still persist at Sydney harbour swimming spots, at Malabar in Sydney’s south, and at popular beaches on the central coast, notably Avoca and Terrigal, due to stormwater runoff. In heavy rain, sewer systems often overflow into the stormwater, causing bacteria and faecal matter to enter the harbour, rivers and oceans. Until now, Coogee had failed to make the grade and had been classified as having poor water quality. The main reason for the change, detailed in the annual State of the Beaches report, appears to be the slightly drier weather in 2016-17 and timing of the tests. In general, open ocean beaches in NSW have excellent water quality, with 98% of 140 monitored ocean beaches graded as very good or good. This indicates they were suitable for swimming most or almost all of the time. This was a slight improvement on 2015-16, when 97% of ocean beaches were graded as very good or good. Overall, of the 250 sites where water quality was tested, 84% were graded as good or very good. These sites were suitable for swimming most or almost all of the time. But rainfall can change the water quality quickly and most beaches and harbour, lake and estuarine swimming spots carry warnings about swimming after rain. In general, swimming should be avoided during heavy rain and for up to a day afterwards at ocean beaches and up to three days at estuarine sites, as they take longer to flush. Fifty-eight (73%) of the 79 estuarine swimming sites were graded as very good or good, a slight decline on the previous year. These swimming sites were typically located in the well flushed sections of the estuaries or had few potential sources of faecal contamination. Seventeen of the estuarine beaches were graded as poor, including Rose Bay beach and Tambourine Bay in Sydney Harbour, Carss Point baths and Oatley Bay baths in the lower Georges River and Horderns beach in Port Hacking. Several were graded as fair, due to their proximity to stormwater outlets. The NSW environment minister, Gabrielle Upton, said stormwater generated by heavy rain was a major cause of pollution in recreational waters. “Councils and water authorities are constantly investing in improving water quality. It’s important to remember whatever is thrown on the ground may end up in stormwater and eventually lead into waterways,” she said. Very heavy rainfall and large swells affected much of the NSW coastline in early June 2016 due to a significant east coast low storm. Dry periods persisted in the later months of 2016 and into early 2017, but wet conditions returned in February 2017, followed by the wettest March on record for many coastal areas. Exposure to contaminated water can cause gastroenteritis, with symptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach ache, nausea, headache and fever. Eye, ear, skin and upper respiratory tract infections can also be contracted when pathogens come into contact with small breaks and tears in the skin or ruptures of the delicate membranes in the ear or nose."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/01/jurgen-klopp-laments-draw-confident-liverpool-luck-improve","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T19:49:58Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp laments draw but confident Liverpool’s luck will improve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/01/jurgen-klopp-laments-draw-confident-liverpool-luck-improve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/01/jurgen-klopp-laments-draw-confident-liverpool-luck-improve","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp laments draw but confident Liverpool’s luck will improve","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp seemed torn between defiance and anxiety after a 1-1 draw at Newcastle United left his Liverpool side in seventh place, seven points behind the leaders, Manchester City. “We should have won,” Klopp said. “We were the better side and created more chances but you know we have a real problem because we have to play better next game, otherwise we will not get a point.” After a wonderful Philippe Coutinho goal gave Liverpool the lead, Joselu equalised for Newcastle when Klopp’s centre-halves, Dejan Lovren and Joel Matip, allowed a through-ball from the excellent Jonjo Shelvey to bisect them. “It was a good pass for Newcastle’s goal, at the right moment,” Klopp, whose side have won one just of their past seven games in all competitions, said. “For me it looked like the centre-halves didn’t see the ball with Shelvey because two or three players are in front of them. If they see it they have to make a step and Joselu is offside. In the end it is unlucky.” Liverpool’s manager felt luck had quite a bit to do with the result and remains confident his is about to turn. “We are in very promising situations and we don’t score. That, of course, is a problem but it will not stay like this. I know, I am long enough around football. “There are different ways to get one win in seven. You can play really bad and lose a lot of games or you play more than a few games really, really good. Most of the games actually we were the better side but a few chances are enough for the opponent to score and we need a lot more and in the end we have had the same number of goals. That happens too often in the last few weeks, of course. “The boys will go away and we all feel not perfect in that moment and by the way the main problem is not only that football is not fair, people write about it and the boys read it and it makes it even worse. You have a point but it feels like you have lost.” Not that he agrees confidence has been dented. “I have not seen a drop in confidence from the players,” the manager said. “It is our duty to be confident because the boys have the quality.” Klopp was frustrated by two particular misses from the disappointing Daniel Sturridge and the impressive Mohamed Salah but said such misses would be corrected. “What is my job? Say, ‘Mo, don’t do that next time and Daniel please have a look next time’? They know that and they will do that next time. “We have our hard moment now but other teams will have their hard moment. We need to work on our thing and I really think it looks like we are not far away from a real challenge. If we do what we are good at, we don’t have to think about other teams and we will close the gap.” Rafael Benítez was considerably happier with a point against the club he led to Champions League glory. “Against a team like Liverpool you have to be happy,” he said. “The lads did a great job and maybe with a bit more composure on the ball we could have scored another goal.” He was particularly pleased with Shelvey. “Jonjo has the quality on the ball, I told him before the game, you know how to play football, you just have to work hard and keep your head focused.” Told that Klopp thought Newcastle should have lost, he turned diplomatic. “Sometimes you get what you deserve, sometimes you don’t. We have got a point at home, which isn’t the best, but against one of the top teams you take it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/14796","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T23:00:03Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 14,796","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/14796","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/14796","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 14,796","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/01/jack-harrison-england-under-21s-mls-new-york-city-fc","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T19:04:32Z","webTitle":"New York City FC 'golden boy' Jack Harrison called up by England Under-21s","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/01/jack-harrison-england-under-21s-mls-new-york-city-fc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/01/jack-harrison-england-under-21s-mls-new-york-city-fc","fields":{"headline":"New York City FC 'golden boy' Jack Harrison called up by England Under-21s","bodyText":"New York City FC midfielder Jack Harrison has been called up by England Under-21s for the first time for the Euro 2019 qualifiers against Scotland and Andorra. Harrison has been drafted in following the withdrawals through injury of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Sheyi Ojo. “It’s really good news for Jack, it’s really good news for the football club and of course I’m really pleased for him because he’s improved a lot and he loves the game,” said New York City FC manager Patrick Vieira. “I just want him to enjoy it – it will be a great, positive experience to be surrounded by players who play in the Premier League and I just want him to show how good he is because if the manager called him, it means he deserves it.” Harrison, 20, began his career as a youth player at Manchester United but moved to the United States aged 14 and made his debut for New York City in May last year. He scored his first professional goal on his first start against Real Salt Lake in June 2016 and was nominated for the MLS rookie of the year award. He told the NYC FC website that he was left “speechless” by the call-up. In the past, Harrison has said he would consider representing England or the US. “I try not to think about it too much,” he told the Guardian last year. “Obviously, it would be great to represent my country, England, but if the interest is not there, I’d be happy to represent America, and I’d be open to that. I’ve said that before: I like to focus on the moment and do what I can while I’m here.” The Spain striker David Villa congratulated his team-mate on the news. “Congrats golden boy,” he tweeted.

The club had asked for the match to be postponed due to protests across Catalonia over the controversial Catalan independence referendum in which more than 750 people have been injured, many in the Spanish city. That request was rejected and Barcelona, threatened with a six-point deduction according to their club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, if they did not play the game, took the decision 20 minutes before kick-off to play it behind closed doors, leaving thousands of supporters stranded outside. A statement from La Liga said the match should take place as normal because the security and safety of fans had been “guaranteed” by the Catalan police. “We have not been able to find a way to postpone it,” Bartomeu said. “From there, all together, directors, executives and players met and we decided, exceptionally, to play the game behind closed doors. Els Mossos [the Catalan police force] told us the game could be played normally. Playing this way, with the stadium empty, the club shows its disagreement [with the decision not to postpone the game]. The league told us we would lose six points, three from today and three as a penalty.” Las Palmas had the national flag embroidered on to their match-day shirts to show their support for a united Spain while Barcelona emerged for the warm-up wearing a yellow-and-red-striped shirt – the colours of the Estelada flag associated with Catalan independence. Earlier on Sunday the defender Gerard Piqué tweeted a photo of him voting in the referendum. “Together we are unstoppable defending democracy,” he said. After the match, speaking to the gathered media, a teary-eyed Piqué described the match as “the hardest game to play”. The result of the match itself ensured Barcelona extended their perfect start to the season, earning a seventh league win. Ernesto Valverde’s side have now scored 23 goals this season, conceding only twice. And by keeping Las Palmas at bay on Sunday afternoon Barcelona recorded their 1,000th La Liga clean sheet. Amid an eerie and strange atmosphere Barcelona started slowly and Las Palmas dominated much of the first half. Jonathan Calleri, the former West Ham United striker, rattled the post three minutes before the interval after good work by Oussama Tannane, who unselfishly laid the ball off. But at half-time Valverde, the Barcelona manager, sought personnel changes, introducing Andrés Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic in place of Aleix Vidal and Paulinho. The latter impressed in the first half but headed wide after arriving late into the box to meet Sergi Roberto’s deep cross, while the substitute Iniesta was later withdrawn with a hamstring injury. Barcelona began the second period with much more intent and were rewarded for their efforts after 49 minutes, with Sergio Busquets glancing home at the near post from Lionel Messi’s corner. Then Barça grew in stature, with Rakitic twice seeing his shots blocked by Mauricio Lemos, the Las Palmas defender. But Messi came up with a second goal, rounding the goalkeeper, Leandro Chichizola, with ease after latching on to Denis Suárez’s defence-splitting reverse ball. Seven minutes later the game was over, with Messi starting and finishing a slick move for his 14th goal of the season. After Rakitic fed Luis Suárez, the Barcelona forward flicked the ball with his first touch into the path of Messi, who tucked it home. Luis Suárez did find the net himself but his acrobatic effort was ruled out after he was adjudged to have committed a foul in the build-up to his overhead kick. Isco on target as Real Madrid beat Espanyol Isco struck twice as the champions, Real Madrid, beat Espanyol 2-0 to claim their first home win of the season in La Liga on Sunday. The Spaniard found the net in each half as Zinedine Zidane’s men stayed within seven points of the early leaders, Barcelona. Real dominated the game but Espanyol occasionally threatened and almost got back into the game when Gerard Moreno hit a post late in the first half. They also rallied after the break but Isco’s second after 71 minutes ended their hopes. Isco was highly impressive throughout and had his first opportunity with only 22 seconds on the clock. Espanyol had not even touched the ball when Sergio Ramos clipped a long ball forward and Isco chased it into the box. He tried to nudge it past Pau López but the keeper reacted quickly to grab the ball. That set the tone for most of the first half as the hosts made all the running. Luka Modric fired a long-range effort wide and Ramos had a firm header tipped over by López. Isco opened the scoring just before the half-hour in circumstances similar to his earlier chance. This time it was Cristiano Ronaldo who played the through-ball and Isco poked the ball past the advancing keeper. Ronaldo went close to doubling the lead when he volleyed over moments later. It was not until the final two minutes of the first half that Espanyol first threatened, Moreno lashing a shot on the turn against a post after a slip by Casemiro. The visitors carried that momentum into the second half. They played with more confidence and Sergio García curled in one dangerous cross before Sergi Darder had a shot blocked and José Manuel Jurado forced Keylor Navas to save. They were then almost handed an equaliser as Moreno robbed Ramos in the box. Leo Baptistao would have had an open goal to shoot at had Moreno got the ball to him but Nacho slid in to make a vital interception. Espanyol were to rue that missed chance as Real doubled their lead moments later. The ball was given away in midfield and Ronaldo pounced, feeding Marco Asensio. He in turn pulled the ball back and Isco stroked home from the edge of the box. It proved enough for Real, who had further chances late on through Ramos and Lucas Vázquez."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/01/catalan-referendum-eu-leaders-remain-muted-over-police-crackdown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T17:03:57Z","webTitle":"Catalan referendum: muted response from EU leaders over police crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/catalan-referendum-eu-leaders-remain-muted-over-police-crackdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/01/catalan-referendum-eu-leaders-remain-muted-over-police-crackdown","fields":{"headline":"Catalan referendum: muted response from EU leaders over police crackdown","bodyText":"Despite calls from Catalan authorities to condemn the brutal police crackdown on their independence referendum, the EU and most member states were reluctant to respond formally, seemingly viewing the dispute as an internal Spanish matter. Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel, was among the few national leaders to denounce the violence, which the Catalan government said had left 465 people injured as police forcibly removed voters from polling stations and on one occasion fired rubber bullets. “Violence can never be the answer!” Michel said on Twitter. His Slovenian counterpart, Miro Cerar, also expressed his concern, saying he was “concerned” and calling for “political dialogue, rule of law and peaceful solutions”. Former Belgian prime minister and senior MEP Guy Verhofstadt also said that while he did “not want to interfere” in Spain’s domestic affairs, “I absolutely condemn what happened today in Catalonia”. It was “high time for de-escalation,” he said. In Britain, the prime minister, Theresa May, faced mounting calls to speak out against the scenes of police brutality in Catalonia after Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats all criticised the Spanish government. Human right groups also condemned the violence. Human Rights Watch said the state “has a duty to protect the rights to peaceful assembly and free expression” both of those opposed to independence and those who supported it. Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn said the police violence against citizens was “shocking” and called on the Spanish government to “act to end it now”. Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, branded the police response “brutal and completely disproportionate”.Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader, also said she was concerned and that people “should be allowed to vote peacefully”. The vote is of particular interest in Scotland, which in 2014 voted in its own heated but largely peaceful independence referendum to remain in the the UK. “Regardless of views on independence, we should all condemn the scenes being witnessed and call on Spain to change course before someone is seriously hurt,” Sturgeon said on Twitter. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “The referendum is a matter for the Spanish government and people. We want to see Spanish law and the Spanish constitution respected and the rule of law upheld.” Raül Romeva, Catalonia’s foreign minister, said on Sunday the pro-independence regional government had informed the EU of a “violation of fundamental rights that puts the very EU at risk”. The bloc did not immediately respond to his demand that it “condemn the violence European citizens are suffering”. The referendum, which has been ruled illegal by Spain’s constitutional court, places the EU in a difficult position. Romeva insisted last month that Brussels could no longer argue the vote was a domestic issue, but must “defend the Treaty of the European Union and stand for the general interest of Catalan citizens as the EU citizens that they are”. Barcelona’s mayor, Ada Colau, who opposes independence but supports the right of Catalans to vote on the question, also called in an article in the Guardian for the EU to “defend the fundamental rights of Catalan citizens”. But Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has said that Brussels must abide by the decisions of the Spanish government and of Spain’s constitutional court. The commission has said on several occasions that a vote in favour of Catalan independence would be recognised but only if the referendum that produced it complied with the Spanish constitution and had been ruled legal. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said Labour believed debates on sovereignty “should be resolved in accordance with rules and laws” and any referendum “needs to be both democratic and fair”. But it was “unacceptable for the Spanish authorities to overreact ... through aggressive police action and the forcible closure of polling stations,” Thornberry said. “All sides must strive to come together and reach a political solution to this constitutional crisis.” Video footage showed police hitting people in the crowd with batons while voters peacefully held up their hands, officers dragging women voters from polling stations by their hair, and Spanish police attacking Catalan firefighters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/02/tories-shock-therapy-candour-theresa-may-lost-control","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"The Tories need the shock therapy of absolute candour | Matthew d’Ancona","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/02/tories-shock-therapy-candour-theresa-may-lost-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/02/tories-shock-therapy-candour-theresa-may-lost-control","fields":{"headline":"The Tories need the shock therapy of absolute candour","bodyText":"Theresa May is right. “As Conservatives,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr on Sunday, “the arguments that we thought we’d had and won during the 1980s about the importance of free market economies – I think we thought there was a general consensus on that. And we now see that there wasn’t.” I’ll say. As a consequence of her general election fiasco, the prime minister faces two formidable crises at the party’s conference in Manchester. The first is, to borrow a song title from Joy Division – the greatest band spawned by this city – she’s lost control. No Conservative party conference is complete without a split or three. But the divisions yielded this year by Brexit and electoral embarrassment are of an especially vivid kind. When Nicky Morgan, a former cabinet minister and now chair of the Treasury select committee, feels she can say explicitly that Boris Johnson has no place in a “responsible government”, one cannot argue with a straight face that May leads a united party. With his repeated interventions, the foreign secretary has put May in a position where her already dilapidated authority is an intolerable embarrassment to the Tories. He won’t shut up, and she won’t sack him. Nor, clearly, is she yet disposed to resign herself, or at least set a timetable for departure. The best she can hope for is that Johnson’s standing ovation on Tuesday does not amount to an acclamation. What does unite the party is the conviction that there will be a leadership contest before the next election. And since the timing of that election is unknowable – the fragility of May’s deal with the Democratic Unionist party being what it is – it follows that this conference will be a squalid beauty contest. Amber Rudd, Ruth Davidson, David Davis and many others will be scrutinised like vegetables in a shop to see if they are fresh and appealing enough to make a difference. Yet the identity of May’s successor is a secondary issue compared with the greater crisis that she and her party face – and which, unhappily for her, she understands more clearly than she is able to articulate to the public. It is a crisis of collective identity and purpose, a challenge to the very idea of conservatism. Labour’s electoral rise has spooked the Tories because it challenges every preconception that most of them share about the world, its rule book and its ideological contours. It is a rich irony that the passage of May’s manifesto that most annoyed her party was also the most acute and prescient. “We do not believe in untrammelled free markets,” that much-maligned document declared. “We reject the cult of selfish individualism. We abhor social division, injustice, unfairness and inequality.” The election result and the national response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy suggest that the voters agree. The problem is that most Conservative politicians do not. They loathed that assertion in the manifesto. They believe that the virtues of the free market are self-evident, unarguably so since the end of the cold war. They mutter that the facts of life are Tory, that what is needed is “real conservatism”, that turning up the volume will bring the public to its senses. To hear such talk is to watch a political gathering mimicking Jonestown. I rather doubt that the nation has suddenly embraced socialism tout court in a moment of grateful epiphany. Last year, the British voted for Brexit after a campaign dominated by ugly anti-immigration rhetoric. This year, there was an electoral surge in favour of a proudly leftwing Labour leader. What binds the two moments is an amorphous yearning for change. For today’s voters are both addicted to change and fearful of it. They love the fruits of globalisation, technological revolution, population mobility and automation – but they want a government that will address the pathologies of these thunderous forces. They crave novelty and security in equal measure. A contradiction? Such is human nature. In this context, the Tories need to do much more than cobble together a routine retail offer. Tweaking tuition fees and increased funding for the help-to-buy loan scheme may generate a few headlines but, disaggregated, will make no impact whatsoever. What the party needs now is not a shopping list of hastily assembled policies, but the shock therapy of absolute candour: it needs to be reminded of its first principles, of its potential to enhance the common good, and of the reasons why Tories are so often not trusted to act in the public interest. When a consensus exists between two people or two million, it is possible to speak in shorthand. When that consensus breaks down – as it has – the dialogue needs to start again, in a spirit of humility. It is not enough, for instance, to say repeatedly that free market policies generate the prosperity necessary to fund decent public services. That proposition needs to be explained in language that speaks to every home and those who long for their own home; to people who believe with every fibre in their being that they have no stake in the status quo, and that more Toryism means more poverty, more inequality, more misery. Technocracy and the recitation of statistics will not do. This is a persuasive task that requires Conservatives to stop using the patois of the privileged. Ditch talk of “public service reform” and explain how Tory policies will improve the GP’s surgery in a voter’s neighbourhood, or the primary school at the end of her road. Dial down the obsession with “aspiration” that belittles those seeking only a decent life and more than 4p in their pockets. Equality of opportunity is a fine objective – but declaring that you believe in it is not enough. Conservatives should be horrified by new research, conducted by British Future, suggesting that their failure to win over ethnic-minority voters cost the party 28 seats. In an interview with the House magazine, May tells Michael Howard that “modernisation” is “an argument that we had in the past … I think we’ve moved on from that.” Again, she’s right. The party has indeed “moved on” from a strategy that broadened its appeal to one that is driving it steadily towards electoral exile. Do the Tories have the courage to confront the scale of the danger? On this most basic question hangs much more than the success of a single conference. • Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/02/google-to-ditch-controversial-first-click-free-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T04:00:21Z","webTitle":"Google to ditch controversial 'first click free' policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/02/google-to-ditch-controversial-first-click-free-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/02/google-to-ditch-controversial-first-click-free-policy","fields":{"headline":"Google to ditch controversial 'first click free' policy","bodyText":"Google is to abandon its controversial policy of forcing news providers to offer free articles in order to appear on its search engine as part of a collection of measures designed to support the growth of digital subscriptions. The US company will replace its so-called “first click free” policy, which requires publishers to offer three free articles a day before readers come across a pay wall. Instead Google will offer a flexible sampling model that allows news organisations to decide how many, if any, articles it offers for free. The “first click free” model has been described as “toxic” by publishers such as Axel Springer and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp, which publishes the Times and the Sun, revealed at a conference last month that Google was considering getting rid of “first click free”, adding that it would “fundamentally change the content ecosystem”. He said: “If you don’t sign up for ‘first click free’, you virtually disappear from a search. Given the power of that Google platform, that is disadvantaging premium content of great provenance.” Google is making the move after feedback from publishers and readers and after tests with the New York Times and the Financial Times. It is also a recognition of the growth of subscription services and the fact a “one size fits all” approach was not appropriate. In a blog, Richard Gingras, vice-president of news at Google, said: “Journalism provides accurate and timely information when it matters most, shaping our understanding of important issues and pushing us to learn more in search of the truth. People come to Google looking for high-quality content, and our job is to help them find it. However, sometimes that content is behind a paywall. “While research has shown that people are becoming more accustomed to paying for news, the sometimes painful process of signing up for a subscription can be a turn off. That’s not great for users or for news publishers who see subscriptions as an increasingly important source of revenue. “To address these problems we’ve been talking to news publishers about how to support their subscription businesses.” As well as dropping “first click free”, Google will make it easier for users to subscribe to services. For example, people will be able to subscribe to news providers with one click through Google’s existing payment technology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/01/paul-dunne-rory-mcilroy-british-masters","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T23:01:15Z","webTitle":"Paul Dunne holds off Rory McIlroy to win British Masters and first Tour title","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/01/paul-dunne-rory-mcilroy-british-masters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/01/paul-dunne-rory-mcilroy-british-masters","fields":{"headline":"Paul Dunne holds off Rory McIlroy to win British Masters and first Tour title","bodyText":"Paul Dunne’s first European Tour title would have been notable enough without the Irishman posting a closing round of 61 and seeing off Rory McIlroy to claim the British Masters.

The 24-year-old, who shot to prominence as an amateur at the 2015 Open Championship, has endured a frustrating time when seeking to make his name in the professional ranks. Dunne was denied his maiden win in April when Edoardo Molinari defeated him in a play-off in Morocco. At Close House there was no such trouble; Dunne’s three-stroke success, at 20 under, was capped by a chip-in from off the 18th green. McIlroy could only look on and applaud. “I had a couple of chances to win earlier in the year and didn’t really press the accelerator when I needed to,” Dunne said. “So I woke up this morning and said to myself I was going to try and win this thing rather than let anyone hand it to me.” A glance back to the Hassan Trophy triggered a Dunne smile. “I think Edoardo finished birdie-eagle to get into the play-off so I was kind of waiting for the scoreboard here to show a McIlroy hole in one at the last.” Dunne will pocket €562,500 for his effort but the bigger picture relates to a move into the world’s top 100 ranked players and an incentive, surely, to push for a spot in Europe’s 2018 Ryder Cup team. McIlroy started the final day two off the lead, then held by Robert Karlsson, with his chances apparently remote when only two under for the day after 11 holes. But he played the closing stretch in minus five. “It was just nice to have a chance to win a golf tournament again,” McIlroy said. “That was a big thing for me. The more chances I have like that, I think the better I play and the better I focus. I’m really happy with how I played. I don’t feel as if I could have done much more. Some weeks close to your best isn’t quite good enough.” “At the turn I thought if I could play the back nine in four under I would have a chance at 17 under par so I did everything that I wanted to do. For Paul to shoot 61 to win his first tour event is incredibly impressive. And it is well deserved; I know how hard he works. Any time I am on the range, on the putting green or chipping, Paul is always out there working on his game.” “I’m really happy with how I played. I don’t feel as if I could have done much more. Some weeks , close to your best isn’t quite good enough.” Karlsson finished third at 16 under. Ian Poulter closed with a 70 to share 11th, with Lee Westwood’s Sunday 69 earning him a tie for 15th."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/01/rising-stars-the-ambitious-tories-hoping-to-shape-partys-future","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T22:12:21Z","webTitle":"Rising stars: the ambitious Tories hoping to shape party’s future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/01/rising-stars-the-ambitious-tories-hoping-to-shape-partys-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/01/rising-stars-the-ambitious-tories-hoping-to-shape-partys-future","fields":{"headline":"Rising stars: the ambitious Tories hoping to shape party’s future","bodyText":"Big beasts in the cabinet are fighting over the future of the Conservative party and a possible change in leadership. But the new generation of Tory MPs who have entered parliament since 2010 are intent on stalling any leadership challenge in the hope that one of their number will have a better chance in a few years’ time. Here are some of the newer intake MPs to keep an eye on at party conference: James Cleverly The MP for Braintree and former deputy mayor of London is making a name for himself as an outspoken backbencher. He recently said he would “bite the hand off” anyone offering him the chance to be prime minister, although he is loyal to Theresa May at the moment. He has impeccable Brexiter credentials and backed Boris Johnson’s aborted leadership bid, after entering parliament in 2015. But if another vacancy at the top arose, he could end up throwing his hat in the ring himself. Until then, Cleverly is tipped to rise up the ministerial ranks and is appearing at several fringes at party conference in Manchester this week. Tom Tugendhat Tugendhat is another MP from the 2015 crop of Conservatives who has made an impact in parliament. A former army officer, he managed to depose fellow Tory Crispin Blunt from his position as chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee. He is frequently mentioned by his younger Tory colleagues in parliament as a possible future leader but could have his work cut out as a former remain supporter who is positioned more towards the centrist wing of the party. Suella Fernandes Fernandes has risen to prominence as the new leader of the powerful European Reform Group of Conservatives, who communicate via WhatsApp and see themselves as the guardians of Brexit within parliament. She took over from Steve Baker, another Tory-to-watch who has risen through the ranks to become a minister in the Brexit department. Fernandes is already a parliamentary aide to the Treasury team but ran into trouble after distributing a pro-Brexit letter to her colleagues that departed from official government policy. Nusrat Ghani Ghani, who was elected in 2015, was heavily involved in the review of the snap election that concluded the Conservatives need a new youth wing to help spread the party’s message. Explaining the review, she did not hold back from criticising the party’s election effort, applauding a contribution from the floor that criticised the number of old white men at the top of the Conservatives. She is the first female Muslim Tory MP and has campaigned to ban police from using the term “honour killing” – as it risks minimising cases of murder and abuse. Dominic Raab Raab is another Conservative frequently mentioned by colleagues casting around for potential future leadership hopes who are anxious to skip a generation. He is a Brexit supporter, comes from the liberal tradition of the party, as a former chief of staff to David Davis, and already a minister. However, some of his past gaffes could come back to haunt him, including once branding feminists “obnoxious bigots” in 2011."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/01/boeing-fiasco-and-uks-post-brexit-future","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T18:05:36Z","webTitle":"Boeing fiasco and UK’s post-Brexit future | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/01/boeing-fiasco-and-uks-post-brexit-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/01/boeing-fiasco-and-uks-post-brexit-future","fields":{"headline":"Boeing fiasco and UK’s post-Brexit future","bodyText":"Michael Fallon’s weasel words threatening Boeing about MoD contracts (Report, 28 September), following the trade tariffs being placed on Bombardier aircraft (Report, 26 September) are pathetic. His government since 2010 has placed order after order after order with Boeing for helicopters when they could have been made under licence in the UK, keeping British aerospace workers in a job. His incompetent government scrapped £4bn worth of BAE Nimrod submarine hunters in 2010. After a Russian periscope was spotted off the Faslane nuclear facility in 2012, they then ordered £3bn worth of inferior Boeing P-8s. This deal has no substantial UK offset, doesn’t use UK-sourced arms and wasn’t hedged against currency movements. The icing on the cake is that these Boeings can’t even be refuelled in the air by the RAF. According to Unite the union, by 2020 a quarter of the UK’s defence budget will be spent in the US, mainly because it’s the ideological choice of the Tories to “buy off the shelf” US kit rather than UK hardware. We are losing the ability to produce our own defence hardware. Another irony is that he threatens a trade war against the very country his government is desperate to do a trade deal with after the EU referendum. He would be better off getting David Davis engaging with the EU as we’d have more success together against the US with our European allies than on our own. If Fallon is sincere about UK aerospace jobs he would: commit to join with France and Germany in developing a manned sixth-generation European fighter jet; order new BAE Hawks to replace ones the Red Arrows currently fly that are due to go out of service in 2018; ensure that any orders given to Boeing for helicopters are made under licence in the UK and use Rolls-Royce engines and UK avionics as well. Finally he could also help to ensure that Airbus UK is not penalised with tariffs and regulations when we leave the EU. We need deeds, not words. Alan Quinn Manchester • One of the best examples to illustrate the double standards being applied regarding US criticism of the state subsidies supporting Bombardier is that of the Boeing 747. The project was originally planned as a military aircraft. The research, design, technology construction and manufacture of prototype components was totally subsidised by the US government. On completion all this was simply transferred to the civil production arm of Boeing and industrially manufactured and marketed as the Boeing 747 (and later 8) intercontinental jumbo jet. It was then bought by, and freely traded to, airlines across the world. Ronald Fairfax Hull • If Sir Michael Fallon actually failed to continue the Boeing MoD contracts, the results after a few days would be the grounding of three of the armed forces’ most important aerospace assets: the C-17 Globemaster III, Apache and Chinook helicopters. Boeing is providing through its contracts the required logistics support to keep these aircraft and helicopters operating. It is unfortunate that David Cameron appointed a political hack with no prior military experience to the post of defence minister.

Theresa May famously tended to her grassroots in 2011 with a story about an immigrant’s cat she had borrowed off Ukip (the story, not the cat). Tony Blair used to arrive before his faithful like a bigamist with a bunch of garage flowers: “Sure, I’ve set up home elsewhere, but be realistic; you’re not going to divorce me. We’ve so much shared history, and, besides, who else would have you?” The game is to keep the rank-and-file sweet enough that they will put the stability of the parliamentary party above themselves; disturb that natural order – put any decisions back into members’ hands – and they will destroy your party, being extremists by definition. The paradox of old politics was that joining a party put you not at its epicentre but at its fringe. That’s how it used to work, until it suddenly stopped working. The Conservatives no longer have enough strength in their core to maintain this balancing act, of seeming normal to the country at large while satisfying their base. Directionless, the party awaits the whim of its members, whose preference is for a leader who would leave the rest of the nation horrified. Every obnoxiousness of Boris Johnson falls as more proof that they have found their man, the one who will stick two fingers up to the world, the world in which you have to consider other nations before you revel in your own glorious colonial past. Every antiquated pose struck by Jacob Rees-Mogg – nappy-changing is for women, salad is for rabbits – soothes 100,000 souls who wish things back the way they were. These members aren’t different from the general population by accident, they are different by design. Their political activism is a signal of their disenchantment with the status quo, and they scorn the makers of that status quo – which is to say, everybody else. The urgent and outrageous upshot isn’t so much that this leaves our national destiny in the hands of a group that is mainly middle-class, 71% male, and with a mean age of 54, but that there are so few of them. Perhaps wisely, the Conservatives stopped publishing membership data in 2013, when it stood at almost 150,000. It has been steadily dropping since then – there are rumours, impossible to substantiate, of 40,000 members having left since June. It is unlikely that Tory party membership even matches the 100,000 of the Liberal Democrats. The idea that such a group – in both size and composition, so unrepresentative – could make a decision as significant as who should lead the governing party through a time so turbulent, is laughable. You wouldn’t leave them to order a pizza. The obvious answer is to strip the members of their power in matters of leadership: introduce open primaries, bloc votes by MPs, let a groundhog decide, choose anything over this self-selecting power base, as random as an aristocracy but without the sense of duty. Yet exactly the same accusations have been levelled at Labour members since 2015 – that they would wreck the party with their ideologies and their obstreperous disregard for moderation – and they were made wrongly. The new members were characterised as fly-by-nights who would leave once they had done their damage. Yet membership has gone from 400,000 to 570,000 in the past two years. They were written off as war-horse Trotskyites, with no understanding of, or love for, modern democracy. It would be sociologically fascinating if that many hardcore Trots existed in the UK, but there is no evidence of hard-left infiltration. The crucial charge was that they didn’t care about winning elections: but this, too, wasn’t right. They didn’t care about the accepted wisdom on how elections were won. But that didn’t mean they fought to lose. Nevertheless, the only difference on paper between Labour and Tory members is that there are hundreds of thousands more of them, and they are more likely to be female: we talk of Corbyn’s Labour as the party of the young, and yet the mean age of members is, astonishingly, the same as that of the Conservatives. So how have Labour members revivified their party? Their conference was marked by its jubilation, its sense of openness and purpose, passion and self-determination. A mood that would have been unimaginable three years ago was last week undeniable, even by those most dispirited by its implications. The source of a profound risk for the Conservatives – that the passions of their members may make them toxic to bystanders – has turned into a profound opportunity for Labour, where the intensity of their members’ enthusiasm has reignited their creativity. The problem with members, in other words, lies not in who they are but in how they move. They are an army, whose nature unfolds in the direction it takes. The Conservatives are in retreat, clustering around calcified individuals, losing numbers as they wait to be led to the safety of an imagined past; Labour are advancing into new territory, bringing in new blood with their small-M momentum. All this is as observable to a die-hard Tory as it is to a Corbynite, though the former mask their disquiet by blaming it on the feckless young. As unsettling as it is to watch the nation’s prospects in so few hands, defanging the members of any party would only leave the battle suspended. Democracy is a white-knuckle ride, but the solution is never to have less of it. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/01/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-sepang-grand-prix-lucky-to-finish-second","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T20:09:32Z","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton: I was lucky to take second from tough weekend in Sepang","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/01/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-sepang-grand-prix-lucky-to-finish-second","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/01/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-sepang-grand-prix-lucky-to-finish-second","fields":{"headline":"Lewis Hamilton: I was lucky to take second from tough weekend in Sepang","bodyText":"Lewis Hamilton has admitted he believed he was lucky to achieve second place in the Malaysian Grand Prix after a difficult weekend that culminated in the Mercedes driver being comprehensively outpaced by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who won in Sepang. Hamilton extended his lead in the Formula One world championship over his rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, to 34 points but he has also insisted his team have a major task ahead of them to ensure he has the best possible chance of securing his fourth title in the remaining five races. The Englishman was overtaken by Verstappen early in the race and proved unable to match the Dutch driver’s speed, ultimately coming home ahead of the second Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo. Vettel had started last but displayed very strong form to make fourth and Hamilton accepted that his car had simply not been good enough. “We definitely have work to do, that is for sure. It was the best I could really do,” he said. “There are definitely positives in terms of the actual result we got. It was a bit fortunate, a bit lucky for us.” Having brought upgrades to the race, Mercedes had been struggling to make their car work and Hamilton did not believe they had performed as well as he expected. “There is stuff you don’t even know about that has been happening through the weekend that is not acceptable for this great team and we all know that and need to work on those areas.” The team have previously described their car as a “diva” but had been confident they were on top of its demands. Sepang proved to be a strident wake-up call and that it was being heeded was evident in that there was a palpable sense of relief from Hamilton rather than satisfaction at extending his lead. “We’ve got a lot of work to do with this car so, considering the issues we did have, I think this is a good result,” Hamilton said. “We do have some big problems with it. There’s still work to do to try and fix it but I think it’s a fundamental issue with this year’s car.” With the next race at Suzuka on Sunday he was positive that the post-race discussion on their problems had proved fruitful at Mercedes. “I feel positive, the debrief was one of the best debriefs we have had. Period,” he said. “It is often the case that, when you have a win, there is not a lot to say and everyone is riding on positives. When you have a difficult day, when the shit really hits the fan, that is when there are more questions and you go into more detail.” The Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, was blunt in his concern at the lack of form his team displayed. “I am very down. You cannot look at it and say we have scored more points than Ferrari,” he said. “We have lost so much pace this weekend. We were half a minute down to Ferrari. If Max had pushed to the end we would have been half a minute down on Max. “If you look at the real pace today we would have been P5, and that is worrisome. Let’s see what happens in Suzuka. We have a couple of days to try and understand.” The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, however, was hugely pleased with his 20-year-old winning driver and his team on the occasion of their second victory of the Formula One season. “To beat Mercedes fair and square was beyond our expectation,” Horner said. “Max has endured so much bad luck this year and the race he drove today was absolutely dominant. He did a great job in managing it. He sounded really cool out there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/01/britain-will-be-world-embarrassment-unless-ehrc-has-more-powers-equality-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T16:14:50Z","webTitle":"Britain will be 'world embarrassment' unless rights watchdog has more powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/01/britain-will-be-world-embarrassment-unless-ehrc-has-more-powers-equality-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/01/britain-will-be-world-embarrassment-unless-ehrc-has-more-powers-equality-justice","fields":{"headline":"Britain will be 'world embarrassment' unless rights watchdog has more powers","bodyText":"Far-reaching powers to enforce equality legislation should be given to the Equality and Human Rights Commission to prevent Britain “returning to the 1930s, when only the wealthy could obtain justice”, according to its chair, David Isaac. The call by the head of the watchdog for additional authority to carry out inspections and punish offenders comes in a defiant statement marking the 10th anniversary of its establishment. Without action, he cautions, Britain will slip from “world leader to world embarrassment”. The EHRC is a statutory body but operates independently. It was formed in 2007 and is funded through the department for education which coordinates government equality policy. Speaking to the Guardian, Isaac said cuts to legal aid and the imposition of high fees for employment tribunals – since ruled to be unlawful – have damaged the UK’s reputation as a world leader in justice. “Laws and rights mean nothing if you can’t take action to protect them,” Isaac said. “Decisions taken to save money have set us on a path back to the 1930s, when only the wealthy could have justice. “It took the vision of those who established the welfare state to ensure that access to justice was established for everyone. In only a few years we are destroying that legacy, making us no better than some of the countries we criticise. “Immediate action is needed now to stop us going from a world leader to a world embarrassment and people failing to get access to the justice they deserve.” The commission is particularly concerned that cuts to the scope of legal aid, introduced by the coalition government in 2012, means legal help and representation is no longer available for family, housing, debt, welfare benefit, employment and clinical negligence cases. Reduced funding has resulted in “advice deserts” in parts of Britain where there are no specialist legal aid advisers available. The Ministry of Justice is reviewing the impact of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act. In a blog to be posted on the commission’s website on Monday, Isaac writes: “We already have strong legal powers and make the very best use of them. However, the governments and large organisations that we are required to hold to account are also powerful and well-resourced. “To tackle those who break the law, I believe we would be even more effective with additional powers. We want to be able to demand information from organisations we suspect are acting unlawfully, without first having to initiate a formal investigation. “We also want the power to enter and inspect premises where disability access requirements are being ignored and to carry out ‘mystery shopping’ to make sure business are complying with the law in a swift, light touch and relatively inexpensive way. To drive real change we should be able to issue enforcement notices or impose a civil sanction, for example where large organisations fail to publish their gender pay gap.” The EHRC is also calling for the power to “arrange arbitrations and give binding determinations in some types of cases” in order to reduce the burden on our courts. “The tragedy at Grenfell was a wake-up call that, even though we find it hard to acknowledge, the least well off do not receive the same level of support in our society,” Isaac adds in the blog. “The right to decent housing is a human right and this injustice must be tackled head on. By bringing in the socioeconomic duty, a critically important part of the Equality Act not yet implemented, our public services would have to play a greater role in helping the less well off in society, and improve the prospects of those such as white, working-class boys who are being left behind in many areas of life.” The powers the EHRC is seeking include: • Requiring an employer to provide information about recruitment practices and workforce demographics where complaints have been made. • Being able to enter premises to, for example, inspect a supermarket’s accessible toilets “on demand”. • Carrying out mystery shopping to make sure businesses are guaranteeing accessibility. For example, checking that an insurance company is offering all the appropriate deals for somebody with a disability. • Issuing enforcement notices or imposing a civil sanction where companies fail to publish their gender pay gap. • Arranging conciliation services to resolve disputes about provision of goods and services such as where a shop refuses to serve a transsexual customer. Making the announcement during the Conservative party conference is a bold move. The prime minister, Theresa May, has repeatedly called for the Human Rights Act to be scrapped."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/01/everton-burnley-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T15:29:26Z","webTitle":"Burnley’s Jeff Hendrick strikes to pile further pressure on Everton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/01/everton-burnley-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/01/everton-burnley-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Burnley’s Jeff Hendrick strikes to pile further pressure on Everton","bodyText":"Ronald Koeman had said he would need four consecutive home wins to enter the international break with a smile. He goes into it under pressure instead, the boos of Goodison Park to accompany him and no closer to halting Everton’s regression after a summer spend of almost £140m. Burnley, for a fraction of the cost and with clearer thinking, move forward. Jeff Hendrick’s fine first-half goal delivered the latest impressive away win for Sean Dyche’s team as the problems mounted for the Everton manager. Burnley have now won at Goodison and Stamford Bridge this season while drawing at Tottenham Hotspur’s temporary Wembley home and Anfield. Their problems on the road last season, when collecting a mere seven points from a possible 57, seem a lifetime ago. The same could be said of when Everton last played as an effective, settled and threatening unit. Wayne Rooney was dropped to the bench for the first time in the Premier League since returning to his boyhood club but it was only after his introduction that Everton attacked with quality or purpose. And that was not enough to break a supremely well-organised and disciplined Burnley side. Koeman claimed his position should not be under scrutiny because of the continued commitment of his players. It is under scrutiny, however, as he seems at a loss over what to do with them. It should also worry the Everton manager that he changed personnel and formation yet still oversaw a weak attacking display and a fifth defeat in eight games. Not that Dyche has to worry himself with such pressures, having faced his own demanding start to the campaign and delivered Burnley’s best Premier League start. “The wins make a massive difference in the Premier League,” he reflected. “Away from home I don’t think anyone could have seen this start with the tough games we had. I think the players are shifting mentally. It is amazing what a difference it makes when you have that assuredness to go to these grounds. There are signs that we are improving.” Everton had showed signs of improvement themselves until Hendrick struck a classy winning goal. The improvement ceased at that point. Koeman had argued his team’s poor form stemmed from a lack of confidence – an assessment Rooney publicly disagreed with following the draw against Apollon Limassol on Thursday – when a lack of pace, width and balance have been this season’s glaring faults. At Rooney’s expense, the Everton manager finally addressed some problems by starting Nikola Vlasic and Oumar Niasse alongside Dominic Calvert-Lewin in attack, although persisting with Gylfi Sigurdsson on the left did little for the team’s balance. It is also a strange use of the £45m record signing’s talents but Sigurdsson had licence to drift inside and should have given Everton the lead as a result. The Iceland international twice had sight of Nick Pope’s goal, from balls across the penalty area by Vlasic and Niasse, but failed to connect cleanly on both occasions. They would prove to be Everton’s best chances and costly misses. Burnley showed the composure that eluded Everton in the final third when they took the lead with an exquisite goal, one that Dyche may well refer to the next time someone applies the long ball label to his team. Robbie Brady instigated the breakthrough with a superb cross-field pass to Stephen Ward, who was overlapping on the left. Chris Wood headed Ward’s first-time cross to Hendrick, who found Scott Arfield before drifting into the box. Arfield released Ward and when the defender cut the ball back for the Republic of Ireland international he dummied Morgan Schneiderlin before placing a measured finish beyond Jordan Pickford. Everton’s defence was static and badly organised, with Ashley Williams playing Ward onside and Schneiderlin weak in the challenge, but that did not detract from an outstanding team goal. Koeman’s team offered little in response until Rooney arrived in the second half and the team shifted to a midfield diamond. Burnley absorbed the pressure comfortably with Ben Mee and James Tarkowski once again showing that Michael Keane’s £30m departure for Goodison has not had the disruptive effect many had feared. The visitors were almost presented with a second when Williams’s clearance cannoned off a claret shirt into the path of Arfield but the attacking midfielder went to ground too easily when he connected with the defender’s attempted recovery and was booked for diving. “I’m flummoxed by that,” said Dyche. “It looks like he gets a nick. Sigurdsson went down in the first half when there wasn’t contact and didn’t get booked. I’m not saying he dived, by the way. I just don’t think he needed to book him.” Aimless shots from distance aside, Everton rarely threatened an equaliser and did not force Pope into a save until Calvert-Lewin shot straight at the keeper in the 87th minute. They claimed long and loud for two handballs by Matthew Lowton in the penalty area in the final stages. The second shout, from a Williams header, was rightly dismissed by the referee Jon Moss but the first, from Rooney’s flick, was a stronger claim, with the defender’s arm raised above his head. “You need to be lucky,” said Koeman. His luck is out, along with Everton’s form."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/01/barcelona-v-las-palmas-la-liga-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T16:19:31Z","webTitle":"Barcelona 3-0 Las Palmas: La Liga – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/01/barcelona-v-las-palmas-la-liga-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/01/barcelona-v-las-palmas-la-liga-live","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona 3-0 Las Palmas: La Liga – as it happened","bodyText":"So, there we are then, Barcelona get the get the three points against Las Palmas in an entertaining contest, on a bizarre day in Catalonia. Lionel Messi scored twice after Sergio Busquets’s opener at an empty Camp Nou. Thanks for your company. Bye! One other thing amid all of today’s chaos around Camp Nou: there are unconfirmed reports that the Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubí has resigned from his role following the decision to play their match against Las Palmas. The players head down the Camp Nou tunnel, to what can only be described as a muted applause from a handful of staff and players in the dugouts. Messi’s 13th and 14th goals of the season ensure Barcelona are in total control in La Liga, top of the table after seven wins in as many matches. They have scored 23 goals this season and conceded just the two. That was a very strange occasion. Las Palmas were quite magnificent for 45 minutes, but, four minutes into the second half Busquets scored a crucial opener for Barcelona. Then came a Messi double, and on another day he could have had a hat-trick. 90 min: There will be a couple of added minutes. 89 min: Mascherano sniffs out another Las Palmas break forward and almost ends up in the opposition half. He’s been ace back there. Up the other end, Suarez flashes another effort wide. A shake of the head follows. 88 min: Messi swings it in, with Pique the target but he’s bullied off the ball by Lemos. Messi then picks it back up on the right, with Rakitic’s powerful shot goalwards blocked. Las Palmas look momentarily all over the place and it ends up with Suarez finding the net with an overhead-kick. But he’s offside. 87 min: Barcelona have themselves a corner. Can they find a fourth? 86 min: ‘If in doubt, get it out’ is the motto as Busquets comes flying forward. Las Palmas go back on the attack but they have lacked the killer instinct as such. 83 min: Iniesta off, with Gomes brought on. He looks down in the dumps as he comes off, but his touch of class has helped them all but win this one. He heads off after an impressive 40 minutes or so. That was all Valverde required from him. He did not look injured. Up the other end, Ousamma has just flashed one wide for Las Palmas. 82 min: Messi tries to return the favour, looping a through ball in for Luis Suarez but it’s just a little too long for him. Meanwhile, Andre Gomes, is readying himself for a cameo appearance off the bench. 80 min: Las Palmas might just employ a damage limitation mindset here. It would be a shame for them if Barcelona do go on to add a fourth or a fifth, because their first-half performance was really quite brilliant. They have been professional since, but they look a little knackered now. 78 min: Messi is almost in again but Chichizola comes way off his line to eventually claim the ball. That’s his 14th goal of the season – not bad going, eh? And there it comes! Some lovely one-touch football sees Messi pick up Suarez’s through ball and he tucks it home. Lovely stuff in the buildup, too, with Messi driving forward before Rakitic kept things moving. The noise outside Camp Nou ratchets up a notch or two. 75 min: Barcelona are just playing the ball around without any real intentions of adding a third. They are waiting for the perfect opening, as opposed to rushing it as they were a little in the first half. 72 min: Alba ghosts in down the left but his cross, drilled in from the left, is met by Chichizola. It was not a great ball in to be honest. Las Palmas get a corner, but Ter-Stegen bellows “OK!” before punching it clear. He’s after his seventh clean sheet of the season this evening ... 71 min: A protestor is hounded out by about 10 stewards. He made his way onto the pitch but he’s quickly escorted off. Quite how he got so far, given everything else, is a discussion for another time. Barcelona are cruising now. That was a lovely little goal by Messi. Barcelona just begin to turn it on, with Rakitic initially having a shot blocked. Then Messi receives a fine reverse pass and rounds the goalkeeper before stroking it into the net. Chichizola, the Las Palmas goalkeeper, has been brilliant until now but he was made to look a little silly there. 66 min: Alba floats in a brilliant, inviting ball for Suarez but before it gets to the striker, Lemos cuts it out. He’s had a decent game at the back for Las Palmas – so far at least. The frenetic pace of this match has slowed, with things seemingly calming down inside the empty Camp Nou a little. 65 min: Messi picks up the ball centrally. He dribbles away from goal, past a sea of Las Palmas bodies, before shoving Iniesta out the way and unleashing a low shot at goal. It’s pretty comfortable for Chichizola, though. 62 min: Las Palmas have completed more passes than Barcelona. 59 min: Las Palmas have not really gone into their shells at all since falling behind. They continue to knock it around neatly, but they have lost a little momentum. 56 min: Denis Suarez does well, darting inside and away from his man but his decision to go solo sees him eventually stopped in his tracks. But Barcelona go again, with Rakitic drawing a foul 25 yards from goal. It’s played stupidly quickly by Messi, but Luis Suarez is a size 13 boot offside, after being threaded through. 55 min: Lemos sends a thundering free-kick at goal but it’s always rising. Barcelona have looked a little sleeker since the arrivals of Iniesta and Rakitic at half-time. Now Messi prods a header agonisingly wide, after superb play by Luis Suarez, dinking the ball back into the box for his team-mate. 54 min: Rakitic is penalised for a sliding tackle on Viera. Las Palmas have a free-kick in a decent position, 30 yards or so from goal. 53 min: Some mail. “It’s such a strange atmosphere,” says Kári. “Throughout the first half I heard an odd creaking sound every once in a while. At first I thought it was some kind of mic problem but then I realized it was the sound of doors opening and closing in the stadium. Also, I’m getting an education in Iberian swearing.” Me too .. 51 min: Penalt ... Luis Suarez is booked for diving, after rounding the Las Palmas goalkeeper Chichizola. A big call by the referee, Montero. 50 min: Barcelona have another glimpse of goal, with Messi forcing Chichizola into another save before Las Palmas go flying up the other end through Oussama. He does well but curls his effort just wide of goal, though. Messi swings in the corner and Busquets glances it home. He runs off to the opposite corner to celebrate, but there’s nobody for him to celebrate with, except his team-mates, the ball-boys and photographers. 48 min: Barcelona have started this second half with a bounce. Rakitic sends a crashing, dipping volley goalwards but Chichizola keeps it out. 47 min: ... and Messi forces Chichizola into another decent stop! Messi wraps his foot around it from 30 yards. It’s on target but the keeper always has it covered, and makes a two-handed save. In terms of those changes, Paulinho and Vidal are the players that have made way for Barcelona. 46 min: Barcelona win an early free-kick, with Luis Suarez caught by Lemos. It’s a bruising challenge and the forward looks in pain. Messi gets ready to stand over it. He went close in the first half, beating the wall but not Chichizola, the Las Palmas goalkeeper. The second half is almost upon us. The players are trudging out of the tunnel and out on to the pitch, to the wild noi ... where Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta are going through their final warmups before coming on at Camp Nou. These changes by Valverde go some way to explaining how well Las Palmas did in that first half. Las Palmas released an interesting statement before kick-off, announcing they would be wearing shirts with an embroidered Spanish flag – a one-off move. A quick delve into the politics of the Catalonia independence protests, then: “We decided to embroider a small Spanish flag and today’s date, to testify without strings our hope in the future of this country and in the goodwill of those who live in it, in search of the best understanding,” it read. “No matter how far away is the Gran Canaria Stadium, we have never felt the least temptation to be part of a country other than this. And however complex the situation may be, we will always rely on simplifying it to better understand and find solutions.” Barcelona surround the referee as he blows the half-time whistle. Messi is in heated conversation, while Alba is among those given yellow cards in quick succession. 44 min: Tana’s high boot crashes into Sergi Roberto and gets a booking for his efforts. 42 min: Calleri rattles the post! It has been coming. Las Palmas are playing some lovely stuff, and this move culminates in them almost finding an opener. They eventually pull the ball out to the right flank, with Oussama making a great run before unselfishly cutting the ball back for Calleri. He hits it first time and the ball slams the upright. Barcelona have been warned ... 39 min: The Barcelona technical area is very noisy at the moment. Valverde looks pensive but just about everybody else is barking, demanding more. Alba flies down the left, supplying Suarez but Lemos charges down his strike. Then Las Palmas put in another thundering challenge. They are winning most of the second balls out there. After 20 minutes under the cosh, they look pretty comfortable now. 38 min: Messi jinks his way past four Las Palmas defenders, but just when the outcome looks inevitable, the goalkeeper Chichizola gives him a fright. 37 min: Barcelona are just getting a little sloppy. A reminder that on the bench, there’s Umtiti, Rakitic and Iniesta. Plus, Andre Gomes. Plenty of options for Valverde, should he wish to alter things at the break. 35 min: Las Palmas are knocking the ball about like Barcelona. Lovely stuff. A burst down the right culminates in Tana almost finding Calleri but Pique just does enough. Calleri – believe it or not – is proving a real handful. 33 min: This match may be lacking atmosphere but it’s provided a decent, engaging contest so far. There have been a couple of meaty challenges and Las Palmas have no intentions of just rolling over here. Now Pique is booked: it’s a cynical challenge on Calleri, who is almost bagged in the process as the Barcelona defender clutches on to his shirt. 32 min: Paulinho heads just wide! He arrives very late into the box, to get on the end of Sergi Roberto’s cross. The Barcelona full-back made a lung-busting run to get to the byline before picking out the Brazilian. It is a free header and he should probably have done better. Just after, Paulinho is booked for clattering Chichizola, fouled while taking his goal-kick. 30 min: More good stuff from Las Palmas but the final ball in was slightly overcooked by Tana. Half an hour in, and a reminder that this game is being played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou. 29 min: Paulinho finds Jordi Alba in acres of space down the left flank. He whips the cross in but Las Palmas clear the ball for a corner. Barcelona look to revive their impressive start but from the set-play Pique gets his nose pushed out by not one but three Las Palmas defenders. 28 min: Sergi Roberto dives in to prevent Barcelona from trailing. Las Palmas are patient in their buildup, with Oussama played in by a fabulous acute reverse ball. He drives on to it but as he squares the ball, it’s cut out by the right boot of the Barcelona full-back. Valverde’s side are on the back foot here. 27 min: It’s all Las Palmas at the moment. 25 min: Calleri is everywhere at the moment. He does well to earn Las Palmas’s first corner of the afternoon before getting on the end of it too. He takes the ball down magnificently before getting a shot away at goal. It deflects wide and Barcelona get it away, but this is certainly encouraging for the visitors. 24 min: Busquets gets caught in possession. Calleri does brilliantly to close down his man and get a challenge in. Perhaps he needed the 90,000-plus crowd to warn him of Calleri’s pending presence there. 23 min: Las Palmas are knocking it about nicely, with captain Jonathan Viera trying to dictate things centrally. Then Oussama gets hold of it and the Moroccan sends a powerful strike goalwards. Ter-Stegen has to save it, but it’s pretty comfortable. 21 min: Chichizola is a busy man at the moment. After saving Messi’s free-kick, he now chases Denis Suarez away from goal after a long, looping ball over the top. The Las Palmas keeper did as much as scare the forward away from goal there, just as it looked as if he was about to skip away from him. 19 min: Messi is clattered. You could tell as much by the noise of a Las Palmas boot smacking his shin-pad. The Argentinian gets up to take the free-kick and he almost finds the very apex of Chichizola’s goal but the goalkeeper pushes it clear. The rebound is inviting but Las Palmas clear. 18 min: Luis Suarez plays in Denis Suarez and it’s a beautiful little ball through but it’s just too quick for the latter. Then Vidal goes crashing down in the box but there’s nothing doing there. He lost control of the ball and then took a little tumble. 16 min: Las Palmas break on the counterattack through Calleri, who dodges past Pique before supplying Hernan. It all ends rather abruptly and Barcelona go up the other end, with Messi charging towards goal. Then Busquets joins in, but he gets sloppy and loses the ball. 15 min: The Las Palmas technical area are making lots of noise. And that’s because they again gift the ball back to Barcelona, who are pretty nifty in possession. 13 min: Vidal is played in by Suarez but Las Palmas do well to shepherd him away from goal. Barcelona are cruising at the moment, albeit with the scoreline still goalless. 12 min: Alberto Aquilani looks for the run of Jonathan Calleri over the top, but it’s cut out. A painful Premier League throwback of sorts. 10 min: It is role reversal for a moment with Las Palmas enjoying plenty of possession. You can hear every thud of the ball, as its passed around the field. 9 min: This atmosphere is all very odd. But Barcelona seem pretty comfortable on the pitch, in what feels and looks like an exhibition match at the moment. Roberto is finding lots of joy down the right flank. Messi has had a busy start too. 7 min: Messi tries to play a one-two with Alba but its cut out. They are soon back it though because Las Palmas gift it back to the opposition. Then comes a great chance, with Suarez slid through on goal by Messi. He leans an inch offside but his shot is saved anyway. That looked destined for the back of the net. 5 min: Sergi Roberto goes up the other end and tests the Las Palmas goalkeeper from 20 yards out. It’s a shot on target. You can hear every word that Ernesto Valverde is saying, although I cannot necessarily understand it. 4 min: Borja shoots wide. It was the sort of driving shot from distance that would usually draw a few gasps from the away supporters. Not today. 3 min: Jonathan Calleri, once of West Ham United, is leading the line for the visitors. Loic Remy is part of this team too, but he’s injured today. Lovely stuff. 2 min: Jordi Alba swings the ball in from the left but Chichizola scoops it up. It’s eerily quiet, you can hear every bark from the touchline. Here’s some – belated – teams: Barcelona: Ter-Stegen, Roberto, Pique, Mascherano, Alba; Vidal, Busquets, Paulinho; Messi, Suarez, Denis Las Palmas: Chichizola, Michel, Ximo, Lemos, Borja, Aquilani, Hernan, Viera, Tana, Oussama, Calleri We’re off ... but the Camp Nou is empty. Barcelona released a statement condemning the violence, but confirmed their match this afternoon would go ahead – behind closed doors. “FC Barcelona condemn the events which have taken place in many parts of Catalonia today in order to prevent its citizens exercising their democratic rights to free expression,” read a club statement. “Given the exceptional nature of events, the Board of Directors have decided that the FC Barcelona first team game against Las Palmas will be played behind closed doors following the Professional Football League’s refusal to postpone the game.” The Catalan Football Federation had already suspended all matches due to referendum, but FC Barcelona are not under their jurisdiction. Earlier today, Las Palmas announced a Spanish flag had been sewn onto their kit for the game to show support for “the unity of Spain.” Ben will be here soon enough. Until then, get the lowdown on those clashes that have not postponed this match, but forced it to be played behind closed doors:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/01/eric-pickles-calls-for-tories-to-be-prepared-for-snap-elections","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T13:03:24Z","webTitle":"Eric Pickles calls for Tories to be prepared for snap elections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/01/eric-pickles-calls-for-tories-to-be-prepared-for-snap-elections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/01/eric-pickles-calls-for-tories-to-be-prepared-for-snap-elections","fields":{"headline":"Eric Pickles calls for Tories to be prepared for snap elections","bodyText":"The Conservatives must be prepared for “sudden elections” at any time by creating a manifesto committee to vet policies and establishing a new youth wing, an internal review has found. The inquest into the result of the 8 June election, drawn up by former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles, made 126 recommendations to make sure the party is better prepared for any future snap elections at a time of political volatility. Pickles, a former party chairman, said there was a “clear campaigning deficiency” in the party and called for a “fundamental re-evaluation” of the way it runs elections. One key proposal was a new manifesto committee to make sure policies are properly thought through by senior cabinet ministers, after the document was kept to a tight circle of the prime minister’s advisers at the last election. He suggested the process of drawing up a manifesto should start within 12 months of the last election, involving the prime minister, chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary, party chairman, chief executive and chief whip. The report also confirms the Guardian’s report that the Conservatives will look to re-establish a “vibrant youth wing” and make sure there is under-30s representation on the party board and on candidate selection panels. Pickles also called for an increase in the number of candidates who are women or from diverse backgrounds, including ethnic minorities, admitting that the Conservatives have not done enough to engage with Britain’s black and ethnic minority communities. Pickles acknowledged that it was a “glum” night for the Tories, with only the improved performance in Scotland providing some cheer. However, he said he felt “a sense of optimism” and believed the party was “in a mood to address the defects and deficiencies of our electoral machine”. He added: “We can come out of this process stronger and better, but we will need to be brave, radical and modern in our reforms.” He said the Conservatives would need to concentrate on squeezing the Labour vote in target seats and Conservative-held marginals, after a return to two-party politics. “The true importance of our percentage share is the measure of the task we face, and the need for a fundamental re-evaluation of the way we organise and conduct our election campaigns to translate this increased vote share into a higher number of seats,” he said. He stressed the importance of recruiting more members and volunteers to get the Tory message out on the ground, in the face of a “united left” that provided coordinated and enthusiastic support for Jeremy Corbyn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/02/labour-calls-for-inquiry-after-private-ambulance-firm-folds","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T06:00:24Z","webTitle":"Labour calls for inquiry after private ambulance firm folds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/02/labour-calls-for-inquiry-after-private-ambulance-firm-folds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/02/labour-calls-for-inquiry-after-private-ambulance-firm-folds","fields":{"headline":"Labour calls for inquiry after private ambulance firm folds","bodyText":"Labour has called for an inquiry after the collapse of a private ambulance firm that has contracts with the NHS and other private health organisations. Private Ambulance Service, which the trade union Unison described as running an “abysmal” operation, was issued a winding-up notice by the Inland Revenue on Friday. The firm is expected to stop trading on 9 October. The company has been employed in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire as non-urgent patient transport service. It worked for hospitals including Watford General and Bedford hospital. Labour MP Justin Madders, the shadow health minister, said: “It is still staggering that under the Tories so many parts of the NHS are being packaged up and sold off to companies who are unable to run the services properly. “Several hundreds of staff and thousands of patients are now faced with huge uncertainty because of the failings of another private ambulance firm, and it’s not the first time this has happened.” Madders called for an inquiry into what went wrong, saying the government should place “an immediate halt” on issuing other patient transport contracts until “lessons have been learned”. Unison representatives said the service should never have been taken outside of the NHS. Tim Roberts, regional manager for Unison Eastern, said patient transport in the area had been contracted to private providers for the last few years. However, the previous company withdrew early, leaving the Private Ambulance Service to step in. “Our concern at Unison is that this key service should be provided by the NHS ... this contract in the last few months has been a disaster. We have heard horror stories of patients soiling themselves as they have been left waiting for an ambulance for so long. We have also heard about non-roadworthy and dirty ambulances. From a safeguarding and safety point of view, Personal Ambulance Services were abysmal,” he said. Roberts said that when news of the service going into administration came through, they were in the process of launching a legal case against the company due to complaints from staff about unpaid wages. In July the Herts Advertiser reported that the Herts Valleys clinical commissioning group had issued an apology after ongoing problems with the performance of Private Ambulance Service, which left vulnerable patients stuck in hospitals or their homes for hours while waiting to be picked up. Employees at the Private Ambulance Service were sent an email on Saturday from East England ambulance service, Unison and Herts Valley, Bedfordshire, Luton, Herts North and East clinical commissioning groups. It read: “[We] have been working together to agree how the service can be continued over the coming days and weeks ... Firstly, the most important thing is that we need you more than ever – we have patients across the area who rely on the services you provide and we therefore very much want you to continue coming to work and delivering those services, for which of course you will be paid for.” It continued: “We are looking how we can support staff through this transition. Part of these discussions will also be to look at staff terms and conditions and explore if we can bring them into line with the NHS, something which we hope will be a positive move for you.” The Private Ambulance Service, which operates 126 vehicles with 300 staff, had not responded to the Guardian with a response at the time of going to press."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/05/the-main-allegations-against-ted-heath","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T11:21:56Z","webTitle":"The main allegations against Ted Heath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/05/the-main-allegations-against-ted-heath","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/05/the-main-allegations-against-ted-heath","fields":{"headline":"The main allegations against Ted Heath","bodyText":"The police report on claims that Sir Edward Heath sexually abused children has produced a chronology of seven main allegations against him. Heath, who died in 2005, was prime minister between 1970 and 1974 and led the Conservative party from 1965 until he was ousted by Margaret Thatcher in 1975. Police said the allegations would have led to Heath being interviewed under caution. None relate to his time as prime minister. These are the allegations and the positions Heath held at the time: 1961 Heath allegedly raped and indecently assaulted an 11-year-old boy during a paid sexual encounter in private in a dwelling. At the time Heath was MP for Bexley and Lord Privy Seal in Harold Macmillan’s government with responsibility for negotiating the UK’s first attempt to join the European Economic Community. 1962 While Heath was still Lord Privy Seal, he allegedly indecently assaulted a 10-year-old boy during a chance encounter in a public place while in the company of an unknown adult male. 1964 While secretary of state for industry, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted a 15-year-old boy during three paid sexual encounters. Heath was made Tory party leader a year later. 1967 Two years after becoming leader of the oppositon, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted a 15-year-old boy who was not known to him, in private, during a chance encounter in a public building. 1976 A year after being ousted as Tory leader, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted an adult male during a chance encounter at a public event. The alleged incident was “over clothing”, according to the police. Heath was MP for Sidcup at the time. 1990-92 While MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted a boy in private, during a chance encounter in private gardens. The boy, who was aged between 12 and 14, was not known to him. But the report says investigators “gathered information that potentially undermines the victim’s account”. 1992 Then father of the House of Commons, Heath allegedly indecently assaulted an adult man after consent was withdrawn, in what had been a paid consensual sexual encounter in a hotel. The report gave no more specific details about the individual allegations. It said more details could compromise the anonymity of the victims and “inadvertently lead to an inference as to the guilt or otherwise of Sir Edward Heath”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-restaurant-pidgin-east-london","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T10:00:28Z","webTitle":"2017's best restaurant – Pidgin, east London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-restaurant-pidgin-east-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/15/ofm-awards-2017-best-restaurant-pidgin-east-london","fields":{"headline":"2017's best restaurant – Pidgin, east London","bodyText":"When the public ballot opened for this year’s Best Restaurant, James Ramsden sent a tweet to his then near-17,000 followers: “If you vote for Pidgin in the #ofmawards I’ll personally empty your dishwasher.” Now the east London restaurant he co-owns has won – by some margin, as it happens – does he not regret making that offer? The 31-year-old Ramsden laughs. “Yeah, it was actually a fairly clumsily written tweet, but I’m glad it was, because it was meant to say ‘…for a year’. As far as is practical, though, I will honour the offer. I mean, it’s a bit of a weird thing to do, to call me up and say …” “I don’t think it’s weird at all,” interjects Sam Herlihy, partner in Pidgin and their new restaurant Magpie. “You’ve said you’ll do it.” You can almost hear Ramsden’s brain whirring. “I might have my work cut out,” he concedes. “I know one guy from Poland who was a barman at Pidgin and is now in the kitchen at Magpie. He voted and he’s going home at the end of the month. I’m not going to Warsaw to unload a dishwasher. But if it’s within a two-hour train journey, I’ll do it.” Pidgin is tiny (just 28 seats) and, unless you live in east London, a total pain to get to. When it opened in July 2015, the reviews were effusive, but almost all questioned whether this neighbourhood was ready for an offering so refined and uncompromising: all diners, lunch and dinner, eat the same four courses, for £45 per head. Every week the menu changes, and not an ingredient here or there, but a total overhaul. In two years, they’ve never repeated a single dish. The concept of Pidgin, the critics noted back then, did not exactly chime with the times. Small, sharing plates were in fashion – they still are – and no one had the time or inclination to sit down for three hours. The most popular restaurants tended to be very regionally specific: Ramsden, Herlihy and their head chef Dan Graham, meanwhile, loved exotic ingredients they’d read about on obscure food blogs. They were as likely to forage in a Chinese supermarket as they were in the hedgerows around London Fields. “There’s a food writer who lives nearby,” says Ramsden, “and I remember saying, ‘Oh, we’re opening round the corner from you.’ He said, ‘That’s really exciting. My wife and I were saying that we really need somewhere local where you can pop in for a bite to eat, glass of wine, you don’t have to worry about being late for the babysitter.’” Ramsden pauses: “And I was like, ‘Yeah, it’s kind of the opposite of that.” Ramsden and Herlihy, who is 36, had a small fanbase from a supper club called the Secret Larder, which was hosted originally in Ramsden’s flat and latterly in the back of a coffee shop. But word soon spread of Pidgin’s convivial, laidback atmosphere and the exuberant food being created by Elizabeth Allen, the original head chef. In October 2016, the restaurant earned a Michelin star (which they lost earlier this month). Graham, previously a sous chef, took over behind the stove around the same time and OFM’s Best Restaurant award – previously won by The Palomar in 2015 and last year by Barrafina, Adelaide Street – is proof that Pidgin continues to delight. “The OFM award feels really meaningful because it’s voted for by the public,” says Ramsden. Herlihy nods: “It’s a place that doesn’t do the easy A to B. We try and do something exciting, and it feels like a nice thumbs up for trying to do something more interesting than what a lot of places do.” When he first heard, Graham apparently said, “Oh really? I’m never going to get a day off now.” But this afternoon, the 30-year-old chef is more sanguine. “It’s a crazy achievement for us,” he says. “Yeah, until I saw you arrive to do the interview I didn’t really believe it.” “He hasn’t shown us any credentials,” Herlihy points out. “This award is for making people happy and that’s what you get into it for,” Graham says. “It’s a great reminder that you’re not just cooking for three people a year who turn up to judge you. You’re cooking for everybody: you want to knock people’s socks off.” It’s not easy to describe a meal at Pidgin, not least because next week it will be different. What remains constant, though, is an obsession with the strange and the wonderful. On the day we meet, Herlihy, who is gruff and shaggy, arrives with bags of fresh yuba, which is a film made from boiling soy milk, and wind-dried Chinese sausage. Graham emerges from the broom-cupboard kitchen where he has been trying to perfect “an oyster version of eggs benedict”, which may be where the sausage ends up. “The hope is it will feel familiar even though it will taste and look foreign,” says Graham. “There’s a comfort level that means it’s not too off-putting.” “Rule number one at Pidgin has always been that there needs to be something about a dish that’s worth talking about,” explains Ramsden, who is described by the other two as the upbeat one. “But rule number two is that it’s got to be delicious.” Ramsden started out as a food writer, which led on to cookbooks, podcasts and the Secret Larder. He made contact with Herlihy, out of the blue, after liking the offbeat food column he wrote for the Quietus website. Herlihy had previously been the front man and songwriter of indie bands Hope of the States and the Northwestern, but had fallen out of love with music. “When Sam and I met, he clearly was a good yin to my dull yang,” recalls Ramsden. “He’d start saying, ‘Have you read this book? Have you heard about this chef?’ And I’d go, ‘No, I just read Nigel Slater and that’s done me fine, thank you.’” All agree that Herlihy is primarily responsible for the wackier elements of Pidgin – including the toilet, which has wallpaper depicting a storm and the sound of thunder booming from a hidden speaker, a background noise that he used to play on tour buses when he was trying to sleep. “It’s maybe not a grand achievement in the list of any achievements we’ve made here, but one of them is that people tend to talk about our bathroom,” says Herlihy. “We’ve only had one complaint, which was from a lady who came out of there a bit freaked out. She said she had a fear of drowning and she’d had a panic attack. I felt really awful, and I didn’t really want to say, ‘That’s my favourite sound in the world.’” The pair’s head chefs, Allen and now Graham, have the complex job of turning often whimsical ideas into sophisticated plates of food. “It might be something abstract like, ‘What if we do a dish that’s all black?’” says Graham. “Or ‘What about a dish that looks like a ghost?’ Some of them might be silly, like let’s rhyme a dish like Dr Seuss.” He’s referring to lychee and kaffir zefir with kefir sorbet, a dessert from back in February that was served – naturally – with tepache and a kuih bangkit tapioca cookie. Such relentless creativity is a lot to ask from a chef and it is perhaps revealing that Allen (who will open her own restaurant, Shibui, next year after her baby is born) and Graham took circuitous paths to cooking: both in fact, coincidentally, trained as architects. This background has come in handy, Graham believes. “Architecture is about critical problem-solving,” he says. “And that’s what we’re doing here: how do you make some weird dish that we’ve spoken about work? Conceptually, and also practically. It’s always said that food and shelter are the two essentials of human life, but they are also two things you can elevate to an art form.” Graham, who decided to become a chef after a visit to Mugaritz in Spain, found it stressful at Pidgin in the early days, but now he can’t imagine working any other way. “I’ve been here nearly two years, so I’ve done nearly 100 menus, that’s 400 dishes,” he says. “That’s more than most chefs would do in a career. So you just practise at making new dishes more, and you get better at it. And it’s not a casual practice: ‘Oh, we need to change the menu in a month’s time …’ It’s, ‘Right, we’re changing it in two days’ time.’” Surely, sometimes there must be calamities? Graham looks nervously at his two bosses. Herlihy shakes his head: “James and I would both say, it’s near supernatural to me that there are not more disasters.” And with that endorsement, Graham heads back to the kitchen to work out how to make an oyster eggs benedict.

Alone in a valley, surrounded by a forest whose trees were stripped bare by wind, Edgardo Alvarado and Annette Grau sleep on the ground floor of their farmhouse, often going to bed thirsty and hungry. When Hurricane Maria thrashed this municipality in the heart of Puerto Rico two weeks ago it made light work of the couple’s flimsy home. It scattered their belongings on to the muddy ground below, leaving only a single room habitable in their home. When the sun sets, they live by two dim torchlights as they cannot afford a generator to restore power. The taps no longer work, so they drink water from a nearby stream and bathe in the river. Their crops have been ruined. Their only neighbour has already fled. “We pray for the dawn,” said Alvarado. “Wishing for someone to come.” When Donald Trump visited Puerto Rico this week, he congratulated local officials, the federal government – and himself – for the official response to the disaster. “It’s now acknowledged what a great job we’ve done,” Trump said, and told Governor Ricardo Rosselló he could be “very proud” of the low official death toll. Hours after the president jetted back to Washington, the tally doubled to 34 and is expected to rise further. Trump also told the island, where about 92% of people still have no electricity, that the crisis had thrown the federal budget “a little out of whack”, before tossing paper towels into a crowd of people waiting for basic supplies. There is no cellular, television, internet or electricity service in Orocovis, but news of the president’s comments had spread here by word of mouth. “It was like he was making fun of us openly,” Alvarado, 64, said. “He showed complete disrespect.” “If I was there, I would have thrown the paper back,” Grau, 58, added. In this remote location, about a 30-minute drive from the municipality’s main town along roads still partially engulfed by landslides, aid has been slow to arrive. Alvarado received his first relief package – two small boxes of snacks – from troops on Monday, and those meagre supplies have already run out. But there are still some neighbourhoods in this area that have received nothing. For the first four days after Maria hit, all communications with Orocovis – a municipality of around 23,000 people – were cut, and the main roadway to San Juan was only completely cleared three days ago, finally allowing more aid to flow in. But the mayor Jesús Colón Berlingeri, said that help was desperately needed. “We still need help with food, water and communications. It is still very bad.” The mayor said that five people had died here in circumstances indirectly related to Maria. One 82-year-old man died of a heart attack on the night the hurricane struck. His relatives were unable to remove his corpse from the family home for three days due to blocked roads. Some of the minor roadways are still hemmed in by debris – ranging from collapsed pylons, uprooted trees and bamboo to mudslides – meaning some residents are still effectively trapped. Manuel Maldonado, a 23-year-old now assisting with roadside clearance, said his street had only opened up on Monday, meaning he had been walking five hours a day through the forest to find food for his young family for nine straight days. “It was like the old times,” he said. “We needed to walk or we would die.” Although queues for fuel in San Juan have dropped significantly in recent days, and the governor’s office reports 76% of gas stations are now open on the island, there was no petrol at any of Orocovis’s six facilities on Wednesday. At the Saez service station dozens of residents had been queueing since midnight for the next petrol truck to arrive. The last delivery here was on Monday. But by 6pm they were still waiting. The municipality’s only hospital was running on a generator that had been in operation since Hurricane Irma struck over a month ago. Staff said it was now only functioning intermittently and the facility had been forced to cut opening hours. Doctors reported a surge in gastroenteritis cases due to people drinking stream water. At a lookout point high into the mountains residents gather on a daily basis, not to admire the views – now marred by thousands of devastated trees and dozens of destroyed houses – but to try and get a signal on their cellphones. The municipality estimates about 2,000 homes have been destroyed here. Erica Cartagena, a mother of three, said she had lost the roof of her home when Maria struck and was now living with her sister-in-law who had flown in from New York to bring supplies. Her family had received no government aid and were going hungry on a daily basis. She was now forced to use unpurified stream water in her eight-month-old son Jonael’s powdered milk. “I know that it is not good, but what else can I do?” she said. “They [the government] say they’re bringing trucks of water, but I don’t see them anywhere.” The 28-year-old voiced the exasperation and resentment towards Trump that many articulated here. “He’s not my president,” she said. “If he was responsible he would have come to the affected areas.” Her 22-year-old friend Madelina Colón nodded in agreement. She is eight months pregnant and worried: “I’ll have to do it [give birth] like the old times, with no doctor.” Annette Grau had herself suffered a medical emergency in Maria’s aftermath – a minor heart attack induced by a panic attack after flies and bees swarmed into the house due to flooding. Luckily, she made it to the hospital in time and was given medication to calm the palpitations. Eventually on Wednesday the couple received the aid they needed in the short term. A brigade of activists working with an ecological farmers collective drove from San Juan with packets of rice, beans and tinned fruit. It would be enough to keep them going for a while, but officials estimated that it could take up to a year to restore power to this neighbourhood. “It doesn’t feel good to lose everything,” Grau said. “But it’s good that I’m alive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/05/uk-car-sales-fall-consumer-confidence-diesel-smmt","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T13:10:41Z","webTitle":"UK car sales slide for a sixth month amid falling consumer confidence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/05/uk-car-sales-fall-consumer-confidence-diesel-smmt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/05/uk-car-sales-fall-consumer-confidence-diesel-smmt","fields":{"headline":"UK car sales slide for a sixth month amid falling consumer confidence","bodyText":"New car sales in the UK fell for a sixth month in September, leaving the market on course for its first annual decline since 2011. Car registrations dropped by 9.3% to 426,170, the first time the September market has declined in six years. The Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT) and Traders blamed declining consumer confidence given uncertainty over Brexit and confusion over air quality plans. Sales of diesel cars crashed by 21.7% last month. September, when number plates change, is a key month for car sales. New car registrations have fallen 3.9% over the first nine months of 2017 and are expected to record a fall over the year as a whole. The SMMT had been expecting an annual decline because previous years were strong, but it now looks as though that drop may be bigger than expected, a spokeswoman said. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said: “This is an economy being driven into the ditch. This is worrying not only for the car industry but speaks to a deeper economic malaise with anaemic economic growth figures this year and real wages lower than 10 years ago. The country desperately needs a bold, transformative industrial strategy.” Richard Jones, the managing director of motor finance firm Black Horse, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said: “With the new 67 plates now available, September was an important month for the industry and today’s figures reflect the general slowdown across the market.” Sales of diesel cars have been falling for six years and if this trend continues, CO2 emissions from new vehicles could rise this year for the first time since average CO2 emissions in Britain were first recorded in 2000, the SMMT said. Diesel vehicles were long promoted as being cleaner than petrol cars but recent research suggests that they could be worse for causing carbon emissions. Tax breaks have favoured diesel over petrol, even though they are a leading emitter of the air pollutants nitrogen oxides (NOx), which is responsible for an estimated 70,000 premature deaths in Europe each year. This year, the UK government announced that it would ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040. It followed a similar announcement in France. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: “September is always a barometer of the health of the UK new car market so this decline will cause considerable concern. Business and political uncertainty is reducing buyer confidence, with consumers and businesses more likely to delay big-ticket purchases.” He noted that a car is usually the second-largest big-ticket item for consumers, after a property. “The confusion surrounding air quality plans has not helped, but consumers should be reassured that all the new diesel and petrol models on the market will not face any bans or additional charges,” he added. “Diesel clearly offers benefits in terms of fuel economy and for many customers fuel economy is an important thing,” he said. The biggest declines in September were seen at opposite ends of the market with sales of luxury saloons and superminis falling 36.4% and 21.2% respectively. Demand from business, fleet and private buyers all fell in September, down by 5.2%, 10.1% and 8.8% respectively. Demand for new vans dropped 4.2% in September to 57,368, driven by a fall in sales of smaller vans. Sales of pick-ups and heavier van sales rose slightly. Credit insurance firm Euler Hermes predicts new UK car sales will fall 5% this year to 3m vehicles and 6% in 2018 to 2.8m after five years of growth. The US is the only other global market that will experience declines. Overall, the firm predicts that global vehicle sales will reach 100m by 2019, driven by strong demand in China and India. Sue Robinson, the director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said: “Consumers walking into the showroom need more clarity on issues such as diesel and air quality. We are working closely with car retailers to assist them in educating their customers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/05/entombed-man-noel-conway-loses-high-court-fight-end-life","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T10:15:02Z","webTitle":"Terminally ill man loses high court fight to end his life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/05/entombed-man-noel-conway-loses-high-court-fight-end-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/05/entombed-man-noel-conway-loses-high-court-fight-end-life","fields":{"headline":"Terminally ill man loses high court fight to end his life","bodyText":"A man who fears being entombed in his own body as he suffers the effects of motor neurone disease has lost his high court fight to enable doctors to help him to end his own life. Three judges ruled against Noel Conway, a 67-year-old retired lecturer, who argued that the law on assisted dying should be changed to allow him a “peaceful and dignified” death. Conway, who was not at the high court in London on Thursday, wanted a declaration that the Suicide Act 1961 is incompatible with article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which relates to respect for private and family life. But Lord Justice Sales, Mrs Justice Whipple and Mr Justice Garnham rejected his case. After the judgment was handed down, Conway expressed his disappointment and said he intended to appeal. “The experiences of those who are terminally ill need to be heard. This decision denies me a real say over how and when I will die. “I am told the only option I currently have is to effectively suffocate to death by choosing to remove my ventilator, which I am now dependent on to breathe for up to 22 hours a day. There is no way of knowing how long it would take me to die if I did this, or whether my suffering could be fully relieved. To me, this is not choice – this is cruelty.” Conway said he faced “unbearable suffering” and the possibility of a “traumatic, drawn-out death” as a result of the judgment. He said it was no longer viable for him to travel to Switzerland, the site of the Dignitas clinic, and he said he would not put his family or doctors “at risk of prosecution by asking for their help here at home”. Conway said: “Knowing I had the option of a safe, peaceful assisted death at a time of my choosing would allow me to face my final months without the fear and anxiety that currently plagues me and my loved ones. It would allow me to live the rest of my life on my own terms, knowing I was in control rather than at the mercy of a cruel illness.” Conway began his legal “fight for choice at the end of life” after being diagnosed with the condition in November 2014. He is unlikely to live beyond the next 12 months and wanted to be given the right to decide when he died. He had said he wanted to say goodbye to his family and friends “at the right time, not to be in a zombie-like condition and suffering both physically and psychologically”. The decision, he argued, could be taken once he had less than six months to live and while he still had the mental capacity, and he wanted to be able to call upon the help of the medical profession. The law forbids doctors giving him such help and doing so is punishable by up to 14 years in prison. His case was supported by Humanists UK and opposed by the secretary of state for justice, with the backing of Care Not Killing and Not Dead Yet UK, who also made submissions. The British Medical Association has previously expressed its opposition to physician-assisted dying, saying it risked putting “vulnerable people at risk of harm” and would be “contrary to the ethics of clinical practice”. Sarah Wootton, the chief executive of Dignity in Dying, which supported Conway, said the judgment confirmed the courts had the authority to “declare the current law inconsistent with our human rights”, though it had ruled the opposite in this case. She said: “How can it be more ethical or safe for Noel to have his ventilation withdrawn under the current law, with no formal safeguards, than for him to request life-ending medication within the multiple safeguards proposed through his case? This is paradoxical. “It is clear the current law does not work, when every eight days someone from this country travels to Dignitas; every year, 300 dying people end their own lives at home in England and Wales; and thousands more experience unimaginable suffering right to the bitter end. “Terminally ill people deserve to be listened to. They are, after all, the true experts on how they want to die.” The chief executive of Humanists UK, Andrew Copson, said: “We are hugely disappointed at the decision of the high court today. It is simply wrong that those who are of sound mind but are terminally ill or incurably suffering are denied the choice and dignity to die at a time of their choosing.” The campaign director of Care Not Killing, which argued against Conway, said: “The safest law is the one we currently have, which gives a blanket prohibition on all assisted suicide and euthanasia. This deters exploitation and abuse through the penalties that it holds in reserve but, at the same time, gives some discretion to prosecutors and judges to temper justice with mercy in hard cases.” Dr Peter Saunders added: “A change in the law is opposed by every major disability rights organisation and doctors’ group, including the BMA, Royal College of GPs and the Association for Palliative Medicine. These groups have looked at this issue on numerous occasions in detail and concluded that there is no safe system of assisted suicide and euthanasia anywhere in the world.” The disability rights campaign group Not Dead Yet UK, which was on the same side of the argument, said it was “relieved” at the judgment. “We are looking forward to the national conversation now focussing on the real issue here, which is a lack of adequate social care being provided to people with disabilities. Similarly we need a proper discussion on ensuring proper palliative care is provided for the terminally ill,” said its spokeswoman, Juliet Marow.The judges ruled that section 2 of the Suicide Act 1961, which outlaws euthanasia, was compatible with the right to a private life conferred in article 8 of the European convention on human rights. Conway’s lawyer dropped a claim that it was incompatible with the right to protection from discrimination during the proceedings. A claim to bring judicial review was dismissed and the judges delayed a decision on whether to grant permission to appeal against their ruling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/06/fake-model-scouts-tricking-uk-girls-into-sharing-explicit-photos","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T14:09:45Z","webTitle":"Fake model scouts tricking UK girls into sharing explicit photos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/06/fake-model-scouts-tricking-uk-girls-into-sharing-explicit-photos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/06/fake-model-scouts-tricking-uk-girls-into-sharing-explicit-photos","fields":{"headline":"Fake model scouts tricking UK girls into sharing explicit photos","bodyText":"A growing number of teenage girls are being approached online by fake model recruiters who lure them into sending indecent images of themselves, which are later used to extort money. Facebook and Instagram accounts are being set up in the names of leading model agencies such as Storm Model Management, which discovered Kate Moss and represents Cindy Crawford. Girls receive messages from someone who claims to be recruiting for the agency; they are encouraged to send topless photos or conduct a Skype interview in which they are asked to remove their clothes or wear lingerie. Sarah Doukas, the managing director of Storm, said that in the past two years the number of calls the agency had received about scam agents had risen from one a week to almost daily messages. “The rise of social media has impacted greatly on why modelling agency scams are increasing,” Doukas said. “Firstly, a lot of young people’s Instagram accounts are not private, and consequently they are easy to approach. Secondly, fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated because of social media generally. “We are getting more scammers posing as ‘friends’ of the model agency and offering an introduction to us, and this is not legitimate. There was one example recently, which went on for several months, where a vulnerable girl was invited to a shoot and she ended up taking her clothes off. She had been approached by a fraudster claiming to know me.” In the UK last year there were 327 reported cases of scam model recruiters. DI Chris Felton, crime manager at the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, said a “significant” number involved scammers operating on social media. “Social media means [scammers] can now reach a larger audience than previously, and if you are after a younger demographic then it’s an easy way to reach them,” he said. “[The number of cases of scam model recruiters] may have gone up slightly, but if you look back, social media will have played a bigger role because it’s how people communicate now.” In other instances, girls are asked to pay extortionate amounts of money to get portfolios or “comp cards” (essentially a business card). A legitimate agency would offer these for free. Doukas said: “Young people and their parents or guardians must be vigilant and defensive – do not trust anyone until you have established they are legitimate, and do your research.” Alex Haddad, the director of BMA Models, said his agency was receiving 10 phone calls and 20 emails a week about scam agents – nearly twice as many as last year. “[Scammers] use names from our agency, a booker or agent. They have used different people in the past – our website has a history of who works here on it. They then contact people from Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook and pretend to be a headhunter or recruiter,” he said. “They will say they are scouting for models and ask for pictures, sometimes they ask for naked shots ... We are getting phone calls from concerned parents saying, ‘Is this a scam? What is happening?’ “Some of them do Skype calls which are so-called interviews, and they ask things like, ‘Would you shave your head or go topless?’ It’s always young girls who get targeted.” Jessica Barker, co-founder of the cyber security consultancy Redacted Firm, said she had heard cases of girls being lured into sending sexually explicit images and told the photos would be posted online unless the scammers were paid. “Teenage girls using Instagram and sharing pictures get approached by someone who has a profile looking like a modelling scout or talent scout for TV and film, often in the US,” she said. “They say the girls look great and have the right look for film or whatever modelling campaign they are supposedly doing. Then they ask, ‘Can we see some more pictures?’ They flatter the girls a lot and give them hope in terms of what they are looking for. They encourage the girls to then share explicit pictures, and when they do they try to extort them of money.” Barker added: “Awareness is key. This form of attack is very unknown and people are not talking about it much in media. If you’re in this situation, approached by someone asking you for explicit images, don’t send them. A reputable model agency, for example, would never ask for someone to send naked images of themselves. If you have sent the images and are worried about being scammed, or you have received threats, tell a trusted adult.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/05/times-up-for-drawn-rugby-union-games-we-need-extra-time-in-tests","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"Time's up for drawn rugby union games.

We need extra-time in Tests","bodyText":"Back to back draws between the Wallabies and the Springboks in less than a month have strengthened the argument for extra time to be introduced into Test rugby. The Wallabies drew 23-all with the Springboks in Perth and 27-all in Bloemfontein, 160 minutes of rugby which did not produce a result. Wallabies playmaker Kurtley Beale described the draw in Bloemfontein as a “dull feeling” and suggested rugby copy rugby league and play extra time. Sport is about emotion as much as skill and fitness. There is nothing worse than walking off the field feeling nothing or leaving the grandstand without a cheer or even a tear. Traditionalists would say extra time undermines the integrity of the 80 minutes of regular time. When the fulltime whistle blows that’s it, game over. But of course rugby does have extra time in the World Cup playoffs, a necessity in tournament play where teams advance through the finals matches to determine the champion. Imagine if there were no extra time in the 2003 World Cup final in Sydney and Jonny Wilkinson never kicked that match-winning field goal. Australia and England would have been declared joint winners after drawing 17-all at the end of 80 minutes. How deflating would that have been? While every Test match is not of the same magnitude as a World Cup final or even a quarter-final, you could argue there should always be a winner and a loser to avoid that empty feeling. More than anything else a sporting event is an experience for players and spectators alike and at the heart of that experience is winning and losing, which defines the contest. That is not to say all draws are meaningless or emotionless. Look at the contrasting reactions to the drawn series between the All Blacks and the British and Irish Lions. You would have thought the tourists had won the series. Ridiculed Lions coach Warren Gatland even wore a red clown’s nose to a media conference to literally thumb his nose at his Kiwi critics. He would not have done that if he had not felt vindicated. Conversely, All Blacks captain Kieran Read did not know whether to laugh or cry when he held the trophy aloft with Lions skipper Sam Warburton. Extra time after that 15-all draw in the third Test in Auckland would have been brilliant. In most cases a draw is a dull feeling just as Beale described. Players and fans seek the gratification of winning, the elixir of sport. A draw is too often a waste of time and energy. It is not as if draws are common in Test rugby, but there is the potential for a draw in every game that is played. You would not want too many games left undecided. That would indeed be dull. If a little bit of extra time or even a golden score ensured a winner, then surely that is something which should be considered quite strongly. Extra time increases spectator interest in a contest. Just think of the thrilling overtime games in NBA basketball for example. Not all sports like the idea though and it does not seem likely World Rugby will introduce extra time to Tests outside the World Cup any time soon. It would mess with television schedules for a start. So the best way to avoid that hollow feeling is to find a way to win those tight games, something the Wallabies should be paying particularly close attention to. In three of their last four Tests the Wallabies have lost narrowly to the All Blacks and drawn twice with the Springboks. In all three games Australia have been found wanting in critical moments whether it is failing to win a vital restart or not securing the ball in a last-ditch attack. Little things that really add up and weigh heavily against you. This is something the Wallabies will need to address as they head towards the 2019 World Cup in Japan, starting with their final game of the Rugby Championship against Argentina in Mendoza on Sunday. There will not be any dull feelings in the knockout stages of the World Cup, just the ecstasy of victory or the agony of defeat, perhaps as it should be after every Test."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/05/energy-firms-overcharging-greg-clark-theresa-may-price-cap","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T08:35:35Z","webTitle":"Government had duty to stop energy firms overcharging, says Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/05/energy-firms-overcharging-greg-clark-theresa-may-price-cap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/05/energy-firms-overcharging-greg-clark-theresa-may-price-cap","fields":{"headline":"Government had duty to stop energy firms overcharging, says Clark","bodyText":"The business secretary has said the government had a “duty to act” to stop energy companies overcharging customers, suggesting households will start to benefit this winter. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether the proposed energy price cap would be imposed on energy companies this winter, Greg Clark said: “Consumers who are suffering a detriment … could receive early relief for that.” Clark added: “If [energy regulator Ofgem] need legal back-up there is a strong consensus in parliament for this, so we will publish legislation and we’ll invite the whole house to endorse this so that they have the legal certainty.” He said he would be surprised if energy companies mounted a legal battle against the price cap, and pointed to “strong consent in parliament for this”. Clark said “loyal customers” were being overcharged £1.4bn a year, referring to a report by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). “A lot of people see themselves as loyal customers and because the companies know that they’re loyal … they are overcharging them,” he told Sky News. “When you are faced with that evidence you’ve got a duty to act.” However, there is scepticism as to how quickly the cap could come into effect. Theresa May pledged to cap “rip-off” energy prices in her Tory party conference keynote speech on Wednesday, promising to introduce a draft bill next week to give the energy regulator, Ofgem, powers to cap the bills of people being “punished” for their loyalty and their inability to shop around. But the Conservatives later admitted that they were only giving Ofgem the powers to impose a cap for everyone on a standard variable tariff, not actually ordering the regulator to impose it. At the moment, when fixed contracts come to an end customers are pushed on to more expensive standard variable tariffs. About 12 million people are on standard variable tariffs. Iain Conn, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, Britain’s biggest energy supplier, warned there was a “real risk” that “cheap deals go because the mechanism changes” if the government pushes ahead with the price caps. Also speaking on the Today programme, Conn said there was “clear evidence that price caps don’t work”. He added: “In New Zealand, in Spain, in California and in Ontario they tend to limit choice, reduce competition and prices tend to bunch around the cap.” He noted that a cap on bills for those on pre-paid meters in the UK had left prices typically within £2 of each other this year. A CMA report found customers had paid £1.4bn a year in “excessive prices” between 2012 and 2015, with those on standard variable tariffs (70% of the total) paying 11% more for their electricity and 15% more for their gas than customers on other tariffs. Clark said: “This is a big amount and if consumers are being overcharged by £1.4bn a year it is right to act on that. “You do need competition, but what the competition authorities have established is that the energy market is not working well.” He said there were essentially two markets, with savvy consumers seeking out the best deals online while many others stay loyal to a brand and end up being ripped off. Conn recognised there was a need to improve the energy market and accepted the industry “has an element of the blame,” but said instead of capping standard variable tariffs, they should be ended altogether. He said Ofgem could regulate to this effect. Conn said: “Our message is wait, don’t go ahead with price caps, there’s a much better way of solving this market for the long run.” The GMB union reiterated that Ofgem should be abolished and all its regulatory functions taken over by the government, making its regulatory role accountable to parliament with the powers to cap prices if deemed necessary part of the forthcoming legislation. Justin Bowden, the GMB national secretary, said: “Ofgem has been a toothless wonder that passed its use-by date years ago, it is not fit for purpose and now is the time for it to be replaced.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/05/ted-heath-would-have-been-questioned-over-seven-abuse-claims-police-say","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T18:08:52Z","webTitle":"Ted Heath would have been questioned over abuse claims, police say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/05/ted-heath-would-have-been-questioned-over-seven-abuse-claims-police-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/05/ted-heath-would-have-been-questioned-over-seven-abuse-claims-police-say","fields":{"headline":"Ted Heath would have been questioned over abuse claims, police say","bodyText":"A police report has said there was reason to suspect that Sir Edward Heath, Britain’s seventh postwar prime minister, carried out a string of sex attacks over a span of decades. The report concludes that the allegations, including the rape of a male child sex worker aged 11 and sexual assault against four other children and two adults, would have met the legal threshold for police to interview Heath under criminal caution had he still been alive. The police said nothing should be inferred from their findings – after a total of 40 allegations – about the guilt or innocence of Heath, who died in 2005. A police chief who oversaw the inquiry told the Guardian that a series of 26 alleged crimes, many against children, would be formally recorded in official law enforcement databases with Heath named as the suspect. Because of the rules under which officers were operating, the conclusion that there was enough reason to suspect Heath to merit interviewing him over at least seven claims was as much as the alleged victims could have got, said assistant chief constable Paul Mills, of Wiltshire police. The police report says: “Further to a proportionate investigation, reasonable grounds exist that, if Sir Edward Heath had been alive today, he would have been interviewed under caution regarding his suspected involvement in an offence.” Of the seven alleged offences deemed most credible by police, one was alleged to have happened while he was a cabinet minister in 1964 and another in 1967 after he became leader of the Conservative party. The first claim, the rape of a boy aged 11 in London, is alleged to have happened in 1961. Another two claims are alleged 31 years later, around 1992, years after Heath’s time as prime minister from 1970 to 1974. It was also alleged that Heath carried out crimes in 1962, against a boy aged 10 in a public place in Kent after a chance encounter. In 1964, when Heath is alleged to have committed an offence against a boy aged 15, Heath was secretary of state for trade and industry. Police said no evidence was found of a coverup or failure to investigate Heath while he was still alive. There was some anger among senior politicians over the findings. Michael Heseltine, who knew Heath, said the report was devoid of evidence. “I am afraid that there isn’t any evidence; there is just speculation and allegations,” Lord Heseltine told Sky News. The two-year investigation was carried out by Wiltshire police, , whose Salisbury home is in their area, on behalf of 14 forces that received allegations about Heath. The Wiltshire chief constable, Mike Veale, who is facing calls for him to resign over the £1.5m pursuit of a dead man, said the investigation showed police would pursue serious allegations no matter how powerful the suspect. “This watershed moment regarding investigations of people connected to the establishment should not be underestimated,” he said. There has been an explosion in reporting of abuse claims to police after the Jimmy Savile scandal, in which the entertainer was found to have got away with hundreds of offences. The government and the police have faced claims first of covering up alleged abuse and then of over-reaction in the pursuit of high-profile figures over baseless allegations – such as Scotland Yard’s Operation Midland, which was found by an inquiry in 2016 to have fallen for lies from an alleged fantasist. The Wiltshire investigation into Heath, after decades of rumours about the former prime minister’s activities, was an attempt to establish the facts. Debate will rage about whether it has and whether the state can investigate the most serious claims about those who have held its highest office. The Guardian understands that there is no corroborative evidence – forensic or DNA evidence – for the seven claims judged most credible by police. The findings are based on an assessment of the accounts from those who say Heath attacked them. It is not unusual for a sexual assault case, let alone one dating back decades, to come down to the word of the complainant, but the key decisions in the investigation were checked and approved by a panel of senior detectives and a panel of non-police experts. Veale said: “We can only go where the evidence takes us.” The report demolishes key defences used by Heath’s supporters which, they say, mean he could not have been an abuser. It says he was often without police protection and was not asexual. The report says: “Two witnesses, who have not disclosed abuse, provided evidence that he was sexually active with consenting adults during parts of his life.” James Gray, the MP for North Wiltshire and a Heath supporter, said: “My strong instinct is that he was entirely asexual, neither gay nor straight nor a paedophile. He was none of those things. “Most of the time he was escorted by close protection officers and he was a high-profile individual. I’m plain that these allegations are nonsensical, not true.” The Crown Prosecution Service will not give advice to police on whether the evidence they have gathered against a deceased suspect would be enough to prosecute. Wiltshire said they thus would not give an opinion on Heath’s guilt or innocence because that was not their role. A scrutiny panel that examined Wiltshire’s decision-making during the investigation included an ethicist and a human rights lawyer. It said: “The investigation was fair, sensitive and rigorous with regards to both victims and suspects.” Veale apologised for an appeal for complainants to come forward being made outside Heath’s house in August 2015, which critics said would encourage false claims. Veale said the inquiry found no evidence of a coverup or that a blind eye was turned to Heath’s activities by agents of the state. The inquiry team spoke to Heath’s police protection officers over the years and the security services. But Veale said police could not investigate thoroughly enough, because it was beyond their remit, to satisfy or rebut claims of a coverup. The report released on Thursday was for public consumption. A fuller version will go to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, where it will most likely be considered as part of an investigation into whether abuse by prominent people was covered up. Ken MacDonald, the former director of public prosecutions, said the force should be ashamed. “The bar for interview is low – in most investigations as low as the police want it to be, and in the case of a dead man virtually non-existent. They are covering their backs at the expense of a dead man. Shame on them.” Two other peers, David Hunt, who chairs the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, and Robert Armstrong, a former cabinet secretary and parliamentary private secretary to Heath while he was prime minister, said: “The Wiltshire police report is profoundly unsatisfactory because it neither justifies nor dispels the cloud of suspicion. As Sir Edward is dead, justice requires that there should be a quasi-judicial process as a substitute for the judicial process.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/05/malcolm-turnbull-renews-pressure-on-nsw-premier-to-approve-narrabri-gas-project","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T07:09:55Z","webTitle":"Turnbull renews pressure on NSW premier to approve Narrabri gas project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/malcolm-turnbull-renews-pressure-on-nsw-premier-to-approve-narrabri-gas-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/malcolm-turnbull-renews-pressure-on-nsw-premier-to-approve-narrabri-gas-project","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull renews pressure on NSW premier to approve Narrabri gas project","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull has resumed pressure on the New South Wales premier to approve the controversial Narrabri gas project, declaring the Santos development would lower domestic gas prices. Going into a special Council of Australian Governments meeting on Thursday, Gladys Berejiklian used a morning radio interview to defy a recent federal government threat to use GST distribution as a lever to overturn state gas bans. Turnbull responded to the rebuff after the Coag meeting by saying his government was looking forward to the Santos project – which is currently going through state planning approvals – going ahead. “The big project, the big Santos project near Narrabri, would contribute a very large amount of gas to the east coast market,” Turnbull told reporters, sitting beside the NSW premier. Berejiklian noted that project was going through a planning process. Turnbull continued to express his view, saying his government was looking forward to that planning process being completed. Turnbull said gas from that field would make “a very significant difference in supply”, and he pointed out that gas prices were a function of supply and demand. Santos is currently seeking approval to drill up to 850 coal seam gas wells on the 95,000 hectare project area. The Narrabri project has faced fierce opposition from sections of the farming community and has caused community division in the region. The NSW premier noted she had gone through the work in her own state to achieve a balance between new gas development and protecting prime farmland, and she was looking forward to a “national approach” on energy issues. The Turnbull government is yet to finalise its new investment framework for energy policy in the wake of the Finkel review of the national electricity market. Leaders were asked on Thursday whether it would be a good idea to gather for a special Coag meeting to resolve energy policy, given they had just successfully agreed on a range of new counter-terrorism measures without controversy. Some premiers at the table pointed out there had already been a Coag meeting to consider the Finkel review, with a number of agreements reached – a clear inference to Canberra’s ongoing lack of resolution on the clean energy target. Turnbull noted that state energy ministers would meet again shortly. The prime minister has signalled the government will deliver a new investment framework for energy by the end of the year. The Labor states have already threatened to band together to implement a new clean energy target consistent with the central recommendation of the Finkel review if the Turnbull government can’t deliver the required national leadership on a post-2020 scheme. The Turnbull government is, meanwhile, pressuring the states with gas bans to open up exploration and production, threatening to use goods and services tax distribution as a lever. NSW and Victoria have rebuffed the GST threat. Ahead of Thursday’s Coag meeting, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, told Sky News there was “no shortage of supply”, as Victoria produced enough gas to supply 7.2m households and only used about 3.6m households’ worth. “The real issue here is not supply, it’s where the gas is being sent,” he said. “Some of us, the prime minister, for instance, and others, can’t seem to recognise the centre of debate is that Australian gas should be for Australian households and Australian businesses.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/06/australias-healthcare-spending-rises-above-10-of-gdp-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T22:22:50Z","webTitle":"Australia's healthcare spending rises above 10% of GDP for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/06/australias-healthcare-spending-rises-above-10-of-gdp-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/06/australias-healthcare-spending-rises-above-10-of-gdp-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Australia's healthcare spending rises above 10% of GDP for first time","bodyText":"Health expenditure exceeded 10% of gross domestic product for the first time in 2015-16, data released on Friday shows. The growth in health spending continues to slow, but not to the same extent as GDP growth. Last year, $170.4bn was spent on health, $6bn (3.6%) more in real terms than in 2014–15, the figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show. It was the fourth consecutive year growth was below the 10-year average of 4.7%. A health economist with the Grattan Institute, Dr Stephen Duckett, said the share of the economy represented by health had hit 10.3% largely due to a slowing increase in GDP. It was good news that health spending was not growing as fast as previously, he said. “But breaching that 10% level is still important, because this means one in every $10 in the economy is being spent in the health sector. Almost 70% of health spending is government spending. “I think it’s a sign that the overall settings that the previous Labor government put in place for public hospital spending is working. No dramatic changes are necessary. We’ve had in the past discussions about healthcare being unsustainable and unaffordable, but the rate of that growth is slowing without any draconian steps like co-payments being required.” But a professor of health economics with the University of Melbourne, Philip Clarke, said state and federal governments needed to act now to avoid a spending and funding crisis. “Inevitably this involves either spending less on other things and/or raising taxes,” Clarke said. “The other option, which is the most politically difficult, is to look at ways of improving the efficiency of the system. In some cases this would involve tackling waste and reducing unnecessary care.” The data showed that state and territory governments contributed 26.1% ($44.4bn) to health expenditure in 2015–16, up from 25.9% ($41.9bn) the previous year. Over the same period, the share of spending by nongovernment funders, including individuals and private health insurers, fell. Individual spending fell only marginally, from 17.7% to 17.3%. “I think as the economy slows down people are having second thoughts about purchasing over-the-counter medicines,” Duckett said. “We also know that when people don’t have as much money to spend sometimes they won’t get their prescription medications filled, as they can’t afford them.” In 2015–16, 68% of individual expenditure was spent on primary healthcare and 19.5% on dental services. Hospital costs accounted for 11.1%, a figure that has more than doubled since 2005–06."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/05/coalition-to-crack-down-on-misuse-of-safety-net-for-unpaid-wages","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T06:10:56Z","webTitle":"Coalition to crack down on misuse of safety net for unpaid wages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/coalition-to-crack-down-on-misuse-of-safety-net-for-unpaid-wages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/coalition-to-crack-down-on-misuse-of-safety-net-for-unpaid-wages","fields":{"headline":"Coalition to crack down on misuse of safety net for unpaid wages","bodyText":"Company directors and managers who leave their companies unable to pay workers’ wages or repeatedly access the taxpayer-funded safety net would be targeted under a federal government crackdown on misuse of the scheme. On Thursday the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, and revenue minister Kelly O’Dwyer announced new penalties for misuse of the fair entitlement guarantee (Feg) due to growing evidence many employers are shifting their costs to the scheme rather than paying their own wage bills. The employment department estimates that one in seven claims on the Feg involves companies that engaged in practices to deliberately avoid paying employees’ entitlements when they become insolvent. A consultation paper issued in May revealed that an examination of all claims on the Feg and its predecessor since July 2007 had concluded “there are more than 1,300 company directors who were directors of two or more companies” who accessed the scheme. “The majority of these 1,300 directors serially managed companies which failed.” In September the employment department refused a freedom of information request from Guardian Australia seeking a list of directors who had repeatedly accessed the Feg, claiming that to release the information would prejudice current investigations that are not public knowledge. The information “forms the basis of departmental referrals to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission as justification for proposed action against certain directors to be disqualified from being company directors”, it said. The proposed changes would create a new civil penalty for directors or managers who make a transaction that a reasonable person would have known would evade employee entitlements. The standard for criminal offences will be lowered so that company officials who recklessly make a transaction that has the effect of avoiding employee entitlements are punished. The current civil penalty is the amount of employee entitlements avoided and the criminal penalty is 10 years’ jail, $210,000 or both, but the existing penalties have never been successfully applied. Directors and officers who have repeatedly become insolvent, relied on the Feg and otherwise breached the Corporations Act could be disqualified under the changes. Since 2007 the average annual cost of the Feg has quadrupled from $63m to $247m. In 2016-17, the scheme paid the unpaid entitlements of 12,354 workers, at a gross cost of $183m of which only $37m was recovered from insolvent companies. The discussion paper identified “sharp” corporate practices to avoid entitlements including: Employees being hired by a company with insufficient assets to pay redundancies or transferring assets away before redundancies; Illegal “phoenix” activity where one company goes insolvent but the business and assets are transferred to another company to continue with the same directors or officers; Unfairly managing an insolvency to the detriment of creditors, for example, through use of a “friendly” liquidator; Company receivers or liquidators failing to pay employee entitlements in breach of legal obligations. In a joint statement Cash and O’Dwyer said: “The government is taking action to ensure employers are held responsible for paying their workers and that taxpayers are protected from corporate abuse of the Feg scheme.” “These changes will be targeted to deter and punish only those who have inappropriately relied on [the] Feg. “They will not affect the overwhelming majority of companies who are doing the right thing.” Labor’s employment spokesman, Brendan O’Connor, said his party “will always support proposals that hold rogue companies and directors to account and ensure workers receive their entitlements”. “However, given that the [employment] minister voted to support her government’s legislation to abolish the Feg scheme only a few years ago, which was stopped by Labor and the crossbench, the detail of any changes to the scheme proposed by the government will need to be carefully scrutinised.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/06/keep-the-change-please-australians-reject-coins-as-not-worth-the-weight","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"Keep the change, please: Australians reject coins as not worth the weight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/06/keep-the-change-please-australians-reject-coins-as-not-worth-the-weight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/06/keep-the-change-please-australians-reject-coins-as-not-worth-the-weight","fields":{"headline":"Keep the change, please: Australians reject coins as not worth the weight","bodyText":"Almost all Australians – 93% – have thrown away a five-cent coin for being annoying to carry, according to a study of more than 1,000 people by the banking group ING. The survey revealed a growing disdain for cash payments across most age groups, and said our aversion to carrying coins costs individuals up to $10 a month in lost change. According to the researchers, Australian adults lose an estimated $38m every month, or $2.10 per person on average. But younger Australians lose more, with 40% of millennials and 36% of Gen Xers losing $10 each month. Only 19% of those aged 50-64 lost a similar amount. More than one in four (28%) of respondents said they hated carrying coins, and 49% said they would regularly make payments on mobile when possible. A comparative international ING survey in February found 27% of Australians carried cash “not often” or “almost never”. Only 10% of Germans gave those responses, while the US was near the top of the cashless table at 34%. Almost one in four Australians (24%) said they would go completely cashless if they had the choice. Reasons cited by respondents in the most recent study for binning the tiny five-cent piece included inconvenience (29%), bulking up a wallet (27%) and the simple fact that people “can’t use five cents” (40%). But Clara Choi, a medical student at the University of Sydney, said she regularly collected coins and took them to the bank. “I collect coins when I clean my room and deposit them at an ATM when the tin is getting heavy,” she said. “My boyfriend and I leave coins in our pockets which end up on the floor when we do the laundry.” Despite her thrift, Choi echoed the sentiment that coins were inconvenient: “They’re only good for buying coffee.” Another postgraduate student, Lachlan Anderson, said he preferred cash to card or phone payments. “Call me paranoid but I don’t really like the idea of all my purchases being tracked. But I also get irritated when too many coins build up in my wallet, as it’s a literal pain in the arse. “My usual response to this is to occasionally offload all my silver into the tip jar of whatever cafe I happen to be buying my coffee from, keeping just the precious, precious gold. “As an Australian, this is one of the few good reasons I can think of for actually leaving a tip.” Other young people Guardian Australia spoke to said they put their loose change in charity donation boxes or saved them for the self-service checkouts of supermarkets. The study found that men were more careless of change than women, with a third of men losing $10 per month, compared with a quarter of women. In February last year, the chief executive of the Royal Australian Mint, Ross MacDiarmid, said the five-cent coin was “dying a natural death” and would fade out of circulation within 10 years. “We’ve seen a halving of the demand for five-cent pieces over the past five years and our expectation is that it will just simply progress, it’s lost its utility, it will lose interest from the public,” he said. Last year, 22.5m five-cent coins were produced, compared with 21.2m in 2015. A 2016 survey of consumer payments conducted by the Reserve Bank found 52% of payments were made with a card and 37% with cash. The use of cash dropped from 47% in 2013 and 69% in 2007. The fall was across all age groups, with 51% of payments in cash by Australians over 65 in 2016, down from 78% in 2007. Last financial year the Royal Australian Mint saw an unexpected rise in demand for coins, attributed to supply chain disruption and “higher demand in tighter economic conditions”. Under the Currency Act, the maximum value of five-cent coins someone can hand over to a shopkeeper is $5."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/05/turnbull-denies-new-facial-recognition-measures-amount-to-mass-surveillance","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Turnbull denies new facial recognition measures amount to 'mass surveillance'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/turnbull-denies-new-facial-recognition-measures-amount-to-mass-surveillance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/turnbull-denies-new-facial-recognition-measures-amount-to-mass-surveillance","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull denies new facial recognition measures amount to 'mass surveillance'","bodyText":"Federal and state police will be given real-time access to passport, visa, citizenship and driver’s licence images for a wide range of criminal investigations – not just identifying terrorism suspects – following agreement between federal, state and territory leaders. Malcolm Turnbull told reporters the facial biometric matching agreement signed off by the Council of Australian Governments on Thursday was not a Big Brother-style mass surveillance exercise, but a modernisation of existing data-sharing practices between agencies. “It doesn’t involve surveillance, or indeed mass surveillance,” the prime minister said. Peppered with questions about the privacy implications of the new automated face-matching regime after he flagged on Wednesday it would work in concert with CCTV footage, Turnbull said law enforcement agencies already routinely shared database information to confirm the identity of potential offenders. But he said the current procedures were laborious, “clunky” and unfit for 21st century law enforcement. “What this is doing is simply making [face matching] available in as near as possible real time,” Turnbull said. He confirmed that private companies could be given access to the information by approval from government, and under supervision. The intergovernmental agreement signed off by leaders says “authorised private sector organisations” will be allowed to access the document verification and face verification services “for matching against identity information held by the commonwealth, states and territories, with the consent of the individual concerned”. While the change was presented by Turnbull and some of the premiers as a technological enhancement of business as usual, the new system will require legislation from the commonwealth and some states. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, made it clear she wanted the new system to be in place before the Commonwealth Games next year, arguing increased surveillance would enhance public safety. The special meeting convened to consider the counter-terrorism framework also agreed that the commonwealth would enact a uniform law to allow terrorism suspects, including minors, to be detained without charge for up to 14 days. Civil libertarians and the Law Council of Australia had raised concerns about the 14-day detention period, which already exists in New South Wales, but the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, brushed those concerns aside. “There will be some today who will focus on the notional infringement, the notional reduction in peoples’ rights and liberties and freedoms, the rights and liberties of a small number of people,” Andrews said. “Some people have the luxury of being able to have that notional debate. Those of us in positions of leadership don’t have that luxury. “We are called to act ... and that is what this Coag meeting today has done. It is this forum operating at its best.” The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said governments needed to be conscious of individual rights and civil liberties, “however, public safety and security must come first”. The federal government has not enacted a 14-day detention regime in the past because of concerns such a law might breach the constitution. But Turnbull said on Thursday it was more efficient for Canberra to legislate, given most counter-terrorism operations were coordinated between the commonwealth and a state jurisdiction. He said the commonwealth was now satisfied it could legislate without constitutional problems. The former independent national security legislation monitor Bret Walker told Sky News a 14-day detention regime was “obviously exceptional” and needed to be justified by politicians seeking the change. Walker said he believed law enforcement agencies would have pressed for the change stemming from their operational experience, but he said ministers needed to do more to inform the public about why the change was desirable. Leaders on Thursday also agreed to criminalise the possession of instructional terrorist material likely to be of practical use to someone preparing for or engaging in a terrorist act, and to create a new hoax offence, ensuring terrorism hoaxes were criminalised in all jurisdictions. The shadow attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, stopped short of lending Labor’s support to the new measures. “On the face of it, these measures appear sensible; but we will wait to see the detail of what is being proposed,” Dreyfus said. “It is important that the balance between security and privacy is maintained in the face of new threats and there are appropriate protections in place.” He noted the changes would require legislation, and examination by the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. “It is important we get any proposed new laws right to ensure the most effective protections are provided for our community,” he said. The Greens expressed outright opposition. Greens justice spokesperson Nick McKim said the measures were “an unjustified trampling of people’s basic liberties, including the freedom from arbitrary imprisonment and the right to privacy”. “Detaining people for two weeks without charge is offensive to Australian values and the rule of law,” McKim said. “Creating a massive database of people’s photographs is a privacy invasion that creates a honeypot for hackers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-gunman-stephen-paddock-survive-police","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T07:39:33Z","webTitle":"Las Vegas sheriff: gunman planned to survive and may have had help","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-gunman-stephen-paddock-survive-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/las-vegas-gunman-stephen-paddock-survive-police","fields":{"headline":"Las Vegas sheriff: gunman planned to survive and may have had help","bodyText":"Las Vegas police said there was evidence gunman Stephen Paddock intended to survive and escape his deadly attack at a country music festival on Sunday, and revealed that he also rented an apartment overlooking another music festival that took place in the city the previous weekend. The disclosures were among several new details revealed by Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, who also strayed into speculation that the man believed responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history had help. “Do you think this was all accomplished on his own?” Lombardo asked, noting the arsenal of weapons the shooter amassed, and the discovery of explosives in his car. He added: “You’ve got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point.” He said that the suspected killer, a 64-year-old retiree and gambler, rented a luxury room through Airbnb overlooking the Life is Beautiful music festival, another Las Vegas festival which occurred the week before the Route 91 Harvest music festival he eventually targeted. Lombardo also said he had seen evidence that Paddock may have intended to survive his killing spree from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, which he used as a base for the attack. The sheriff did not say what the evidence was. The remarks were made at press conference that raised as many questions as it answered and suggested that, 72 hours after the attack, after extensively interviewing Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, and examining his computers, investigators remain genuinely baffled about his motives. Paddock’s killing spree resulted in 58 victims and injured at least 489 people. The updated casualty numbers were the most recent given by authorities on Wednesday night. Lombardo had previously said law enforcement believed Paddock had perpetrated “a solo act”. But on Wednesday, he appeared to change his position. His speculation about the possibility Paddock was aided came after an exchange in which he conceded investigators had not been able to identify any “person of interest” other than Danley. He said investigators were, however, pressing to find others who may have been involved. It was possible that Paddock was “a super guy” who was “working out all of this on his own”, Lombardo said. But he added: “It would be hard for me to believe that.” The comment appeared to earn a veiled rebuke from the agent overseeing the FBI’s investigation. “Theories are great and everyone can have a theory,” said Aaron Rouse, who runs the bureau’s Las Vegas division, and took to the lectern immediately after the sheriff’s comments. “But I need to deal with facts. The sheriff needs to deal with facts.” He added: “He’s not going to make assumptions. I’m not going to make assumptions.” Rouse said the FBI was working with “a number of theories”, but was not prepared to publicize them. Rouse was considerably more cautious in his remarks than the sheriff, refusing to reveal what Danley said after she returned to the US on Wednesday from the Philippines to be questioned by agents. The FBI agent declined even to say whether Danley remains “a person of interest”. Danley, 62, released a statement after being interviewed by FBI agents, saying she had no idea of the massacre her partner was plotting when he sent her abroad to be with her family. “It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone,” she said in a statement read out by her lawyer. “He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen.” Lombardo, in another surprising remark, appeared to cast doubt over those comments when he said at the press conference: “Any person put in her situation would probably answer in the same way.” In addition to the sheriff’s speculation, there were also a handful of previously undisclosed facts revealed at the press conference, including new details about events in the days and hours leading up to the shooting. Lombardo said that Paddock had reserved a room via Airbnb at the Ogden luxury apartment complex, which overlooked the site of the Life is Beautiful festival, an event over the previous weekend that featured acts such as Gorillaz and Lorde. The sheriff did not say when the room was booked, and said he did not know “what was in his mind”. “Was he doing pre-surveillance?” he said. “We don’t know yet.” Lombardo also revealed the crucial role played by a security guard, who helped locate Paddock, on the 32nd floor, just over 10 minutes after he began shooting at concertgoers. Paddock, who had set up multiple cameras outside his room to monitor the corridor, shot as many as 200 rounds through the door, injuring the guard. Swat teams did not penetrate the hotel suite Paddock was using for another hour, but Lombardo stressed that there were no unintended delays. “It was purposeful,” he said, explaining that police decided to take their time to clear surrounding rooms of guests when they realized Paddock had stopped firing. Upon entering the room, they discovered Paddock had killed himself. Lombardo also said they discovered several containers of explosives and 1,600 rounds of additional ammunition in his car. Lombardo described Paddock, who he revealed was gambling at the casino hours before the attack, as a “disturbed and dangerous” man who had apparently led a “secret life” that left few clues about his actions. He confirmed that investigators were exploring whether there was some incident in October 2016 that would explain why, in the year that followed, he purchased some 33 new weapons. But he gave the impression that Las Vegas and the FBI have been left flummoxed by the case, saying Paddock did not appear to conform to the profile of other mass murderers. “We haven’t understood it yet,” he said. “You have to be patient with us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/07/australian-police-sting-brings-down-paedophile-forum-on-dark-web","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T08:16:49Z","webTitle":"Australian police sting brings down paedophile forum on dark web","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/07/australian-police-sting-brings-down-paedophile-forum-on-dark-web","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/07/australian-police-sting-brings-down-paedophile-forum-on-dark-web","fields":{"headline":"Australian police sting brings down paedophile forum on dark web","bodyText":"Australian police secretly operated one of the dark web’s largest child abuse sites for almost a year, posing as its founder in an undercover operation that has triggered arrests and rescues across the globe. The sting has brought down a vast child exploitation forum, Childs Play, which acted as an underground meeting place for thousands of paedophiles. The police involvement was uncovered by journalists with the Norwegian newspaper, VG, who spent months tracing Childs Play’s origins and monitoring public posts. The paper’s investigation, shared with the Guardian, led them to the offices of Queensland police’s Taskforce Argos, a specialist child abuse unit, in January. Unwittingly, they had stumbled on to a sensitive police operation. The Argos squad had quietly taken over Childs Play three months earlier, assuming the identity of its founder following his arrest for the rape of a four-year-old girl in the US. To maintain their cover, undercover detectives were posting and sharing abuse material on Childs Play. Other users continued to post and view images while the site was under police control. It was at least the second operation of its type conducted from the unit’s Brisbane headquarters. Last year, the Guardian revealed Argos used a similar takeover to bring down Richard Huckle, dubbed Britain’s worst paedophile, and Shannon McCoole, an Australian state care worker whose arrest triggered a royal commission. Childs Play’s scale made it significant on the dark web. The site was created in April 2016, and had attracted more than 1m user registrations by the time police took it offline last month. Between 3,000 and 4,000 of those users were active, the Guardian understands. About 100 “producers” filmed the rape of children and shared videos and imagery with the Childs Play “community”. The Argos operation has now led to investigations by a dozen foreign countries into the site’s users. The Argos commander, Insp Jon Rouse, said it had led to “significant rescues of children globally” and the arrest of “serious criminal child sex offenders”. He said Tor, a program that masked users’ identities, attracted child sex offenders to sites such as Childs Play. “The perceived anonymity and ‘safe haven’ that this environment allegedly provides facilitates the exchange of child exploitation material, it provides a platform for them to share their horrendous ideologies and it also is a vehicle for them to share methodologies to try to defeat law enforcement agencies,” Rouse told the Guardian. “Our team, and units like ours across the world are singularly focused on stopping the sexual abuse of children and we will continue to work together to infiltrate, disrupt and dismantle child sex offender networks like this one,” he said. The leader of the site, Canadian Benjamin Faulkner, is serving life behind bars for the sexual assault of the four-year-old in Virginia last year, which he committed alongside American Patrick Falte. Taskforce Argos, working with European police and US Homeland Security, had been tracking the two men before the rape in Virginia. They got an alert that Faulkner had crossed the border, and knew he was likely to meet Falte. The police soon pounced, arresting both at a home in Virginia. Following the arrest, they moved the website to an Australian server, and the Argos unit assumed the identity of Faulkner. They began posting to the community, quickly apologising for the unexplained absence. “Phew, what a month that was!. A month of my life that I won’t get back. Although technically most of the really screwed up shit happened in October, not September, hence my late foray into this month,” the team posted. “Sorry again about the late arrival but I did ask the Staff team to step in and cover for me in my enforced absences.” The forum’s community expected a monthly post from Faulkner. If it did not come, members would know the site was compromised. Each of the posts was to end with an image of child exploitation, a measure thought to create a legal hurdle for undercover police. But no such hurdle exists in Australia, where legal protections allow police to post abuse material. It puts them in an uncomfortable position. To prevent harm to children, detectives must share images of child exploitation. The child protection advocacy group Bravehearts says the tactic poses difficult questions for police. But its executive chair and founder, Hetty Johnston, is supportive of the Argos methodology, and says the team’s groundbreaking work is saving children from harm. “I think it’s a tough question for everyone involved, and I know it’s a tough question for police,” Johnston said. “But I support this 100% because the images that police would use would not be images that they create, they would be existing images. And the idea is to get to people who are currently sexually offending against children,” she said. “This is a war, and we have to engage in the war. We have to engage in it.” Johnston describes Argos’s work as groundbreaking and Rouse as “an absolute genius”. “He should be Australian of the year, what he has to do, what he has to view, would send most of us absolutely stark raving mad,” she said. The powers to share abuse material are not unique to Australia. But they are not available to many English-speaking law enforcement agencies. The Argos squad is highly experienced and well resourced. That makes Australia a sound base from which to launch global child abuse investigations. Falte and Faulkner first met online, but became better acquainted in 2015, through another child exploitation site. The next year, Faulkner created Childs Play. “With the security scares brought about recently [...] and the lack of good forums, I decided to bring Childs Play to the community,” Faulkner wrote, according to VG. “The goal of Childs Play is to provide a simple free access forum to the community, while simultaneously allowing a safe and secure place to talk and just be ourselves.” The Norwegian newspaper began monitoring the site in 2016. The paper’s IT expert, Einar Otto Stangvik, created a program that allowed him to download, index and analyse all the public messages on the forum. In January, he found a weakness in the system that led him and journalist Håkon Fostervold Høydal to identify the website’s owner as Taskforce Argos. Høydal met Argos investigator Paul Griffiths and Rouse in Brisbane. The paper then waited until Childs Play was offline before publishing their investigation on Saturday. “After the meeting with Griffiths and Rouse, we understood that the journalists had discovered an ongoing police operation,” VG editor-in-chief Gard Steiro said. “Although it was stunning news and obviously of public interest, we decided to hold off publishing what we knew. The situation was unclear. We needed more information before deciding what could be published. In a worst-case scenario, VG could have damaged the investigation and endangered innocent people.” This article was produced with the assistance of VG and based upon investigations it conducted. VG has launched a documentary on Childs Play, detailing their investigation and the involvement of taskforce Argos."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/05/daredevils-illegal-waterslide-videos-spark-threat-to-close-dam","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T02:14:38Z","webTitle":"Daredevils' 'illegal waterslide' videos spark threat to close dam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/daredevils-illegal-waterslide-videos-spark-threat-to-close-dam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/daredevils-illegal-waterslide-videos-spark-threat-to-close-dam","fields":{"headline":"Daredevils' 'illegal waterslide' videos spark threat to close dam","bodyText":"Authorities have threatened to close a dam in northern New South Wales after footage emerged of young people using bodyboards to surf down a dangerous 110-metre concrete chute. Video of the “illegal waterslide” created by the dam’s spillway, originally filmed in May 2016, was shared on Facebook last week, prompting Tweed shire council to warn locals off the practice. The council’s manager of water, Anthony Burnham, told the ABC it put thrillseekers at a significant risk of drowning. “[The spillway has] got a large flip bucket at the end and, with any significant flow, you can be held underwater in that flip bucket. You can be rendered unconscious and drown.” Other videos posted to YouTube showed footage of similar stunts from as early as 2011. In 2013 a video sparked calls from local police to end the practice, while a video from 2011 showed two men sliding down the spillway in an inflatable raft. The latest video amassed 10,000 views after being posted to YouTube in May last year. On 25 September, an edited version was shared on the Facebook page Culturetrip, attracting 40,000 likes and reactions, and 3m video starts. “Daredevils are using this dam as an illegal waterslide,” it said. “Make sure you seek permission first.” Burnham said the council had attempted to use CCTV to deter the practice in the past and was now considering a public closure of the Clarrie Hall dam. The spillway chute is lined with six-metre to eight-metre high walls and narrows to only 12 metres across for much of its length. The dam has a storage capacity of 15,000ML and a catchment area of 60 sq km. The dam, but not the spillway, has traditionally been open to the public year-round during business hours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/06/a-league-off-season-recruitment-augers-well-for-new-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"A-League: off-season recruitment augurs well for new season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/06/a-league-off-season-recruitment-augers-well-for-new-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/06/a-league-off-season-recruitment-augers-well-for-new-season","fields":{"headline":"A-League: off-season recruitment augurs well for new season","bodyText":"If the turmoil wasn’t so familiar it would be tempting to regard the 13th instalment of the A-League as cursed. On the eve of the new season clubs are at war with the governing body (again), the Socceroos are shredding nerves in a World Cup playoff (again), and the once clearish air of midsummer will be tested like never before with an Ashes series, an ascendant Big Bash League and the nascent AFLW competing for attention. Fortunately, the on-field product promises to be robust following one of the smartest off-seasons of player recruitment yet. The season kicks off tonight with Melbourne City hosting Brisbane Roar at AAMI Park. City will be without Tim Cahill, who 12-months ago was almost single-handedly responsible for any hype around the competition. This time around he will be recovering from the first leg of Australia’s AFC playoff against Syria in Melaka and preparing for the vital second leg in Sydney on Tuesday. The tenor of the season rests on the next 270 minutes of international action. If Australia qualify we’re in for a burst of footballing euphoria followed by an extended build up to Russia 2018. Each game will be burnished by discussion of strong performances pushing A-League hopefuls into World Cup reckoning. There will be increased mainstream interest with quadrennial football fans peering over the fence to familiarise themselves with Daniel De Silva, Dimitri Petratos, or whichever bolter forces himself into Ange Postecoglou’s plans. Failure hardly bears thinking about. The game’s predilection for eating itself will surely come to the fore once again, with the A-League in the crosshairs of critics. On a practical level it may also mean one of the leading clubs is forced into a mid-season managerial reshuffle with the likes of Graham Arnold, Kevin Muscat and John Aloisi all tipped as possible Postecoglou successors. We will know - one way or the other - how the Socceroos have fared by the start of round seven, just in time for the 30 November deadline that’s been set by Fifa for FFA to get its house in order. As things stand on the day round one of the 2017-18 season begins, a FIFA normalisation committee taking over control of the governing body seems almost inevitable. Last Friday was Steven Lowy’s cutoff for consensus to be reached on the makeup of an expanded congress. This date needed to be hit to allow enough time for all the legalese to be completed in line with Fifa’s schedule but the deadline passed without resolution. The A-League clubs remain steadfast, writing to the state federations this week to indicate they will apply for a court injunction to prevent an Extraordinary General Meeting of FFA’s congress from happening, should any attempt be made to hold one. If a normalisation committee is appointed it’s impossible to predict what might follow. In the short-term the political upheaval will obviously present the game in a poor light but the rest is in the lap of the Gods. The A-League has not known life without a Lowy at the helm. If A-League clubs are to be believed the other side of this tumultuous process should be positive for the competition. More money should flow to the league (at what detriment, if any, to the rest of the pyramid remains to be seen) which should in turn generate more investment and a virtuous cycle of improvement to the overall product. Conversations around expansion, a second division and promotion and relegation will reignite, presumably with a much greater expectation of change than under the incumbent administration. That all could be pie in the sky of course, with a deal potentially struck any day to continue the status quo. Should that happen without the support of the A-League owners or the PFA, who knows what anarchy might reign? The arrival of the Ashes juggernaut towards the end of November at least means football’s internecine warfare is unlikely to be anywhere near the back pages. Once the Big Bash League begins its six-week residency on 19 December, the A-League will be even further down the list of mainstream priorities, which could end up a tad embarrassing for football with Network Ten offering blanket coverage to T20 on its main free-to-air channel while it pipes in Fox Sports’ content to its off-Broadway stablemate One. The departure from SBS to Network Ten has never been a deal with much lustre. Viewing figures will be scrutinised throughout the season with plenty of fingers crossed that the exposure of a commercial network moves the dial. The partnership is emblematic of the A-League’s continued inability to commandeer eyeballs. The start of the season is now timed for the week after the AFL and NRL grand finals, which is a smart call, but it also makes preseason hype near impossible with any marketing or PR drowned out by the saturation coverage of the other sports. Consequently everything is squeezed into one frenzied week of activity, which this year coincides with the biggest Socceroos game in three years. “We’ll be optimising our spend throughout the year on this campaign rather than spending an unbalanced amount of our resources on some big, flashy thing at the start of the year,” said Greg O’Rourke, head of the A-League, at the official season launch. “That would look good for a couple of days but we want to build a sustained campaign that starts to bring people to the game. We want to bring people to watch games, and use our resources to do that for 27 rounds.” Let’s hope it works. In more encouraging marketing news, FFA deserve credit for a savvy brand refresh, as well as a much needed update of its digital presence. The toilet seat has also had a spit and polish. On the topic of actual football, the signs are overwhelmingly positive. The talent drain away from the top teams has been comparatively minor, last year’s bottom clubs appear to have improved greatly, and the squad building overall - especially the recruitment from overseas - seems to be at an all-time high. There’s no guarantee that will all translate into a competitive season, especially with 50% of last year’s managers moving on, but there are grounds for expecting an unpredictable campaign with what should be the highest floor the league has ever seen. Here’s to hoping it can find room to flourish among all the distractions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/05/slovenia-jan-oblak-england","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T09:00:19Z","webTitle":"Slovenia’s Jan Oblak is ready and willing to be a fly in England’s ointment | Ed Aarons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/05/slovenia-jan-oblak-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/05/slovenia-jan-oblak-england","fields":{"headline":"Slovenia’s Jan Oblak is ready and willing to be a fly in England’s ointment","bodyText":"Jan Oblak never really had much choice about which position he would play. “My father, Matjaz, was as an amateur for a team in the Slovenian third division and he was also a goalkeeper,” the Atlético Madrid and Slovenia No1 told the Spanish newspaper El País last year. “I would put myself behind his goal and if he went right, I would go right; if I went to the left, I went left ... I did not like it when they scored goals, but that made me realise since I was small that the goal is part of the keeper’s life.” It was a chance encounter at half-time during one of his father’s matches that changed the life of the man who stands between England and a place at the 2018 World Cup. Born in Skofja Loka, a small town half an hour’s drive from the capital, Ljubljana, he joined his local club, Locan, at the age of six and showed great promise under the watchful eye of his father, who had once been on the books of the top-flight side Medvode as third-choice goalkeeper. Four years later, a scout for Olimpija – the original version of one of Slovenia’s most successful clubs – happened to be in the crowd for one of Matjaz’s matches when Oblak junior took to the field during the break and fended off shots from his older sister Teja, who is now a basketball international. The scout persuaded Jan’s father to bring him to Olimpija’s next training session. Within 12 months the club had ceased to exist due to financial problems – eventually reforming as Olimpija Ljubljana in 2005 – but the upheaval had little effect on their rising star, who would cycle the 30-mile round trip after school for training every day. “Sometimes my mother accompanied me on the bike, but when it was raining or cold I would take a train or a bus,” he recalled. “I had to leave a few hours earlier and then arrive back at my house late at night.” A series of spectacular performances for Olimpija Ljubljana’s youth teams attracted the attention of several European sides, with Liverpool inviting him for a trial. But an untimely injury scuppered his hopes of being offered a move to Merseyside, while contract offers from Fulham and the Italian side Empoli were rejected on his father’s advice. He made his first-team debut for Olimpija at the age of 16, but when Benfica came calling in June 2010 after his starring role in Olimpija’s fourth-placed finish in the league, Matjaz finally relented. “Everything went pretty fast,” Oblak said. “At 16 I was already playing in the first division of my country, that’s why so much was being said about me. It was not normal, but at age 16 I felt I was four or five years older. I’ve always felt older than I am.” Since then Oblak has gone on to become the most expensive goalkeeper in the history of La Liga – by moving to Atlético for €16m. He has also appeared in a Champions League final and was linked with a €100m move to join Paris Saint-Germain last summer. He will not celebrate his 25th birthday until January, but the manager, Diego Simeone, already rates him as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. A shoulder injury sustained in a league victory over Villarreal in December had threatened to curtail his season. But a visit to the London-based surgeon Andrew Williams, who has operated on Arsenal’s Petr Cech, saw him return to the fray by the end of February, even though it had been estimated he would be out for four months. Oblak’s spectacular triple stop in the Champions League last-16 victory over Bayer Leverkusen was followed by a penalty save to deny Bayern Munich’s Thomas Müller in the semi-final – a tie Atlético eventually won on away goals. That penalty save cemented his reputation as one of Europe’s best young goalkeepers, even if he could not prevent his side from a second final defeat in three years to Real Madrid. While the Football Leaks website has claimed that his representative, Miha Mlakar – who has connections to the super-agent Jorge Mendes – is due 12.5% of any future transfer fee, Atlético have yet to secure one of their prized assets on a new contract and it seems almost inevitable that he will move on sooner rather than later, with Real and PSG expected to lead the chase. In the meantime, Oblak has emerged as the star in a Slovenia side who have been on the decline since reaching the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, where they were eliminated from England’s group after Landon Donovan’s injury-time winner for the USA against Algeria. Only 6,000 supporters attended the 4-0 qualifying victory over Lithuania last month, with Srecko Katanec’s side now likely to need at least four points from their final two matches to stand a chance of reaching the finals in Russia. As the successor to the Internazionale keeper Samir Handanovic, who retired from international football in 2015 after being deposed as captain by Katanec, Oblak has big boots to fill. But England should be warned that he can handle the pressure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/04/harry-kane-england-marginal-gains","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T21:45:03Z","webTitle":"Harry Kane turns to kitchen rather than training ground for England recipe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/04/harry-kane-england-marginal-gains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/04/harry-kane-england-marginal-gains","fields":{"headline":"Harry Kane turns to kitchen rather than training ground for England recipe","bodyText":"Harry Kane was striving for marginal gains. Those little tweaks to his daily preparations that would assist recovery time amid a cluttered fixture schedule, and always with the fatigue he had endured back in the summer of 2016, after a year where football had hauled him from postseason tours of Australia to the European Championship in France via the shlep of Premier League and Europa League campaigns, still foremost in his mind. If he was to retain his edge, particularly with a daughter on the way, then something had to change. Yet even Kane, a model professional who will captain his country against Slovenia on Thursday, probably never appreciated those improvements would be made not on the training pitch but in the kitchen. “It clicked in my head a football career goes so quickly, so you have to make every day count,” said the striker. “But you can’t train as hard as you’d like when you have so many games to play, so you have to make the little gains elsewhere. So, over the last year or so, I’ve made them on the nutrition side. I was recommended a chef and, when I spoke to him, it blew me away a bit. When he explained what the body does and how he could help me recover … it opened my eyes. I’d always eaten well, never badly, but he explained what you could do. It’s not always about just eating the right food, but eating it at the right times. “You can eat healthily all week and then stock up on carbs before a game, but your body might not be used to that and could actually go into a kind of shock. So it’s about making plans around training, maybe stocking up on carbs sometimes, and going lower at other times. I started doing that on 1 January, a new year’s resolution. We had a baby on the way, we knew she would take up a lot of our time, but I was cooking, my missus was cooking, and the food was getting boring …” That prompted a yelp from Kane’s national manager, Gareth Southgate, at his side. “Sorry, not my girlfriend’s cooking, just mine,” offered the Tottenham Hotspur player in haste. “No, the chef is with us Monday to Saturday, and leaves the meals in the fridge for Sunday, so I can follow the programme. “I want to maximise my potential and it seems to be working. When you’re playing Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday there’s not a lot of time to train, so it’s about making those little gains in other ways: ice baths, stretching, nutrition … little things that keep as you as fresh as you can be. He helped me in the recovery from the injury earlier this year, with certain foods I was eating.” Kane endured two spells out with ankle ligament injuries last season but on the second occasion, in March when he was following the nutritionist’s food plan, the initial diagnosis of an eight-week lay-off proved overly pessimistic. The striker was back in four. “He’s absolutely the kind of role model you want,” said Southgate of his striker. “Clearly our sport has changed massively over the last few years in terms of preparation. But you’re talking about a player trying to maximise his ability and finding every edge he can. The marginal gains make a massive difference at this high level. Far more of a difference than at a lower standard of football. You want a mindset in a player where he wants to become one of the best in the world because, for me, that’s a mindset that will inspire others. The more people like that in my squad … well, it starts to become a self-fulfilling prophecy with everyone always striving for more. They’re not at the level they want to be at yet, so everyone’s hungry for more.” The England setup are attempting similar tweaks to enliven the customary routine to eke more from those at their disposal. Southgate invited Alan Shearer to St George’s Park this week to speak to his squad, “telling stories about England and his whole career, what he’d come through, the ups and downs, even penalties,” said Kane. There was even a discussion on how Shearer was poacher turned gamekeeper given his current role as a pundit. “We wanted to understand what that takes, how the mindset changes,” said Kane, who has not ruled out the possibility of playing abroad in the future. “As a player I’m sure he was probably like most players when he was criticised: not too happy. And now he’s the one criticising. But, really, all that matters is what goes on in your head, and staying focused on your own job. If someone criticises you, you prove them wrong.” His recent record has choked any criticism at source. Kane scored 13 goals in eight games in September alone, and has five from his last four caps under Southgate. He has scored timely goals, that equaliser at Hampden Park in June the most noteworthy, and merits wearing the armband given the inspiration he currently provides. “But I don’t see any of it as pressure,” he added. “When people talk about me it means I’m doing well. When they’re not, I need to start worrying. “But I don’t focus too much on it. Of course, when you’re scoring goals opposing teams are going to have a certain game-plan against you, but that’s a good appreciation to have. It shows you’re doing well. I appreciate good players, but Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are doing it every week consistently. That’s what I aspire to do.” There was an admission to one guilty pleasure – “apple crumble” – but everything else had Southgate purring at his side. The marginal gains will benefit Kane, club and country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2017/dec/03/rob-roy-walking-trail-scotland-trossachs-pitlochry","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-03T11:00:39Z","webTitle":"Great Scott: walking Scotland’s Rob Roy Way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/03/rob-roy-walking-trail-scotland-trossachs-pitlochry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/dec/03/rob-roy-walking-trail-scotland-trossachs-pitlochry","fields":{"headline":"Great Scott: walking Scotland’s Rob Roy Way","bodyText":"Hero, thief, extortioner, loyal Jacobite, traitor or Scotland’s very own Robin Hood. Any of these epithets can be used to describe Rob Roy MacGregor, and will at least be partly true. The outlaw, whose fame was sealed 200 years ago this New Year’s Eve with the publication of Sir Walter Scott’s fictionalised account of episodes from his life, is one of history’s true enigmas. Nowadays, he also boasts his own long-distance footpath. The Rob Roy Way is a 77-mile hike (94 miles if you add an optional loop) from Drymen – on the edge of the Trossachs, 17 miles north of Glasgow – to Pitlochry, gateway to the Cairngorms. On the way, it takes in other places MacGregor is said to have been in his somewhat chaotic career: Aberfoyle, Callander, Strathyre, Killin and Aberfeldy, plus Lochs Venachar, Lubnaig and Tay. Armed with an 1863 edition of Rob Roy and the excellent guidebook to the footpath written by its co-creator Jacquetta Megarry, a friend and I tackled the path at a pace that Rob Roy might have found sloth-like. We ambled between 9 and 15 miles a day (he moved quicker than that even when driving stolen cattle) and stayed in comfy B&amp;Bs each night. At one, the owner told us that he’d just had a couple of peeved Americans staying. “We’ve paid thousands of dollars to come here to do this walk,” they had grumbled, “and there are parts of it that are boggy.” Apparently they had expected the whole trail to be on a wide gravel walkway. Come day four we, by contrast, had begun to wish there was rather less minor road, forestry track, disused railway line and metalled cycle path and rather more in the way of little footpaths, whatever their state. The route had necessarily kept us low, winding through bonny glens and straths, by rivers or lochs, as it mimicked the journeys Rob Roy would have taken as he drove his rustled wares. We spent our time either looking up – at the Menteith Hills, or the stately peaks of Ben Ledi and Ben Lawers – or looking down at myriad cascades along the way. It must be said that, 283 years after his passing (against all odds MacGregor died in his bed, peacefully), traces of the infamous villain/hero are few and far between. Our journey had begun propitiously enough at Drymen’s Clachan Inn, a pub that gained its licence in the very year of MacGregor’s death, but the Rob Roy Experience in Callander has been closed since 2006; and, unaccountably, the way passes within two miles of Rob Roy’s grave at Balquhidder – with its fantastically defiant epitaph, “MACGREGOR DESPITE THEM” – but doesn’t deign to visit it. At least the descendants of the cattle he was so adept at purloining still grazed the hillsides, dotting them black, brown, ginger and cream. The skies above them were awash with late-staying swallows, dining on what few early-autumn midges remained. Buzzards wheeled on high, while in one narrow glen a kestrel had an almighty altercation with a crow. At Loch Tay, we were entertained by red squirrels; and we stopped and gazed spellbound at brown-and-white dippers as they dived into a river to fish, tumbled and turned in the swift currents, then emerged unruffled to fly back upstream and feed again. We fed rather well ourselves, and with rather less effort. It’s fair to say that rural Scotland is not yet renowned as a gourmet destination, but our evening meals were consistently delicious. Michael Clayton, the chef at Aberfoyle’s Forth Inn, worked particular wonders with vegetables and, so my companion informed me, venison too. Most of our lodgings, meanwhile, had evidently been built for well-to-do Victorians who enjoyed comfort and space – the landing at Aberfeldy’s gorgeous Balnearn House was so large it was worthy of a map. It was during the final two days, when the Rob Roy Way finally leaves the glens – and civilisation – behind for extended stretches, that the walk really took off. We breathed in the silence and rejoiced to be in the hills, rather than merely spectators of them. We delighted in the fairytale Falls of Moness and their sylvan cloak, the Birks of Aberfeldy, a beguiling birch wood immortalised by Robert Burns. But we came closest to the spirit of Rob Roy on a road skirting Loch Tay. “How far is it to Killin?” an elderly overalled man pushing an empty wheelbarrow asked us. “It’s about 15 miles,” I estimated, then, unable to stop myself, enquired as to why he was pushing an empty wheelbarrow there. “Oh, in case I need to pick up anything along the way,” he replied, walking purposefully away. Now there’s enigmatic for you. • The trip was provided by Wilderness Scotland, whose Self-Guided Rob Roy Way costs from £720pp, including eight nights’ B&amp;B, luggage transfers and route notes.

These touchstones of my life may seem sporadic – the cooking pot I went off to university with, the first towel I bought (rather than stole from my mother), the rucksack I wore during my pregnancy, the changing table that will, I hope, one day serve as my child’s desk – but they all unite under a single Swedish philosophy: “To create a better everyday life for the many people.” I didn’t know about this philosophy until I stood, bathed in the gentle air of meatballs, in the foyer of the Ikea Museum in Älmhult, Småland and read it off a giant white wall beside a portrait of the Ikea founder, Ingvar Kamprad. The museum, which opened in 2016 on the site of Ikea’s first ever store, tells the story not only of Swedish life via its common household objects (not to mention the more arresting ones such as “bog ore” and “sausage horn”), but gives a glimpse into the life of Kamprad, his staff, those early furniture experiments (denim divan, anyone?) and the unlikely rise to global proportions of this small, backwood business. If you haven’t heard of Älmhult, this may be because it is, essentially, a small Swedish town in the middle of the woods, so far south it’s actually closer to Copenhagen than Stockholm, with fewer than 20,000 residents. Imagine a village in the Home Counties, but with more cinnamon buns and where everyone is dressed in H&amp;M. However, it was here, in 1943, that the young entrepreneur, Kamprad, founded his business, moving on from selling cheap matches to neighbours to using the local milkman to distribute small household items across Sweden at a discounted rate. In 1953 there followed his first furniture showroom, in 1956 his first flat-pack furniture and in 1958 his first Ikea store. It would take until 1987 for Ikea to reach the UK, opening its blue and yellow doors for the first time in Warrington. Why Warrington? Why not? If you have a business based on the founding principles of form, function, quality, sustainability and low price, setting up in a northern manufacturing town with plenty of room and a good rate of home ownership doesn’t seem a crazy idea. Thirty years later, it is hard to imagine any student bedroom, any couple’s first flat, home office or granny annexe untouched by the sharp lines of a Billy bookcase, Poäng chair, Klippan sofa, Lack table or Ribba picture frame. You might not love them, you might not even remember them, but you own them nonetheless. Just as the font in a good book is the very one you don’t notice, so the ubiquity of Ikea in our homes has rendered the Kallax unit, the Fargrik mug and Fado lamp near-invisible. During my trip to Älmhult, and after filling up on a cheese and crispbread brunch at Icom – the Ikea communications department – one of Ikea’s longest-serving staff members (a Danish woman in an immaculate white shirt) let me into the company’s little inside joke about those “funny” Scandinavian names. It goes that while the sofas are given Swedish place names and the beds are named after towns in Norway, the Danish place names are reserved especially for toilet brushes. These days, Ikea can sometimes feel like an emblem of the northern European, socially democratic future we could have won: a principal partner of the Living Wage Foundation with a strict 50/50 gender split target for management teams across the globe. Ikea also serves under founder Kamprad’s philosophy that waste is a “mortal sin”. As we sat in a small, white room surrounded by LED lights and flooring made from recycled wood, Nanette Weisdal, the company’s sustainability leader, explained to me that their code of conduct strives to achieve ever higher rates of recycling, reuse and repair, and to source sustainable materials, labour and products across the world. Afterwards I strolled across the carpark from the Ikea Museum canteen to the Ikea hotel under a light Swedish drizzle and wondered what comes next for the company and for me, a customer. Today, as the company prepares to open its first store in India, I scroll through baby bouncers and nursing chairs. As they deploy more than 16,000 flat-pack refugee shelters to crisis locations from Nepal to Baghdad to Dijbouti, I wonder what sort of world my child, rolling about in his Charmtroll sleeping bag, will inherit. And as we prepare to be cut adrift from the safety, protection and culture of the EU, will we look north to our Scandinavian cousins, or turn inward in a fit of nationalism? Either way, one thing is for sure: home will never be the same again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/03/may-johnson-mogg-tories-conservatives-panic","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T11:19:51Z","webTitle":"If Johnson and Rees-Mogg are the symptoms, the Tories must be very sick | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/03/may-johnson-mogg-tories-conservatives-panic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/03/may-johnson-mogg-tories-conservatives-panic","fields":{"headline":"If Johnson and Rees-Mogg are symptoms, the Tories must really be ill","bodyText":"The world’s most successful electoral machine is in the midst of a “nervous breakdown”, as the leader of the Scottish Tories, Ruth Davidson, puts it. But the crisis of the Conservative party is not being caused by an embarrassingly weak leadership – although Theresa May’s zombie premiership is hardly helping matters. The “political consensus” has collapsed in Britain, as May herself put it on Sunday, and the very model of society promoted and fashioned by Toryism is rapidly losing public consent. The internal squabbling, the political manoeuvring, the backbiting: these are just the morbid symptoms of a broader existential crisis within the movement. It is worth considering the beauty parade of political ghouls sitting at the bedside of May’s political career, feigning concern and pretending to will her on, but secretly waiting for life support to be switched off. Take Amber Rudd, a former director of companies located in tax havens. The problem with Rudd is that when she’s on TV, all I can see is a juicy steak fashioned into the number 346: that’s the number of votes she has left after her majority collapsed this year, from 4,796 in 2015. Her desperation has driven her to hire Lynton Crosby, after his dazzling success in this year’s general election. I look forward to joining hundreds of activists campaigning in Hastings and Rye as part of Momentum’s Unseat campaign. Then there’s Boris Johnson, a bumbling vulture who is already feasting on the carcass of May’s leadership before it has even properly expired. There are two types of Tories: one who realises that Johnson will repel the younger voters that the party needs in order to win an election; and another who is completely and utterly deluded. Not as deluded as those who have come down with a serious case of Moggmania, of course. What are these people thinking? Do they really think those repelled by May’s Tories in favour of Corbyn’s Labour party are going to see an 18th-century eccentric proffering a combination of hardcore economic Thatcherism and uncompromising social conservatism and say, “Yes please, sign me up”? But it was Philip Hammond’s speech yesterday that gave away the true extent of the Tory malaise. He echoed May’s view that Corbyn had broken the political consensus. Most of his speech was a red-baiting rant warning of an impending Marxist seizure of power. What it revealed is that the Tories are out of ideas and out of vision, and worry they will be out of power sooner rather than later. They can see that the consensus has collapsed, but they don’t have the faintest idea of what to do about it other than ramp up the fear and loathing towards the opposition. But it is not all over for the Tories. Labour should be full of enthusiastic momentum, but not complacency. The Tories’ polling has solidified around the 40 point mark since the election. Their electoral coalition is substantially older, sure, than Labour’s, but much of it represents a solid anti-socialist bloc, united by fear of what will happen when Britain’s current social order falls. Nonetheless, there is a growing sense that the country is on the verge of a peaceful, democratic revolution, one that will replace the old society and not simply tinker with it. There is a very real prospect, at least, that this can happen. And that explains the panic enveloping the Conservative party. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/shortcuts/2017/oct/03/amber-rudd-lynton-crosby-pm-leadership-bid","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T11:33:26Z","webTitle":"Send for Lynton!

A judge has said she prima facie is, but Amber seems to be fearlessly setting her mind towards the future. Why do I feel my heart filling with dread? She has hired high-profile pollster Lynton Crosby’s firm CTF Partners to run her next election campaign. Heart not getting any emptier of dread.

That their work is entirely limited to her constituency and that any leadership speculation is “far-fetched and wrong”. So, sounds like a dead cert then? One cannot help but feel.

It’s all coming back to me now! They somehow managed to suggest that she was not entirely devoted to the people of the East Sussex coast.

Welcome to the promised land","bodyText":"Chris Fenwick recalls vividly the day he first met the two Abrahams. It was July 2015 and he was sitting outside the Lobster Smack, a crooked clapboard relic from the days when Canvey Island was a marshy backwater populated by grazing sheep and the occasional smuggler. Tucked behind the sea wall on the island’s south coast, it used to be called the World’s End, a remote inn frequented by sailors, which became notorious for its bouts of bare-knuckle fighting. “I turned round and standing on the steps of the sea wall looking a bit bemused were these two Haredi Jews,” says Chris. “It was a hot day and there they were in the full clobber, looking out at the estuary with the ships coming by. So I walked up to them and said: ‘Shalom, gentlemen, what brings you to Canvey?’” The men told Chris that they were from Stamford Hill and they were looking to relocate. Chris filled them in on “the good, the bad and the ugly” of life on Canvey. Phone numbers were swapped and the foundations of an unlikely friendship were laid. Born in 1953, the year of the Great Flood, Chris Fenwick is Mr Canvey. Sailor, hotelier, restaurateur, raconteur and self-confessed “bullshitting showman”, he’s been the manager of Dr Feelgood – the pub-rock band which became Canvey’s most famous export in the 1970s – for 46 years and counting. If anyone could smooth the Haredi community’s passage on to the island, he could. “Of course, they’d never heard of Dr Feelgood,” says Chris. “But I showed them the [Down by the Jetty] album cover which had the band standing in the exact same spot where I first set eyes on the two Abrahams and I said it’s all too spooky for words, boys. And they said: ‘No, no, no. It’s divine intervention.’” In fact, what had brought the men to this island in the Thames estuary was something far more prosaic. Like many Londoners, the Orthodox Jewish community is being priced out of the capital. With large families – eight children is not uncommon – they needed a ready supply of large, affordable houses within an hour’s commute of London. Scouting parties were sent out to Canvey, Milton Keynes, Harlow and Southend. House prices, crime statistics and traffic levels were scrutinised. Canvey came out on top. At low tide the creek which separates Canvey from the Essex coast is more silt than seawater, with sailing boats sitting forlornly in the mud, but you don’t always need to cross water to know you’re on an island. “As you drive on to the island it suddenly changes. The quietness hits you,” says Joel Friedman, whose family moved to Canvey last summer from Tottenham. “You cross the marshes, you see the cattle grazing and it gives you five minutes just to quieten down and get used to a different pace.” Joel says his wife and six children loved their new home “from day one” – the space, the freedom, the purity of the air. But the quiet life he was hoping for hasn’t quite materialised. The Haredi “exodus” from Stamford Hill, the London neighbourhood with which they’ve been synonymous for more than 200 years, has inevitably attracted a certain amount of media attention – not least because the destination that this deeply religious community has chosen is often caricatured as a land of boy-racers and “Essex girls”, retired gangsters and hardline Brexiteers (the Canvey constituency of Castle Point was among the five most pro-Brexit wards in the UK). Joel has become the spokesman for the Canvey Haredis and currently has the unenviable task of juggling a steady stream of media requests for access to a community which is fiercely private. He agrees to meet me at the Jcoci Educational Foundation, the school and synagogue they established earlier this year on the site of a derelict school. I’ve brought along Chris as a “chaperone” to avoid any awkwardness – the Haredis observe strict gender-segregation rules – and they greet each other with handshakes while I lurk a few paces behind with my hands in my pockets. Joel tells us they are preparing for Sukkot, a religious festival in which Jews commemorate the 40 years the Israelites spent wandering the desert on their way to the Promised Land by building wooden shelters covered with palm leaves. There’s something about the makeshift nature of the school, too, with its boarded-up windows, spartan offices and classrooms, which resonates. Moving on. Starting over somewhere new. These people have been doing it for centuries. Pinned to the school office wall is a small map of the island with red dots showing where the Haredi families are living: 25 families have moved here in the past year and Joel says another 10 will be arriving in the next month or so. He says the reception from locals has on the whole been “fantastic”. Neighbours have brought kosher cakes and Passover food, “things you wouldn’t ever get in London, where it’s each man to his own”. A group of the men were recently invited to attend a Rotary Club dinner where, Joel recounts with a flicker of amusement, the most pressing question of the night was: “When is the bagel shop coming?” (This is a question I will hear repeated from almost every Canvey resident I speak to over the following days.) It’s not all been plain sailing, of course: some local children riding their bikes made the Nazi salute to a group of Haredis and were swiftly berated by older onlookers who witnessed the incident. And Joel says he keeps an eye on local social media groups to make sure any outlandish rumours are nipped in the bud. A recent story on a Canvey Facebook group that the Jews had persuaded the council to ban dogs from Canvey Heights (a local beauty spot) was “sucked out of the air” says Joel, “but it shows how something stupid can escalate”. It’s to avoid such misunderstandings that the Jewish community has been so uncharacteristically open since moving to Canvey, even agreeing to be filmed for a BBC documentary, Canvey Island: the Promised Land, which examines the “clash of faiths” between the Haredi and the Canveyites and will be broadcast early next year. Joel admits he was uncomfortable with the decision to open their doors to a film crew but was persuaded to do so by their rabbi and community leader back in Hackney, “for public relations purposes”. “People see you on the street and they don’t necessarily know what you stand for, your history, what your plans are,” he says. “Filming has arguably the highest benefits, but also the highest risk attached to it. It’s not an easy thing to do. People in our community are not used to exposure in any sense or form. They just want to live and let live.” The Haredis were not the only ones taking a risk by agreeing to be filmed. In recent years Canvey Island has become the go-to place for TV researchers looking for an angry Ukipper, or Brexiteer. With its surreal mix of oil silos and caravan parks, amusement arcades and nature reserves, it makes for great television, but often for all the wrong reasons. When Channel 4 wanted to film a one-off Brexit special of Wife Swap, they headed straight to Canvey. So it’s perhaps not surprising that when word got out that the BBC was making a documentary, a petition went round the island insisting the film was banned. The assumption was that Canvey Island was about to get another kicking. This distrust of the media and the “cultural elite” was something that united both communities, says Riete Oord, the film’s director. Both sides feel they are misrepresented, ridiculed even. And yet once she had earned their trust, she says she found the level of openness and honesty disarming. The centrepiece of the film is a meal, organised by Chris Fenwick at his hotel, at which the Haredis and the Canveyites sit down together – or as together as the gender segregation rules will allow. It could have felt like a stunt for the cameras, but the warmth and curiosity of the Canveyites and the willingness of the new arrivals to take themselves so clearly out of their comfort zone in the name of good relations, turn it into something far more uplifting. The bemused looks on the faces of the Haredi gentlemen as the guitarist from Dr Feelgood launches into a rendition of Milk and Alcohol are priceless, as is the moment when Gary, a local car mechanic, goes in for a “man hug” with one of his new acquaintances, who protests, “I’m not used to this,” before submitting with good humour and no small degree of awkwardness. While Gary was bonding with the new neighbours, his wife Sharon was on a separate table getting to know the women. Chris arranges for me to meet Sharon in the bar of the Oysterfleet Hotel and I ask her what she made of the experience. “I loved them,” says Sharon. “We talked about where they got their clothes from and we asked about their wigs. They didn’t mind us asking. I want to get a book on it, I’m fascinated by them. If they moved next door to me it wouldn’t really bother me. I can’t see any harm in them and I think they’re brave as well.” “When clashing cultures refuse to mix, trouble often follows – you get extremism and racial hatred,” says Riete. “But what I loved about the Canvey Islanders is that they weren’t going to let that happen. They said sit down and have a meal with us, we want to know how you live, how we can talk to each other.” What’s often overlooked, in the “clash of cultures” narrative that has followed the Haredis’ relocation, is that they are in fact following in a time-honoured tradition – that of east Londoners moving to Essex in search of a better life for their families. And nobody understands that imperative better than the people of Canvey Island, many of whom were rehoused there from the East End after the Second World War. “There’s a folk memory of living alongside Jews from east London,” says the Rev David Tudor, the rector for Canvey who was born in Barbados and moved here from southeast London 20 years ago. “Many of these people started their life in London, or their parents did, or they worked in the rag trade and their employers were Jews, so there’s a memory of living and working alongside good people.” Morning service has just finished at St Nicholas church and the adjacent community centre is buzzing, with a toddler music group, line-dancing class and a coffee morning in progress. David has been a key point of contact between the Haredi newcomers and the Canvey community, trying to “spread the word” that these people “need to be separate, but they want to belong. They want to integrate without assimilating.” Separate but belonging. It’s a difficult line to walk. But David believes Canvey’s infamous “island mentality” could work in everyone’s favour. “There’s a sense here of ‘We look after our own.’ At its best it means we’re all in this together. There’s huge goodwill on both sides. Come back in five years and ask me again, but so far, so good.” The unspoken question which hangs in the air is how big exactly this new community will grow. There is an estimated 30,000 strictly orthodox Jews living in northeast London. Canvey is an island five miles long by three miles wide, with a population of 40,000. It would be a relevant question to ask, but nobody I spoke to on Canvey asked it. For now, the community is small enough to be a source of curiosity rather than consternation. “We’ve not had one single email or complaint about the Haredi Jews and, trust me, our constituents tend to let us know if they’re not happy about something,” says Rebecca Harris, the Conservative MP for Castle Point. “If anything, there’s a sense of people looking out for them and feeling quite protective towards them.” She mentions the council is looking into putting timers on some of Canvey’s pedestrian crossings as the Sabbath laws prevent observant Jews from operating electrical machinery. There are also tentative plans afoot to give the Haredi community its own section of the sea wall to decorate, adding a new chapter to the colourful series of murals which tell the island’s story, from the Great Flood to the rise of Dr Feelgood. Down on Thorney Bay, the island’s deputy mayor, Barry Campagna, oversees Canvey Bay Watch, a group of volunteers who meet each Tuesday to clean up the beach, paint the sea walls and plant palm trees. Barry recalls moving from Islington as a child and thinking he’d arrived in “paradise”. Like many of the locals I speak to, he is cheerfully confident that the renowned aloofness of the Haredi community will be no match for the friendliness of the Canveyites. “We’ll wear ’em down in the end,” he says, laughing. “You can’t help it. You walk along the sea wall and everyone says hello to each other. It’s the Canvey way.” But perhaps there are some lines in the sand that won’t be crossed. “I’ve invited them to a couple of Dr Feelgood concerts,” says Chris. “They never turn up, but I’ll keep asking.” The documentary Canvey: The Promised Island will be shown on BBC One early next year"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/20/pear-chicory-bacon-salad-allioli-recipe-thomasina-miers","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T16:00:01Z","webTitle":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for pear, chicory and bacon salad with allioli dressing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/20/pear-chicory-bacon-salad-allioli-recipe-thomasina-miers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/20/pear-chicory-bacon-salad-allioli-recipe-thomasina-miers","fields":{"headline":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for pear, chicory and bacon salad with allioli dressing","bodyText":"Many years ago, I was introduced to what is still one of my favourite cookbooks, Catalan Cooking, by Colman Andrews (£14.99, Grub Street). Catalan food is similar to Spanish, but takes glorious twists and turns – you could even say it’s a bit surreal, like the paintings of Dalí, himself a Catalan. The unusual dressing in today’s recipe, for example, is the star of the show. In traditional Catalan allioli, you use no binder other than garlic, but it’s famously difficult to make. The addition of pear solves this problem, while adding a wonderful, sweet, almost exotic taste. The fruit is poached until just tender, then pureed to bind the mayo, instead of the usual egg. It’s spectacularly garlicky, too, so make sure to eat it with close friends and have no important meetings coming up. The allioli is also vegan, and to make today’s dish wholly so, omit the cheese and bacon and use thinly sliced butternut squash instead, a bit like a carpaccio. Steam the squash until just tender, but still holding its shape, then cut into 0.5cm-thick slices. Bulk up the salad with a few extra slices of roast or raw pear, to complement the dressing, and throw in a handful of bean sprouts for body and texture. That will turn this into a lovely meat- and dairy-free salad. Pear, chicory and bacon salad with allioli dressing The chicory provides a deliciously crisp, fresh backdrop for the blue cheese and streaky bacon. You could use pancetta instead of bacon – Trealy Farm makes a particularly good home-grown version. You’ll have plenty of dressing left over, but that’s no bad thing, because it transforms all sorts (see And For The Rest Of The Week…). Serves four. 6 rashers streaky bacon (or pancetta) 2 ripe pears, cored, quartered and finely sliced A squeeze of lemon 4 large heads chicory, separated into leaves 4 celery sticks, thinly sliced 1 big handful parsley leaves, very roughly chopped 50g roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped 80g blue cheese (such as stilton) Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper For the allioli dressing 2 small pears, peeled, cored and cut into small chunks 2 small garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped 2 tbsp cider vinegar 200ml mild olive oil Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a large baking tray with foil, lay the bacon in the tray, then roast for eight to 10 minutes, until crisp (or fry it in a pan, if you prefer). Remove and leave to cool. Meanwhile, make the allioli. Put the pears chunks in a small pan, add enough cold water to cover and cook on a medium heat for five to six minutes, until soft. Drain, then place in a food processor with the chopped garlic and vinegar, and whizz to a puree. With the motor running, start adding the oil a drop at a time to begin with, and when you’ve incorporated about half, pour in the rest in a very slow, steady stream. Season generously to taste. Core, quarter and finely slice the remaining pears, and toss in lemon juice to prevent discolouration. Combine the pears in a bowl with the chicory, celery, parsley, hazelnuts and cheese. Season lightly, toss gently, then break the crisp bacon over the top, drizzle over the allioli dressing and serve at once. And for the rest of the week… The lightly fruity allioli goes well with so many things. I love it with baby gem and softly boiled eggs, which makes for a beautiful and light lunch. Or try it alongside steamed fish, roast vegetables (it’s particularly good with roast jerusalem artichoke) or a plate of autumnal crudités: florets of raw cauliflower, pink chicory, carrot and radish for dipping in the garlicky mayo would make a grand start to any weekend lunch. For a sumptuous supper dish, layer slices of parsnip, potato or celeriac with the allioli and bake, gratin-style; all you’ll need with that is good bread and a crisp, green salad. Or try it Lebanese-style, mixed with yoghurt and maybe some hot sauce, and eat with roast chicken, fried potatoes and flatbreads to mop up all those juices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/20/my-life-in-sex-woman-who-sleeps-with-masseur","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T12:00:07Z","webTitle":"My life in sex: ‘I have sensual encounters with my masseur’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/20/my-life-in-sex-woman-who-sleeps-with-masseur","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/20/my-life-in-sex-woman-who-sleeps-with-masseur","fields":{"headline":"My life in sex: ‘I have sensual encounters with my masseur’","bodyText":"Thirteen years ago we became parents, and it sucked the wind out of my husband’s sails. He became depressed, and lost all interest in sex. In the past decade I have gone from trying, single-handedly, to make things happen in the bedroom to taking notes on how infrequently we were intimate (was I imagining things?), to seeing a counsellor. Therapy made me realise I was going to have to look after my sensuality on my own. I didn’t want my libido to flatline. A friend recommended a masseur who specialises in sensuality and reconnecting with the body. After four full-body massages, during which I did orgasm, I felt I could trust him, and I asked whether we could have sex. I lost my virginity to my husband and had never been with anyone else. The thought of going through life having only been with one man, who now didn’t want sex, was infuriating. Four years after making my first appointment, we meet once or twice a year and have sex in an hours-long, languid sensual encounter. My husband is no longer depressed, but still doesn’t appear interested in sex, and almost never expresses physical affection. We might have sex once or twice a year. I don’t fancy him, but I do still love him and wouldn’t break up our family for the world. During one of our many conversations about the lack of sex, my husband said I should probably have an affair, but shouldn’t tell him about it. I wait to see how things develop and, in the meantime, look forward to appointments with my masseur. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life. Want to share yours?

Our new report, Vital Signs, which combines statistical data with local surveys for 22 areas in the country, shines a spotlight on the issues facing our communities. The reports have exposed specific problems of increased poverty, homelessness and poor mental health. In Newquay Central, for example, 45% of children are living in poverty, and in some areas in Bristol this is almost at 50%. The findings suggest many people feel left behind, as access to community support, services and opportunities becomes increasingly unequal and as statutory provision continues to contract. The increase in poverty is clear. The proportion of homeless households in Milton Keynes that include children or pregnant women has grown by 128% since 2013, to 5.7 out of 1,000 households – significantly higher than the national rate of 1.9. Cornwall has the third-highest number of people sleeping rough in England, with young people increasingly turning to couch surfing as an alternative to finding a home. Local communities in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire and the south-west are also seeing significant increases in reports of mental illness and related behavioural problems, such as substance abuse and self-harm, particularly for young people. One in 10 young people in Luton are likely to have a mental health condition and 22,700 children and young people (8%) in Cambridgeshire live with a parent with a mental illness. Between one and two-thirds of these children and young people are likely to develop mental health problems themselves. At the same time, resources to address these problems have shrunk considerably in recent years and many people have been left unable to access the support they need. As the government is not going to reverse the austerity agenda, we need to look to local charities and support those giving in our local areas. Strong communities are the key to a cohesive and prosperous civil society, often kept afloat by the thousands of local groups and charities supporting those in need. In Cornwall, for example, we are working with the Community Land Trust to offer a simple way for second-home owners to help Cornish communities. They just give one week’s rent a year to the scheme, which supports a crisis fund to address hardship and homelessness. It also helps the Community Land Trust to deliver genuinely affordable homes. These small charities largely go unrecognised for their vital work. We hope these reports can connect local donors to the grassroots organisations supporting vulnerable people in their area, and remind us all of the huge need on our own doorsteps.

Not only because it makes you and your passenger whoop with joy, but also because it sends out a bow wave of cheer wherever you drive it. I’ve never experienced anything like it. At every junction we were met with thumbs-ups, air punches, endless smiles of appreciation and even clapping. People filmed us on their phones and called out from their gardens. Driving it is an unusually inclusive affair. Everyone you pass gets involved. It’s so low that you can easily lean out and put the palm of your hand on the tarmac. You gaze up at cyclists and van drivers from your prone, legs-outstretched driving position. And everyone has something to say. The car really is tiny – it only weighs 490kg. I can’t think of anything, other than maybe a go-kart or a skateboard, where a Ford Fiesta looms over you. Stopping at a junction where a young mother was waiting to cross I found myself exactly at the eye level of her toddler. He waved and smiled and made a broom brrrrroooom noise. Just like me, in fact. It’s been a big year for this tiny car. It’s exactly six decades since the great Colin Chapman launched the Lotus Seven. In 1973, he sold the brand to Caterham, which continued to produce these lightweight, high-powered racing machines with pure, raw, driving fun coursing through their veins. As part of the celebrations, Caterham has now built this Seven Sprint – a “variant” of the iconic Seven that was planned for the 1960s but never launched. To maintain their exclusivity – and to keep the maths pleasingly simple – only 60 have been built. Which is total madness as they could easily sell hundreds more. The car’s retro sister, the more powerful SuperSprint, which was launched last month, sold out within seven hours. I suspect there will soon be more “variations” of retro Sevens coming along to keep us happy. Updated with a 660cc 80hp, three-cylinder Suzuki engine (the same one that is installed in Caterham’s entry-level Seven 160 model), the rest of the Sprint has all four wheels planted firmly in the 60s. Handling is elemental, you feel every rut; while cornering is physical and rewarding. There are no doors to speak of, no radio and the heating and the windscreen wipers work just as they used back then – not very well. Similarly the suspension and rollover bar are reminiscent of Colin Chapman’s original. It’s lovely to look at with its flared wings and chromed bug-eye headlamps. The polished exhaust silencer is perfectly positioned to scorch the hairs off your passenger’s calves as they clamber out, which adds to the period experience. The wheels are painted cream and have shiny hub caps (when was the last time you sawhubcaps on a car?) It comes in the same colours you’d have had 60 years ago: Cream, Mellow Yellow, Regency Red, Camberwick Green (pictured here and my favourite), British Racing Green and Misty Blue. In the cockpit, the sepia-washed impression continues. There is a wood-rimmed steering wheel and the dashboard is scarlet red, complete with the classic “oOOo” instrument layout. The stitched seat upholstery is also in striking abattoir red. Drivers were obviously fitter and slimmer in them days. Clambering in is almost impossible, a sort of knee curl followed by a triceps dip. Once you’re in it is tight but comfortable, in the way a sardine feels snug in its tin. If you are more than 12st you’ll struggle. Two friends could barely get their arses in – and one became so wedged we had to heave him out. But if you can get in, fire it up, listen to the glorious rattling roar – and blast your way back to the 60s.

Channell, known to everybody as Chann, is a registered pilot who served 24 years in the army working on Apache helicopters. Chann also happens to be scared of heights. He doesn’t mind flying planes or sitting on the side of the Apache with the door open; he’s just terrified of going up two or three floors of a building or driving over a bridge. Chann is nervous; his speech is fast. He says he’s sweating. We meet at a trendy startup in Oxford, where he is about to undergo virtual-reality therapy for his phobia (although the term “virtual-reality” therapy is controversial: some say the VR is just a tool for the therapy; others argue that the virtual reality is the therapy itself). Psychologists are now trialling VR for all kinds of conditions, from phobias to pain management to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There are two other people in the room. Cognitive-behavioural therapist Polly Haselton sits behind a curved computer screen watching Chann, occasionally asking questions. Daniel Freeman, professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford and one of the world’s pioneers in this field, watches Chann’s every movement. Freeman explains there are three common fears of heights: that you will fall; that what you are standing on will give way; or that you will jump, which is known as “the call of the void”. Chann’s fear is of falling. He straps on his virtual-reality headset (also known as a head-mounted display, or HMD). Inside the headset, he will find himself fully immersed in a three-dimensional world. Today, he is going to level four of a 10-storey building in New York to rescue a kitten stranded on a branch of an indoor tree. Chann has to use a lever to push himself on to a small platform towards the cat. He is a stocky, tough-looking man in his late 50s. But he’s not looking tough any more. His voice is rising, and he’s shaking. He edges forward along the virtual branch. In real life, his feet also move gingerly – then come to a sudden stop. His breathing becomes louder and more staccato. “You’re doing really well,” Haselton says. “You don’t know how difficult this is,” Chann pants. “Come here, cat.” Then he stops. “Nah, can’t get it. Aaaagh. No! Gotta come back.” He starts again, cautiously edging forward. “Yes. Yes. Yes! No, stop Chann. Yes! Yes!” His yeses are urgent, desperate. He makes a grab for the kitten, and returns it to virtual safety. Task complete. He takes his headset off, talking even faster. “My anxiety levels were way high. Super high.” “We’re talking nine out of 10, 10 out of 10?” Freeman asks calmly. “Yeah. I really didn’t want to be there. I had to think I was in a room in Oxford. ‘You’re not here, it’s all OK, do it.’” Chann is one of a dozen people currently testing this software. (Next month, the trial is being extended to 100 people.) Already, he says, it has made a difference to his life. “Yesterday, I went on a rollercoaster with my daughter. I had never gone on one before. Not the big ones, the smaller ones, but still...” He’s spent only around 20 minutes in the virtual world today, but he is exhausted. “I was worried about coming here, and I’ve done it, and I’m buzzing. Elated.” He pauses, trying to catch his breath. “But I know in my heart of hearts, if there was a real cat on level four, I would not be going out and getting it. Polly asked me, what if it was a little baby? That would change the dynamics.” Freeman has been working with VR for 16 years. What he loves about this therapy is its simplicity. “There are very few conditions VR can’t help,” he says, “because, in the end, every mental health problem is about dealing with a problem in the real world, and VR can produce that troubling situation for you. It gives you a chance to coach people in other ways of responding. The people I see are anxious or depressed, or worried about people attacking them, and what they’ve done in their life is retreat from the world. With VR, you can get people to try stuff they haven’t done for years – go in lifts, to shopping malls, then they realise they can do it out in the real world.” Acrophobia, or the fear of heights, is just the start, Freeman says. He has already developed VR programs that treat people with paranoia – for example, placing them in virtual libraries, lifts or on tube trains with strangers eyeballing them. In a Medical Research Council-funded study, he used VR with 30 patients to help them re-learn that they are safe around other people. “The results were remarkable. From just 30 minutes in VR, there were large reductions in paranoia. Immediately afterwards, more than half the patients no longer had severe paranoia. Importantly, the benefits transferred to the real world. It wasn’t a definitive study. It was small and short-term, but the results do show great potential.” The program will initially be used in NHS mental health services with a staff member present, but Freeman believes that, ultimately, it could be available commercially. Nearly two million people sought advice for mental health issues in 2015, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre – up from 1.2 million in 2010. Meanwhile, the number of mental health nurses fell by nearly 15% from 45,384 in 2010 to 38,774 in July 2016, according to a written parliamentary answer from Philip Dunne, the health minister. The British Medical Association recently revealed that in 2016-17, 5,876 adult patients with mental health conditions were referred to another health trust for treatment, with some patients being sent 600 miles away to Scotland. Against this backdrop, virtual reality is the great hope for many mental health professionals. Some psychologists believe they are on the brink of a VR revolution. Then again, they were saying the same thing a quarter of a century ago. Barbara Rothbaum’s office in Atlanta, Georgia, is closed due to the impending arrival of Hurricane Irma. In between electricity cuts, I manage to speak to her at her home. Rothbaum is a professor in psychiatry, a clinical psychologist at Emory University, and the founding mother of exposure therapy using virtual reality. “We published the very first study using VR to treat a psychological and psychiatric disorder back in 1995,” she tells me. Again, it was to treat acrophobia, and the results amazed Rothbaum. “Seven out of 10 people who got the virtual reality reported putting themselves in real-life height situations afterwards.” That was when they thought they were on to something big. “We used to say: ‘We’re on the cutting edge of the lunatic fringe.’ That was our line at the time.” She laughs. After acrophobia, Rothbaum developed a VR program for fear of flying. This was even more effective, because traditional exposure therapy (paying for yourself and a therapist to travel on a plane) is time-consuming and expensive. “I can do all that in my 45- to 50-minute therapy session, with ultimate control. So if I know they’re not ready for turbulence, I can guarantee there won’t be turbulence.” Rothbaum then went on to do pioneering work with Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans suffering from PTSD. Before VR, veterans were confined to imaginal therapy – basically, shutting your eyes and thinking yourself back to the original situation. But now Rothbaum could recreate it for them in a controlled environment. “With PTSD, especially in military folk, they are very avoidant emotionally. With VR, it’s harder to avoid, because it is such a potent stimulus.” Early on in her VR career, a public-private partnership between Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology insisted Rothbaum and her colleagues form a corporation and patent their software. The result was a company, Virtually Better, that designs environments for fellow clinicians to use. “That is my conflict of interest,” Rothbaum says. Whoever she speaks to, she instantly declares it. Does it worry her that she is responsible for the research showing how effective her own VR products are? “It has done, over the years,” she says. “One of the ways I manage it is, I disclose, disclose, disclose.” Rothbaum is not alone. VR therapy is a small, niche world. Read the scientific papers, and the same names crop up again and again. And most of these academics are now also running commercial companies. As traditional funds dry up for universities, people such as Rothbaum are increasingly reliant on business – often their own business – for support in their research. As it happens, Rothbaum says, she lacked the cut-throat instincts to be a good businesswoman. “A criticism of Virtually Better was that it was run more like an academic department than a business. We knew how to write grants so we’d write small business grants and enjoy collaborating rather than competing. I thought it was an interesting way to do exposure therapy and wasn’t very mercenary about it.” Has she ever used VR to treat her own fears? “No. My fear early on was that somebody was going to make a lot of money, and it wasn’t going to be us. Actually, that is probably still going to come true. But I’ve adapted to that; it’s all right.” She’s still not rich? “Oh no, not by a long shot, no.” Despite research showing its efficacy, the VR therapy revolution did not take off in the 1990s or the noughties. This time around, though, it looks as if it might. Mel Slater, a professor of virtual environments, shows me why. We meet in the London HQ of Digital Catapult, a government initiative to promote the digital economy. Slater hands me the headset used in the virtual psychotherapy sessions he is developing. “The VR world burst open in 2013 when this Oculus Rift was released for a few hundred dollars, compared with the next credible headset of $50,000, and now all the big companies have gone into it.” Slater talks quietly and, facially, has a touch of Woody Allen about him. Although primarily a computer scientist, he is now largely based in the psychology faculty at the University of Barcelona. Slater is one of the most-in-demand academics in the virtual world, with an endless list of titles, including professor of virtual environments at University College London, co-founder of the company Virtual Bodyworks, and immersive fellow at Digital Catapult. He also works with Daniel Freeman on treatments for persecutory delusions and acrophobia. Like Rothbaum, Slater is one of the early 1990s pioneers. “Nobody told me virtual reality died, so I stayed with it.” He smiles. And had it died? “No, but for a long time people said, ‘It’s not going anywhere because it’s too expensive.’ The equipment we used at UCL cost £1m. The equipment I have in Barcelona, when I set up there 10 years ago, was £100,000. Now I can do the same thing with £3,000.” Slater says the human reaction still surprises him. “There is some level of the brain that doesn’t distinguish between reality and virtual reality. A typical example is, you see a precipice and you jump back and your heart starts racing. You react very fast because it’s the safe thing for the brain to do. All your autonomic system starts functioning, you get a very strong level of arousal, then you go, ‘I know it’s not real’. But it doesn’t matter, because you still can’t step forward near that precipice.” In some ways, he says, virtual reality beats reality because it enables you to experiment in ways you can’t, physically, in real life (for example, putting people in different bodies to experience what it is like to be a different gender or ethnicity) or in situations you would avoid. “I was in one session where the guy had such a fear of public speaking that he told us about speaking at his daughter’s wedding, and we said, ‘How old is your daughter?’ and he said, ‘Three!’ So he spoke to a virtual audience. He said: ‘I can’t do this, I’m turning bright red, my voice is an octave higher.’ The psychologist later played it back to him and said: ‘Is your face red? No. Are you speaking an octave higher than normal? No.’ The psychologist did in one afternoon what would normally take 12 weeks.” I have seen headlines suggesting that VR can cure depression. Surely that is an exaggeration? “Cure, I don’t know,” Slater says. “But we published a study last year where we reduced the level of depression among a cohort of people through a VR intervention not that dissimilar from what I’m going to show you today. Part of having depression is that you are overly self-critical and cannot give compassionate thoughts to yourself. So in the VR, you see a crying child. Beforehand, the therapist has given you a structure of things you should say to other people in order to give them compassion. So you say these things to the child who starts looking at you and stops crying. Then, in the next phase, you are that child, so you then see and hear your previous self giving you the compassionate speech. When we gave this to a group of moderately depressed people three times, the level of depression decreased.” I put on my headset and sit in front of a screen. The program I’m trying, called VReflect-Me, is still being developed for people with anxiety issues and depression. It is based on the notion that, when advising friends, we are often kinder and more objective than when analysing ourselves. First of all, an avatar is created of me. Then I embody that avatar. I am in a therapy session with a psychiatrist (in this case, Sigmund Freud) and I tell him my problems. In the next stage, I embody Freud. When my head moves, Freud’s head moves; when my hands move, his move; and when I’m ready, I advise myself in the form of Freud. (Slater says that Freud is a useful avatar, because you tend to adopt characteristics of your avatar; so, if he is wise, you become more wise.) I tell Freud I have paranoid tendencies; generally, I think I’m incredibly boring with nothing to say and hate formal social situations (not the pub), because I fear my stupidity will be exposed. More specifically, I tell Freud, I have just read comments on social media about an interview I just wrote saying that I gave my subject an easy ride. I am full of self-loathing, and feel useless at my job. Now I switch roles, and am Freud advising me. The first time I do it, I’m too self-conscious. Slater gently suggests that I was not fully immersed. I ask if I can do it again. This time, I go for it. It might not be the way Freud would have responded, but I listen to my problems and then tear into myself – rightly or wrongly, I make a good case for not being boring, stupid and a rubbish journalist. I verbalise everything and dismiss it as solipsistic nonsense. I then return to my own avatar. “Good points. Well made,” I say to Freud. And I mean it. When I take off my headset and leave the virtual world, my breathing is fast and shallow – not unlike Chann’s after he’d been to the heights. I feel both ecstatic and emotional. Tearful, almost. Even if it doesn’t last, it’s been a useful exercise. I might say this kind of stuff to myself in my head, but it feels different when you say it out loud. Slater is pleased with me. “Wow! You did amazing. You said, ‘You, you, you!’ which is great.” What he means is, I successfully got out of my head and into Freud’s. It strikes me as a powerful tool for therapists. There is no way I would have said what I said, as Freud, if I was simply talking to a real person. But I can’t help thinking I’m a relatively safe case. What if I were more vulnerable? What, for example, if I suffered from the acrophobic’s call of the void, did the VR program, convinced myself I’d overcome my phobia, went to the nearest high-rise and jumped? Dr Kate Anthony, an expert on the use of technology in therapy and a fellow of the British Association for Counselling &amp; Psychotherapy, stresses that technology is there to be used alongside therapy, rather than instead of. “VR is a good opportunity for helping psychotherapists,” she says, “but we’re not at a stage yet where virtual reality is going to be able to replicate a human therapist.” It’s all very well, she adds, having software to encourage you to talk and tackle your fears, but that will take you only so far. “The VR therapist can’t respond in any meaningful way, and without that meaningful response, I don’t think the client is going to progress.” Once VR treatments have been proven to be effective, she says, she would like to see them available on prescription. What about making them commercially available? No, she says, it’s too risky. “If we’re talking about paranoia, for example, any of these situations can trigger the client. The trouble with something like that is it could bring up all sorts of issues. I would want to see it closely managed.” Dr Michael Madary, a philosopher and technology ethicist, and his colleague Thomas Metzinger, have drawn up a code of conduct for the use of VR, some of which addresses its use in therapy. He thinks VR can have a positive impact, but that therapists must not blind themselves to the dangers. One particularly sensitive issue, Madary says, is data. Participants in studies know their data is confidential, but that could be very different if commercial companies invest in VR therapy purely for profit. “With motion tracking, particularly facial tracking, users are going to reveal a lot about themselves – about their mental state, about how they react to various stimuli – and that data can be collected and then used as a powerful bargaining tool.” He envisages a scenario where there is an advertisement flashed, or product placed, in the virtual world and the content creators collect the response of users to that ad based on the faces they make. “You can imagine seeing your avatar in a new jacket, for example. There will be a lot of powerful techniques that emerge in marketing, with widespread use of motion capture.” Mel Slater accepts that virtual reality can be abused. But anything can, he says. “You can use a bread knife to cut bread or to stab someone, so any tool can be misused deliberately. This is why I think the applications in clinical psychology have to be led by people such as Daniel, who know the risks.” Back in Oxford, Daniel Freeman is not so sure the programs need his presence to be effective. He is talking about his company Nowican, and anticipating the launch of its first product – Nowican Do Heights, the acrophobia program being trialled by Chann. He hopes that the NHS and individual psychologists will invest in it, but believes its prime use will be for individuals seeking help. “We’re putting a virtual coach in there so you don’t need a therapist, and we’re also looking at better techniques than simple exposure.” Is he in danger of doing himself out of a job? “No. We’re not saying it has to replace the therapist. Some people will want to talk to a therapist, and sometimes the complexity means you need a therapist. But the issue is, there aren’t enough therapists.” Freeman is hoping that, before long, we will be able to download this as an app on our smartphones. In a world of diminishing NHS resources, Freeman regards it as a no-brainer: “I see people who have been waiting 20 years and not had a chance of seeing a therapist. The idea that we can give so many people the chance to access what the best therapists should be doing – that is really exciting.” Watch the Guardian’s latest VR experience The Party, filmed from the perspective of a 16-year-old girl with autism, on our new Guardian VR app. You can download it from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, or watch it as a 360 video, along with other Guardian VR experiences, at theguardian.com/vr"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/chilli-tofu-recipe-vegan-meera-sodha","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T08:30:18Z","webTitle":"Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for chilli tofu","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/chilli-tofu-recipe-vegan-meera-sodha","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/21/chilli-tofu-recipe-vegan-meera-sodha","fields":{"headline":"Meera Sodha’s vegan recipe for chilli tofu","bodyText":"Something happens to me when I get within 10 miles of Leicester. I crave chilli tofu: the urge is so strong, I swear I can smell it the closer I get to into the city. This Pavlovian response was forged over years travelling as a child with my parents from Lincolnshire to Leicester on the three-and-a- half-hour round trip to shop for spices and saris. We’d head to Melton Road, which was lined with shops owned by the Indian community recently ousted from Idi Amin’s Uganda. Back then, the sari shop windows displayed 1960s mannequins with beehives, many of them chipped or missing an arm, and the dazzling gold jewellery shops attracted Indian women like moths to a flame. There were endless shaak (vegetable) bhaji shops selling produce I wasn’t used to seeing in rural Lincolnshire: spiky bitter gourds, eyeball-like lychees and obscenely large jackfruit in spice- and incense-scented shops. Although I love it all now, at 10 it was the height of boredom being dragged around those shops, so my parents regularly employed bribes to keep my sister and me from getting up to no good (pulling saris off their hangers). Top of the list was a chilli paneer, chilli mogo or chilli tofu washed down with a carton of neon-orange Rubicon mango juice. These dishes are Indo-Chinese, a fairly new cuisine (the first restaurant opened in Kolkata just 85 years ago) that has found its way into the hearts and bellies of all Indians. In today’s recipe, tofu is fried until crisp, then doused in garlic, chillies, tomato, soy and sugar until sticky, hot, sweet and sour. There is nothing not to like: it is brazenly addictive stuff. Chilli tofu An excellent way to get your protein. This dish is traditionally eaten out and about with other street food such as samosas, chaats and dosas, but at home I eat it by itself or with spinach, non-dairy yoghurt and chapatis to create a meal. Serves four. 800g firm tofu (try the Cauldron and Taifun brands, which are widely available), drained and cut into 3cm cubes Cornflour Rapeseed oil, for frying 2 tsp cumin seeds, bashed 1 brown onion, peeled and diced 6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 3cm piece ginger, peeled and grated 4 green finger chillies: 2 very finely chopped, 2 slit down their length ¼ tsp ground black pepper 2 tbsp tomato puree 2 tbsp light soy sauce 2 tsp caster sugar ¾ tsp salt 2 peppers (1 red and 1 green, ideally), cored and cut into 1cm slices Spread the tofu on a large plate and dust with the cornflour, turning the cubes to coat. Take a deep frying pan for which you have a lid and add enough oil to come 0.5cm up the sides, and heat over a medium flame. Line a dish with kitchen towel, to drain the cooked tofu on. Shake any excess cornflour off the tofu, then put half the tofu in the hot oil. Fry for three minutes, turning regularly with tongs, until golden, then transfer to the paper-lined dish and repeat with the remaining tofu. Drain all but two tablespoons of oil from the pan, then fry the cumin and onion for 10-12 minutes, until soft and sweet. Add the garlic, ginger and the chopped and whole chillies, fry for five minutes, then add the ground pepper, tomato puree, soy sauce, sugar and salt. Stir to mix, cook for five minutes, then add the pepper strips and 100ml water. Cover and leave to cook for eight minutes, stirring every now and then, and adding more water if need be: there should be just enough “sauce” to coat the tofu. When the peppers are soft, return the tofu back to the pan, turn up the heat and stir to coat the tofu in sauce. Stir-fry for five minutes, to warm the tofu through, then take off the heat. Serve by itself if you’re Indian, or with chapatis, greens or a leafy salad, and rice if you’re not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/05/social-media-stars-breaching-rules-on-promoting-brands-watchdog-says-instagram-twitter","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T17:31:35Z","webTitle":"Social media stars breaching rules on promoting brands, watchdog says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/05/social-media-stars-breaching-rules-on-promoting-brands-watchdog-says-instagram-twitter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/05/social-media-stars-breaching-rules-on-promoting-brands-watchdog-says-instagram-twitter","fields":{"headline":"Social media stars breaching rules on promoting brands, watchdog says","bodyText":"Social media stars are not following the law and telling fans when they are being paid to promote products, the UK advertising watchdog has warned. It comes as new data from the watchdog shows a sharp rise in complaints about adverts posted on social media over the last four years. Figures reveal that there were 1,824 complaints about content on social networking sites in 2016, up 193% from 622 in 2012. A recent case involved the online makeup Instagram blogger Sheikhbeauty, who promoted Flat Tummy Tea, described online as a herbal detox tea. In December last year, the blogger wrote: “@flattummytea 20% off guys!!!! If you’ve been following me you’ll know i used this and I genuinely feel less bloated and a flatter tummy … oh yessss (sic)”. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found that this breached the CAP code for non-broadcast advertisements because it was not clear that it was an advert. In a similar case in June 2015, the reality star and fashion designer Millie Mackintosh posted a video on Instagram under which she wrote: “80s vogeuing [sic] x yoga @Houseofvoga. More of my #BlendRecommends with @drinkj2o Spritz to come! #sp”. A complaint that the ad with Britvic Soft Drinks Ltd was not clearly marked was also upheld. The ASA put the rise down to the growing number of advertisers using platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram as their popularity grows. Guy Parker, chief executive of the ASA, said a small but significant number of complaints related to social media stars and that they needed to work with brands to make sure ads were clearly labelled. Parker said that while progress had been made to get well-known figures on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram to be open about paid-for ads, “we are still not where we need to be”. “Too often we are seeing content that is clearly an ad and not identified as one. We are trumpeting this a bit and trying to raise awareness … We are trying to deal with cases that come across our desk to provide support, advice and clarity to brands and social influencers so they know when and how to disclose content,” he added. As social media has soared in popularity, so has the trade between marketers and “influencers”, or social media celebrities who have large and engaged followings online. They get paid money to publicise products and can command tens of thousands for one post. In the UK they are legally obliged to identify when such advertisements have been agreed by putting hashtag “#ad” with the post. Anyone not doing so is in breach of consumer protection legislation. Parker said: “Some [people] do include #ad and, although we are in a better situation than a few years ago, we are still not where we need to be and that is very often due to ignorance [people not knowing the law].” Daniel Knapp, an advertising researcher at the analyst firm IHS, said: “Consumers are saturated by traditional forms of advertising, such as TV breaks, online banner ads or outdoor posters. To combat advertising fatigue, marketers look to influencers as an alternative and more authentic way of selling their goods and services. Yet while many influencers are managed by specialist agencies, ultimately, brands work with individual people who may not adhere to the same standards and codes of ethics as a TV broadcaster or radio station selling advertising. “Undeclared advertising and sponsorships are just the tip of the iceberg. Many of the larger influencers have become brands in their own right, who have launched makeup and product lines that they present on their social media channels. This leads to a further blurring of content and commerce that especially younger consumers struggle to navigate.” In recent years consumer protection bodies in the UK and abroad in the US have made efforts to crack down on social media stars who have deals with big businesses. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority said: “It’s vital that anyone getting paid for endorsing or promoting products online makes that clear. Unclear online endorsements can mislead shoppers and damage businesses playing by the rules. “The CMA has been leading the way in this area with its international partners to help stop fake and misleading online reviews and endorsements. We’ve already carried out two enforcement cases against social media and marketing companies in the UK for misleading practices, and we’re going further to protect online shoppers by providing clearer guidelines to businesses and marketing companies on their responsibilities under the law.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/03/talking-horses-tuesday-3-october-best-best-horse-racing-ayr-kempton-non-runners-trainers","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T11:02:29Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Non-runners on Tuesday’s cards reveal scale of problem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/03/talking-horses-tuesday-3-october-best-best-horse-racing-ayr-kempton-non-runners-trainers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/03/talking-horses-tuesday-3-october-best-best-horse-racing-ayr-kempton-non-runners-trainers","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Non-runners on Tuesday’s cards reveal scale of problem","bodyText":"There are 15 non-runners on Tuesday’s four cards already, including no fewer than nine of the original 68 final declarations on the Flat card at Ayr, which gives a glimpse of the scale of the problem that the British Horseracing Authority is trying to address by publishing a detailed breakdown of the last year’s non-runners by trainer. The tables published on Monday highlighted several trainers whose non-runner rate is above the threshold level that could trigger a 12-month ban on using the self-certification system to withdraw horses from their yard. Pat Morris, whose record of nearly one-in-four horses failing to run after being declared is the worst in either code, offered a stout defence of his approach on Monday. However, the BHA threatened six years ago that it would change the rules to allow it to withdraw the right to “self-cert” if the overall situation did not improve, and now that the change has been made, it is unlikely to back down if Morris or any other trainer is still above the permitted threshold level of non-runners at the end of March. There is an odd look to the card at Ayr, which races for the first time since the abandonment of all three days of its Gold Cup meeting last month due to a small patch of waterlogged ground a couple of furlongs from the line. As a result, its last two meeting of the year on the level will be staged on the hurdles course and that means no straight track and no sprints. The going in Ayrshire is soft, heavy in places, which means that the two-year-olds face quite a test in the opening nursery. Here In The Dark (2.20) looks like the safest option here as he is proven at the trip having finished a close fourth of 19 over a mile last time out, though punters who bet on pedigrees may take an interest in Burn Some Dust, who is by Shirocco, a Breeders’ Cup winner on soft ground, out of a Montjeu mare and steps up to a suitable trip for the first time today. The best bet on the card, though, is Archie Watson’s thriving five-year-old Brandon Castle (4.00), the winner of four of his last five starts and the runner-up in the other. He is set to carry 10st 6lb this afternoon thanks to a 6lb penalty for winning at Chester on Saturday, but he lugged 10st to victory there and finished 15 lengths clear, and in his current mood he will be very difficult to stop. A series of quick races may catch up with him in the end, but he is odds-against at around 5-4 and in his current mood it is hard to find an obvious danger among his eight rivals. La Bacouetteuse (3.25) was disappointing on faster ground last time out but would have a big chance on her previous form on soft, while at Kempton Park this evening, Summerghand (7.40) could be worth a small interest at around 10-1. David O’Meara’s colt did well to finish fifth in a well-run race at Redcar last time, remains on a fair mark based on his win at Yarmouth in August and was a winner on his only previous start on an artificial surface. Deadly Move (3.15), up only 3lb for a rallying success last time out, should go well again at Southwell, while Our Kylie (4.10) has been beaten only once in her last five starts over jumps, in a competitive race at Galway, and should improve her record to five out of six today.

That’s what happened when Cambridgeshire council commissioned Care Network Cambridgeshire to deliver a county-wide community navigator service. It sees volunteers acting as local points of contact and working with often isolated older people to identify what would support them, such as help around the home and assistance with benefits. Volunteers also assess what skills and interests older people have, to enable them to contribute to society. The service takes an asset-based approach by placing people’s skills, networks and community resources (their assets) alongside their needs to improve care and support. At first, it was obvious that local people wanted to be more involved in how their care and support was delivered, but it was clear that something was needed to make this happen. This led to the flourishing of community-based services and networks, such as befriending groups and social clubs. Over the past three months, Cambridgeshire’s adult social care department has seen a 30% reduction in level of need due to early interventions, such as by providing equipment, community support and less intrusive services. What is an asset-based approach? We know there is enormous untapped potential in every area of the country. It’s astounding to think that someone could have skills, knowledge and assets, but are isolated because they don’t have decent social connections. For example, 72-year-old Joshua was lonely after his wife died two years earlier. His social worker spoke with him and discovered that Joshua used to be a cook in the merchant navy – and soon he was volunteering in the canteen of a local social club. Our recent report suggests how asset-based approaches can thrive. In Wigan, for instance, the council created the Deal (pdf), which seeks to develop different kinds of conversations between public services and those who use them, based on building on people’s strengths and assets, with increased investment in the voluntary sector to make it happen. And York council is investing in local area coordination, a community-led model, which seeks to bring people together to identify their issues and to solve them with access to support. It is hoped that this approach will deliver fantastic outcomes and reduce demands on statutory services. Flexibility A key benefit is that each area of the country is different and so asset-based approaches cannot be imposed from above. By their very nature, they grow out of communities and it is important they are given the space and support to develop and succeed. There are, however, some common themes that all areas of the country can embrace, such as building a dynamic picture of personal and community assets. This could include taking an inventory of what can be drawn on. People such as Joshua should be known about, rather than simply stumbled on by luck. An asset-based approach can mean giving more power to neighbourhoods so that community groups can do the simple things, such as offering places to meet, or providing community development support. It can also be about more complex and important issues, such as giving local people a say on priority-setting and spending by local authorities – which we call co-production. They know their communities best and co-production means taking a fuller asset-based approach, even if it requires local authorities, health and other statutory organisations to hand over more power to communities. Building blocks Here are five things local areas can add to their “to do” list: Move the discussion away from people’s needs and towards communities’ assets, and build this into strategies and plans Build and update a map of personal and community assets Bring people and their assets together through peer support, local area coordination, care navigators and social prescribing, which involves primary care professionals referring people to a range of local, non-clinical services Create an environment for an asset-based approach to thrive, for example by commissioning more services to be delivered by small voluntary sector providers Monitor how your area is doing, and share your successes – as well as looking at how some of the challenges are being addressed For some further reading, Alex Fox from Shared Live Plus has written an excellent guide for Think Local Act Personal, describing 10 features of an “asset-based area” necessary for developing strong communities and sustainable public services. An asset-based approach can reduce social isolation and move people from dependence to independence. It’s time to use assets in communities to improve people’s lives. • Ewan King is director of business development and delivery at the Social Care Institute for Excellence Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

So what's holding me back?","bodyText":"I earned my PhD nine years ago. I took a full-time post in the Middle East for over four years because nothing else was available in Britain for someone newly qualified and without publications – and it was a wonderful experience. But I needed to come back to England for family reasons. Since then, my experience of trying to bag a full-time post in my own country – despite having published a book and four articles – has been demoralising to say the least. I have had to work on part-time, zero-hours contracts, and have moved from pillar to post, without the satisfaction of having any input into faculty decisions, or any say over the fate of myself or other casual staff. Nor have I had any formal teaching or management development, or any real engagement with the progress of my students through the years. Financially, this is ruining me, and I wonder what I’m going to do about a pension, since I suspect my contributions will not be enough to support me for five minutes. I find myself thinking about the huge disparity of opportunity that exists between men and women in academia. In 2015/16, 60,805 men were employed on permanent contracts compared to 39,330 of their female counterparts, according to the higher education statistics authority (Hesa), in spite of the fact that 45% of academic staff are female. While some young women worry that motherhood or perceptions that they might leave to have children hold them back, as a 50-year-old woman, I can say it does not get any easier as you get older to find a permanent job. According to Hesa, of the 27,600 women aged 50+ with academic contracts in Britain in 2015/16, only 4,090 of that age group work as lecturers or researchers on a fixed term contract. The equivalent figures for male staff aged 50+ is 39,615 and 4,075 respectively, meaning males have more opportunities in academia aged 50+ than their female rivals. I believe the reason behind the gender gap in academia is discrimination, perhaps an unconscious sexism perpetrated by recruitment committees. It’s anecdotal, but all the young men I used to visit conferences with when I was a PhD student have got permanent positions and are going up the ranks. At first, I thought this was down to the fact that I was permanently abroad in the early part of my career. Then I thought it was because I lacked sufficient publications. But this does not account for the fact that I still often can’t even get on to shortlists – in the last couple of years, not even for temporary positions. Overall, I suspect I’ve applied for literally hundreds of jobs. Discrimination is often multidimensional. I believe it’s not just my gender holding me back, but my age and class, too. I came from a non-academic background and attended a sink school in London. I worked for several years to save money to go to university. As the Social Mobility Commission has pointed out, access to the professions - and success once you get there - remains dominated by those from middle-class backgrounds. Despite the fact that I went to Russell Group universities, I believe that recruitment committees look at my age, and at the fact that I didn’t go straight to Oxbridge from a stellar school career, and cross me off their list. It often feels like academia is filled with brilliant and wealthy young folk who went to excellent schools and straight to the flagship universities. But to get to a position where I could compete for academic posts took a little longer for me. I’ve decided I can’t continue after nearly six years without a full-time income, and I’m not getting any younger. I’ve produced some very good peer-reviewed research, and have met some inspiring and supportive academics – in fact, some of the top academics in my field, who have acted as mentors and referees for my applications. But none of this seems to make any difference. The worst of it is the waste, and this is where resentment sets in. I feel I have so much to give students and so much I could be working on, but all this potential is just being squandered.I am aware that phrases such as “it is down to sexism” or “class discrimination” can be dismissed as unsubstantiated accusations. Nevertheless, there is something wrong in an industry that seems not to welcome people like me who have been around the block a few times, and who can really offer students the fruits of my experience. I love teaching and have proved popular with my students. And I’m passionate about widening access to higher education. I only hope some structural changes, both in the wider economy and concurrently in academia itself, might transform the opportunities for working-class women in my situation. But I feel that the changes required will come too late for me. Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

The news is a huge blow for Wales in particular, especially with so much resting on the Georgia and Ireland matches, and comes as a major disappointment to Bale, who was desperate to play for his country in two qualifiers that will determine whether Chris Coleman’s side have any chance of appearing at next summer’s finals. Bale discovered the extent of the injury on Monday after flagging up discomfort in his calf that was unrelated to the hamstring problem that troubled him during Real’s 3-1 win over Borussia Dortmund last week. He underwent a scan on the hamstring while in Spain but his club were happy for the 28-year-old to join up with the Wales squad, despite the fact that he missed Sunday’s game against Espanyol. Zinedine Zidane said afterwards that Bale had a “small complaint” but Madrid’s coach described the player as “fine” and suggested leaving him out was a precautionary measure. However, the calf problem that Bale mentioned after arriving in Cardiff prompted fresh concerns and led to Wales sending him for a scan on that area as well as the hamstring. It is understood that the results showed a tear within the calf muscle, meaning Bale had no chance of playing for Wales and faces the prospect of missing key games for Madrid, including the Champions League fixtures against Spurs on 17 October and 1 November. From Wales’s point of view, the timing could not be worse. They are second in Group D, one point ahead of Ireland with two games remaining. With Serbia expected to finish top of the group, Wales’s hopes of reaching Russia 2018 hang on pipping Ireland to the runners-up spot and securing a play-off berth by being one of the eight best second-placed teams – as things stand they are ninth. The two-leg play-offs take place from 9-14 November, a little more than five weeks from now. Bale should be available by then but is unlikely to have played much football in the lead-up. Before Wales can contemplate that scenario they need to negotiate a tricky away game on Friday against Georgia followed by Ireland’s visit on Monday. Bale’s absence leaves a huge hole to fill – Wales have won only eight out of 33 matches without him since his debut in 2006 – and Coleman must decide whether to start Ben Woodburn, the 17-year-old Liverpool forward who made such an impressive impact from the substitutes’ bench in the wins over Austria and Moldova last month, in his place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/03/nuclear-disarmament-dirty-word-tories-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T09:11:38Z","webTitle":"When did nuclear disarmament become such a dirty word for the Tories? | Emily Thornberry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/03/nuclear-disarmament-dirty-word-tories-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/03/nuclear-disarmament-dirty-word-tories-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"When did nuclear disarmament become such a dirty word for the Tories?","bodyText":"On this day, 65 years ago, near a remote island off the Australian west coast, a bomb was exploded in the hull of the empty navy frigate HMS Plym, its blast two-thirds more powerful than the one that destroyed Hiroshima. At that moment, Britain officially became the world’s third nuclear power. Both Winston Churchill, who authorised the test, and Clement Attlee, who initiated it, believed its true significance lay not in increasing Britain’s military capabilities, but in further deterring the threat of nuclear war between Russia and the west, and ultimately in eradicating that threat. Since that day in October 1952, 17 general elections have been held in Britain, and – while debates have often raged about a unilateral versus multilateral approach – the principle that the British government should always be working towards global disarmament has never seemed in doubt. Until now, that is. Theresa May’s manifesto earlier this year was only the third by a sitting government since Britain got the bomb that made no mention at all of nuclear proliferation and the importance of arms control. And – unlike the two others – she had no excuse. The previous exceptions to the rule were in February 1974, when Ted Heath tried to reduce his snap election to the single question “Who governs Britain?”; and 1997, when a fag-end Tory administration was barely going through the motions against New Labour. But in every other case, the prime minister and government of the day treated it as almost a moral responsibility to make clear their long-term commitment to disarmament, often alongside a statement of their short-term plans to retain and renew Britain’s nuclear arsenal. Take Harold Macmillan in 1955, declaring: “In the face of [the bomb’s] destructive power, any group of men would have to be not only bad, but mad, to unleash a war. We must not only abolish nuclear weapons, but also reduce armies and armaments to a point where no one state can threaten the peace. I shall never despair of finding by agreement solutions which will rid the world of fear.” Take Margaret Thatcher in 1983, who lambasted Labour’s unilateralist nuclear policy, but at the same time insisted that “every thinking man and woman wants to get rid of nuclear weapons”; and then, in 1987, set out detailed policies for the elimination or reduction of nuclear missile capabilities throughout the world, and claimed that “Britain is at the forefront of arms control negotiations”. Take John Major in 1992 and David Cameron in 2015, both speaking out strongly in their manifestos against the dangers of nuclear proliferation, and insisting that they would work with international allies to prevent more countries obtaining the bomb. So the question for the prime minister and her party is: “When did disarmament become such a dirty word?” Why are Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party now derided for advocating policies that Tory governments once considered perfectly commonplace? Theresa May cannot claim the circumstances are different. After all, Macmillan and Thatcher led the country through the most dangerous periods of the cold war; Major had to deal with the break-up of the Soviet Union and the fears over what would happen to its nuclear weapons; and Cameron was involved in the high-stakes negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme. They all recognised – as did Labour prime ministers of different eras – that the greater the threat of nuclear warfare facing the world, the more urgent the need became for all countries to tackle proliferation and make real progress on disarmament. Look at the situation today, especially this summer’s volatile and unresolved standoff between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, and it is clear that the threat of nuclear conflict is definitely no less severe than in previous decades, and is arguably at its highest level since the early 1980s. For past governments of all parties in Britain, that was the cue to step up their efforts on nuclear diplomacy, and commit to progress on disarmament. But from May, Boris Johnson and Michael Fallon, we hear the opposite, and the explanation is as depressing as it is straightforward. They know that Corbyn – along with me and others – is a long-standing proponent of disarmament. They know that this issue has caused tension in the Labour party over the past two years. And they therefore regard any discussion of nuclear weapons simply as a chance to misrepresent Labour as soft and divided on defence. In that context, the silence of the last Tory manifesto makes total sense; any commitment to make progress on arms control would have made it impossible for May’s attack dogs to tear holes in Labour for saying the same. So this most unprincipled of prime ministers chooses to ignore the issue of disarmament simply for short-term political gain, something no sitting government has done since that massive blast 65 years ago on HMS Plym. Perhaps she needs to reflect on why that 1952 test was staged as it was. Churchill’s scientists and engineers could have set off the A-bomb in any number of different ways, but they deliberately chose to simulate the effects of a bomb exploding aboard a boat approaching land. They did so because that scenario was one of the government’s greatest fears for how an atomic bomb might be deployed against Britain. In other words, their test simultaneously proved that we were a nuclear power, but also demonstrated our huge vulnerability to attack. And that paradox is why, at least up until now, every government since Churchill’s has believed that – whatever the arguments that nuclear weapons are a necessary short-term deterrent – the only long-term and absolute guarantee of safety is to eliminate them entirely from the planet. It should hardly be a surprise therefore for Labour’s leader to state that as his ambition, just as it was for Churchill, Macmillan, Thatcher, Major and Cameron. Indeed, the fact that Theresa May continues to attack Jeremy Corbyn for holding that principle is not just a massive departure from the standards of her postwar predecessors, but one of the many reasons she is not fit to stand in their – or his – company. • Emily Thornberry is the shadow foreign secretary"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/05/carla-bruni-french-touch-review-odd-detached-covers-plus-a-bit-of-mischief","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T21:15:34Z","webTitle":"Carla Bruni: French Touch review – odd, detached covers, plus a bit of mischief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/carla-bruni-french-touch-review-odd-detached-covers-plus-a-bit-of-mischief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/05/carla-bruni-french-touch-review-odd-detached-covers-plus-a-bit-of-mischief","fields":{"headline":"Carla Bruni: French Touch review – odd, detached covers, plus a bit of mischief","bodyText":"Although Carla Bruni is probably best known in the UK as the wife of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, the ex-supermodel has been a pop star in France for 20 years.

According to leaked documents, Bjarni Benediktsson, then an MP on the parliament’s economy and tax committee, sold several million króna of assets in the Glitnir bank’s fund in the final days and hours before an emergency law placed Iceland’s failed financial institutions under state control. The documents suggest Benediktsson, whose name appeared in the Panama Papers offshore scandal that toppled Iceland’s previous prime minister, talked to senior Glitnir executives on 6 October 2008, as the country’s banking bubble was on the point of bursting. While he denies any wrongdoing and the Guardian has seen no evidence he broke any laws, the revelations could be embarrassing: Benediktsson faces elections on 28 October after his coalition collapsed last month over an alleged attempt to cover up a scandal involving the prime minister’s father and a convicted child sex abuser. The leaked documents, seen by Icelandic investigative journalists and the Guardian, suggest he enjoyed a privileged relationship with Glitnir, close enough to raise questions about a possible conflict of interest between his roles as an MP and as one of the bank’s most valued clients. They also confirm that other members of the prime minister’s family – one of the richest and most powerful in the country – divested substantial assets in Glitnir’s Sjoður 9 fund in the run-up to the state takeover. Asked whether he had personally sold assets from the fund just before the bank’s collapse, Benediktsson said last year he had “some assets at one point” but “nothing that mattered”. The leaked documents show he had ISK165m (more than £1m at the time) in the fund in March 2008. The documents offer further evidence of the many, often opaque links between Iceland’s small but powerful political and business elite. Campaigners have long railed against what they describe as endemic cronyism in Icelandic politics and the apparent impunity of the country’s wealthy few. In early October 2008, the Glitnir, Kaupthing, and Landsbanki banks collapsed with liabilities of more than 11 times Iceland’s GDP, plunging the country into economic meltdown and a deep crisis from which it took years to recover: the Reykjavík stock market fell 97%, and the value of the króna halved. The leaked documents show Benediktsson withdrew an initial ISK30m (just under £200,000 at the time) from Glitnir’s Sjoður 9 fund on 2 October, four days before the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) took control of the bank, and employees of the bank gave instructions for a further ISK21m (£140,000) to be sold on 6 October. Benediktsson told the Guardian he had sold “most of my units but not all” in the fund, but did not give figures. He said all events and transactions leading up to the crash had been thoroughly, sometimes repeatedly, reviewed and investigated, and he had never been found at fault. “Markets and confidence were falling rapidly” after the fall of Lehman Brothers in mid-September, he said. “Any sensible investor would have been considering selling then.” He insisted he had no knowledge of, and took no part in, the preparation of the emergency law, which was not discussed in his committee. The documents also reveal that assets in the same fund belonging to Benediktsson’s uncle and worth just over ISK1bn were sold on 6 October, and suggest the MP was in telephone contact with Glitnir executives on that day. At 2.15pm, just hours before parliament enacted the emergency banking law, Einar Örn Olafsson, the head of Glitnir’s investment banking division, sent an email to the assistant of CEO Làrus Welding. “Bjarni Ben [Benediktsson] says the FSA are working hard on this right now,” it read. “Anyone contacting Jònas?” At the time, the head of the FSA – which hours later would take emergency control of Iceland’s banks and would soon place them in receivership, leading to heavy losses among foreign (including British) creditors – was Jònas Fr Jònsson. Benediktsson, 47, told the Guardian he “could have called” Olafsson that day but could not recall the conversation. “But in any case, I had no idea what was happening at the FSA. I had no confidential information during this period.” Known familiarly in Iceland as Bjarni Ben, Benediktsson is a member of the Engey family, one of Iceland’s wealthiest, who have been prominent political and business figures on the island for the past century. His father, Benedikt Sveinsson, and uncle Einar Sveinsson own or have owned major interests in banks and financial services firms as well as energy, transport, fisheries and trading companies, among others. The two brothers sold their shares in Glitnir for several billion kronur in 2007, and Benedikt Sveinsson sold his ISK260m assets in the Sjoður 9 fund on 27 August 2008, the documents show. The documents show Benediktsson, who was first elected to parliament in 2003, was a longstanding friend of Glitnir’s Olafsson, who founded the MP’s campaign organisation for Iceland’s 2007 elections. Emails show the pair travelled abroad together, for example to London, with Olafsson instructing Glitnir to book the hotel – the Sanderson – and ensuring the frequent flyer points were credited to Benediktsson. In September 2007, emails also show Bjarni Markússon, who handled Benediktsson’s private banking account at Glitnir, “taking care of” flights and a hotel in New York for the MP and his wife. The emails are addressed to the MP’s parliamentary email account. Another email confirms a meeting took place between Benediktsson and Welding, Glitnir’s chief executive, on 19 February 2008. Two days afterwards, the MP sold almost all his shares in the bank for ISK119m. Further records show he sold Sjoður 9 assets four days after a crisis meeting about Glitnir’s fast-deteriorating situation on 28 September to which – along with some other politicians – he had been invited by the bank’s chairman. Benediktsson’s name appeared in the Mossack Fonseca law firm’s Panama Papers leak last year in connection with Falson &amp; Co, a Seychelles-based company of which he once owned a third. He failed to declare the stake in the register of parliamentary interests and later said he had thought it was based in Luxembourg. His predecessor as prime minister, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, was the Panama Papers’ first major casualty. He was forced to step down amid mass protests against the revelations that his family had sheltered money offshore. Again, there was no evidence Gunnlaugsson broke any laws. But public fury at the hypocrisy of senior Icelandic politicians using offshore holdings to conceal sizeable assets during the financial crisis forced a snap election in October last year, and it was won by Benediktsson and his Independence party. After the crash, Glitnir’s winding-up board examined all last-minute sales from the bank’s Sjoður 9 fund for possible insider trading violations, but took no action. Creditors eventually received 85% of the 6 October value of their investments, meaning Benediktsson and his uncle saved around ISK1m by selling when they did. The FSA said last year it had concluded there was “a reasonable suspicion that certain parties” may have broken insider information laws in the Sjoður 9 sales, but Iceland’s special prosecutor – who has said insider information cases are notoriously hard to prove – also took no action. It could have been clear to informed investors by late September that Iceland’s banks were in serious trouble. From 29 September it was known that the government was considering refinancing Glintir. Instead, it decided to enact the emergency laws on 6 October. Benediktsson told the Guardian that after the crash he decided it was “not appropriate” to have both major business and political interests. “I sold my shares and equities, resigned all my board positions, and focused on my political career,” he said. He was elected leader of his party in March 2009. Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson of Stundin and Jóhannes Kr.

But not many. I don’t mind that; you don’t get bored talking about winning a World Cup for England. If anything, as I get older, I find myself growing more astonished to have been part of something that means so much to so many people. I don’t think that’s unusual: in any walk of life it’s only as the years pass that you start to appreciate the significance of what you achieved. It was a good afternoon. I scored a hat-trick, but it’s not false modesty to say I was fortunate. That squad didn’t need me in it to be world class. You had [Gordon] Banks, [Bobby] Moore, [Bobby] Charlton, [Jimmy] Greaves. Every one of those was unbelievable. I hadn’t been the best player at my school, let alone in the country, but I worked hard and had a good attitude. That’s what [England manager] Sir Alf Ramsey wanted in his players. The day itself is a series of moments to me now. The coach to the ground, quiet and contemplative; walking out at Wembley to a growing roar; the goals, obviously. My favourite was the first. It was a Moore free-kick dropped straight into where I was running. It was straight off the training ground. I can remember this photograph being taken. If you ask me how I was feeling, I can tell you in one word: tired. We’d been playing for two hours. We were all exhausted. You can see it in Ray Wilson’s face, he’s struggling to lift Moore there. I don’t know how I’m looking so fresh. What might also seem surprising is that when this was taken, I didn’t know what the score had been. I still didn’t know I’d scored a hat-trick. It’s sometimes assumed we paraded Bobby around like that. We didn’t. He was on our shoulders for only a few seconds – no more. It was just a spontaneous thing. It wasn’t for the camera, but I like that the moment was caught: it encapsulates the team’s camaraderie somehow. It captures how close knit we were as a group. The other thing I remember clearly feeling was relief. We wanted so badly to win and because West Germany had scored a last-minute goal to take the game to extra-time, there was a worry the momentum was theirs. So to get over the line, you can’t describe it… it’s more than you dare dream of as a footballer. There are only 22 of us in this country to have known that feeling – although I live in hope for the day there are more. The last goal – England’s fourth, my third – had come with the last kick. The ref blew the whistle pretty much as the ball hit the net. It was only when I was back in the dressing room afterwards I realised I wasn’t sure if it had counted. I wasn’t bothered either way; winning was what mattered. But I was curious to know. I remember putting my suit on and walking back down the tunnel. Wembley was quiet by then… the fans had all left. I got on to the pitch and was pretty much alone. I looked up at the scoreboard and, sure enough, it said 4-2. I remember thinking it was a job well done. • Are you in a notable photograph?

Architects working on the Ekaterinburg Arena have come up with a unique answer to the tricky question: how do you seat the Fifa-sanctioned minimum of 35,000 spectators when the stadium has a capacity of many thousands less? Simply build a stand outside. The change, which incorporates extra seating behind both goals, will allow the stadium to host four group games taking pace at the home of the Russian Premier League side FC Ural before being removed after the World Cup is over. The stadium was built in 1957 and is one of 12 venues across 11 cities which will be used in the 2018 World Cup. A Fifa spokesperson said: “In the case of Ekaterinburg, temporary seats are being installed in order to ensure that the renovation work would conserve the historical façade of the stadium and that maintenance costs are reduced after the Fifa World Cup.

The foreign secretary’s latest offence was to tell a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference that the Libyan city of Sirte could prosper, eventually becoming the next Dubai: “The only thing they have got to do is clear the dead bodies away,” he said, in that tone he reserves for a comic aside. Naturally, the remark elicited laughter. And so, once again, the morning news shows were talking about Johnson rather than the prime minister – even on the day of her big speech. Of course, this follows previous and more deliberate moves by Johnson to ensure all eyes are on him. In the last few weeks, we have been treated to his 4,200-word Brexit manifesto in the Telegraph, now functioning as an unashamed Johnson fanzine – its front-page report on his (rather middling) address to the conference came with a splash headline spanning all six columns hailing “the roaring lion” – as well as fully briefed reports of his “red lines” on Britain’s EU departure. Both those interventions looked like Johnson laying down the law to Theresa May – and therefore, according to the usual rules of the Westminster jungle, sacking offences. But his joke about the corpses of Sirte, described by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston as “crass, poorly judged and grossly insensitive”, offers much more straightforward grounds for dismissal. It touches directly on his ability to do his job. Indeed, it proves he cannot do it. Johnson is meant to be Britain’s chief diplomat, and this episode confirms that he lacks the human sensitivity that is a requirement of diplomacy. The very act of appointing a man involved in one of the most public, demonstrable and egregious lies of recent times – the bogus claim that Britain pays £350m a week to the EU – as foreign secretary was already an insult to the rest of the world. But retaining someone who clearly cares so little for the pain of others is untenable. Recall that just a few days ago, video emerged showing the UK ambassador to Myanmar having firmly to silence his boss, as Johnson mooched around a Buddhist temple, muttering to himself Rudyard Kipling’s colonial-era ode The Road to Mandalay – a verse bound to reawaken old hurts. Still, all the signals suggest that Johnson will stay in his post. May is too weak to remove him. She dare not risking exiling him to the backbenches, where he will play the Brexit martyr and become the focus of Europhobic dissent. Not that May is the real target of Johnson’s recent antics. No, the Telegraph essay and the red lines were designed less to undermine the PM than to stop a different rival in his tracks. The rival in question is Jacob Rees-Mogg. Johnson has clocked the absurd Moggmentum cult, watching as the Somerset MP has stepped into the niche that used to be his alone – that of conference darling, heroically sticking it to Brussels while other Tories tremble. Why, Mogg even offers the same shtick: Etonian accent, Latin tags, supposedly lovable Wodehousian eccentricity, sub-Churchillian evocation of the glorious past of this island race. The foreign secretary could not let his brand be grabbed by a competitor. So he’s been busy reasserting his claim on the hard Brexiter slice of the Tory market – decisive terrain, especially among the party members who will elect May’s successor. It’s almost been poignant to watch as Johnson waves his arms, seeking again the attention of the Tories who once adored him but have this week been queueing around the block to see Mogg. One colleague compares the Johnson display to a jealous toddler desperately doing somersaults, trying to win back the gaze of the adults now looking lovingly at his newborn brother. The trouble is, the old tricks don’t suit the job he’s got or the job he wants. His speech on Tuesday was a case in point. All politicians like to make the odd joke, but Johnson feels the need to keep them coming. (Surely that explains the Sirte gaffe: he just can’t pass up an easy laugh line.) The result is a kind of contamination effect. The gags don’t remain isolated but infect the rest until the whole speech becomes a joke. Even the serious bits sound like padding, the filler between punchlines. This is Johnson’s problem. He needs to show gravitas as foreign secretary and gravitas to be prime minister. But he seems temperamentally unable to do it for long. He keeps reverting to type, lapsing into the familiar routine. And that routine is getting old. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/06/the-glass-castle-review-woody-harrelson-naomi-watts-brie-larson","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"The Glass Castle review – treacly, tiresome family-in-peril drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/06/the-glass-castle-review-woody-harrelson-naomi-watts-brie-larson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/06/the-glass-castle-review-woody-harrelson-naomi-watts-brie-larson","fields":{"headline":"The Glass Castle review – treacly, tiresome family-in-peril drama","bodyText":"Woody Harrelson gives a performance of borderline unwatchable hamminess in this really tiresome film, which sentimentally neutralises parental abuse into a supposedly fascinating angel/devil split. Admittedly, this isn’t as purely insufferable as Viggo Mortensen in the comparably wince-inducing Captain Fantastic. But almost. A radioactive sentimentality oozes from the screen, although it is saved, just a little, by the robustness of Brie Larson’s presence. The film is based on a bestselling 2005 memoir by US columnist and author Jeannette Walls, about her anarchic upbringing at the hands of an alcoholic, bipolar dad, who always kept his bewildered wife and kids on the move, one step ahead of the debt collectors, rattling all across the country. He is Rex, a brilliant but feckless individual: free-thinker, scientist and engineer, entrancing his trusting and saucer-eyed children with his plans to build them a glass castle of his own design. But his whisky and indiscipline keeps them hungry and confused and often in danger from stove hobs etc. Harrelson plays him as a life-affirming wildman, glamorised as a rebel that you hate for his cruelty but of course can’t help loving for his adorable passion. Naomi Watts gets to play his dozy, feather-brained wife, and Larson plays his daughter Jeannette in disillusioned later years, an uptight and controlling career woman who has utterly rejected her dad’s anti-materialism in ways that are intended to suggest that maybe she’s kind of got it wrong and just needs to heal. The film is structured in such a way that you consent to an insidious balance: loathing and loving Rex before finally giving him the benefit of the doubt. A rigged game, as Rex himself occasionally rants, and a shallow, treacly piece of work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/05/schubert-der-einsame-cd-review-ilker-arcayurek-champs-hill","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T14:15:25Z","webTitle":"Schubert: Der Einsame CD review – Young tenor Ilker Arcayürek is in a class on his own","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/05/schubert-der-einsame-cd-review-ilker-arcayurek-champs-hill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/05/schubert-der-einsame-cd-review-ilker-arcayurek-champs-hill","fields":{"headline":"Schubert: Der Einsame CD review – Young tenor Ilker Arcayürek is in a class on his own","bodyText":"It’s been a while since we’ve had a debut disc as engaging as this.

Comparisons to Ian Bostridge are entirely appropriate, except that his poise will appeal to those who find Bostridge too fussy. The theme of his all-Schubert programme is solitude, but not only the undesired kind: the recluse of the title song is all good-humoured contentment; in Der Musensohn, Arcayürek’s swinging mini-crescendos and Simon Lepper’s skipping piano make solitary wandering sound like fun. But as the selection goes on, loneliness begins to bite, until resignation takes over. With Lepper offering consistently vivid support, Arcayurek spins long lines that are achingly sweet.

The men, aged between 33 and 38, were arrested as part of the National Crime Agency’s Operation Stovewood, an investigation into non-familial child sexual exploitation and abuse in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, between 1997 and 2013. The charges relate to the alleged sexual abuse of eight girls under the age of 16 between 1998 and 2003. The men will appear at Sheffield magistrates court on 24 October. The senior investigating officer, Paul Williamson, said a total of 21 men had now been charged with more than 94 child sexual abuse offences as part of Operation Stovewood, and he expected that number to increase as more complainants came forward. He said officers were investigating more than 80 suspects and were engaging with 235 complainants with the support of partner agencies. “Our focus is to bring lasting and worthwhile benefits for victims, helping to build better futures,” he said. “We will listen to their accounts and investigate allegations made to identify and bring offenders to justice. This focus has not wavered and we, along with our partners, will persist in our efforts to make Rotherham a hostile environment for child sex offenders.” The 12 men are: Amjal Rafiq, 38; Nabeel Kurshid, 34; Iqlak Yousaf, 33; Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar, 36; Tanweer Ali, 36; Aftab Hussain, 38; Abid Saddiq, 36; Sharaz Hussain, 33; and Salah Ahmed El-Hakam, 38, who have been charged with a total of 39 offences, and Mohammed Ashan, 33; Masaeud Malik, 33; and Waseem Khaliq, 33. The NCA has described Operation Stovewood as “the largest ever investigation into non-recent child sexual exploitation undertaken by law enforcement”, and says the complexity of its investigation is unparalleled. A report in the Times in 2012 claimed that gang rape and trafficking were widespread in Rotherham. A subsequent investigation by a former chief inspector of social work, Prof Alexis Jay, concluded in 2014 that failures of political and police leadership contributed to the sexual exploitation of 1,400 children in the town over 16 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/05/night-is-short-walk-on-girl-review-anime","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"The Night Is Short, Walk on Girl review – a hallucinogenic trip down a rabbit hole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/05/night-is-short-walk-on-girl-review-anime","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/05/night-is-short-walk-on-girl-review-anime","fields":{"headline":"The Night Is Short, Walk on Girl review – a hallucinogenic trip down a rabbit hole","bodyText":"Here is a weird, very bemusing and sometimes wonderful anime from Japan: a kind of miniaturist epic or odyssey from animator and director Masaaki Yuasa, adapted from a campus novel by Tomihiko Morimi – and evidently an extension or development of ideas from his earlier book The Tatami Galaxy. It is romantic and hallucinogenic, with an edge of softcore erotic sleaze. A female student with dark hair (voiced by Kana Hanazawa) goes down the rabbit hole for an all-night dreamlike adventure of drinking and partying. She is on a quest to discover a children’s book she once loved. She is also being pursued by an older student, Senpai (Gen Hoshino), who is in love with her, or at any rate sexually obsessed with her, and not only discovers the book but discovers her own childhood copy. He then occupies strange, kaleidoscope fantasies about how he might make her his own. It feels like Lewis Carroll or the Nighttown episode of Ulysses, and there is an interesting passage about what Yukio Mishima owes to Jules Verne and Alexandre Dumas.

She acknowledged her election campaign was “too scripted, too presidential” and allowed Labour to paint the Tories as the party of continuity. This was an implicit criticism of Lynton Crosby, who crafted the overarching “strong and stable” message, rather than her former adviser Nick Timothy, who was in charge of the disastrous manifesto. May also gave a direct apology to activists, something she had avoided several times previously. The passage was well received by the hall, which gave extended applause for her decision to start the speech by eating some humble pie. An independent review of mental health provision. The first new announcement of the speech was a promise to launch a review of how the NHS and other public services deal with people suffering mental health problems. She has asked Prof Sir Simon Wessely to review the Mental Health Act with a view to updating the law. This is part of May’s promise to deal with “burning injustices” and inequality in how people of different races are treated, as she tries to turn the focus on to her domestic agenda and away from Brexit. The prime minister claimed repeatedly: “That’s what I’m in this for,” which appeared to be an attempt to show she is still motivated and has clear policy goals after the personal disappointment of the election result. No new detail on Brexit. The Florence speech last week was intended to deal with developments on Brexit, revealing new information about how she sees the transition period. She spent just 10 paragraphs in this conference speech on issues of leaving the European Union, merely repeating promises about a new “deep and special partnership” and reassurances for EU citizens that a deal on their rights will be reached. It was a sign that May really wants to emphasise her domestic agenda and fight against the inevitability that her premiership will be engulfed by Brexit. New council homes and more housebuilding. A major theme of May’s speech was the promise of a “British dream” for young people, strongly echoing Ed Miliband’s promise in 2014 to help them fulfil the “British dream” of home ownership. The big announcement was that May will meet the Conservative manifesto promise to renew the building of council and social housing, making £2bn available. Councils and housing associations will be able to bid for the money and provide certainty over future rent levels, with some homes being built for social rent below market levels. This added to earlier announcements at the party conference by Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, that he would extend help to buy and give more protection to tenants. There is a risk though that these measures will be seen as insufficient compared with Labour’s promise to build a million homes, of which half would be council houses. A cap on energy bills. May promised to end “rip-off energy prices” with a new cap on bills, fulfilling a manifesto promise that looked set to be watered down. There was very little detail in the speech though about how many people the cap will cover and whether it will be an absolute cap or a limit on rises. This is another policy that straightforwardly copies Miliband, who was mocked by the Tories for returning to marxism when he unveiled a two-year energy price freeze before the last election. It also showed May and the business secretary, Greg Clark, have seen off objections from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and Javid. Review of student university fees and loans. May confirmed the review of university funding and student financing that was briefed to the newspapers over the weekend, along with a freeze in the cap on tuition fees at £9,250 and a higher earnings repayment threshold of £25,000. This is the second policy aimed at attracting young people, after under-30s voted for Labour in their droves at the 8 June election. But, like the housing policy, there is a danger that it does not look like sufficiently bold or decisive action to turn around the Conservatives’ fortunes with younger people. Party unity. May did not make any direct digs at Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who has made the last few weeks difficult for the prime minister by undermining her Brexit policy in public. But she did issue a plea for unity and called on her party to “shape up”, saying most people paid little attention to gossip in the corridors of Westminster and just wanted politicians to focus on protecting the jobs of working people. She did make one joke at George Osborne’s expense about not being an “ice maiden”, despite his reported comment about chopping her up to put in his freezer. But otherwise she took a conciliatory tone towards the former chancellor, praising the “northern powerhouse”, and defending the economic record of David Cameron’s coalition. The tone went down well with the conference audience, who gave her multiple standing ovations – sometimes to give her time to recover from repeated coughing fits. The biggest applause of all was for her claim that the “test of a leader is how you respond when tough times come upon you”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/04/king-arthur-review-barbican-london-daisy-evans-dryden-purcell","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T14:25:24Z","webTitle":"King Arthur review – home truths with Purcell transposed to the age of Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/04/king-arthur-review-barbican-london-daisy-evans-dryden-purcell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/04/king-arthur-review-barbican-london-daisy-evans-dryden-purcell","fields":{"headline":"King Arthur review – home truths with Purcell transposed to the age of Brexit","bodyText":"Purcell’s King Arthur has long been a problematic work. It’s not quite an opera, not quite a play; the singing characters are bit parts, the story is one that only a devoted Arthurian scholar will recognise. Purcell’s music is incidental to a vast and largely forgettable text by Dryden. Most modern performances adapt both drama and words, but it takes a director as determined as Daisy Evans to offer a rewriting as bold as this: a reflection on national identity – King Arthur in the age of Brexit. Some numbers slotted easily into Evans’s conception, not least the climactic aria Fairest Isle, captivatingly sung by soprano Louise Alder as she stood on a chair next to Richard Egarr’s harpsichord. All the action happened around the players of the Academy of Ancient Music, whom Egarr led through a buoyant, dynamic performance: nothing was lacking on the musical side. But anyone wanting a coherent narrative had no more luck than they would have had with Dryden’s original, or indeed with the whole sorry Brexit saga itself. The beginning had the dozen-strong chorus and six soloists, in anonymous modern dress, arriving on stage through the auditorium and joining in the refrains of an excerpt from Ali Smith’s novel Autumn, describing the morning after the referendum. This group of anxious, drifting people grouped and regrouped in various settings as indicated by posters at the sides – a polling station, a pub – with coloured tags around their necks reflecting shifting allegiances. Ashley Riches sang the Cold Genius’s aria from the floor of a homeless shelter; the Sirens, Alder and Mhairi Lawson, were on the pull in a nightclub. Most of the texts were delivered by the actor Ray Fearon – a charismatic focal point, although when he relied on his crib sheet he could resemble a cocky academic delivering a paper. Additional excerpts by Blake, Rose Macaulay, Shakespeare, Wisława Szymborska and others each offered food for thought. But once the music began, Dryden’s words rarely advanced these thoughts any further. At least Fairest Isle offered the uncomfortable topicality Evans was looking for. Is this still how you feel about your country, it seemed to ask, given that Cupid’s job of removing care and envy only gets harder, and Venus won’t get to choose her dwelling without five years’ previous residency? Elsewhere, though, the Brexit angle seemed something on which to hang Purcell’s music – no more and no less."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/08/kelela-take-me-apart-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-08T08:00:45Z","webTitle":"Kelela: Take Me Apart review – sultry, shape-shifting R&B","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/08/kelela-take-me-apart-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/08/kelela-take-me-apart-review","fields":{"headline":"Kelela: Take Me Apart review – sultry, shape-shifting R&B","bodyText":"Can one successfully rewind and fast-forward at the same time? Kelela, it seems, is a dab hand at it. Over the course of one celebrated mixtape, 2013’s Cut 4 Me, a 2015 EP, Hallucinogen, and, now, her long-awaited debut album, one of the most arresting new voices in R&amp;B has created a deft stitch in time, laying 90s R&amp;B vocals over cutting-edge digital production techniques. If that summary seems reductionist or formulaic, it shouldn’t: Take Me Apart is a very spacious operation in which the 34-year-old ponders love, lust and hurt as soundbeds break down around her. LMK, the lead track, is Kelela’s most accessible case in point. As hyper-modern come-hither, it finds Kelela propositioning someone. “No one’s tryna settle down,” she breathes, “all you gotta do is let me know.” A pretty keyboard twinkle and some throwback handclap beats become wedded to doomy resonances, courtesy of producer Jam City, who throws in fast-forwarding audio tape squeak for good measure. Half a dozen Kelelas weigh in, on ecstatic “oh”s, little half-spoken raps, on FKA twigs-like high notes. The no-strings hook-up is a standard trope of pop music, but Kelela is nobody’s disposable night friend. Since then, a nagging break-up song called Frontline has featured even more cinematic sounds – lighter clicks, inhales, car key fob beeps (Jam City again). Kelela’s sing-song vocals play off against echoey, late-night skitters. As engrossing as those tunes are, the title track still manages to surprise you. Again, Kelela reels you in with naturalistic vocals. The chorus then jumps you, resonant beat-shrapnel assaulting the track; you want to duck for cover and turn it up at the same time. Over the course of 14 tracks, Take Me Apart faintly recalls the 90s work of Timbaland and Aaliyah, or Timbaland and Destiny’s Child, when ideas about what mainstream R&amp;B would allow were upended. An icy, small-hours feel means the Weeknd is an inevitable contemporary comparison. To generalise: up top, Kelela’s melodic coos are silken, layered and vulnerable, cleaving to song forms that traditionalists would recognise. Down below, the electronics range far and wide – more assured now than on Cut 4 Me. Trap beats rub up against menacing bass music with UK roots, making this Washington-raised, LA-based musician something of a shape-shifting nomad (her own roots are Ethiopian). In this mix are other returnees such as Arca – Alejandro Ghersi, the London-based producer whose avant-garde digitals fill his own albums and Björk’s. Perhaps less well known is the input of producer Ariel Rechtshaid (Haim, Charli XCX), and the xx’s Romy Madley Croft. The next candidate for a disruptive single might be the atmospheric Blue Light, another headphone feast in which two notionally opposite boxes are ticked: sultriness and instability. Or maybe Onanon, where Kelela’s swing comes untethered from an increasingly inconstant, Doppler-effect beat. These are unanchored R&amp;B songs for unmoored times, with Kelela’s alluring vocals holding fast, front and centre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"careers/2017/oct/06/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-before-you-became-my-manager-i-loved-my-job","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'Before you became my manager, I loved my job'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/oct/06/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-before-you-became-my-manager-i-loved-my-job","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/2017/oct/06/what-i-wish-i-could-tell-my-boss-before-you-became-my-manager-i-loved-my-job","fields":{"headline":"What I wish I could tell my boss: 'Before you became my manager, I loved my job'","bodyText":"Before you became my manager, I loved my job. My old boss was excellent – nurturing, efficient and kind. But because of personal circumstances she had to leave, and so you became our micromanager. I discovered later that you were appointed because you were the “sweet, pretty blonde one”. Looks are deceiving: in reality you were a megalomaniac who micromanaged everybody in our department. Once, at your request, I was asked to create a display in the main entrance, ready for our Ofsted inspection. I spent two weeks on that display: making slogans, creating word puzzles and finding images. Then you were not happy with it and it was torn down. You said it wasn’t “exactly what you asked for” – so two other tutors were forced to spend Friday night until after midnight working on another display before Ofsted came in on Monday morning. Team meetings that you organised went on for 3-4 hours, often without any reason for the discussion. You would often arrive an hour late or not bother to turn up at all. Annual job appraisals were also forgotten: I clearly remember sitting waiting in a room for 45 minutes for my job appraisal. Eventually I went home. There was no email of apology, nor a rescheduling of the meeting – I simply did not have an appraisal for the following three years. We used to be responsible for covering each other’s classes when someone was ill. This all changed when you arrived – if we needed to attend a medical appointment we had to ask permission and you would arrange cover. Only you didn’t. It became routine that you telephoned one of us at 11pm to cover a class at 9am the next morning. Your behaviour made me and my colleagues so depressed that we felt like we were the failures. You were very good at carrying on as if nothing had happened, and no-one felt able to tackle you directly. Eventually, I made an official complaint about you. Although you were spoken to, it didn’t have any effect. You seemed to breeze through life without any idea of the impact your unprofessional attitude had on other people. The day I left was a huge relief. There was thankfully no party or night out with you. My teaching colleagues did arrange a small get together, but you were not invited. I wish I had told you what an arrogant, selfish, unprofessional and incompetent manager you were, but at the time I had neither the courage nor the strength – I was so ground down by you. I have never regretted leaving, although I did regret leaving my students. After working for you, my confidence was dented – but slowly, I regained belief in my abilities. I now have my own private tutoring business. It is thriving – and I am helping people of all ages from primary, secondary and adult education.

They say that if you see the model buildings from the sky they are in the shape of Korea – both Koreas – because their biggest desire, always, is reunification. They don’t talk “South” and “North”. Tourists are allowed to go there, but it’s so obscure there was hardly anyone around. The park might now be permanently closed because Jang Song-thaek [the uncle of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un] was executed. He was taking care of it before he died. It’s sort of his legacy, so they might tear it down. They had a prehistoric part, a Middle Ages section and a bronze age section, then at the end they had a modern area with this model of Pyongyang’s Grand People’s Study House. Because the place was really empty I wondered if it would be a wasted trip, then all of a sudden a wedding procession came by. I wanted to take a photo of the bride and groom, but was told: “No, no, he’s a soldier.” Then I saw a lady with a big pink hat in the distance. She said yes to a photo, so I asked her to stand in front of the model building. Before I could ready the camera she looked back, saw the leaders’ portraits on the side of the model and said: “I cannot be higher than the leaders.” So I asked, “What if you kneel down?” She knelt and I finally took the photo. It was with a flash because it was midday and really disgusting natural light, but in the end it turned out to be my favourite shot from Pyongyang. She was so confident and classy. A little lipstick, a scarf – everyone looks so special there, like a Wes Anderson movie. In fact, the best part of the trip was seeing that there are real people everywhere. They want their kids to go to school, they want to have a good partner, they want to live in an apartment. No one tried to brainwash me and nobody there really hates Americans, they just try to survive in the environment they are in. You can’t judge them by their leader – they are no different to anyone else in the world. It was 2014 and I was in North Korea for a project called 3DPRK, which ended up being the first photo exhibition by a foreigner to be shown in Pyongyang. The idea was to shoot as many intimate portraits of normal people that I could. We packaged the concept as “photos of tourist spots, promoting tourism”. The guys from Koryo Tours, the company I collaborated with on the project. We would go for a tour, meet officials, say, “Oh, it would be cool if we could do something”, go home, come back and so on. It took eight months of that to get my trip approved. Usually most of the photos you see from North Korea are stolen shots or soldiers in parades, which is what tourists and journalists can get on tightly controlled tours. My tour was different – we had a little van and we travelled all over the country. I was there for 10 days with Vicky Mohieddeen, who worked for Koryo Tours and made a behind-the-scenes video, plus two North Korean translators/minders/tour guides, and our driver. I had a really good rapport with the guides – we got drunk together and talked about families, relationships, sex – but there were three main rules: don’t photograph army personnel, don’t shoot construction sites, and don’t crop statues and pictures of the leaders. Every night they had to report what I was doing. Despite this, they didn’t check a single shot – no one did, at any point. The guides always emphasised how many times each leader had visited a site, how fast it was built, how great it was. I was just nodding, nodding, nodding, while looking around for everyday people to shoot. It was part of the game: I had to be respectful and interested, which I was. I played my game and they played theirs. Matjaž Tančič’s CV Born: 1982, Ljubljana, Slovenia. Trained: Self-trained, and at the University of the Arts, London.

The new research unit will aim “to help technologists put ethics into practice, and to help society anticipate and direct the impact of AI so that it works for the benefit of all”, according to the company, which hit headlines in 2016 for building the first machine to beat a world champion at the ancient Asian board game Go.The company is bringing in external advisers from academia and the charitable sector, including Columbia development professor Jeffrey Sachs, Oxford AI professor Nick Bostrom, and climate change campaigner Christiana Figueres to advise the unit. “These Fellows are important not only for the expertise that they bring but for the diversity of thought they represent,” said the unit’s co-leads, Verity Harding and Sean Legassick, in a blogpost announcing its creation. The unit, called DeepMind Ethics and Society, is not the AI Ethics Board that DeepMind was promised when it agreed to be acquired by Google in 2014. That board, which was convened by January 2016, was supposed to oversee all of the company’s AI research, but nothing has been heard of it in the three-and-a-half years since the acquisition. It remains a mystery who is on it, what they discuss, or even whether it has officially met. DeepMind Ethics and Society is also not the same as DeepMind Health’s Independent Review Panel, a third body set up by the company to provide ethical oversight - in this case, of its specific operations in healthcare. DeepMind provides services to a number of UK hospitals, including its Streams app, which aims to bring modern mobile-first communications into the NHS, as well as a number of AI-focused research projects looking at using machine learning to help diagnose visual problems and treat cancer. The review panel has met several times, and produced its first annual report in July 2017, a few days after DeepMind’s NHS partner the Royal Free received a slap on the wrist from the Information Commissioner’s Office for improper data transfers. Nor is the new research unit the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, an external group founded in part by DeepMind and chaired by the company’s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. That partnership, which was also co-founded by Facebook, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft, exists to “conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open licence in areas such as ethics, fairness and inclusivity”. Nonetheless, its creation is the hallmark of a change in attitude from DeepMind over the past year, which has seen the company reassess its previously closed and secretive outlook. It is still battling a wave of bad publicity started when it partnered with the Royal Free in secret, bringing the app Streams to active use in the London hospital without being open to the public about what data was being shared and how. The research unit also reflects an urgency on the part of many AI practitioners to get ahead of growing concerns on the part of the public about how the new technology will shape the world around us. Some technology leaders, such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, have led discussion about the potentially disastrous effect of super-intelligent AI. Other experts are more concerned about the near-term risk of outsourcing ever more complex and serious decisions to systems whose operation we still do not fully understand, yet which seem to be susceptible to embodying the worst of humanity’s pre-existing biases and prejudices. One pair of researchers, Ryan Calo and Kate Crawford, approvingly cited by DeepMind, wrote in the publication Nature: “Autonomous systems are already deployed in our most crucial social institutions, from hospitals to courtrooms. Yet there are no agreed methods to assess the sustained effects of such applications on human populations.” Designers and researchers, Calo and Crawford wrote, “need to assess the impact of technologies on their social, cultural and political settings.” Elon Musk leads 116 experts calling for outright ban of killer robots"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/05/grand-final-solo-tries-rickie-lamberts-southampton-goals-and-baseball-pain","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T09:00:19Z","webTitle":"Grand Final solo tries, racing run-in drama and inexplicable celebrations | Classic YouTube","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/05/grand-final-solo-tries-rickie-lamberts-southampton-goals-and-baseball-pain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/05/grand-final-solo-tries-rickie-lamberts-southampton-goals-and-baseball-pain","fields":{"headline":"Grand Final solo tries, racing run-in drama and inexplicable celebrations","bodyText":"1) It’s the Super League Grand Final this weekend between Castleford Tigers and Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford.

Certainly, looking at the pained expressions of many in the hall, they did not. Bring me a general who is lucky, said Napoleon. She isn’t that. There were two microphones protruding from the lectern. Perhaps, out of view, there was a reset button too. Because a seismic reset was how she sought to save her career and salvage her reputation. She tried, hampered by a nagging throat tickle, to reinvent herself under the umbrella of a purloined concept, “renewing the British dream”, casting herself as an upwardly mobile embodiment of it, the granddaughter of a below-stairs domestic servant. She boasted of socially liberal credentials. The facilitator of Hillsborough justice and a hearing for child abuse victims, a campaigner for racial justice, a champion for the Grenfell Tower tenants she initially declined to meet.

The provider of homes to those who need them. May’s problem now is not so much with her script. She began her ill-fated tenure with a pretty brilliant script on the steps of Downing Street. Today, reprising those one-nation Tory themes again, she said it “still holds”. Brexit aside, it’s probably the right Tory script for the times. The problem is that no one alongside her or among the viewing public now sees her as befitting leading role status. She barely leads her party. That is the context against which too many will measure her speech. The British dream feels out of reach for many, she said. Her own dream died some time ago. Today’s ordeal will not revive it. Gaby Hinsliff: This was May’s ‘fainting Hillary Clinton’ moment By the end, you half expected someone to rush on and wrap her in a silver foil blanket, like a marathon runner half-dead with exhaustion. But at least May made the finish line, when at times during this extraordinary performance one wondered if she even could. It’s unfair, obviously, as anyone can get a croaky voice. But the metaphors would write themselves even if the speech wasn’t all about persevering in adversity. May cut a fragile figure in Manchester. The gossip is all about how brittle she is in private, how much others have to hold things together. She needed to demonstrate a point to her continued existence in Downing Street but a speech that ticked some of those boxes will now be overshadowed by the unfortunate drama of its delivery. She opened well with a much-needed mea culpa about an election campaign that was “too scripted, too presidential”, too redolent of continuity not change, and she was sorry. Conservatives, who are hot on manners, will appreciate that apology. Then came a reminder of the occasionally radical things she did as home secretary, although it served mainly to remind one that she has done nothing this bold since becoming prime minister. But then disaster struck. First, the ambush, by a man proffering a P45, a staggering security breach. Next came that fatal frog in the throat. On the plus side, at least she didn’t look robotic, even managing some ad-libbed jokes at her own expense. But it was the understatedly British equivalent of that time Hillary Clinton fainted on the campaign trail. May recovered, to some extent. The promise of a new £2bn fund allowing councils to build cheap homes for rent as well as sale recognises a sea change among urban Tories, fearing extinction if under-40s can’t get on the housing ladder. Together with the promised price cap on energy bills, this was a tacit acceptance that the market cannot always provide – a revolution of sorts for Tories, although the contradictions between this and her defence of free markets remains unresolved. However, the two truths evident at the beginning of this conference – that she looks weak, but the alternatives look worse – remain true. Little has changed. And no change isn’t quite enough. Matthew d’Ancona: Strong and stable, but also too little, too late For the want of linctus, a speech was lost. Well, not quite. If ever there was a triumph of form over content, it was this extraordinary address, interrupted as it was by the supposedly comic presentation of a P45 and, more horribly, by a crippling cough. Often, the words were completely eclipsed by the toe-curling spectacle. Cue a thousand jokes about Theresa May “losing her voice”. Yet the resolve the prime minister displayed in sticking it out, staying the course and risking total humiliation was also completely compelling. Never has she delivered such a personal speech – opening with the moment she joined the party 40 years ago, referring to her diabetes, lamenting the fact that she has no children, mourning Alexander Paul, the young man whose remarkable intervention at the Tory conference in 2014 inspired her crackdown as home secretary on racial bias in the use of stop-and-search powers. For the Tories’ election fiasco, she took the rap unambiguously and declared herself “sorry”. The binding theme of the “British dream” was both vague and nothing new – Michael Howard tried something similar and Ed Miliband’s “Promise of Britain” was not so different. But it was good to hear May revive the spirit of her speech when she entered Downing Street last year, attacking bigotry in all its forms, the inadequacy of mental health provision, the structural failures that led to the Grenfell Tower tragedy. It was no accident that she invoked Benjamin Disraeli, as well as Jo Cox. There was a pleasing eclecticism to this speech that has been all too absent from most of her rhetoric. In her moment of greatest frailty, May revealed a humanity and robustness that did her credit. She proved herself, in the truest sense, strong and stable. A shame for her that it is all far, far too late. Kate Maltby: Honourable, but hypocritical The coughing fit; the attention-seeking comedian; the attention-seeking foreign secretary. There are plenty of reasons why this will be a day Theresa May prefers to forget. Some will admire her for soldiering on. Some may even pity her – a disaster for a leader, especially a woman. But though none could have anticipated the slings and arrows thrown Theresa May’s way in the Manchester Central conference hall, a Boris Johnson or a Tony Blair would have responded with flair. May’s dogged determination to stick to her script will only entrench her “Maybot” reputation. In the closing moments, she read: “The test of a leader is how you respond when tough times come upon you.” It was a golden opportunity to make light of it all – but that’s not in the Maybot’s programming. There was much here to remind us of May at her most honourable. Three years ago, Alexander Paul was her conference guest and he confronted the membership in his speech with a young black man’s experience of being stopped and searched regularly by police. May’s commitment to confronting racism in the police was real – her tribute to Paul will resonate with all of us who remember him. When she announced that the number of black people being stopped and searched had fallen by two-thirds, she will have done so with personal pride. But you can’t promise “a more open, global Britain”, when you are still remembered as the architect of “Go Home” vans and the woman who referred to “citizens of nowhere”. If anything, this was a reminder of the effective reformer she could have been – against the tragedy of the flailing authoritarian she has become. Other Tory ministers who privately assert their liberal values, while enforcing May’s anti-immigrant agenda in public, would do well to learn from her mistake. Abi Wilkinson: Anything good was cribbed from Labour and the Liberal Democrats After getting off to a reasonable start, May’s speech quickly became excruciating. The P45 incident marked the beginning of a descent into chaos. When her voice started dying, leaving her coughing and spluttering as she struggled to finish her sentences, it felt allegorical. The audience attempted to support her – bursting into unconvincing applause whenever they sensed she needed a moment to clear her throat – but no party wants to be pitied. When even your political opponents are rooting for you to pull yourself together, because it’s just too agonising to watch, it’s game over. For this reason, it was difficult to pay too much attention to the actual content of the speech. There were a few decent policy announcements, mainly cribbed from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but there’s no reason to assume she’ll be in power long enough to follow through on them. Even if she does cling on, there’s no guarantee she’ll stick to her word. Most confusing was the re-commitment to an energy price cap – a watered-down Ed Miliband policy she previously poached and then rapidly U-turned on, before another reverse back to the original position. Though I’m sceptical about her commitment, May’s promise to build more social housing was a big deal – even if it is only 5,000 new homes a year. It’s a significant departure from housing policy under David Cameron, and is effectively an admission that, on one of the biggest issues currently facing our country, Labour is right. The Tories are clearly panicking about their lack of appeal to younger voters, but this sort of half-hearted copying only makes Jeremy Corbyn’s full-blooded social democracy seem more appealing – and more of an agenda-setter. Overall, it was an appropriate end to a conference that has presented the Conservatives as desperate, flailing and intellectually bankrupt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/30/hong-kong-universities-a-new-battleground-in-independence-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T06:10:43Z","webTitle":"Hong Kong universities a new battleground in independence debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/30/hong-kong-universities-a-new-battleground-in-independence-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/30/hong-kong-universities-a-new-battleground-in-independence-debate","fields":{"headline":"Hong Kong universities a new battleground in independence debate","bodyText":"When a handful of students decided to express an opinion on a university campus bulletin board in Hong Kong, they never imagined the backlash that would follow. What began with a few posters emblazoned with a radical idea, that Hong Kong should split with China and become independent, eventually engulfed the entire political and academic establishment in the latest clash over shrinking freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. Student representatives at the Chinese University of Hong Kong faced off last month with mainland classmates who screamed their opposition to the political signs and attempted to cover them, while middle-aged pro-China protesters shouted they were nothing more than “British dogs”. In response to the three-week confrontation, the heads of all 10 universities in Hong Kong penned a joint statement saying “freedom of expression is not absolute” and described calls for independence as “abuses”. During an interview at the school’s Benjamin Franklin Centre, named after the American revolutionary who advocated for independence from the UK, the president of the student union, 20-year-old Justin Au, said: “Universities are one of the last fortresses for defending ideas, they are supposed to be open for all kinds of opinions no matter what you believe. “Absolute obedience to authority does not help society, so it’s important we maintain freedom of speech at the university.” One of the signatories of the letter condemning the students was Peter Mathieson, the current vice-chancellor of the University of Hong Kong, who is due to take up the same post at the University of Edinburgh next year. Chinese University’s vice-chancellor said any banners or posters advocating independence would be removed. The row marks the latest example of Beijing’s creeping influence in the former British colony, and the confrontation quickly spread beyond the borders of academia. The city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said “there is no room for any discussion on the independence of Hong Kong” and backed university leadership in its plan to tear down independence posters. Her comments echoed a speech by China’s president Xi Jinping, who said during a visit in July any challenge to Beijing’s sovereignty over the city “crosses a red line”. Junius Ho, an MP in the city’s legislature, said pro-independence activists should be “killed mercilessly” at a rally condemning the movement, while a former education secretary and current member for the University of Hong Kong’s governing council called them losers. Amid the swift backlash, students at universities in Hong Kong fear basic freedoms are under attack and expect academic freedom will only deteriorate. “Whether you support independence or not, you have to support freedom of speech,” said Thomas Lee, 24, the student union secretary at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “We have to fight back, we have to stand up, we can’t just accept this silently.” Lee quoted the poem “First they came … ” by the German pastor Martin Niemöller which describes the failure of ordinary Germans to act in the face of Nazi persecution. Lee and Au said they do not support independence, but both believe it is a option that deserves to be discussed and debated. Hong Kong has a small but increasingly vocal independence movement that has become more pronounced in the wake of 11 weeks of street protests in 2014. Those demonstrations, dubbed the Umbrella Movement, ultimately failed to secure any concessions from the government on political reform. An opinion poll published in June showed a little over 11% supported eventual independence for Hong Kong. The same study found people in Hong Kong overwhelmingly oppose being directly governed by China. Mainland Chinese students studying in Hong Kong have taken a hard line against their fellow classmate who they claim are proposing ideas that are illegal and dangerous. “Hong Kong will always be a part of China and it’s offensive to try to tear our country apart,” said a mainland student who would only give his name as Billy. “Hong Kong people need better political education, they should support the country and the Communist party.” Meanwhile, professors worry apparatchiks will one day dictate what can and cannot be taught in their classrooms. “There is real fear that the government will use the talk of independence to restrict academic freedoms on campus more broadly,” said Willy Lam, a politics professor at the Chinese University. “Things will definitely get worse, Hong Kong’s leaders have been told by the Chinese government to crack down on what Beijing sees as threats to national security, which means incriminating any talk of Hong Kong independence. “The campus has become a venue for Cultural Revolution-style political struggle,” he added, referring to a decade of political upheaval in China starting in 1966. Lam warned crackdowns on political speech would only exacerbate tensions between the authorities and the city’s youth, already increasingly radical after years of government failures to address their concerns. For Hong Kong students graduating in a city with astronomical rents and shrinking job prospects, change feels necessary. “The current system isn’t working right now,” Lee said. “We have to discuss alternatives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2017/oct/04/antikythera-shipwreck-yields-new-treasures-and-hints-of-priceless-classical-statues","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T11:56:49Z","webTitle":"Antikythera shipwreck yields bronze arm – and hints at spectacular haul of statues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/04/antikythera-shipwreck-yields-new-treasures-and-hints-of-priceless-classical-statues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2017/oct/04/antikythera-shipwreck-yields-new-treasures-and-hints-of-priceless-classical-statues","fields":{"headline":"Antikythera shipwreck yields bronze arm – and hints at spectacular haul of statues","bodyText":"Marine archaeologists have recovered a bronze arm from an ancient shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, where the remains of at least seven more priceless statues from the classical world are believed to lie buried. Divers found the right arm, encrusted and stained green, under half a metre of sediment on the boulder-strewn slope where the ship and its cargo now rest. The huge vessel, perhaps 50m from bow to stern, was sailing from Asia Minor to Rome in 1BC when it foundered near the tiny island between Crete and the Peloponnese. The project team, from the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities and Lund University in Sweden, discovered the buried arm with a bespoke underwater metal detector which has revealed the presence of other large metal objects nearby under the seabed. “There should be at least seven statues,” Alexandros Sotiriou, a Greek technical diver on the team told the Guardian. The operation is overseen by Ageliki Simosi, director of the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, which is responsible for all underwater archaeology in Greece. “What we’re finding is these sculptures are in among and under the boulders,” said Brendan Foley, co-director of the excavations team at Lund University. “We think it means a minimum of seven, and potentially nine, bronze sculptures still waiting for us down there.” The boulders that overlie the metal objects weigh several tonnes and may have tumbled onto the wreck during a massive earthquake that shook Antikythera and surrounding islands in the 4th century AD. The bronze arm, probably from a statue of a male, is the highlight of the team’s 2017 excavation season. Among other objects the divers recovered are a patterned slab of red marble the size of a tea tray, a silver tankard, sections of joined wood from the ship’s frame, and a human bone. Last year, the team found the skull, teeth, ribs and other bones of an individual who perished on the wreck. They have since extracted DNA from the skull and from it learned the individual’s sex and where they came from. Until those results are published, the person is known as Pamphilos after divers found the name, meaning “friend of all”, carved on a buried cup that had been decorated with an erotic scene. The Antikythera wreck first came to light in 1900 when Greek sponge divers happened on the scene in 50 metres of water. Archaeologists have since pulled up spectacular bronze and marble statues, ornate glass and pottery, stunning pieces of jewellery, and a remarkable geared device – the Antikythera mechanism – which modelled the motion of the heavens. During the 2017 excavations, divers recovered a bronze disc that may be a missing part of the ancient device. But it is the statues that made the wreck famous. In the 1900s, archaeologists working at the site surfaced pieces of a beautiful Hellenistic bronze, named the Antikythera Youth. The statue now stands in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens alongside an impressive bronze head named the Antikythera philosopher, also hauled from the wreck. Both date to the 4th century BC, raising the question of how they came to be aboard the ill-fated ship 300 years later. Jens Daehner, associate curator of antiquities at the J Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, said the Antikythera wreck had already yielded significant bronze statues. “The chance to recover another group of lifesize statues associated with the wreck is extraordinary, because bronzes are usually encountered randomly under the sea, picked up by fishing nets or chanced upon by divers,” he said. “Those finds are not excavated like at Antikythera, where archaeologists can and do document the entire context, which provides all the sorts of very valuable data as to when the sculptures were transported and why they were on the ship: for trade, as booty, or as scrap metal to be recycled.” The bronze recycling industry was huge in classical times and later in the medieval period, leading to the destruction of countless statues and other artefacts that would be priceless today. For this reason, many of the finest specimens of bronze statues that survive were once lost at sea. “Ancient bronze sculpture in general is rare due to the metal having been recycled in antiquity and later. We think of the ones from the sea as those that got away,” said Daehner. “Any chance to recover more Greek sculptures in any medium, but particularly in bronze, should not be missed.” To recover the statues will take a massive effort. The divers must first remove boulders that are in their way, either by hauling them up, or by drilling holes in the rocks and filling them with grout that expands to fracture the stone. Another option is to crack the boulders open with small shaped charges that technical divers use to rescue people trapped when undersea caves collapse. But even if the statues can be lifted from the sea, they will be broken and need costly and time-consuming conservation and reconstruction. Statues are not the only objects the excavators hope to find. The latest excavations uncovered a lump of material bearing a bronze disc that matches the size of geared wheels found in the Antikythera mechanism. Wound by a handle, the device showed the movement of the sun, moon and planets in the sky, but not all of the machine was recovered. “The disc looks very exciting indeed,” said Andrew Ramsey, a CT specialist at Nikon Metrology in Tring, who used CT scans to read inscriptions on the original pieces of the mechanism. But the disc may be something entirely different. Preliminary x-ray images reveal no teeth, but an image of a bull, suggesting the disc is not a cog but a decorative item. Mike Edmunds, emeritus professor of astrophysics at Cardiff University and a member of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project, said the findings are impressive. “They are getting very good at detecting bronze items which raises the possibility that they may be able to find either the missing planetary gearing from the Antikythera mechanism, which we know is there from the analysis of the inscriptions on the mechanism, or a new piece of mechanism, or another mechanism that was being transported, and that would be very exciting.” The team will return to the wreck in the spring, optimistic that they may pull up fresh treasures from the wreck. “It’s not going to be just the bronze sculptures,” said Foley. “We’re down in the hold of the ship now, so all the other things that would have been carried should be down there as well. Every day is going to be like opening Tut’s tomb.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/05/negative-campaign-sites-scandal-shakes-up-austrian-election-race","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"Negative campaign sites scandal shakes up Austrian election race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/negative-campaign-sites-scandal-shakes-up-austrian-election-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/05/negative-campaign-sites-scandal-shakes-up-austrian-election-race","fields":{"headline":"Negative campaign sites scandal shakes up Austrian election race","bodyText":"Austria’s centre-left chancellor is battling allegations that his party paid for a group of websites churning out xenophobic and antisemitic conspiracy theories in order to discredit his main challenger in the eyes of far-right supporters. The scandal, which has rocked Austrian politics two weeks before the country goes to the polls to elect a new government, centres on at least two Facebook sites dedicated to the centre-right foreign minister and candidate for chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. One of them, called The Truth About Sebastian Kurz, which had about 16,000 followers, posted Photoshopped images and video clips accusing the politician of secretly paving the way for a new wave of immigration from Islamic countries, and of being part of the “dubious political network” of the Hungarian-American financier George Soros. Another site, For Sebastian Kurz, masqueraded as a website run by supporters of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP) candidate but published controversial content such as a poll on whether the government should close its border on the Brenner pass in the light of NGOs allegedly threatening to smuggle thousands of migrants from Italy into Austria. Kurz, who has campaigned on a promise to strengthen the EU’s outer borders and end rescues of refugees in the Mediterranean, is leading in opinion polls by a considerable margin and is widely expected to be become his country’s youngest ever head of government, at the age of 31, after elections on 15 October. Over the weekend the investigative magazine Profil alleged that the two websites targeting Kurz were run not by rightwing or far-right activists but by a former adviser to Austria’s current chancellor, Christian Kern, of the Social Democratic party for Austria (SPÖ). Kern hired Tal Silberstein, an Israeli political adviser, for a fee of €400,000 to mastermind his election campaign. But Silberstein was fired from the chancellor’s team on 14 August after being investigated over alleged money laundering in Israel. He denies wrongdoing in the Israeli case. Austrian media allege that Silberstein’s team continued to operate the websites even after the party had cut ties with him. Silberstein extolled the virtues of negative campaigning in the 2005 documentary Our Brand is Crisis, about the 2002 Bolivian presidential election. Then working for the US pollster Stanley Greenberg’s team of advisers, Silberstein was caught on camera telling the candidate Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada to “start negative campaigns” against his main rival without being seen as the campaign’s instigator. “We have to make him from clean to a dirty candidate, that’s our task,” he was heard to say. In Austria, which has a multi-party system and proportional representation, openly negative campaigning has traditionally been taboo. The SPÖ general secretary and campaign manager, Georg Niedermühlbichler, resigned on Saturday in the immediate wake of the revelations around the so-called Schmutzkübel (dirt bucket) campaign. Kern has said he was unaware of the Facebook sites, which he described as “amoral and incredibly stupid” – a denial supported by Silberstein himself. “The chancellor did not even have the slightest bit of knowledge or information,” Silberstein told Austrian media. “It is now part of the opposition’s own negative campaign to accuse the chancellor and the SPÖ.” Officially, he had been commissioned to analyse and interpret polling data, he said. Kern announced on Sunday that his party would release Silberstein’s contract to the public, but by Wednesday evening it had not done so. Silberstein has not denied running the sites in interviews with Austrian media and said that rather than negative campaigning his intention was to gather data and test out different messages. “The strange thing is that people from other parties have been used to steal information, and everyone gets worked up about the Facebook sites,” he reportedly said. As early as July, Kurz’s ÖVP had asked Facebook to delete posts from the two sites, but neither went offline until after Saturday’s revelations in the media. A third site, The Truth About Christian Kern, targets the incumbent chancellor, though a social media analyst quoted in Die Presse newspaper said it was unlikely to be run by the same people. Facebook has so far declined to comment specifically on the scandal that could influence the outcome of the Austrian elections, stating only that there are “well-functioning processes” for lodging complaints."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/04/amazon-eu-tax-irish-government-apple","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T10:25:22Z","webTitle":"Amazon ordered to repay €250m by EU over 'illegal tax advantages'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/04/amazon-eu-tax-irish-government-apple","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/04/amazon-eu-tax-irish-government-apple","fields":{"headline":"Amazon ordered to repay €250m by EU over 'illegal tax advantages'","bodyText":"Amazon has been ordered to repay €250m (£222m) in illegal state aid to Luxembourg, as EU authorities continue their campaign against sweetheart deals that help the biggest corporations slash their tax bills. The European commission also announced on Wednesday that it planned to take the the Irish government to the European court of justice (ECJ) over its failure to collect €13bn in unpaid taxes from Apple, in relation to an earlier ruling. Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner in charge of competition, said Luxembourg’s “illegal tax advantages to Amazon” had allowed almost three-quarters of the company’s profits to go untaxed, allowing it to pay four times less tax than local rivals. “This is about competition in Europe, no matter your flag, no matter your ownership,” Vestager said, dismissing suggestions she was targeting non-European companies. “Paying taxes is part of doing business in Europe.” The commission said Amazon had benefited from an illegal tax deal granted by the Luxembourg authorities that allowed the company to artificially reduce its tax bill by €250m from 2006 to 2014. The company has been ordered to repay the full amount plus interest. Amazon rejected the findings of the commission investigation. “We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law. We will study the commission’s ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal.” The country’s government said: “As Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible state aid.” In a separate announcement, Vestager said she was appealing to Europe’s highest court to enforce an earlier ruling against Apple to ensure the iPhone maker repaid €13bn in back taxes. Apple, which has appealed to Europe’s highest court to contest the decision, has neither repaid the money to the Irish government nor placed the money in an escrow account, a standard practice when court proceedings are under way. Dublin said it disputed the commission’s ruling that it made the wrong decision in the Apple tax deal, but has promised to collect money owed as soon as possible. Citing its “intensive work” on recovering the funds, the Irish government described the decision as “extremely regrettable” in a statement. “Irish officials and experts have been engaged in intensive work to ensure that the state complies with all its recovery obligations as soon as possible, and have been in constant contact with the European commission and Apple on all aspects of this process for over a year,” it said. EU member states risk multimillion-euro fines when they fail to act on EU competition rulings. In 2015 the commission requested a €20m fine plus daily penalty payments against Italy over the country’s refusal to collect back taxes from Sardinian hotels that had benefited from special deals. The commission acknowledged that Ireland had begun to work on the recovery of the back taxes, but deems the Irish deadline of “March 2018 at the earliest” not good enough. The case against Amazon centred on two subsidiaries incorporated in Luxembourg and controlled by the US parent – Amazon EU group and Amazon Europe Holding Technologies. The latter was described by the commission as “an empty shell” that had no employees or offices, but was used to bring down the company’s tax bill. Amazon EU group, which runs the internet company’s operations in the region, transferred 90% of its operating profits to the holding company, where they were not taxed. As a result, Amazon paid an effective tax rate in Luxembourg of 7.25%, compared with the national rate of 29%. Amazon’s blueprint was Project Goldcrest, a tax scheme named after Luxembourg’s national bird, based on a 2003 deal with authorities in the Grand Duchy. Amazon changed its tax operations in June 2014, a year after Brussels began investigating tax rulings across the EU. US authorities have also been investigating Project Goldcrest, but lost in court to the retail firm. In March a court ruled against the Internal Revenue Service, which had argued Amazon owed the US $1.5bn (£1.13bn) in unpaid taxes linked to its Luxembourg companies. Luxembourg’s role in orchestrating tax avoidance deals for hundreds of global companies was revealed by the Guardian in 2014, raising questions about tax policy in one of the EU’s oldest member states. The case continues to hang over Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, who served as Luxembourg’s prime minister from 1995 to 2013, and acted as finance minister for much of that period. The commission launched the Amazon investigation in October 2014, just weeks before Juncker took office, while the fallout over the Luxleaks revelations clouded his early weeks. Many European politicians and business groups argue generous tax breaks give Amazon an unfair competitive advantage over smaller rivals, prompting the recent announcement of a plan to rewrite EU tax rules. But investigations into unfair state aid run broader, with the EU authorities expected to conclude an inquiry into the fast-food chain McDonald’s in the coming weeks. The commission has also ruled unlawful tax deals between Starbucks and the Dutch authorities, as well as Fiat’s arrangements with Luxembourg. The Apple case has generated the biggest furore, with the chief executive, Tim Cook, dismissing the claims as “total political crap”. The commission said the sweetheart deal with the Irish government allowed Apple to pay a maximum tax rate of 1%, which fell to just 0.005% in 2014. The usual rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 12.5%. If the UK leaves the EU single market, it will not be bound by European rules on fair tax competition. However, any free-trade deal with the EU is likely to constrain the government’s ability to turn the UK into a low-tax haven. Vestager said she was not expecting British government’s to pursue this course: “I don’t see why [UK policy] would change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/27/uk-asylum-seekers-living-in-squalid-unsafe-slum-conditions","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-27T12:00:29Z","webTitle":"UK asylum seekers living in 'squalid, unsafe slum conditions'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/27/uk-asylum-seekers-living-in-squalid-unsafe-slum-conditions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/27/uk-asylum-seekers-living-in-squalid-unsafe-slum-conditions","fields":{"headline":"UK asylum seekers living in 'squalid, unsafe slum conditions'","bodyText":"Asylum seekers arriving in the UK are forced to live in “squalid, unsafe, slum housing conditions” and the public is largely unaware of the conditions into which “traumatised people are routinely dumped”, charities have said. The £600m government contract to provide shelter for those seeking sanctuary in the UK goes up for tender next month as calls mount for for urgent reforms. Testimonies from asylum seekers and frontline workers detail accommodation that is infested with vermin, insecure, damp and dirty. One woman in Greater Manchester described how she was forced to stay in the same house even after her newborn baby was covered with bites from bed bugs. Another asylum seeker in Greater Manchester told of a sink pedestal that crashed though the ceiling into the area where she was living with her three children. Another in Merseyside shared images of her bedroom after the ceiling had collapsed for the second time in six months. Charities also told the Guardian that women who had been trafficked had been put in housing with internal and external doors that did not lock securely. “You’re talking about people who have potentially been raped, sexually assaulted, tortured, not being able to lock their front door,” said Christina Bodenes from MRANG, a Merseyside charity that provides support to women their children seeking asylum. “It’s just a completely unacceptable situation.” Responsibility for housing people seeking asylum in the UK was taken away from local authorities in 2012 and given to the companies Serco, G4S and Clearsprings, through contracts known as Compass. The vast majority of asylum seekers are housed by G4S and Serco in the poorest parts of the country where housing is comparatively cheap. G4S holds Compass contracts for the north-east, Yorkshire and the Humber, the Midlands and the east of England, where 45% of the UK’s asylum seekers live. Serco holds contracts for Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north-west, where just over a third of the asylum seekers live. Clearsprings had contracts for Wales, the south-west, and London and the south-east. Maurice Wren, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “All too often, people seeking asylum in the UK are forced to live in squalid, unsafe, slum housing conditions, at exorbitant cost to the public purse. “Though the general public is largely unaware of the appalling conditions into which traumatised people are routinely dumped, ministers and officials are not, yet this scandal continues unchecked. The time has come to end this shameful practice and allow people seeking asylum to live in dignity.” David Simmonds, the chair of the Local Government Association’s asylum, refugee and migration taskforce, said councils regularly complained that they had little power to tackle the “generally unacceptable” standard of accommodation for asylum seekers in their areas, because the private contractors’ contracts are with the Home Office. “The accommodation will always be at the lowest end of the market, because to win the contract the providers bid at the lowest possible price,” he said. “But vermin infestations and damp are things that would stop a local authority from considering that accommodation for placing UK homeless families. That same minimum standard should apply consistently.” Graham O’Neill of the Scottish Refugee Council said asylum-seeker housing was a vital public service, “housing for a group of people who really need the stability and the privacy that a safe home and a safe space can bring”. It is “publicly funded and yet local authorities and devolved governments have no ability to hold these providers to account”, he said. Asylum seekers do not have permission to work while awaiting a decision on their claim. Under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 they are able to apply for accommodation and financial help from the Home Office if they have no other means of supporting themselves. Armed conflict and political instability in the Middle East and Africa have caused the number of people housed under the act to jump sharply during the life of the Compass contracts, from about 25,000 to 40,000 at the end of last year. MPs on the home affairs select committee heard evidence last year that G4S and Serco were losing money on the Compass contracts, in part because of the increase in the number of asylum seekers and the rising cost of rents. Serco’s average monthly income per service user was about £300 in February 2016, compared with an average cost of around £450. The committee published a report in January that said the government should act immediately to improve conditions. Ten months later, charities say there has been little improvement and the government is yet to respond to the findings. It has said the previous month that the current Compass contracts would be extended for two years until August 2019. Contracts to provide asylum seeker accommodation from September 2019 until 2024 will be put out to tender in November. A Home Office spokesperson said the ministry worked closely with contractors to ensure they provided accommodation that was “safe, habitable, fit for purpose and adequately equipped”, and that it investigated all complaints relating to sub-standard accommodation. John Whitwam, G4S’s head of immigration and borders, said the standard of accommodation provided to asylum seekers was “subject to prescriptive criteria”, and that any failure to meet those criteria would result in a contract penalty. “Since November 2013, we have not been subject to any performance penalties on the basis that we rectify many tens of thousands of defects each year to meet the required standard,” he said. “We continue to invest in our provision, despite heavy commercial losses.” Scott Ross, Serco’s operations director, said the company was committed to ensuring they provided “decent and safe accommodation” for the 16,000 asylum seekers in its care, and that they met all of their contractual obligations. “We are absolutely confident that the asylum seekers we look after are in housing of a decent standard, and where repairs are required to the 5,000 properties that we manage, these are completed in accordance with the strict timescales of our contract with the Home Office,” he said. ‘This house is awful’ When Maria - not her real name - fled her home in South America because she faced imprisonment without trial for protesting against the government, she was pregnant and homeless. Now her daughter is eight and they have been living in her current home for five years, but the property is still is barely habitable. Maria says the accommodation in Leeds has got worse since G4S took over the contract. Her house is so riddled with mice that she and her daughter are forced to sleep with the lights on to stop them coming into their bedrooms. “It’s not just the quality of the house I’m in, but the service has got worse,” she says. “I’m excited to move out of this house, but I already feel so sorry for the next family they are going to bring here. This house is awful.” Another asylum seeker living in Greater Manchester said she was scared for the safety of her children, all under ten, after a sink pedestal fell through the ceiling of her living room in mid-July. “My daughter and son played in the same place [where the pedestal fell]. I was really scared,” she said. “When I go to sleep I think what could have happened.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/04/norman-conquests-review-chichester-festival-theatre-blanche-mcintyre-alan-ayckbourn-trilogy","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T12:03:59Z","webTitle":"The Norman Conquests review – Ayckbourn's weekenders get lost in longing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/04/norman-conquests-review-chichester-festival-theatre-blanche-mcintyre-alan-ayckbourn-trilogy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/04/norman-conquests-review-chichester-festival-theatre-blanche-mcintyre-alan-ayckbourn-trilogy","fields":{"headline":"The Norman Conquests review – Ayckbourn's weekenders get lost in longing","bodyText":"Fresh from directing Titus Andronicus, Blanche McIntyre now tackles Alan Ayckbourn’s 1973 trilogy, which has its own share of sex and violence. But it would be absurd to push the Shakespearean comparison. The dramatist who often came to mind watching McIntyre’s mordantly comic revival was Chekhov. Within a set of arrivals and departures at a Sussex country house, we glimpse loneliness, defeat and a particularly middle-class kind of desperation. The three plays cover a traumatic family weekend from 5.30pm on Saturday to 9am on Monday from the separate vantage points of dining room, living room and garden: they amount to a single, unified work. The catalyst for the action is a libertine librarian, Norman, who has tempted one sister-in-law (Annie) with the prospect of a dirty weekend, profoundly attracts another (Sarah) and even manages to have sex on a hearthrug with his wife (Ruth). But while each play has a comic set piece, what emerges from this production is the prevailing sadness. The pivotal figures here are Annie, the stay-at-home sister doomed to cope with a tyrannical invalid mother, and Tom, the dim vet whose dithering adoration of her never turns into physical action. Jemima Rooper plays Annie with just the right frazzled, Chekhovian frustration. She makes “I want to go to East Grinstead” – the unlikely site of her putative sexy weekend – sound as plaintive as the longing for Moscow in Three Sisters and her dream of Tom actually proposing reminds you of Varya’s similarly quashed hopes in The Cherry Orchard. John Hollingworth is also a revelation as Tom. He has the beaming insensitivity of a kindly chump and the splay-footed walk of a man who never seems fully at ease in his own body. While emphasising the emotional reality of the plays rather than treating them as a sustained laugh-riot, McIntyre cannot disguise the fact that Ayckbourn’s dialogue occasionally pads out, rather than propels, the action. The comic high points, however, are expertly handled. In Table Manners, a dinner scene turns hilariously fractious under Sarah’s manic gaze. In Living Together, the attempt by Reg, Sarah’s husband, to organise a homemade board game exposes the family frictions even further. Best of all is the moment in Round and Round the Garden when the lawn of this old Victorian vicarage suddenly abounds in orgiastic frenzy. Sarah Hadland as the control-freakish Sarah, Hattie Ladbury as the myopically tolerant Ruth who treats her husband as an errant sheepdog, Jonathan Broadbent as the put-upon Reg doomed to perpetual disappointment, and Trystan Gavelle as the shamblingly egotistic Norman – “a gigolo trapped inside a haystack” – all give credible, detailed performances. But while audiences rightly go to Ayckbourn for a good time, what comes across most vividly from McIntyre’s production is the solitude that accompanies constantly thwarted dreams and desires. • At Chichester Festival theatre until 28 October.

Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson will receive equal shares of the 9m Swedish kronor (£825,000) prize, which was announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm on Wednesday. The technique, called cryo-electron microscopy, allowed biomolecules to be visualised in their natural configuration for the first time, triggering a “revolution in biochemistry”, according to the Nobel committee. The latest versions of the technology mean scientists can record biochemical processes as they unfold in film-like sequences. Earlier imaging techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, required samples to be studied in a rigid state, revealing little about the dynamics of proteins and enzymes – many of which could not be successfully crystallised in any case. Another microscopic technique, the electron microscope, was only suitable for imaging dead matter, because its powerful beam destroyed delicate biological structures. Henderson, a Scottish scientist and professor at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, was the first to successfully modify the electron microscope to image a protein involved in photosynthesis, by using a weaker beam and taking pictures from many angles. Joachim Frank, a German-born professor at Columbia University in New York, developed mathematical algorithms that allowed the method to be applied to a wider array of molecules. Dubochet, who is Swiss and an honorary professor at the University of Lausanne, pioneered a flash freezing method that turned the water inside cells into a glassy solid, rather than ice crystals which would damage the cellular structure. His vitrification technique allowed biological samples to be frozen while retaining their natural shape. Speaking to journalists after the announcement, Frank said the practical uses for the technique were “immense” and meant medicine no longer focuses on organs but “looks at the processes in the cell”. Cryo-electron microscopy has allowed scientists to explore the architecture of everything from the proteins that cause antibiotic resistance to the surface of the Zika virus. Last year the 3D structure of the enzyme producing the amyloid of Alzheimer’s disease was published using this technology. By capturing snapshots of the same system at different time-points, scientists can even stitch together jittery film sequences of biological processes as they unfold. This has paved the way for both new basic insights into life’s chemistry and for the development of pharmaceuticals. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, said the win underscored the value of patiently supporting basic science for decades, which in this case led to immense payoffs. “It has already been used by drug companies to do structures of important drug targets, and it is used to understand fundamental biology that can change medicine in the future – so it just goes to show you how all these things are linked,” he said. Dr Carsten Sachse, of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg who worked with Henderson in Cambridge, describes his former colleague as a “visionary”. “When I worked with him that was a time when it was not clear how far the technology really would go but he had it all worked out in his head and he just had to make this happen,” he said. The nine science Nobel prize winners this year include include seven Americans (Frank and Rainer Weiss, who won the physics prize yesterday, are both German-born US citizens). The academy’s secretary-general, Göran Hansson, commented on this success after the announcement: “The United States has after the Second World War allowed scientists to perform fundamental research, to focus on important questions in science, not forcing them to do immediate applications, not controlling them in a political way,” Prof Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, professor of mammalian development and stem cell biology at the University of Cambridge, said: “A visual image is the essential component to understanding, often the first one to open our eyes, and so our minds, to a scientific breakthrough,” she said. Dame Athene Donald, a professor of experimental physics at the University of Cambridge whose work has focussed on understanding biological structures, said the technique had made an enormous difference to her field, adding that she had been struck by a talk by Henderson that she attended during her PhD. “It was stunning work,” she said. “It’s a long time ago but it’s brilliant to see the developments finally be rewarded by this year’s award.” Barry Fuller, professor in surgical sciences at University College London Medical School, said Dubochet is widely known as a “star” in his field. “The technology is aimed … on imaging biomolecules in the life process ‘frozen’ in time – so they are called to immediate halt,” he said. In the future, Fuller added, understanding the configurations and stability of biomolecules at ultra-low temperatures could also accelerate efforts in cryobiology, where scientists are focused on how to vitrify human tissue and organs to allow them to be preserved for long durations. Last year’s prize went to three European chemists for developing “nano-machines”, an advance that paved the way for the world’s first smart materials. On Monday, three American scientists shared the 2017 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their painstaking work on circadian rhythms and the Nobel prize in chemistry went to another American trio for the first observation of gravitational waves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/05/push-for-drink-driving-law-exemption-for-those-in-automated-cars","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"Drink-driving in a driverless car should be legal, expert body says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/push-for-drink-driving-law-exemption-for-those-in-automated-cars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/05/push-for-drink-driving-law-exemption-for-those-in-automated-cars","fields":{"headline":"Drink-driving in a driverless car should be legal, expert body says","bodyText":"Uber drivers could one day be spared from engaging in small talk with drunks if a National Transport Commission suggestion to allow people under the influence of alcohol to use fully automated vehicles is adopted by state road authorities. The NTC, an independent statutory body tasked with reforming Australia’s driving laws to prepare for the arrival of driverless cars, has recommended an “exemption” from drink and drug-driving laws for people who ride in fully automated vehicles. In a new discussion paper it argues there is a “clear-cut” justification for an exemption from drink-driving laws because there is “no possibility that a human could drive a dedicated automated vehicle”. “The situation is analogous to a person instructing a taxi driver where to go,” the NTC report states. State traffic laws prohibit driving under the influence of varying levels of alcohol but the NTC says they could be a “barrier” to the benefits of driverless vehicles, which it argues could improve road safety by reducing the incidence of drink-driving. Advocates of the new technology argue its largest benefit would be reducing Australia’s road toll. There are about 1,300 deaths in Australia every year and the vast majority are caused by human error. However, it recommend the rules remain in place for semi-autonomous vehicles or those that allow manual driving. While individual states and territories set road rules, the NTC provides a model for nationally consistent laws. It has been tasked with grappling with the enormous regulatory overhaul required to respond to the introduction of driverless-vehicle technology, which some estimate could be on roads in Australia by 2020. That includes the question of who is liable in the event of driverless vehicle malfunction that results in an accident and to what extent a person in an autonomous vehicle is deemed to be in control. Current laws assume that a person is in control of a vehicle but the NTC believes that should be changed so that a person “would not expect to be held responsible for contraventions of the laws” while an automated vehicle was engaged. “To hold the human responsible may restrict the introduction of automated vehicles into Australia and unnecessarily deny or delay the many potential benefits of the technology,” the NTC found. Instead, the law should be changed so that the automated driving system itself was legally responsible. The NTC is due to make recommendations for reforms at the 2018 transport and infrastructure council meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory transport ministers. Various states and territories have legislated to allow trials of driverless-vehicle technology in recent years. South Australia passed legislation last year, while New South Wales passed legislation to allow its own trials in August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/04/bob-and-gareths-throwback-routine-unleashes-ghosts-of-good-government-past","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T06:36:40Z","webTitle":"Bob and Gareth’s throwback routine unleashes ghosts of good government past","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/bob-and-gareths-throwback-routine-unleashes-ghosts-of-good-government-past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/bob-and-gareths-throwback-routine-unleashes-ghosts-of-good-government-past","fields":{"headline":"Bob and Gareth’s throwback routine unleashes ghosts of good government past","bodyText":"For an hour or so on a sunny spring day in Canberra, the politics of the past imposed itself on the politics of the present. The former prime minister Bob Hawke lifted his weathered face to the light like a seasoned supermodel and waved to his people at the National Press Club, fully determined to upstage his foreign minister, Gareth Evans, at the launch of Evans’s new memoir. Evans, with hardback editions of the book propped like sentries at the ends of the podium, blushed as he was alternatively praised and rebuked by Hawke during the obligatory warm-up act. Hawke reasoned that Evans was Australia’s “greatest internationalist”. Yet he was also capable of getting it wrong. Take page 332 of the new tome, where Evans had remarked that Hawke set the direction of the government, but “rarely generated any big new ideas subsequently”. “Gareth, this is simply not true,” counselled the support act. In invoking his right of reply, Hawke told the room he had no intention of doing “a Gareth” – what that meant was left coyly to the collective imagination in a political capital where anecdotes about the volcanic Evans temper persist in high rotation. Generous to a fault, Hawke said he would not seek to be “exhaustive” in his correction of the public record, but would share a couple of his better ideas. There was working to end apartheid. There was “saving the Antarctic”. Mothers still thanked him, Hawke said, for increasing assistance for children. Evans squirmed a little in his seat as the polite conventions of the event prevented a minor eruption from the chair. When he was permitted to speak, he acknowledged the note from Hawke was a fair cop. Hawke, he said, was “absolutely as good as it gets for an Australian prime minister” – and during the period where the Labor government worked to transform the country, the prime minister gave as good as he got. To underscore the point, there were a couple of war stories about prime ministerial profanities lobbed across the cabinet table, and Hawke’s pithy summation of Evans’s period in the attorney general’s portfolio before he was dumped in 1984. Evans’s time as attorney general was his “two-handed wank phase”, according to the boss. Evans’s purpose on Wednesday, however, went beyond the transactional business of memoir flogging. Having curated and crafted the necessary sense of nostalgia, having lifted Canberra out of the present and given it a soft landing in a period when political life was less cluttered, contested, and crazy – Evans then sought to puncture his own nostalgia bubble with a homily crafted for contemporary consumption. The new Evans memoir is entitled Incorrigible Optimist – and hope is a very tough gig in politics right now. Hawke readily confessed he wasn’t that optimistic, what with global warming getting worse and with the possibility that terrorists could get their hands on nuclear devices. Evans acknowledged it was hard to be upbeat during the Trumpocalypse, ringside at the Washington “horror show”, with geopolitical tensions running high, and with the Australian political debate “more shallow and superficial”. The former cabinet minister acknowledged optimism was a fraught business; taken to extremes it was the stuff of Monty Python parody. But he contended it was a necessary precondition for public life, if you were a political character who wants to build things, and change things. In explaining his otherwise inexplicable optimism, and its resilience in challenging times, Evans said: “If you believe that an enterprise is bound to fail, you won’t even begin trying to push the envelope. “Achieving almost anything in public life is difficult enough but it is almost impossible without believing that what seems out of reach is actually achievable.” Australian politics was at a grim little pass, little better than “second-rate vaudeville”. This could change, Evans thought, if politics took itself more seriously, and projected the sense that public contributions, in public office, still change the world. Seriousness and steadiness could come from some structural things, like four-year terms or reforms to clear the “Star Wars bar” characters out of the Senate, but mainly it would come from stowing some of the grim hyperpartisanship. Evans noted governments didn’t make good decisions in a nails-down-chalkboard environment where kicking the hell out of political opponents was the daily priority. Perhaps politics could actually rediscover the courage to cooperate across party lines. “People might be surprised if there was decency and that kind of cooperative spirit came back into the show,” he said. Rather than complaining about the impossibility of governing, major parties needed to adopt a “new willingness … to really listen to the electorate’s concerns which are real, to think hard in addressing the concerns, and to win genuine respect”. Politics needed a new storyline, Evans thought, and in his mind, the new storyline, at least for the centre left, was a little like the old storyline – economic policy that was pro competition, pro productivity, combined with a liberal internationalist foreign policy and a “very warm, very moist, very compassionate, highly compensatory social policy”. The ghost of good government past said tricks weren’t the answer, caving into populism wasn’t the answer – the answer was credible storytellers and credible stories. “It’s got to be based on substantive, decent, well communicated, attractively communicated policy.” “I suspect that might be a winning combination,” Evans said, with a chuffed sort of twinkle. “But I would say that, wouldn’t I?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/10/australian-students-at-richer-schools-have-unfair-advantage-in-science-report","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T01:49:27Z","webTitle":"Australian students at richer schools have unfair advantage in science – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/australian-students-at-richer-schools-have-unfair-advantage-in-science-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/australian-students-at-richer-schools-have-unfair-advantage-in-science-report","fields":{"headline":"Australian students at richer schools have unfair advantage in science – report","bodyText":"Australian students who attend wealthy schools have an unfair advantage in science education, an OECD report has found. The report, released in September, used the latest Program for International Student Assessment – or Pisa – results to examine the factors that impact on science education in 69 countries. When it came to access to resources, exposure to science and instructional practices, only students in Australia and Singapore were consistently better off in richer schools. In nations with high rankings in science achievement, such as Estonia, students in disadvantaged schools had similar or better access to good learning environments as their peers in richer schools. It also found that about one-third of the variation in science performance across OECD countries is explained by the degree of equity in the allocation of resources, and that countries with more equitable systems performed better on average. The report argued that countries with successful science results were the ones which “provide additional support to disadvantaged schools”. “Allocating additional resources to socioeconomically disadvantaged schools is not only a way to compensate inequalities across schools; it can also help improve overall student performance in science,” the report stated. The OECD’s latest findings echo those of previous studies. An analysis of Pisa results in 2016 found that students in the top socioeconomic group were about three years ahead in science, reading and maths compared with those in the lowest group. Correna Haythorpe, the federal president of the Australian Education Union, said the results were a “wake-up call” for the federal government. “Australia’s investment in education is lagging as a share of GDP,” she said. “What this paper shows is that equity in sharing resources between advantaged and disadvantaged schools makes a significant difference to how schools perform.” She said the government’s Gonski 2.0 funding package “further privileges wealthy private schools over public schools that educate the overwhelming majority of students with disadvantage”. But the education minister, Simon Birmingham, said the new funding model would see funding for government schools grow by an average of 6.4% per student per year over the next four years compared with 4.2% growth for nongovernment schools. “Our plan ensures that within six years all schools receiving less than their commonwealth share of the Schooling Resource Standard will be brought up to that level and all notionally overfunded schools will be brought down to the SRS within a decade unlike the 150 years it would have taken if we’d let Labor’s arrangements continue,” he said. “It’s extraordinary that after years extolling the virtues of the 2011 Gonski review, the union are turning their back on that landmark report for political expediency.” Birmingham accused the union of hypocrisy for criticising the equity of the government’s needs-based funding model when it had backed Labor in opposing cuts to overfunded private schools. The report also found that while gender and socioeconomic status was important, “what happens in the school and in the classroom” also made a crucial difference in student outcomes. And many of the countries with more equitable science education fared worse than Australia in the Pisa rankings. Birmingham said while funding mattered, “what’s more important is how that funding is used”. Birmingham said the government had asked David Gonski to lead a panel of experts to examine best-practice initiatives in classrooms so that the extra funding actually delivered results."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/oct/04/conservative-conference-2017-theresa-may-to-announce-council-house-building-programme-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T18:25:25Z","webTitle":"Conservative conference 2017: May interrupted by man trying to give her P45 - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/04/conservative-conference-2017-theresa-may-to-announce-council-house-building-programme-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/04/conservative-conference-2017-theresa-may-to-announce-council-house-building-programme-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Conservative conference 2017: May interrupted by man trying to give her P45 - as it happened","bodyText":"Theresa May said she wanted to offer voters the “British dream” but the most personal speech of her premiership was overshadowed by a a P45, an incessant cough and a stage malfunction. The Conservatives will launch an investigation into security at their party conference after a prankster waving a P45 disrupted Theresa May’s speech before being dragged from the auditorium. Police said he was accredited. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has since declared herself “disappointed” and Downing Street has said there will be a “thorough investigation”. Main points from the speech. A tweet from a Conservative MP, apparently seeking to dampen speculation about Theresa May’s future, has indicated that the parliamentary party is, in fact, discussing whether or not she can stay on. That’s all from this live blog, which is now closing. Thanks for following. Had Theresa May known she was going to have a coughing fit, would she have worn a bracelet comprised of small, painted images of the Mexican reconstructionist, Frida Kahlo on her right wrist? Or is that precisely why she used that hand to cough into - so that we, the public, could see that, in 2005, she went to a blockbuster show at the Tate Modern? A kind reading suggests that May is aware of Kahlo’s resurgence in the cultural world. Next year, the V&amp;A will host a grand retrospective of the Mexican artist. Kahlo was also cited as a muse to Roland Mouret’s most recent collection, spring-summer 2017, and featured heavily in Etro’s pre-autumn collection. Moreover, May did wear Mouret to the party conference two years ago and, well, she is fond of the past. As to where it came from, a gift shop springs to mind, although there’s an excellent likeness on twee, hipster, online craft site, Etsy. Either way, it’s perhaps a surprising statement for the Tory leader, not least because Kahlo was a communist, married to artist Diego Riviera, a prominent figure in the Mexican Communist party, and a close friend of Leon Trotsky. She also spent her career concerned with the plight of the impoverished, our connectedness to self, nature and the universe, the relationship between pain and identity, and imagined, one day, we could live in a classless society. Referring to the apparent ease with which a prankster got to within yards of the government’s most senior figures during May’s speech, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, has said she was “very disappointed”. She told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: I am going to continue to follow what’s going on, it’s in the hands of the police and we will make sure we look carefully into how it happened to make sure it doesn’t again. Simon Brodkin, who was arrested and released soon afterwards, was accredited to attend the conference, Greater Manchester police said. Chief superintendent John O’Hare said officers would be “reviewing the accreditation process with the Conservative party” as a result. A Downing Street source has told the Press Association: “We expect that there will be a thorough investigation into what happened.” The source declined to discuss the prime minister’s security arrangements. The Conservative MP, George Freeman, the head of the prime minister’s policy board, told the agency: There should be some very serious questions, that could have been a terrorist. My understanding is he’s a comedian, he’s often used by the BBC, and questions will be asked about how he was allowed to get that close. Shaun Hinds, the chief executive of Manchester Central, said that “conference security protocols were immediately enacted resulting in the individual being quickly ejected from the venue and handed over” to police. The former cabinet minister, Ken Clarke, urged Boris Johnson to “go away and try and find out something about foreign policy and try to be foreign secretary”, accusing him of turning the party’s conference into “mayhem”. Clarke said of Johnson: He made a very disloyal speech just before she was due to make the Florence speech. He made a very disloyal speech just before this conference, and he’s turned the conference into mayhem. And anybody looking in from outside, I’m not surprised they’re somewhat puzzled at the state of the government. Johnson has sought to paint a picture of unity in public. This live blog is reopening and we’ve been getting some more reaction to the prime minister’s conference speech. In an apparent attempt to quieten down questions among his parliamentary colleagues about Theresa May’s future as the party’s leader, Tory MP Mark Pritchard amplified questions among his parliamentary colleagues about Theresa May’s future as the party’s leader. Pritchard, who was appointed as one of May’s trade envoys last month, also praised her for battling through the unexpected interruptions. The announcement that energy prices were to be capped drew praise from the former Conservative minister, John Penrose, who said May was “absolutely right to protect households from rip-off energy bills with an energy price cap”. Penrose, who helped organise a cross-party campaign to cap energy bills for 17 million families that had the backing of 76 Tories, said May must back a relative price cap - a maximum mark-up between each energy firm’s best deal and its default tariff. Labour’s shadow business and energy secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said May’s energy price plans dd not go far enough. “It is unclear if responsibility for action has again been passed to Ofgem, with no commitment on when or how action will be taken. Yet again, the country is left confused about whether the prime minister will honour her election promise.” The energy cap announcement received a cooler response from the Confederation of British Industry, whose director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, called it an “example of state intervention that misses the mark”. But she welcomed the prime minister’s words on how to meet the “profound challenges and opportunities of Brexit and creating a fairer and more prosperous economy”, saying she had “recognised the fundamental importance of good government working in partnership with responsible business to improve lives”. The industry regulator, Ofgem, said it shared the government’s “concern that the market is not working for all consumers”. The Scottish National Party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: “Theresa May’s speech, beset with problems and protests, proved the ‘British dream’ is a Tory nightmare for families and communities hit by years of endless austerity, cuts and low economic growth.” The chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, Alison Garnham, said: “Despite its billing, despite all the slogans on the stage, this was not really a speech about aspiration and building a country that works for everyone. “To do that the Prime Minister should have directly addressed UK poverty, one of the ‘burning injustices’ which she spoke about last year.” Theresa May said she wanted to offer voters the “British dream” but the most personal speech of her premiership was overshadowed by a a P45, an incessant cough and a stage malfunction. The Conservatives will launch an investigation into security at their party conference after a prankster waving a P45 disrupted Theresa May’s speech before being dragged from the auditorium. Main points from the speech. That’s all from me. Thanks for the comments. Health groups have praised Theresa May’s decision to overhaul the system of organ donation in England in order to increase the number of livers, kidneys and other body parts available for transplant patients. In future people in England will have to opt out of organ donation – a system called presumed consent – rather than opt in as they do under the current system. Wales brought in a presumed consent system in December 2015 and that has led to more organs than before being retrieved and thus more lives being extended or saved, doctors say. Under the system May wants it is automatically presumed that someone will donate their organs upon their death unless they opt out. Currently people in England opt in by signing on the organ donor register. Gordon Brown tried to make the same switch in 2008 when he was in No 10 but in the end did not press ahead with the plan after some doctors warned such a change could create difficulties for those treating patients near the end of their lives. The prime minister’s announcement follows a sustained campaign in favour of presumed consent by the Daily Mirror – not a newspaper that Tory premiers usually take seriously. “The decision to introduce an opt-out system for organ donation in England is excellent news,” said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association. “The BMA has lobbied and campaigned tirelessly on this for many years and [it] has the potential to save many lives. It is important that the new process is well publicised to ensure the public are fully aware of and understand this important change. The health service must also have the resources, as well as facilities, to ensure transplant procedures can be performed when they are needed.” Theresa May is not the first to reach for a cough lozenge during an important speech; Hillary Clinton did the same during her presidential campaign. Despite Philip Hammond’s proffered remedy, cough drops may not be the way to go when tackling a coughing attack. Rather, it seems, it is all in the breathing. Dr Konstantin Buteyko, a breathing disorders expert, devised a “stop cough” method in the 1950s that is still advocated today. According to his tried and tested technique, at the first sign of a tickle you should put your hand over your mouth and swallow, keeping your hand over your mouth throughout. Next, take a small breath in and out through your mouth, and pinch your nose if you can. Hold your breath for a count of five or 10. Leave your hand over your mouth and release your nose if pinching it. Then, take small, careful breaths through the nose, all the time resisting the urge to cough. Take slow steady breaths in and out of your nose until the tickle has subsided. Reaching for the water may lead only to temporary relief, as May’s speech proved. This method may not make for flattering photographs up there on the stage in Manchester. But as the P45 picture is probably the money shot, that is arguably an irrelevance. ITV’s Robert Peston has written a Facebook post about the speech. Here is an excerpt. Frustratingly for her it is not her “British Dream” which will lodge in the public consciousness – but the chaotic theatre, which also involved letters tumbling from the campaign slogan stuck on the wall behind her (“Building a country that works for everyone”, though apparently with insipid adhesive). I am told that after she left the stage, the prime minister hugged her husband and wept. No one would blame her. PS Downing Street insists “her crying is a total lie, 100% untrue”. I am obviously happy to report that. The Conservative have confirmed they will review the accreditation arrangements for conference. A spokesperson said: In light of the arrest during the prime minister’s speech we are working with the police to review the accreditation process and security arrangements for party conference. And this is what CCHQ is saying in its briefing note about the draft legislation for an energy price cap. The energy market hasn’t been working for ordinary consumers. For millions of families, energy bills are far too high – in particular, those on “standard variable tariffs” (SVTs) What we are doing is publishing a draft bill next week that would give Ofgem powers to impose a cap on SVTs over the whole market. Ofgem are expected to come out with their plans for how they will safeguard customers on the poorest value tariffs. If their plans do not go far enough, this power will enable them to go further. Our plan still preserves the workings of the competitive market and the principle of arms-length regulation. It will be up to Ofgem to set the level of the cap. There should be savings for customers on bad deals, but enough headroom for there still to be a reason for people to shop around. And this measure is intended to be temporary, while innovations such as smart meters arrive and enable the market to work properly for everyone. The fact that there will be legislation is significant. MPs can amend bills and, with more than 70 Tory MPs calling for a relatively tough energy price cap, May’s plans could end up being beefed up. This is what the CCHQ is saying in a briefing note about the £2bn for affordable housing announced by Theresa May. We will provide £2bn more funding for the affordable housing programme. This will increase the government’s 2016-21 affordable homes programme to £9.1bn. This extra £2bn will lever in a total investment of £5bn (public and private) in new housing. In those areas of the country where rents are high, we will allow bids for social rent, which are further below market rents. With a typical subsidy of £80,000, £2bn investment can supply around 25,000 homes available for social rent. This compares with an additional 6,800 social rent homes delivered in 2015-16. To help encourage more investment in social housing, we will create a stable financial environment by setting a long-term rent deal for councils and housing associations. This will give them the security and certainty to invest and build more. We will encourage councils as well as housing associations to bid for this funding so that we can deliver a new generation of council homes in this country. Here is a Guardian video of Theresa May’s coughing fit. Theresa May has tweeted a picture of all her cough sweets. The Institute of Directors says the entire party conference season has been “one big letdown” for business. This is from Stephen Martin, the IoD’s director general. I think it’s fair to say that this year’s party conference season has been one big letdown for businesses across the UK. On the one hand you have a Labour party which has decided that business is the bad guy, on the other you have a Conservative party which talks about the importance of markets, but then tinkers around with help to buy and energy price caps. What are business leaders meant to make of it all? At this pivotal moment in this country’s history, far too little time has been spent explaining the plan for how we leave the European Union, or debating how we tackle the long-term challenges that face our economy. Here is Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, on Theresa May’s speech. Theresa May’s speech – beset with problems and protests – proved the ‘British dream’ is a Tory nightmare for families and communities hit by years of endless austerity, cuts and low economic growth. That nightmare is now compounded by the dangerous shambles of Brexit which is a threat to jobs, businesses and livelihoods across the UK. Here is a Guardian panel with reaction to the speech from Hugh Muir, Gaby Hinsliff, Matthew d’Ancona, Kate Maltby and Abi Wilkinson. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, on Theresa May’s speech. Lord Porter, the Conservative chair of the Local Government Association, has given a qualified welcome to Theresa May’s announcement about council homes. But he is implying it does not go far enough. He said: It is good that the government has accepted our argument that councils must be part of the solution to our chronic housing shortage and able to resume their historic role as a major builder of affordable homes. We hope that today’s speech by the prime minister signals an important shift in the government’s housing vision and are pleased that there will be additional funding for affordable homes. Councils are working with communities to approve nine in 10 planning applications but it is clear that only an increase of all types of housing – including those for affordable or social rent – will solve the housing crisis. A genuine renaissance in council housebuilding would increase housing supply, boost home ownership and reduce homelessness. The last time the country was building more than 250,000 houses was in 1978 – when councils built 44% of new homes. Councils want to get on with the job of building the new homes that people in their areas desperately need. Every housing market is different and the only way councils will be able to significantly deliver the new homes we need is if they are given genuine powers to invest in housing that meets the needs of communities in every town and city across the country. This means the ability to borrow to invest in new council housing, to keep 100% of right-to-buy receipts to replace sold homes, certainty over future rents, powers to make sure developers build approved homes in a timely fashion, and adequately funded planning departments so that they can cover the cost of processing applications. Greater Manchester police have put out this statement from Ch Supt John O’Hare: Earlier today a man was detained by conference security during the prime minister’s speech. Officers attended and the man was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace and was released a short time later. The man had legitimate accreditation which granted him access to the conference site. In light of this we will be reviewing the accreditation process with the Conservative party. Even with accreditation, everyone at the conference goes through airport-style searches before being allowed entry to the site. This is from ITV’s Paul Brand. Theresa May’s colleagues are putting a positive gloss on the way she managed to keep going despite her cough. This is what Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, told the BBC’s World at One. Well I think she came across as very human, in fairness perhaps not in the way that she had planned. But people up and down the country watching TV have coughs and colds and they struggle on and that’s what she did. I think people know that she has had not just an annoying cough but a very, very tough few months and what comes across about Theresa May in public now is something that I’ve always seen in private which is a tremendous sense of duty. And this is from Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservatives’ leader. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the speech on Twitter. Basically, there is no avoiding the fact it was a disaster. From Sky’s Tamara Cohen From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From Steve Richards From the BBC’s Andrew Neil From the Mirror’s Jason Beattie From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman From Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan From the Guardian’s Gaby Hinsliff From the BBC’s Nick Robinson From Channel 4 News’s Cathy Newman From the BBC’s Jeremy Vine From Good Morning Britain’s Anne Alexander From the Telegraph’s Gordon Rayner From the Independent’s Ashley Cowburn From the Guardian’s Jonathan Freedland From the Telegraph’s Stephen Swinford From HuffPost’s Paul Waugh This is from MLex’s Matthew Holehouse. May’s team has been briefing on the speech. As the FT’s Jim Pickard says, the claim that Theresa May is going to oversee a massive, Macmillanesque council house building programme is well wide of the mark. Most party conference speeches, even those that are deemed a success on the day, are quickly forgotten. This one will be remembered for the rest of May’s career. As her voice continually gave way, it was excruciating to watch and at one point it looked as if she would have to give up. The start of May’s speech was strong, and she responded to the (rather puerile) protest from Simon Brodkin with a good, confident ad lib, but after that her voice sabotaged the rest of the speech. It is often overlooked how physically demanding politics is at the very top: endless early mornings, late nights, demanding schedules, and a job where you can’t pull a sickie. May boasts that she is someone who doesn’t give up, and she proved it today as she limped to the end of her speech. But it is hard - no, impossible - not to see this, at least to an extent, as a metaphor for premiership that is struggling and running out of things to say. That is particularly harsh for May because, for once, she did have something to tell us. The first 15 minutes or so, as she talked about the election, and her grandmother who was in service, was good. She managed just about the right mix of determination and contrition and, although the “British dream” is a hackneyed theme, she personalised it well. In policy terms, there were two significant announcements: on housebuilding and on an energy price cap. Both could have come straight out of an Ed Miliband speech, and in this respect the speech confirms that it is Labour that is setting the agenda. The housing announcement does not seem to live up to the billing it received overnight in the Sun, and we have had little detail on the energy price cap plan so far, and so the speech does not really fill the gap in the Conservative party’s domestic policy agenda (see 10.47am). But it is a move in the right direction. Will this be enough to reset May’s fortunes? Unless having most of the nation feeling sorry for you can boost your ratings, almost certainly not. But she has got through conference without Boris Johnson resigning, or the party falling apart, and so it could have been worse. Here is a shot showing the missing “F”. (See 12.50pm.) May is now winding up. She is in politics to make a difference, she says. Now is the time to fulfil our duty to the British people. And that’s it. Oh dear. Now the ‘f’ on the slogan behind May (BUILDING A COUNTRY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE) has fallen off. May says we are a nation of dreamers, “with the capacity to deliver those dreams too”. Cities like Manchester fired the industrial revolution, she says. Britain discovered DNA, and the lithium-ion battery, which powers all laptops and phones. And in Manchester graphene was developed, leading to two scientists winning the Nobel prize. She says George Osborne was right to back the ‘northern powerhouse’. She will back it too. May praises the way ordinary people rushed to help after the Manchester Arena attack. Above all, we saw a community coming together, she says. This image was shared around the globe, she says. May is now talking about the terror attack in Manchester. (Her voice, which has been holding up for the last few minutes, now seems to be getting very faint.) May says we must look at how we conduct politics in this country. There is a big problem when an MP from one party refuses to be friends with someone from another. (She is referring to Labour’s Laura Pidcock.) She says there is a problem when a political journalist needs bodyguards to do her job. And there is a problem when one of the major parties is “riven with the stain of antisemitism”. A picture of the P45 handed to May has found its way on to social media May turns to Scotland. She says she takes comfort from the fact that “the general election saw the threat of nationalism set back”. May summarises the tuition fee proposals announced earlier this week. And she turns to energy prices, saying the government will publish a draft bill next week for an energy cap, implementing the manifesto promise. May says the government will publish draft legislation for an energy price cap next week. May turns to housing. She says the government will fix the broken housing market. The election result showed people think not enough is being done to address this. “We’ve listened and we’ve learnt,” she says. May announces an extra £2bn to be spend on affordable housing - taking the government’s total affordable housing budget to almost £9bn. She says the government will encourage councils to bid for this money. So, if you have been waiting for a council home, “help is on the way”. May says it is a matter of great sadness to her that she and her husband could not have children. But I believe in the dream that life should be better for the next generation as much as any mother. Any father. Any grandfather. May defends aid spending. But she says it is “absurd” that international rules mean the aid budget should not be used to help the hurricane victims in the British Overseas Territories. She says if Britain has to change the rules on international aid to stop this being a problem “then that’s what we will do”. May calls for change to the rules on international aid spending so that aid money can be used to help relatively wealthy countries hit by natural disasters. Prankster Simon Brodkin disrupted Theresa May’s speech at the Conservative conference, waving a P45 at the prime minister on the podium before being tackled by security guards. Brodkin, who is also known as Lee Nelson and famously showered then-Fifa president Sepp Blatter with fake banknotes, was dragged out of the hall pursued by journalists. “Boris told me to do it,” he said, referring to the foreign secretary. A scrum of photographers descended around him, as well as members and security guards who began chanting “out, out, out” as May was forced to pause her speech, tripping over her words In the scrum, several cameramen tripped over as he was taken down the steps of the conference hall and into the security area May restarted her speech with a quip that she would like to give a P45 to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, receiving a standing ovation from members in the hall. The incident is likely to raise significant questions about the security at the conference, with Brodkin allowed to wave the P45 at May for several seconds before he was pulled away. May says some young people worry that Brexit means the UK is turning its back on the world. But the government is choosing a global Britain instead, she says. Britain will cooperate with other nations tackling problems like mass migration, modern slavery and climate change. We will provide a moral lead in the world, and set an example for others. May says the UK will continue to spend 2% of GDP on defence. And it will lead the world cracking down on modern slavery. We must bring this outrage to an end. May says the government will extend the same energy to skills training. For the first time, Britain will get “a first-class technical education system”. May says the government will continue to reform education and skills training. School reforms are working, she says. But there is more to do. It is not good enough that people in the north have less chance of attending a good school than someone in the south. The government will extend free schools, “not because our ideology says so, but because free schools work, and it is the right thing to do”. May says it is time to focus on the next big economic challenge. As the world’s leading advocates for free markets, the UK will pursue new free market deals with countries around the world. May starts again, but the cough comes back. She says this shows how good the chancellor’s cough sweet was. Members are applauding – stretching it out so that May has time for her voice to recover. May says the NHS is the “very essence of our solidarity in our United Kingdom”. She says the NHS that has been there for her. It was the NHS that diagnosed her type 1 diabetes, she says. She thanks NHS staff for their dedication. May says the Tories have invested in the NHS and upheld its principles “through more years in government than any other”. May says wealth creators generate the taxes that pay for our public services. When politicians offer the earth, disillusionment with politics grows. The government will adopt a balanced approach, she says. (This is excruciating to watch.) Philip Hammond gives her a throat sweet. That’s the chancellor giving away something for free, she says. May is now getting a standing ovation. May says the government is on course to get the economy back on track. The coughing is getting worse. May has now stopped. (People are feeling sorry for her.) May, who has had a cold this week, is now starting to cough a lot. And her voice is getting weaker. (All a bit reminiscent of Iain Duncan Smith.) May says she knows EU citizens are nervous. But she has a message for them. You are welcome here. May is now talking about Brexit. She says she finds some negotiations frustrating. But if we approach them in the right spirit, “I am confident that we will find a deal that works for Britain and Europe too.” May is now back on her text. She says Corbyn thinks we should take Venezuela as a role model. No, Jeremy Corbyn. (That was intended to be an ‘Oh, Jeremy Corbyn’ joke, but it did not come across like that.) May’s comeback was rather good. But she was momentarily thrown. When the person approached her, she talked about “run on the ground” instead of “run on the pound”. May says she was about to talk about someone she would like to give a P45 to, and that’s Jeremy Corbyn. Someone hands May a P45. May stumbles over a word, and then stops her speech. There is silence for a bit, then applause. It looks like the protester has been removed. May says the Tories must defend free and open markets “with all our might”. The Tories have a vision of an open, global Britain, “while our opponents flrit with a foreign policy of neutrality”. May says the free and open market system helped to bring the downfall of communism. It spread freedom. So don’t try and tell me that free markets are no longer fit for purpose ... The free market ... remains the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created. May says the Tories must win the battle of ideas again. The country is under attack from militant forces who preach hate, she says. And the market economy is being called into question “by those who would imperil our future by adopting the failed experiments of the past”. May says mental health is a priority for her. May announces review of the Mental Health Act. It will be conducted by Prof Sir Simon Wessely, she says. May says as prime minister she ordered the racial disparity unit. BME people have a higher risk of illness that requires a transplant, she says. May says an opt-out organ donation system will be introduced in England, instead of the current opt-in one. (Wales has already adopted an opt-out system, and Jeremy Corbyn committed Labour to doing the same for England at last week’s Labour conference.) May says she wants to make a difference for people whose voices are not heard. Like the families of the 96 people killed at Hillsborough. Or the victims and survivors of sexual abuse. Or Alexander Paul, a young black man who spoke at conference three years ago about continually being stopped by police. She says she took action. The number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by two thirds. She says Paul was diagnosed with brain cancer and died in June. Let us remember his courage in speaking out, she says. May says people ask why she puts herself through this. She does this to “root out injustice and give everyone in our country a voice”, she says. May says the party cannot stand still. Change is constant, as Disraeli said. May says the party had to deal with the crash. But it did not just do that. She lists various achievements: Income tax cuts. 4 million people not paying tax. Employment at record high. Income inequality at its lowest level for 30 years. More women in work than ever. Over 11,000 more doctors in the NHS. May says the party must renew that dream. That is what drives her, she says. Whenever we are tested as a nation, the Tories step up to the plate. May says her grandmother was a ladies’ maid, a servant. She worked hard, and wanted her family to get on. And her grandchildren include three professors and a prime minister. This dream is her story too, she says. She says people think she is not emotional. She does not mind being called the ice maiden - “although perhaps George Osborne did take the analogy a little too far”. May says the party has to renew the dream that says each generation can do better than the last. It is the dream that means the son of a bus driver from Pakistan can serve in a cabinet. May says she called the election. The party won its highest share of the vote for years. But they did not win a majority. The campaign was too scripted, she says. She says she takes responsibility. I am sorry. But the election showed that this dream feels distant, she says. It feels “inceasingly out of reach”. May says British dream “increasingly out of reach”. Theresa May arrives on the stage. She starts by saying a little over 40 years ago, in a village in Oxfordshire, she joined the party. She joined because it had the ideas to build a better Britain. At its heart was a simple promise: that each generation could build a better future, could live the British dream. Badenoch has finished. A video is now being shown before May starts. Badenoch says she would not have been selected either without help from Women2Win, a group in the party strongly backed by Theresa May. Badenoch says in 2010, when she stood as a candidate, she was told the Tories would never pick her for a winnable seat. Then, when she went for Saffron Walden, she was told she would not get it, she says. But it is the Conservatives who are the party of opportunity, she says, adding that she has never experienced discrimination in the Conservative party. She says she could not have got to where she is now without the support of white, middle-aged males. Kemi Badenoch, the new MP for Saffron Walden, is introducing Theresa May. Badenoch was elected to parliament for the first time in June. Her maiden speech got rave reviews in some quarters. She says only in Britain could a girl move to the UK aged 16, instantly be accepted as British, and then be elected as an MP. Theresa May is due to start her speech any minute now. There have been claims at the Conservative conference that the average age of members is now 72. But according to Prof Tim Bale, who is involved in a project studying party membership, the average age is actually 57. Gavin Williamson, the hedgehog-loving chief whip (at least, according to this Radio 4 profile), gave the speech opening this morning’s conference session. CCHQ have not released the text of his speech, which is a shame because it included a memorable joke. Being a whip was about using carrot and stick approaches, he said. He said he was not a big fan of using sticks. But “it is amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot”. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has admitted that the Tory conference started off “flat”. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg thinks Rudd is being diplomatic. This report, from my colleague Adam Vaughan in June, explains some of the background to Theresa May’s energy price cap zig-zag. May included a plan for an energy price cap in the manifesto. But, after the election, the full version of the planned seemed to get dropped. It was not included in the Queen’s speech, which instead had a much more modest proposal on energy prices. The decision not to include a full energy price cap in the Queen’s speech was seen as a sign of Philip Hammond’s increased authority as chancellor after the election. The Treasury was very wary of the idea. It was included in the manifesto partly because it was enthusiastically backed by Nick Timothy, May’s then co-chief of staff. Timothy, who frequently clashed with Hammond, resigned the day after the general election. But perhaps May has started listening to him again. Yesterday, in a Sun column about what May should say in her speech, he said that the Tories should “cap energy bills and reform the market to keep costs down in the long term”. Centrica shares are now down 5%, and SSE shares down 2.5%, in response to the news about the energy price cap proposal. Theresa May will announce new energy price cap legislation in her speech, Bloomberg reports. Greg Clark, the energy secretary, has confirmed that, Bloomberg says. Centrica shares are down 3% as a result, the Sun’s Steve Hawkes says. Theresa May’s speech is yet to come. But we have had three days of Tory conferencing already, as well as some indication as to what May will say, and so it is reasonable to draw some conclusions. Here are 10 things we’ve learnt. 1 - For a party of government, the Conservatives are perilously short of ideas. May did have an agenda at the election but the loss of her majority meant that much of that has been ditched (Labour released a briefing document this week saying more than 40% of Tory manifesto promises – 181 out of 447 – have been dropped or shelved) and there is very little evidence so far of an alternative domestic agenda. May’s housing announcement (see 8.40am) may or may not turn out to be transformative, but otherwise what has been striking has been the paucity of policy thinking on bread-and-butter issues like schools and health, on crisis areas like social care, or on the problems of the future, like automation. May’s difficulties are compounded by the fact that the government is still running a deficit and can only be confident of getting radical legislation through the Commons with opposition support. 2 - The Conservatives are desperate to win back young voters - but may be missing the big problem. Age, not class, has become the key divide in British politics and the few significant announcements we have had, on tuition fees, help to buy and council houses, have been aimed at the under-40s. Pensioners, by contrast, have not had a mention. But on their own they might not be enough. These are retail offers, but there is some evidence that the problem is cultural, and that young voters are turning away from the Tories because ... 3 - The Conservative party has become the Brexit party. At the time of the referendum it was a coalition, with members predominantly but not overwhelmingly pro-Brexit and the leadership predominantly but not overwhelmingly against. Now it looks like an enthusiastic pro-Brexit party. In the hall only Brexit really seems to get them going and the most popular fringe meetings have been those addressed by hardcore Brexiteers. MPs say that pro-remain members have stayed away, and that some are leaving the party altogether. 4 - The prospect of Jacob Rees-Mogg becoming next party leader is not quite as fanciful as it seemed in the summer. Rees-Mogg has been the undoubted star of the fringe, and the queues to get into meetings he is addressing have been longer than anyone can remember at a Tory conference. The parallels are not exact, and the Conservative leadership rules are different, but Moggmania is reminiscent of the buzz generated by Jeremy Corbyn in the early summer of 2015. 5 - But the prospect of Boris Johnson becoming leader has diminished. His freelance Brexit policy-making has boosted his standing with party members, but Conservative party rules mean leadership candidates have to get through an MPs’ filter before members vote on the final two, and Johnson’s antics have gone down very, very badly with his colleagues. Because he has been perceived as disloyal, even some Brexiteers have been criticising him. In a good blog Channel 4 News’s Gary Gibbon suggests Johnson’s core support in the Commons is now down to about 30 MPs. 6 - As a campaigning organisation the Conservative party has significant problems. The party has had to deny claims membership is down to 100,000, which would put in on a par with the Lib Dems’. (Damian Green said membership was “around 120,,000”, although some members have their doubts.) In the past having few members did not stop the party winning elections, but in June the Tories were overwhelmed by Labour on social media and on the ground and now, as people have been discussing at fringe meetings, the fabled election-winning machine looks knackered. To make matters worse, no one seems to be investing much time working out what to do about it - perhaps because the party leader is consumed by Brexit and does not expect to be around to worry about the next election. 7 - The Conservatives have not yet found convincing arguments to undermine Labour. Until the election they concentrated on depicting Jeremy Corbyn as a terrorist sympathiser. That didn’t work, and at this conference they have switched to the economy, giving us endless references to the 1970s and Venezuela. It takes time to work out whether or not political messages are effective, but there is no evidence yet to suggest that this attack line is hitting home. 8 - Tory relations with business are strained. A party conference speech from a Conservative chancellor almost always gets a warm reception from business groups, but this year they were much more critical than usual. Big business did not want Brexit, and this to a large extent explains the problem. Philip Hammond’s call for businesses not to “collaborate” with Labour also seems to have backfired. 9 - The Conservatives have abandoned the austerity narrative. Three years ago Ed Miliband was ridiculed by the Tories after failing to mention the deficit in his party conference speech. The deficit it still with us, but the Tories can see that people are fed up of anti-austerity and it has hardly had a mention all conference. Instead May is now talking about taking a “balanced approach” to the economy - whatever that means. 10 - There is no obvious successor to May. There were expectations that the party conference would turn into a leadership beauty parade, but cabinet ministers have not been using their speeches to set themselves up as alternatives to May (except Johnson, a bit) and none of the mainstream Tories from the younger generation touted as possible future leaders have made much of a mark either. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has said he cannot defend what Boris Johnson said about Sirte, the BBC’s Norman Smith reports. On the Today programme this morning Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said she hoped there would be “some serious numbers” in Theresa May’s announcement on council homes. She said: We do need to see some serious numbers being talked about today, but if we do, this could be an absolute watershed because this is what we desperately need ... We’ve got about 1.2 million people on the waiting list currently for social housing. Honestly, from what we see at Shelter every day it’s not possible to exaggerate the level of misery that that represents, and we have people pushed into the private rented sector, which is completely unaffordable due to a combination of social security cuts on the one hand, low wages, and also then the huge cost anyway within the property market. Andrew Whitaker, planning director of the Home Builders Federation, told the programme that land needed to be made available alongside additional council powers. He said: Of course what we must see is additional land coming forward. We can’t just substitute tenure, so we can’t just use the land that the private sector would have used to develop housing. Don’t forget, the private sector already cross-subsidises affordable housing, but we must have more land and councils must be given the tools in order to deliver their own housing. The Sun’s Steve Hawkes says Centrica shares are down this morning. As the Guardian reported last week, more than 70 Conservative MPs have signed a cross-party letter urging Theresa May to impose a price cap on energy bills. That is a number she cannot afford to ignore, and so it seems reasonable to assume she will have something to say on this subject this morning. Here are the extracts from Theresa May’s speech released by Number 10 in advance. She will say: So let us do our duty by Britain. Let us shape up and give the country the government it needs. For beyond this hall, beyond the gossip pages of the newspapers, and beyond the streets, corridors and meeting rooms of Westminster, life continues – the daily lives of ordinary working people go on. And they must be our focus today. Not worrying about our job security, but theirs. Not addressing our concerns, but the issues, the problems, the challenges, that concern them. Not focusing on our future, but on the future of their children and their grandchildren – doing everything we can to ensure their tomorrow will be better than our today. That is what I am in politics for. To make a difference. To change things for the better. To hand on to the next generation a country that is stronger, fairer and more prosperous. None of this will be easy. There will be obstacles and barriers along the way. But it has never been my style to hide from a challenge, to shrink from a task, to retreat in the face of difficulty, to give up and turn away. And it is when tested the most that we reach deep within ourselves and find that our capacity to rise to the challenge before us may well be limitless. That is the story of our party. That is the story of our country. And that is the resolve and determination we need as we turn to face the future today. So let us go forward together. Let us fulfil our duty to Britain. Damian McBride, who was Gordon Brown’s communications chief and who now works for the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has point out that the speechwriter has pilfered a phrase from the West Wing. McBride has directed this at the Times because he is clearly still angry about a Times story 10 years ago accusing Brown of lifting phrases from Bill Clinton and Al Gore in his Labour conference speech in 2007. Here is video of Boris Johnson making his “dead bodies” remark. And here he is leaving his hotel this morning for a run with Tony Gallagher, editor of the Sun. Theresa May will wrap up the Conservative conference with her keynote speech and, after three days of relatively lacklustre policy announcements, she has a potentially big promise - a major council house building programme. HuffPost UK and the Sun had the story last night and Damian Green, the first secretary of state, has confirmed it in interviews this morning. He told the Today programme a few minutes ago that May would unveil measures in her speech to “make it easier for councils to build new houses for rent”. But we have not had any detail yet of what is being proposed, so at this point it is hard to assess how transformative this will be. But, as is customary when May is about to give a speech, she has found herself overshadowed by Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary. This, from Sky’s Beth Rigby, sums it up well. After his speech yesterday there was a brief two hours when people stopped calling for Johnson’s resignation. But, after he said a war-torn Libyan city only has to “clear the dead bodies away” to become a world-class tourist and business destination, the calls for him to go resumed. Two Conservative MPs took to Twitter last night to say he should go. And the Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston posted this. This morning, on the Today programme, Wollaston went a bit further and said Johnson should “consider his position”. In response, Green has said that Johnson’s language was not acceptable. He told the BBC: Let me be clear: it was not an acceptable use of ... it was not a sensitive use of language ... As I say, we all need to be sensitive in our use of language, particularly in situations like that. Green did not call for Johnson to apologise, but on the Today programme Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, was speculating that we would get an apology before May starts her speech. But last night Johnson did not seem inclined to back down. He posted these messages on Twitter. And, according Rigby and the BBC’s Norman Smith, Johnson does not seem very repentant this morning. There is only one item on the agenda today. May is due to speak at about 11.20am. But before she speaks the conference will also hear from Gavin Williamson, the chief whip. Before May speaks I will also write up a post on 10 things we’ve learnt from the Conservative conference. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

The review, released on Thursday, audited the compliance of state and territory firearms legislation to the 1996 NFA, implemented after the Port Arthur massacre, and the additional restrictions on handguns introduced in 2002. It argued that divergence from the resolutions of the NFA significantly weakened the national gun control framework. “This report finds that, on balance, both non-compliance from day one and two decades of political pressure have steadily reduced restrictions and undermined the NFA’s original intent,” it said. That conclusion is repeated from three previous formal reviews, conducted in 1997, 1999 and 2007, which found the spirit and intent of the NFA resolutions had not been fully implemented. “Four consecutive formal reports have now found that no Australian state or territory has at any stage fully complied with the 1996 or 2002 firearm resolutions, which collectively formed the national firearms agreement,” the report said. It added that “compliance with the most important provisions of the NFA remained substantially intact”. The NFA was reviewed last year and the Council of Australian Governments agreed on an updated version in February. The audit was conducted by the Sydney University adjunct professor Philip Alpers and Amelie Rossetti, from GunPolicy.org. It found that despite the requirement in the NFA that firearms licences not be available to anyone under the age of 18, all Australian jurisdictions allowed children to use firearms in some circumstances and state-by-state age limits varied from 10 to 16. It also found that some provisions, like the requirement for a 28-day cooling off period for purchasing a new firearm, had been rolled back. Victoria and Western Australia only stipulate a cooling off period for the first purchase of a firearm, while in New South Wales the laws have been loosened to remove the cooling off period for the second or subsequent firearm bought by a person who already has a firearm of that type, provided it is a category A or category B weapon. Category A firearms include shotguns – provided they are not pump-action shotguns – air rifles and rimfire rifles. Category B firearms include centre-fire rifles and shotgun/centre-fire rifle combinations, provided they are not self-loading, and muzzle-loading firearms other than pistols. NSW has also allowed the “limited use” of silencers, despite them being a prohibited weapon; extended permission to use semi-automatic firearms for shooters whose occupation is not pest control; permits for people on safari-tours to use a firearm without a firearms licence; and has included membership in a hunting club as a “genuine reason” for firearm possession. The report said the requirement that a person have a “genuine reason” and “genuine need” for both having a firearms licence and possessing a particular type of gun, which was the backbone of the 1996 reforms, was “generally complied with” by all Australian states and territories. However, it said the conditions were less stringent in some jurisdictions than they were in 1996. Gun owners do not need to demonstrate a specific genuine need for a category B firearms licence in South Australia and Victoria, and for some categories of firearm Queensland legislation only stipulates there be a genuine need to authorise the purchase of a firearm but not to approve a firearms licence. WA is the only state to have tightened conditions around access to category D weapons, which include rifles with a magazine capacity of more than 10 rounds and self-loading and pump-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of more than five rounds. Category D weapons are only available for official purposes. Queensland, SA, Victoria and the Northern Territory all authorise possession of a handgun during the first six months of a handgun license, despite the 2002 handgun rules stipulating graduated access. All jurisdictions restrict the number and type of handguns a person may own in the first 12 months of their gun license. The report said that the examples it cites as exceptions to the NFA resolutions applied “only in limited circumstances” but “arguably opens the door to further dilution of the national agreement”. “Attempts to undermine and circumvent the provisions of the NFA are persistent and have often been successful,” it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/05/australias-politics-only-barrier-to-clean-energy-system-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T17:00:00Z","webTitle":"Australia's politics only barrier to clean energy system, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/australias-politics-only-barrier-to-clean-energy-system-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/australias-politics-only-barrier-to-clean-energy-system-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"Australia's politics only barrier to clean energy system, report finds","bodyText":"Politics is the only barrier to modernising Australia’s ageing electricity system, according to a synthesis report by the Climate Council. The council found there was agreement among a series of major independent reports that there were no technological or economic barriers to a clean, secure, affordable and reliable grid. The Climate Council report coincides with international law firm Pinsent Masons’ release of research findings that 90% of energy utility companies around the world are actively seeking acquisitions or joint ventures with companies that implement smart energy technologies like batteries, vehicle-to-grid technology and smart meters, but policy uncertainty is limiting investment in Australia. Within a decade, more than one-third of Australia’s coal plants in the national electricity market will be more than 50 years old – after which the vast majority of coal plants fail to operate. Reports by the independent operator of the grid, Aemo, CSIRO and the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, found there were no technical barriers to modernising the grid, the Climate Council report found. “Combining low-cost wind and solar PV [photovoltaic] with other renewable energy technologies, such as solar thermal, hydro and biomass plants, can provide round-the-clock or on-demand power, as well as meeting technical requirements for grid stability,” said the report, authored by Andrew Stock, a Climate Council councillor who previously spent four decades in the energy industry. The report said combining those technologies with grid-scale batteries, pumped hydro and heat storage would would increase the reliability of the system, as well as add competition to the market. There was also a large degree of consensus among the surveyed reports that modernising the system in that way would increase reliability in the face of climate change and increased extreme weather. Relying on a large number of smaller distributed renewable generators, rather than a small number of massive fossil-fuel generators, meant single outages in the system caused by wild weather would be less disruptive. “Generating and storing power closer to where it is needed – for example, using solar and storage technologies – can reduce risks of grid failure for critical infrastructure,” the Climate Council report said. The surveyed reports also found renewable energy would push down energy prices for consumers. One CSIRO report this year concluded a zero-emissions grid by 2050 would save the average household $414 a year compared with a business-as-usual approach. “There’s no disputing it – fossil-fuel technology is obsolete, expensive and unreliable,” Stock said. “It’s time to look to the future with an energy system fit for the 21st century.” The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, have been unable to get a climate and energy policy through the party room, leaving the industry in limbo. This means businesses have been discouraged from investing in new electricity generation because the federal government can give them no confidence about future policy that would affect their investments. The Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said the lack of a bipartisan policy was the only barrier remaining. “The nation’s leading energy experts, scientists and major authorities are all in agreement – Australia is ready to switch to a modern grid, powered by renewables and storage,” she said. “However, the only thing stopping this is political will.” The vast majority of large energy companies globally also appear keen to invest millions in smart-grid technologies that would enable the transition. Pinsent Masons surveyed 250 senior-level executives from 200 energy generation and distribution companies (and investors in those markets) with revenues over US$1bn across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific. The firm found 90% of the utility companies in the survey were planning a joint venture with, or an acquisition of, a smart-grid technology company. Australia was among the top five countries that the surveyed businesses were targeting for investment, but was being limited by lack of policy clarity. Uncertainty and lack of legislation were highlighted as the biggest investment blockers for 13% of utilities in the survey. Nordic countries took the top place for attractiveness for investment, partly because energy policies there were clear. “The Nordics are not only ahead in the technology bit, but their policies are also the best,” said one investor quoted in the report. “They have gradually changed their energy consumption and have successfully achieved their transformation targets, which are just increasing year-on-year as their policies are in favour of consumers. Businesses are benefiting either way with growth and rising interests of new consumers.” A chief financial officer of an Australian utility was quoted as saying: “Countries without a cohesive energy policy are usually in turmoil when it comes to issues around energy distribution and management. For an investor looking to enter that market with smart energy solutions, it means a lot of uncertainty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/04/bob-hawke-says-marriage-survey-the-worst-economic-decision-by-any-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T19:26:41Z","webTitle":"Bob Hawke says marriage survey the worst economic decision by any PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/bob-hawke-says-marriage-survey-the-worst-economic-decision-by-any-pm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/bob-hawke-says-marriage-survey-the-worst-economic-decision-by-any-pm","fields":{"headline":"Bob Hawke says marriage survey the worst economic decision by any PM","bodyText":"Bob Hawke has lashed Malcolm Turnbull’s $122m postal survey on same-sex marriage as “the worst economic decision made by any Australian prime minister since federation”. Hawke made the comment at the National Press Club on Wednesday, joining the former Labor foreign affairs minister Gareth Evans in attacking the survey during the question and answer session of Evans’s speech about his book Incorrigible Optimist. But his intervention was blasted by another former prime minister later on Wednesday, who accused the Labor veteran of suffering from memory loss, and recalled Hawke’s previous characterisation of a pensioner who was critical of him as “a silly old bugger.” Tony Abbott, who is pushing for a no vote in the postal survey, told 2GB Hawke now needed to look in the mirror. “You know I have a lot of respect for Bob Hawke as prime minister,” Abbott said. “He was a good prime minister by Labor standards, but some years ago he called a pensioner who gave him a hard time in a shopping centre, I think the phrase he used was a silly old bugger.” “I think it’s time Bob looked in the mirror, frankly.” Abbott said Hawke was suffering a memory lapse about wasteful Labor expenditure. “I think Bob Hawke is suffering from memory loss,” he said. “Let’s face it, it was the former Gillard Labor government which spent $16bn on school halls – grotesquely overpriced school halls – including on schools which already had them.” The stimulus package, including the school refurbishment program, was actually legislated while Kevin Rudd was prime minister, not during Gillard’s tenure. During his appearance at the National Press Club, Hawke argued that the postal survey “cannot produce a decision” because a bill to legislate marriage equality “still requires a vote of the parliament”. “Whatever the result of the vote is, it costs 122 million bloody dollars,” he said. “Can you imagine a prime minister would make a decision in these stringent times, spending $122m on a process that can’t produce the result when you could do so much to reduce the gaps [in Aboriginal health and education]? “Without any question, it’s the worst economic decision made by any Australian prime minister.” Evans said that, while Turnbull’s instincts were “decent and civilised”, he had “sold himself completely to the trogs [troglodytes] in his party” on both marriage and energy policy. He said it was “screamingly obvious” the Australian community wanted same-sex marriage legalised. “That is where the politicians should be prepared to go without resorting to the various divisive and indirect means of demonstrating that,” he said. “It hasn’t been a happy time for policy-making and, you know, both sides of politics have contributed something to that. “But I think, at the moment, the real worries are much less on the opposition side, where I have to say I am impressed by the quality of the opposition frontbench.” Evans said it was “obvious” the way forward on energy policy was a clean energy target, as recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, or some variation of one, but it was difficult for Turnbull and the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, to deliver. Labor, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team twice blocked a compulsory attendance vote on marriage equality in the Senate, leading to the Turnbull government launching the postal survey to fulfil its policy to give Australians a say on the marriage law. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Tuesday that an estimated 57.5% of enrolled Australians have already cast their votes in the postal survey, with a month still to go. On Wednesday, Turnbull told the ABC’s AM program that the 57.5% turnout was a “great outcome”. “What that tells you is that Australians wanted to have their say,” he said, accusing Labor of “playing politics with the issue”. “Already, as of last week, just under 60% have participated,” Turnbull said. “That’s a very high participation rate but it will obviously get higher. “So I think it is a ringing endorsement of the government’s decision to give every Australian their say on this issue.” At a press conference in Melbourne, Bill Shorten said he was pleased at the turnout but said Turnbull “could have saved $122m” by not having the postal survey and noting it had been “an ordeal for a lot of Australians”. Asked if he had underestimated the Australian people’s desire to have their say, he replied: “Not at all. I don’t underestimate the Australian people in any fashion.” “But what I do believe is $122m could have been spent better, it could have funded thousands of teachers or nurses.” Shorten said Australians told him they supported marriage equality but they wanted parliament to “get on with it”. “I think most Australians, when they stop to think about it, think parliament should just do its job because, at the end of the day, this survey will tell us what we already knew and, at the end of the day, the parliament will have a vote,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/04/mining-companies-links-with-politicians-susceptible-to-corruption-report","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T08:39:21Z","webTitle":"Mining companies' links with politicians 'susceptible to corruption' – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/04/mining-companies-links-with-politicians-susceptible-to-corruption-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/04/mining-companies-links-with-politicians-susceptible-to-corruption-report","fields":{"headline":"Mining companies' links with politicians 'susceptible to corruption' – report","bodyText":"A new report shines a critical light on the links between mining companies, lobbyists and politicians, pointing to the Indian mining giant Adani as an example of how a company with a questionable record overseas can still gain mining approval in Australia. It warns the political mining complex in Australia’s two biggest mining states, Western Australian and Queensland, is “susceptible to corruption” due to key weaknesses in their approvals regimes, including inadequate due diligence investigation into the companies and individuals applying for mining leases. It also criticises the “revolving doors” of personnel between government and industry broadly, and political donations regimes. The report, published by Transparency International Australia (TIA), Corruption Risks: Mining Approvals in Australia, was released on Wednesday. Its authors conducted 47 interviews with experts from government, industry, civil society, academics, Indigenous traditional owners and consultants in Perth and Brisbane to gather its evidence. Its list of key weaknesses in the mining approvals regimes is long. The researchers says “industry influence” is a corruption risk in Australia, particularly with regard to large infrastructure project approvals in Queensland and WA. It notes the mining industry has disclosed donations of $16.6m to major political parties over the past 10 years (2006-07 to 2015-16), and warns the under-regulated system of political donations can allow special interest groups to attempt to influence policy-making at all levels of government. It highlights the “revolving doors” of personnel between government an industry as a risk in Australia generally. It points out 191 of 538 lobbyists (35.5%) registered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, as of September 2016, were former government representatives. The researchers also warn government departments involved in the mining approvals process in Queensland and WA do not undertake adequate due diligence into the character and integrity of applicants for mining leases, including companies’ track records overseas, and investigations of their financial capacity do not involve an examination of beneficial ownership to understand who the real owners are. In Queensland, even though mining proponents are required to provide details of their environmental record, there is no requirement to report non-compliance with environmental law or breaches outside Australia. The researchers warn that this creates the risk that companies with a history of non-compliance, criminal or corrupt behaviour, a record of environmental damage, or other poor business conduct, such as human rights violations, can operate in Australia. “A number of these factors have arguably been at play in the case of Adani’s Carmichael coalmine,” the report says. “In the environmental impact assessment for the Carmichael coalmine, February 2013, the proponent Adani Mining, an Indian multinational corporation, stated that it ‘has not been subject to any proceedings under a commonwealth, state or territory law for the protection of the environment or the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources’. Yet there is evidence that Adani has failed to comply with laws and environmental permits in India. “An investigation in December 2010 by officials from the Indian Ministry of Environment Protection and Forests into the Mundra port and special economic zone operated by Adani Ports found destruction of mangroves, creek systems and natural seawater flow by reclamation, and development of a township, airport and hospital without the proper environmental records.” Guardian Australia reported last month that Adani had been accused in India of fraudulently siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars of borrowed money into overseas tax havens, by inflating invoices for an electricity project in India. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) file, compiled in 2014, mapped out a complex money trail from India through South Korea and Dubai, and eventually to an offshore company in Mauritius allegedly controlled by Vinod Adani, the older brother of the billionaire Adani Group chief executive, Gautam Adani. Vinod Adani is the director of four companies proposing to build a railway line and expand a coal port attached to Queensland’s vast Carmichael mine project. The Adani Group said in a statement to the Guardian on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and Vinod Adani that it “strongly denies the allegations of overvaluation”. This week, the ABC’s Four Corners program highlighted Adani’s troubling environmental record in India. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis also warned this week that Adani’s ambitions in Queensland faced a new risk, with the company having to refinance more than $2bn in debt on the Abbot Point coal terminal – more than it paid for the port in 2011. “While Australia has systems of transparency an accountability in place, more needs to be done to address transparency of negotiation processes and agreements, including native title parties,” Serena Lillywite, the chief executive of Transparency International Australia, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/oct/05/gerard-way-my-chemical-romance-comic-book-writer","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"My comic book romance: why Gerard Way ditched emo for ink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/05/gerard-way-my-chemical-romance-comic-book-writer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/oct/05/gerard-way-my-chemical-romance-comic-book-writer","fields":{"headline":"My comic book romance: why Gerard Way ditched emo for ink","bodyText":"It’s perhaps an exaggeration to say that comic books saved Gerard Way’s life, but they certainly played their part. “I was often quite a depressed teenager,” says the former My Chemical Romance frontman. “I didn’t even know there was such a thing as group therapy until I read about it in a Doom Patrol comic.” As a teen, New Jersey-born Way worked in a comic shop, and that particular DC comic was just finishing up its four-year run under the stewardship of writer Grant Morrison. It embodied the quirky, often grotesque feeling that a lot of early 90s comic books embraced, especially those under the “mature readers” Vertigo imprint later published by DC. Morrison’s Doom Patrol – and the run written after him by Rachel Pollack made such an impression on Way that 25 years later, when offered the opportunity to write his first comic for DC, it was a no-brainer which title he would choose. Way’s move into comics marks a significant shift – his battles with drugs and alcohol are well-documented and now firmly behind him. As, it seems, is My Chemical Romance; after four albums the band broke up in 2013. Way followed with a solo album, Hesitant Alien, the following year. But for the past two years, he’s been all about the comics. Way curates his own imprint for DC, Young Animal, for which he writes two titles: Doom Patrol and the fabulously named Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye. There are three other books and a clutch of further highly anticipated titles are set to be announced at this weekend’s New York Comic Con. Way is now firmly established in the comics world, and by no means just as some kind of slumming celebrity who fancied trying his hand at something different – he had his first pro work published at the age of 15. That was under the byline Garry Way, but difficulties with the art team meant it lasted just two issues. Then in 2007 Way began a new series, Umbrella Academy, published by the big independent company Dark Horse, a superhero book set in an alternate 1970s. The series is being adapted into a TV series by Netflix, due to be released next year. “I guess I’ve been a comics reader all my life,” says Way at the Thought Bubble comic convention in Leeds. “Certainly since I was eight years old, and I always made my own comics as a kid. I didn’t know how to write comics, I just made it up, but then if you went to comic conventions back in the day you could buy these scripts, things like Watchmen, and I learned how to write properly from them.” Way studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York, and as his band My Chemical Romance was climbing in popularity he was building his comic career at the same time. “The good thing about the Umbrella Academy period was that I was a lot younger and had lots of energy,” says Way. “And when you’re touring with a band, when you’re on the road, the downtime is insane. I like touring but one of the things I didn’t like was that it felt there was so much wasted time, so I used that time to write comic books.” Didn’t anyone say to him that he should be concentrating on being a rock star rather than building a comics career during those days? “No one ever said that,” says Way. “And my record label could have said, yeah, great, make comics and we’ll capitalise on that, we’ll publish them, but they didn’t and I was delighted to get published properly, by a company like Dark Horse, because it meant this wasn’t just a vanity project.” Umbrella Academy earned Way two of the comic industry’s biggest awards, the Eisner and the Harvey. “All those awards we won for the music …” he says. “The Eisner and the Harvey are the only ones I have out on display.” After touring his 2014 solo album, Way found himself with a burning desire to get into comics again, and at a convention in South America he met DC co-publishers Dan Didio and Jim Lee. “They said, what comic would you love to write, and straight away I said Doom Patrol,” remembers Way. “I said I wanted to tell strange stories, stories that had heart.” What Way was less keen on was getting embroiled in the finely tuned continuity that weighs down a comics universe such as DC’s, so Lee suggested Way curate his own imprint, using DC characters but apart from the usual line. Young Animal was born from that, and Way assembled a team of creators to work on characters often at the margins of DC’s output, weird and edgy ones such as Doom Patrol (Way and Nick Derington), super-spelunker Cave Carson (Way, John Rivera and Michael Oeming) and Shade (by Cecil Castellucci and Marley Zarcone), together with brand-new properties such as Jody Houser and Tommy Lee Edwards’ Mother Panic. Young Animal launched last year, and Way’s been head down on it ever since, as well as throwing around ideas for a second solo album. Inevitably, a question must be asked about My Chemical Romance. Almost five years since they split, is a reunion in the offing? “I don’t think we’re getting back together,” he says. “Everyone’s in a great place at the moment, we’re all doing our own things and we have amazing families. But no one knows what the future holds.” Not even for Young Animal. Way has been writing comics and running the imprint for two years now, with his own unique stamp on the books. The characters are the property of DC, of course, but Young Animal was always envisaged as a “pop-up imprint”, says Way, and if he decides not to apply his particular vision to the line in the future, it’s likely that DC would end the imprint. The road is perhaps clear for Way to take on the major DC properties, except he doesn’t want to (“I think I’d feel a bit intimidated to write Batman or Superman”). In fact, though, Way did once get a Batman pitch greenlit by DC, which circumstances meant he never wrote and probably never will. “I don’t feel I’m in a dark enough place to write Batman,” he says. He breaks out into a wide grin. “My life is pretty awesome right now, and I don’t particularly want to access the darkness.” Way is married to Scottish-born Lindsey (of the band Mindless Self Indulgence) and they live in LA with their eight-year-old daughter, Bandit. “I feel super-lucky right now,” he says. “I love feeling healthy and happy.” So while comics might not necessarily have saved the life of Gerard Way, they’ve certainly helped to get him to a pretty nice place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/04/donald-trump-visit-las-vegas-shooting-gun-control-democrats","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"Trump faces test of temperament in Las Vegas – and entrenched partisan divide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/donald-trump-visit-las-vegas-shooting-gun-control-democrats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/04/donald-trump-visit-las-vegas-shooting-gun-control-democrats","fields":{"headline":"Trump faces test of temperament in Las Vegas – and entrenched partisan divide","bodyText":"Donald Trump faces a test of temperament on Wednesday as he visits Las Vegas, the scene of the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, with Democrats stepping up political pressure for tighter gun laws. It has become a grim ritual for American presidents to visit the scenes of mass murder and gun violence, burdened by expectations that they will be dignified, rise above party politics and perform the unifying role of head of state. But Trump is already notorious for divisive rhetoric at key national moments, including after the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. The National Rifle Association was crucial to his election and he was the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to address its annual conference, where he vowed to defend the second amendment. Since the gunman, identified by police as Stephen Paddock, opened fire from his hotel room, killing at least 59 victims and injuring more than 500 at a country music festival on Sunday night, Trump has struck a measured tone. But on the ground in Las Vegas, where he is expected to meet the state governor and city mayor, and possibly visit survivors in hospital, there will be no shortage of opportunities for a jarring remark. On Tuesday, visiting hurricane hit Puerto Rico, he joked: “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack. But that’s fine because we’ve saved a lot of lives.” Democrats intend to throw down the gauntlet before Trump’s plane touches down by staging a high-profile event on the front steps of the US Capitol building in Washington. Congressman and civil rights veteran John Lewis and former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived a shooting in 2011, will be among those calling for the immediate passage of legislation to strengthen background checks on gun buyers, as well as creating a bipartisan select committee on gun violence. In a Republican-controlled Congress, Democrats know the odds are against them. But they think they may have an unlikely ally in Trump, whose views on gun control have shifted since he ran for president as a Republican. Past incidents – such as visceral TV images of children killed by poison gas in Syria – suggest that Trump can be swayed by direct appeals to the heart. On Tuesday the president said: “We’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.” In a floor speech, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called on Trump to bring together leaders of Congress as a sign to both sides that he is “ready and willing to address this issue of gun safety head-on”. Activists and even comedians have called on Trump, who ran as an anti-Washington outsider, to act. Late-night TV host Stephen Colbert said: “You do not owe the Republicans anything. You know the Republicans tried to stop you from being president; well screw ’em. You want to make America great again, do something the last two presidents have been unable to do: pass any kind of commonsense gun control legislation that the vast majority of Americans want.” Democrats are weary from years of political stalemate over gun control. Senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, was visibly frustrated on Tuesday when he condemned members’ “utter silence” in response to ever-rising toll of mass shootings and called their inaction “unintentional complicity”. “In the minds of these mad men when they see Congress doing absolutely nothing, shooting after shooting – they read that as quiet acceptance of the carnage,” Murphy told reporters on Capitol Hill. “It has to stop.” Joined by four colleagues, the Democratic senators outlined “a menu” of gun control measures they planned to introduce, including to expand background checks and to restrict people convicted of domestic violence from obtaining a gun. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California also plans to reintroduce a bill that would ban bump stocks and similar devices, which Murphy said he believes could attract bipartisan support. Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, cited himself as an example of how one incident can change hearts and minds. Before the 2012 massacre of 26 young children and teachers in Newtown, Connecticut, Casey opposed additional gun restrictions. He said he realised then that opposing the slate of gun control measures brought forward that session meant accepting that nothing could change. He said: “I think we have to ask ourselves the same question again. Is there nothing that we can do? No law? Nothing that we can do? … I don’t think that’s acceptable.” But there has been little sign that the horror of Las Vegas will budge congressional Republicans. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, dismissed the debate as “premature” and chastised Democrats for raising the issue of gun control so soon after the attack. “I think it’s particularly inappropriate to politicize an event like this,” McConnell said. “It just happened within the last day and a half. It’s entirely premature to be discussing legislative solutions – if any.” He added: “We’re in the middle of an investigation. We’ll see what that reveals and at the end of that will be an appropriate time to discuss it. In the meantime, our priority is tax reform.” Schumer also called on Republicans to drop a bill that would make it easier to purchase a silencer. Republicans postponed a hearing on the bill in June when members were attacked by a gunman during a congressional baseball practice. “When two mass shootings force you to delay a bill that would make those mass shootings harder to detect and stop, maybe that’s a sign you ought to let go of the bill, once and for all,” Schumer said. On Tuesday, Ryan said the bill was not currently scheduled to come to the floor. The deeply entrenched partisan divide on gun control are illustrated by two former House colleagues who were both grievously injured in mass shootings. Congressman Steve Scalise on Tuesday joined his Republican colleagues for a weekly press conference. It was his first time at the podium since returning to Washington after he was grievously injured in the June shooting. Scalise urged prayer and did not raise the issue of gun control. In a Fox News interview later on Tuesday, Martha MacCallum asked Scalise if his experience being shot on a baseball diamond had changed his views on the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right of citizens to “bear arms”. Scalise, a strong supporter of gun rights, replied: “I think it’s fortified it.” Scalise is one of only a handful of members of Congress who have been injured while serving in office. Another is Giffords, now a prominent advocate for stricter gun control.Paddock had an arsenal of 23 guns in his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel. The retiree had no criminal record and his motive remains a mystery as the criminal investigation continues. On Tuesday Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of Clark County said detectives were in contact with 64-year-old Paddock’s girlfriend Marilou Danley, who is in the Philippines and considered “a person of interest”. Trump has described Paddock as a “very, very sick individual” and said “we’re looking into him very seriously.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/oct/03/trump-in-puerto-rico-the-minute","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T21:48:06Z","webTitle":"Trump in Puerto Rico: ‘What a great job we’ve done’ | The minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/03/trump-in-puerto-rico-the-minute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/03/trump-in-puerto-rico-the-minute","fields":{"headline":"Trump in Puerto Rico: ‘What a great job we’ve done’","bodyText":"“It’s now acknowledged what a great job we’ve done,” Donald Trump told reporters on a trip to Puerto Rico.

Manchester City believe their top scorer will be out for between two and four weeks after breaking a rib in the road accident last Thursday. That timescale would rule the 29-year-old out of Argentina’s final two World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Ecuador, but could see him in contention for City’s Premier League match at home to Stoke on 14 October. However, Villani has suggested Aguero is likely to be out for longer than expected. He told www.tycsports.com: “He’s feeling very bad because he was really looking forward to coming to play and this incident, which had nothing to do with him, left him out of the two games. He’s going to be off the pitch for a month and a half. “He can’t move in his house, nor get in and out of the car. He seemed very down to me because we wanted to be here.” A six-week lay-off would rule Agüero out of both of City’s Champions League group games against Napoli, as well as four more Premier League games, including the home match with Arsenal on 5 November. Agüero suffered the injury in Amsterdam at 11pm on Thursday when his taxi hit a lamp-post as the striker was being driven to the airport to fly back to Manchester. Agüero was on a day off and had been attending a concert of the Colombian singer Maluma. The incident occurred less than 48 hours before the Premier League game at Chelsea, which City won 1-0."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/03/stan-kroenke-makes-525-offer-usmanov-arsenal-shares","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T18:27:44Z","webTitle":"Stan Kroenke makes £525m offer to buy Alisher Usmanov’s Arsenal shares","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/03/stan-kroenke-makes-525-offer-usmanov-arsenal-shares","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/03/stan-kroenke-makes-525-offer-usmanov-arsenal-shares","fields":{"headline":"Stan Kroenke makes £525m offer to buy Alisher Usmanov’s Arsenal shares","bodyText":"Arsenal’s majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, has bid almost £525m to buy out Alisher Usmanov, the second-largest shareholder who has tried several times to wrest control of the club. Only last May the American resisted Usmanov’s latest attempt at a takeover, and within the past couple of weeks this slow-burning struggle for full control took a twist as Kroenke offered £28,000 per share for the Russian’s stake. Kroenke owns 67% of Arsenal; Usmanov has a 30.4% stake. The remaining shares belong to minority shareholders, many of whom have preserved a small holding for decades, even passing down the generations. Having two main investors who do not have a working relationship, despite having been on the scene for the past 10 years and who appear to hold one another in low regard, is not a healthy situation. Usmanov has never been able to secure a seat on the board or influence any decisions and both men know this will continue with the current awkwardly cut pieces of the Arsenal cake. Both parties have tried to force a change. If Kroenke succeeds in his attempt to buy out Usmanov, initially reported by the website Arseblog, it would take his percentage to 97%. It would put him in a position to squeeze out the minority shareholders and presents the risk Arsenal would become a privately owned business. The consequences of that are troubling for the 130-year-old club. As well as removing any requirement for the publication of accounts or an AGM, the option of registering the business in the United States, to be based under Kroenke’s KSE umbrella in Delaware, would open up. There would also be no internal barriers to using Arsenal as leverage in deals as the Glazer family did with Manchester United. These board-level manoeuvrings have been watched with interest by a consortium of longstanding Arsenal supporters who found heavyweight financial backing and tried to throw their hat into the ring three times during the past year. They made two inquiries to Kroenke at a valuation of £2bn for the club – £32,000 per share – and made a third attempt at a breakthrough in June via an olive branch idea to buy out Usmanov but that was dependent on a seat on the board and collaboration with Kroenke to create a more unified environment around the club. The Missouri-born entrepreneur turned down all three presentations. A spokesman for the consortium, which has been in communication with Kroenke and Usmanov for close to a year, expressed concerns about the situation. “We are owned 97% by two very wealthy individuals but it is a disappointment that they have never managed to get together and see eye to eye to move the club forward. The benefit of their wealth and experience could have been felt in unison but Arsenal has not been able to gain from it.” The consortium’s bid to try to make a difference and lift the club remains on the table. “We absolutely retain an interest,” the spokesman said. “We are a group of experienced local business folk who have had a longstanding involvement with Arsenal. We came together three years ago with a vision to dislodge the impasse that exists with the current ownership. We wanted to find an alternative. Our group have spent three years searching for the right backer. After our own due diligence we were delighted to have found that a year ago. We have gone out to find the money for Mr Kroenke and Mr Usmanov to make a huge profit and for us to get the club back where it should be challenging at the top. “If Kroenke were to get to 97 % he can force Arsenal into becoming a completely private company. That would be a major concern for everyone involved in Arsenal. At that point transparency would be a real minimum.” Ashley Brown, chief executive of Supporters Direct, sees this as part of a worrying trend. “It is clear that too many clubs are moving in a similar direction, taking clubs further away from fans and treating them primarily as businesses. The best owners recognise that they are custodians of a football club loved by thousands and operating at the heart of their communities.” Usmanov may be tempted to sell given his lack of input at Arsenal. Arsenal’s accounts will be arriving through shareholders’ letterboxes on Wednesday and the AGM is on 26 October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/little-library-cafe/2017/oct/06/little-library-cookbook-extract-narnia-marmalade-roll-recipe","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T11:00:51Z","webTitle":"Novel eating: new recipes from your favourite fiction | Book extract","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/little-library-cafe/2017/oct/06/little-library-cookbook-extract-narnia-marmalade-roll-recipe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/little-library-cafe/2017/oct/06/little-library-cookbook-extract-narnia-marmalade-roll-recipe","fields":{"headline":"Novel eating: new recipes from your favourite fiction","bodyText":"I have always been a highly suggestible, hungry reader. When discovering a new book, or revisiting an old favourite, my mind wanders, imagining what food the characters are enjoying would taste like. A passing mention of a ripe summer strawberry, a fragrant roast chicken or a warming mug of hot chocolate sends me straight to the kitchen, book still in hand. When I wasn’t in the kitchen, my childhood was spent in books. On weekends, my dad would push me out of our front door towards the park, encouraging me to run around in the fresh air until dusk. Little did he know that I always had a book tucked into my bike shorts, and would instead hide under a tree somewhere, losing myself in Jane Austen’s Regency England, Enid Blyton’s seaside Devon or Harper Lee’s Depression-era Alabama. My childhood was idyllic, but I spent much of it in parallel fictional worlds. As I grew up and then moved away from Australia, the books I had read as a child became imbued with a strong sense of nostalgia. I found that I could often remember exactly where I was when I had read each book for the first time. Far away from home, these memories provided real comfort. I discovered that the passages utmost in my memory were often food-related. And so, as well as reading them, I started cooking from them too. As I started writing about these literary/culinary links, people began to get in touch, telling me of their favourite fictional food memories. So many of us seemed to have a shared childhood: time spent dreaming of eating sardines and drinking ginger beer on Kirrin Island with the Famous Five; feeling jealous of Bruce and his infamous chocolate cake in Matilda; and wondering what on earth Dr Seuss’s Green Eggs and Ham might taste like. It is not something we grow out of either. We imagine the dripping crumpets at Manderley in Rebecca, and find our mouths watering at the thought of the perfect steak in The End of the Affair. All the titles I have featured in my book are ones that I have read, and are part of my story. Books that I, as the librarian, would press into your hands with a glowing endorsement. BREAKFAST On the way I found an open café and ate a breakfast of rice and miso soup, pickled vegetables and fried eggs. Norwegian Wood, Haruki Murakami This breakfast is a lovely one to wake up to. Bright, sharp and salty: it gives me a boost on days when I have lots to achieve. Miso soup Serves 4 2 pieces of konbu seaweed 750ml water 2 tbsp white miso paste A pinch of salt 100g silken tofu, cut into small cubes 1 Put the seaweed and water in a saucepan, and put over a very low heat, stirring occasionally. As the water boils, pull out the seaweed. 2 Allow the stock to boil for 2 minutes, then turn off the heat. Spoon in the miso and stir until it has dissolved. Taste and season with a little salt. 3 Add the diced tofu to the hot stock. Serve immediately. Rice, pickles, egg Serves 4 For the rice 100g sushi rice 125ml cold water 2 tbsp rice vinegar 1 tsp mirin 1 tsp caster sugar For the pickles 1 tbsp flaky salt 1 tbsp caster sugar White pepper 150ml rice vinegar 1 cucumber 10 radishes For the fried egg 2 tbsp sesame oil 4 eggs 1 Wash the rice 4 times in cold water. Drain well, then pour 125ml water over the rice. Let it sit for 30 minutes. 2 Meanwhile, make the pickle, slice the vegetables into any thickness you fancy: the thinner they are, the more they will pickle. I like to slice the cucumber with a mandoline, so they pick up the pickle, and the radishes into quarters, so they retain most of their crunch. 3 Mix the salt, caster sugar, white pepper and vinegar together until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Split between two bowls. Put the cucumber in one and the radishes in the other. Set aside. 4 Bring the rice to the boil, then slowly simmer for 10 minutes, with the lid on, until the water dips below the rice. LUNCH Desdemona went up and down the line, adding walnuts, butter, honey, spinach, cheese, adding more layers of dough, then more butter, before forging the assembled concoctions in the oven. Middlesex, Jeffrey Eugenides Shop-bought filo turns this pie from a full-day challenge into a midweek supper or a simple weekend lunch. In Middlesex, Desdemona lays her pastry out all over the house, but she is cooking in the 1920s, before Greek pastry was common in supermarkets. If using shop-bought, keep it covered for as long as possible, or it will dry out faster than you can fill it, and it will end up all over your carpet, rather than round your spinach. Spanakopita Serves 4 1 brown onion, finely chopped 1 tbsp flavourless oil 1kg frozen spinach 1 tbsp chopped dill 3 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley 1 egg 100g feta cheese Nutmeg, freshly grated Salt and black pepper 100g butter 10 sheets filo pastry Sesame seeds, to decorate 1 Set your oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Fry the onion in a large saucepan in the oil until translucent. Tip in the spinach, stirring constantly while it defrosts. Cook over a relatively high heat to try to encourage some of the water to evaporate. 2 Tip the spinach and onion into a sieve. Squeeze out as much of the water as you can. The more you can remove here, the crisper your pastry will be. Leave to cool. 3 Add the chopped herbs and egg, crumble in the feta, then add nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. 4 Melt the butter in a saucepan. Lay 2 sheets of filo on your work surface, with their longest edges parallel to you, and overlapping by 2cm. Brush generously with butter. Lay two more sheets on top, butter again. Repeat until all the filo is used up. Lay a long line of filling about 5cm from the long edge of pastry closest to you. Roll the pastry into a long sausage. Coil into a spiral. 5 Transfer the spanakopita to a lined baking sheet, brush generously with butter, sprinkle with sesame seeds and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown. DINNER Is it possible to fall in love over a dish of onions? ... I said, “It’s a good steak,” and heard, like poetry, her reply: “It’s the best I’ve ever eaten.” The End of the Affair, Graham Greene This is, in my opinion at least, the sexiest dish in my book. I wholeheartedly recommend serving it to someone you fancy. And, I guarantee you, it is possible to fall in love over these onions. Sarah’s thoughts on the steak in The End of the Affair are exactly the response you are aiming for, so keep it simple, and don’t forget to let it rest. Steak and onions Serves 2 2 rump steaks Salt and black pepper Olive oil For the onions 16 small, round shallots 50g butter 30 sprigs thyme Salt and black pepper 1 Set your oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Remove the steaks from the fridge to bring them to room temperature. 2 Top and tail your shallots and peel off the outer layer of skin. Arrange them with one of the cut sides up in a small ovenproof dish. Put a small pat of butter on each one, then add a couple of sprigs of thyme and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Transfer the dish to the oven for 50 minutes, until golden and soft. 3 In the last 15 minutes of the onion cooking time, heat a griddle pan or heavy frying pan until water evaporates immediately when flicked on to it. Sprinkle some salt and pepper on one side of the steaks and put them, seasoning-side down, into the pan. 4 Flip each steak every 30 seconds or so. I’m loath to give cooking times here, because it is so dependent on the thickness of your steak. I use the hand test I was taught at school instead. Gently touch your forefinger to your thumb (don’t pinch, just touch). Prod the heel of your thumb with a finger from your other hand, and then prod your steak. You’re looking for a similar tenderness in a rare cooked steak. Once it reaches this tenderness, take it off the heat immediately. If you want your steak cooked differently, it’s: medium rare – middle finger; medium – ring finger; well done – little finger. 5 Once your steaks are cooked to your liking, wrap them in foil and leave to rest for 5 minutes, then slice the steak into strips, put on your plate, and season with salt, pepper and a little drizzle of olive oil. Serve with the dish of onions. MIDNIGHT FEAST And when they had finished the fish, Mrs Beaver brought, unexpectedly, out of the oven, a great and gloriously sticky marmalade roll, steaming hot ... The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, CS Lewis I am unable to stay inside when snow starts. I frolic. But as much as I love being outside in it, that first hour back inside again – the long bath, the clean, warm socks, the hot meal – is just as wonderful. This marmalade roll, served to the Pevensie children by the beavers as the snow lies thick on the ground under an ink-black sky, is just the ticket. Custard is the ideal accompaniment to marmalade roll. Marmalade roll Serves 6 250g plain/all-purpose flour 50g light brown sugar 1 tsp baking powder 40g butter 40g vegetable suet 60g soured cream 60ml milk 1 egg 450g marmalade 25ml whiskey For the custard 300ml milk 100ml double cream 1 vanilla pod 4 egg yolks 40g caster sugar 1 Set the oven to 190C/375F/gas 5. Sift the flour, sugar and baking powder into a mixing bowl. Rub the butter and suet into the mixture with your fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs. 2 Whisk the soured cream, milk and egg together in a cup, then tip the liquids into the dry ingredients. Mix everything together with a fork until it comes together in a dough. Generously flour the work surface and tip the dough out. Push it out into a rough rectangle, around 18x30cm in size and 15mm thick. 3 Spoon ⅔ of the marmalade on to the dough, spreading it over the whole surface. If your marmalade is hard set and not very spreadable, warm it over a low heat to melt a little. 4 Using a spatula, roll the dough up from the short end into a scroll. Pinch the ends together, and roll tightly in greaseproof paper. Tie the ends with string, or twist them and tuck them under the marmalade roll. Place a rack in the base of an oven dish, and place the roll on top. Transfer to the oven and, before you close the door, tip a little boiling water into the bottom of the dish, being careful to ensure that the water does not touch the roll. Bake for 1 hour, until a skewer inserted into the roll comes out with no bits of uncooked dough clinging to it. 5 To make the custard, pour the milk and cream into a saucepan with the split vanilla pod. Place over a low heat until almost simmering, stirring occasionally to prevent the milk burning on the bottom. Remove the vanilla pod. 6 Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together. While still whisking, slowly pour the hot milk and cream on top. 7 Pour the custard back into the saucepan. Stir continuously over a very low heat until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. If you’re not going to serve it immediately, cover the top with plastic wrap, pushing it down until it sits on the top of the custard, to prevent it from forming a skin. 8 Remove the roll from the oven. Put the rest of the marmalade and the whisky in a small saucepan and heat until liquid. Paint the top of the roll with the marmalade glaze and serve hot with the custard.

She was a new friend, my only friend, actually, as I had just moved to Miami. Her mother came in and saw me looking and said: “That’s where Shane shot himself up.” Shane was Sherry’s cousin. Her mother was mostly annoyed that he had used Sherry’s dad’s gun. Whether this was an accident or a suicide I was too polite to ask. He was 16. When Sherry’s dad sat down at the table, he showed me his huge collection of guns. One rifle after another. I sat there nodding, wondering what to say. I was 21 and had gone to live in Miami because I thought New York might be dangerous. Yes, I know – now. Every boyfriend I had in Miami would give me their gun to put in my bag when we went out. This became just the way it was. America was in my blood, literally – my father was American – and I presumed this was what it was like to be properly American. The American dream was what my father had offered my mother. Escape from small-town Suffolk to a place of Pontiacs and huge fridges. She liked Americans so much she married two of them, with an English man in between. “He bought me a lovely little handbag pistol,” she said of my father. This was as glamorous to her as the menthols she smoked: a special ladies’ gun. This casual relationship to gun ownership is different in different parts of the US. For the US is several different countries. When, later in the 80s, I moved to New York, gun violence was seen as a black crime. I had moved to the US because it seemed to offer everything I already knew and more. But very quickly I knew that this was an extremely alien culture. It is an illusion of popular culture that makes us think it isn’t. Somehow, though, British people still think they “know” America because they once had brunch in Manhattan. Americans are just like us but with bigger portions. We can prescribe our liberal solutions to their terrible problems if they would only listen. This is delusional. The unknowability of the US, even to itself, has been brought into focus by Donald Trump’s election. Nowhere is it more apparent than in the debate around gun control. An angry white man is in the White House. And angry white men who murder scores of people with guns are not terrorists, apparently. The reaction to these massacres is that more people go out and buy guns to protect themselves. This mentality is incomprehensible to many of us. Never mind North Korea, Americans excel at killing each other with guns and opioids. The terror that they fear is coming over some mythical wall is in fact rooted inside their own culture. The same figures are rehearsed after every massacre. It is estimated that the US has the highest number of privately owned guns in the world – in 2012, there were thought to be about 300m, held by about one-third of the population (enough for every man, woman and child in the country to have a gun). The second-ranked country is Yemen. In the US, 18 young people are killed every day by guns. Meanwhile, suicide – the majority by gun – is the second most common cause of death for Americans between 15 and 34. One of the saddest parts of Gary Younge’s devastating book Another Day in the Death of America is when parents of children gunned down speak of relief. The mother of Tyshon Anderson, who was shot in a gang-related incident at 18, says: “I don’t have to worry about him being out there killing nobody else or nobody else trying to kill him.” Every right-minded liberal can point to Australia, where gun control has brought the homicide rate right down. Legislation would implement background checks for gun ownership and yet … Gun fairs are visited as if by Victorian anthropologists. Who are these people? The National Rifle Association is powerful, and, of course, the militias were out recently in Charlottesville. This is not “left-behind” America, but it is a part we find utterly foreign. The anti-centralised state narrative may be wrapped in second-amendment bluster, but part of the problem with gun control is precisely this word “control”. Obamacare is rejected again as something to do with control. I offer no solution to the massacres. I don’t particularly like the US’s reliance on cars either, but I can’t see the country without them. The now-familiar argument in the US on gun control is that of two different nations circling each other. It seems to me much of the US cannot be understood as a developed nation. Look at the levels of inequality, the infant mortality rates, the addiction, the self-inflicted wounds. The absolute rejection of a centralised state is part of its notion of freedom. That this culture is not ours, that it is something entirely different, gets brought home time and again. When I was being taught to shoot by an American ex-cop, he emphasised that children must learn how to behave around guns. At what age, I asked him, did he think they should have their first gun? “Three” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/04/the-true-cost-of-sugar-is-more-than-its-price","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T17:25:49Z","webTitle":"The true cost of sugar is more than its price  | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/04/the-true-cost-of-sugar-is-more-than-its-price","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/04/the-true-cost-of-sugar-is-more-than-its-price","fields":{"headline":"The true cost of sugar is more than its price","bodyText":"In response to your article (Beet that: sugar prices set to fall as EU quotas abolished, 29 September), whether sugar costs pennies or pounds, the food industry knows the government target – 20% – on how much of it they need to reduce from their products by 2020. We are monitoring industry progress against these targets and will report on it in spring. The fact remains that children eat too much sugar and it causes weight gain, which can lead to bullying, low self-esteem and tooth decay. Excess weight in childhood also increases the risk of becoming an overweight or obese adult, which will increase the likelihood of developing a range of cancers, heart diseases and type 2 diabetes. If the food industry is about to save money on sugar, it will hopefully make more resource available for research into innovative ways to make products healthier. Dr Alison Tedstone Chief nutritionist, Public Health England • The article by Richard Partington is remarkable in discussing the implications of EU sugar production and pricing policy for the UK and EU economies, but completely fails to mention the implications for world sugar trade and particularly for the potential impact on lower-income countries. There was space in the print version of the Guardian for a large photograph of a pile of sugar, but no space for any reference to the role of the sugar trade on the welfare of developing countries. This, of course, is consistent with the EU switch of major responsibility for policy relating to developing countries’ trade matters from the directorate of development to the directorate of trade. Perhaps we can look forward to another article in the near future which deals with the wider implications of changes in EU policy on the sugar market for global trade and development issues?

Now in his 80s, the doctor who encouraged women to experience pain-free labour in warm pools of water and was the first to write about the importance of placing newborn babies to the breast has turned Cassandra. His new book is a warning to humanity that we face a grim future by our heedless embrace of medical technology; that the very techniques used to save lives are also changing the human race on an evolutionary level. The Birth of Homo, The Marine Chimpanzee theorises that the way babies are delivered could be one cause of increased numbers of developmental disorders, psychological problems and addictive behaviours. He has interpreted epidemiological studies that show that a high number of children born by caesarean section or induction go on to be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder in support of his theories. It’s not surprising that the man who trained as a surgeon in France in the 50s and became a guru to the natural birth movement when he pioneered birthing pools and skin-to-skin contact should have a passionate interest in neonatal health. Since retiring in 1985 from Pithiviers hospital south of Paris where he revolutionised the labour ward, he’s spent his time writing and lecturing around the world to midwives and doctors. Now based in London, he likes to describe himself as “an interdisciplinary student of human nature”. Odent maintains an English-language database cataloguing scientific papers on pregnancy, birth and epidemiology. He is tireless in his output, producing five books in the last 10 years alone. The inspiration for his latest book came to him a year ago while he was lecturing to an audience of midwives and swimming instructors who work with babies. It draws on his interpretation of recent discoveries in palaeontology, microbiology and genetics and he is eager to see how his arguments are received. He explores the highly contentious aquatic ape theory at length – the theory that human ancestors descended from the trees via an aquatic evolutionary phase – particularly as it echoes his belief that some women in labour are innately drawn to immersion in water. He is also fascinated by current research into epigenetics – the study of biological mechanisms that switch genes on and off – and studies that investigate how the maternal microbiome – the microscopic organisms, such as bacteria, that inhabit the human body – might affect a baby’s development in pregnancy, delivery and infancy. He is most passionate about advancing his theory that altering the way women conceive and give birth is changing humanity at an evolutionary level. Odent believes that induction using artificial hormones, caesarean deliveries and advances in neonatal medicine have led to more babies being born to mothers who might otherwise have not survived. “One effect of modern obstetrics is to neutralise the laws of natural selection – the laws that foiled us all [in the past]. We have neutralised those laws. It means that at the beginning of the 20th century, a woman who could not give birth naturally would die, whereas the one in the village who could give birth easily would have 12 children. Today, the number of children one has depends on other factors than the physical capacity to give birth. “I mainly talk about obstetrics, but we can also talk about conception. If you cannot have a child, you can have medicalised conception. So we have neutralised the laws of natural selection. It is one of the biggest problems for humanity today and people don’t realise that. Any mathematician, any statistician interested in this topic will find ways to calculate what will happen – in my book I give several examples.” Odent cites the discovery in the 70s that medication could treat rhesus incompatibility disease that has since saved hundreds of thousands of lives. It’s made it possible for parents who are rhesus incompatible to have several babies. He also cites research into breech births that has shown a genetic component: “In the past, breech births were more dangerous than head first, but suddenly with the advent of modern caesarean techniques, they are not more dangerous. So the people with the genes for breech birth (and it can come from the mother or the father) are able to have the same amount of babies. This is a mathematical fact.” Where Odent moves on to far more controversial ground is in his selective interpretation of two large longitudinal studies into higher rates of caesareans and induction among children later diagnosed with autism spectrum conditions. These case-control studies used population-based data done in 2002 and 2004 and found an association with caesarean deliveries and autism. Odent claims that the increase in prevalence in cases of autistic spectrum disorders cannot be ascribed solely to increased awareness and changes in the definition of autism. His concerns focus on synthetic oxytocin used to induce labour, the increasing number of caesareans and the environmental conditions in the womb. He suggests that some or all of these factors may in some cases trigger a genetic predisposition to develop autism. But correlation does not equal causation. A very different interpretation of the higher rates of autism among children born via intervention comes from the American paediatrician and autism specialist Paul Wang: “A foetus with developmental issues may have low muscle tone that can interfere with moving into proper position for natural delivery. In this and other ways, the foetus plays a crucial role in initiating and advancing natural labour.” Others have pointed out that the higher rates may not be an indication that birth interventions have triggered autism but that the difficulties associated with autism – motor planning, hypo or hyper sensory differences, communication impairments – may make it difficult for the already autistic baby in the womb to engage in the birth process in the standard way. Dr Carole Buckley, the Royal College of General Practitioners’ clinical representative on autism, is disturbed by the hypothesis: “There is no evidence to support the claims in this book and it is extremely unhelpful of Dr Odent to make them. Suggesting that inducing labour or delivering a baby via caesarean may lead to autism is irresponsible. It will only increase anxiety and feelings of guilt or inadequacy that women often feel when they need intervention to give birth to their babies.” Worrying anxious parents is the last thing that Odent believes is helpful. “I put a caveat in my books – they are not for pregnant women. I tell them not to read them. They are books for people who are interested in the future of human beings – preferably ones with a scientific background, people interested in thinking in terms of the future and the future of the species. That’s the public I want to reach.” This may seem a little disingenuous when the book’s small publisher specialises in birth and parenting guides. Trying to tease out of Odent whether he’s arguing that would-be parents who have problems with fertility or delivery should not embrace medical technology in case it increases the risk of autism, results in a defensive answer: “I’m not thinking that way – not in terms of opinion and judging, I’m just observing. What I am saying is that people think in the short term, which is what we do in general – our objective is always what can we do now? So if we say that everyone can have a baby, from a short-term perspective, that is positive. But I am not talking about the short term, I am thinking of the future of mankind. There have been human beings on this planet for millions of years and how long can humanity survive now? It’s probably a negligible number of years in comparison with the past.” Those who see autism and other developmental disabilities as differences to be accommodated and accepted rather than something to be prevented may well find the tone of his concluding chapter worrying: “We suggest that the neutralisation of the laws of natural selection by obstetrics and other branches of reproductive medicine should be given a prominent place as an apparently irreversible factor: it tends to set forward the ‘Doomsday clock’. It is urgent to realise the probable and unprecedented evolutionary effects of easy, fast and safe techniques of caesarean section.” It’s a considerable shift in Odent’s image from the benign natural-birth pioneer to the doomsayer; it will be interesting to see how his arguments are evaluated. • The Birth of Homo, The Marine Chimpanzee by Michel Odent (Pinter &amp; Martin Ltd, £11.99).

This week, the two sons he never met went back to Italy to rededicate his grave after a years-long campaign to identify it. Edward and Sydney Graham, now aged 74, travelled from their homes in northern England to attend the ceremony at Catania war cemetery, in Sicily, on Wednesday. The service gave a sense of “closure and satisfaction” that his father would be resting with his colleagues who were also killed, said Edward Graham. “That is comforting. But my great sadness is my mother never knew where he was. That would have been nice but it wasn’t to be. He was on active service and communication being what it was he didn’t know he was the father of twin boys. My brother and I were born just 22 days before he was killed. “And, indeed, my mother didn’t know what his fate was for almost two years. He was posted missing, which was changed to missing presumed killed, but his actual fate she didn’t know for definite for almost two years. It’s very sad he didn’t know he had two sons, but that was the time he was living in.” Graham, who is from Prudhoe, in Northumberland, added: “It was a very emotional service and the culmination of years of hard work and research. We are very grateful to everyone involved who made today so special.” He carried out much of the research that led to the identification of his father’s grave decades after his death. Fusilier Graham was killed during an ambush by German soldiers on 13 August – as the allies advanced across Sicily and the Axis forces carried out their withdrawal across the strait of Messina to the Italian mainland. He was initially buried on the battlefield but, when he was reburied later, it was impossible to identify his body and his grave was marked with a headstone bearing the inscription “Unknown Soldier”. Years of research and work by the younger Edward eventually paid off when he found a Royal Irish Fusiliers diary that showed when and where his father, a member of that regiment, died. Further records showed that all but one of the graves connected to his battalion at Catania had named headstones – suggesting that the victim in the unmarked grave was likely to be his father. Fusilier Graham joined the Territorial Army as a private in the Durham Light Infantry before he became full-time following the outbreak of war. He transferred to the Royal Irish Fusiliers and was posted to Ballykinler, in Northern Ireland, where he met and married the mother of his sons, Eveline McBride. His regiment was sent to north Africa, before moving to Italy. He was killed near the small town of Maletto, to the north of Catania. At Wednesday’s ceremony, which was led by the regimental chaplain of the Royal Irish Regiment, a new headstone bearing Fusilier Graham’s name was finally installed. Nicola Nash, from the Ministry of Defence’s joint casualty and compassionate centre, who organised the service, said: “We feel privileged to bring some closure to Edward and Sydney after 74 years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/oct/04/frieze-jeff-koons-mary-beard-lucy-jorge-orta","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T17:19:35Z","webTitle":"Frieze 2017: Judas, Bourgeois and Mary Beard storm the hyper-capitalist hothouse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/04/frieze-jeff-koons-mary-beard-lucy-jorge-orta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/04/frieze-jeff-koons-mary-beard-lucy-jorge-orta","fields":{"headline":"Frieze 2017 review – Judas, Bourgeois and Mary Beard storm the hyper-capitalist hothouse","bodyText":"The kiss of Judas is the first thing you see at Frieze. It is striking, this great image of the betrayer of Christ bringing his lips close to his leader’s as their eyes meet in a devastating moment of truth. But this is not exactly new art, having been painted by Giotto about 700 years ago. Have I blundered into Frieze Masters, the art fair’s more historical companion event, by mistake? Has some art dealer prised this famous fresco off the wall of the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua? No – on closer inspection, this makes a kind of insane sense. Tired of basing his art on ads or kitsch puppy photos, Jeff Koons has remade one the most eloquent paintings in history. At least Giotto isn’t around to cry plagiarism or complain about the fact that, into the yellow robes of Judas, Koons has inserted a shiny blue mirror ball that reflects everything around it. I’ve always suspected that, under his smiling salesman demeanour, Koons might be a deeply moral artist. Now I know it. For here he takes one of the most trenchant images of good and evil, and adds a beady blue eye that captures all the collectors and dealers with whom I streamed into the “professional” early viewing. Koons puts us directly into the moral world of Giotto so that we can see – and judge – ourselves. And what a place to do it. Look around, at all these stupendously well-clad and manicured VIPs, and you start spotting collectors: that guy chomping on an unlit cigar as he eyes a painting; that slim well-heeled young couple who look as if they own a large chunk of the internet. What has brought such a gathering of wealth to Regent’s Park? Well, Frieze London is the fair that defines the new. It offers the most complete picture of the art of our time. What a dismal prospect. For if this is the new, the new is starting to look old and jaded. Koons carries off his historical appropriation with deadly panache but that feeling of blundering into an old-fashioned art event never quite left me. Hauser &amp; Wirth have wittily contrived to show all their artists – from Louise Bourgeois to Phyllida Barlow – in a fake museum complete with fading old typed labels and a gift shop that sells postcards and souvenirs. This museum has been put together with classics professor Mary Beard. There are just two problems. One is that Damien Hirst has already done the same thing, on a more outrageous scale, at this year’s Venice Biennale. The second is that cramming all of these modern artists into a deliberately archaic museum wrecks their individuality. It’s not just boring, it’s meaningless. This is the overriding trouble with Frieze. It wants to be seen as so much more than it really is, to be respected as if it were a proper exhibition, to be revered as if its hordes of rival dealers selling wares were curators at the National Gallery. Bringing in Beard is part of that pretension. As is this year’s “curated” exhibition, spread across several galleries, that purports to explore the history of feminist art. It’s called Sex Work and has a lot of full-on anatomical images by the likes of Marilyn Minter and Penny Slinger. Is Frieze getting nervous? Sex Work is a desperate attempt to make this hyper-capitalist event look radical. Where is the new in this look back at 40-year-old radical art? Three strange, provocative watercolours catch my eye. But they turn out to be the work of Francis Picabia, who died in 1953. Picabia was a revolutionary, part of the generation of Duchamp and dada. I found myself wondering what he might make of Frieze. He wouldn’t be surprised – except by the conservatism of it all. It’s a cosy mingle of famous names, blasts from the past and youngsters who are doing pretty much what their elders did. Such venerable artists as Jasper Johns, Brice Marden, Robert Mapplethorpe and Georg Baselitz are on view. Good stuff. But the cutting edge? There isn’t one any more. There’s even a tryptich by Francis Bacon. Actually, there’s something fishy about this. Would Bacon really have portrayed Marlene Dietrich? His fondness for Nazi imagery is well known and Dietrich was a courageous anti-Nazi. Is Francesco Vezzoli, the actual painter of this hilariously tasteless Bacon parody, saying something about nazism, history and chic? I have no idea, but his painting made me laugh. Gillian Wearing’s replica of her face bulging out of a mirror frame, at the Maureen Paley stand, is another nugget of strong art. But if you want daft performances and interactivity, head for the Focus area, where Mark Fell’s Numb Imperatives features two performers in green costumes with what look like tables on their heads banging blocks of wood. Picabia would shrug. You could see better performance art at the Cabaret Voltaire in 1916. Nearby, visitors can pick up an Antarctica passport from a stall set up by Lucy and Jorge Orta as a somewhat glib comment on climate change. These fairground entertainments don’t add up to much but, thinly scattered among the samey stalls, there are some intelligent artists. Take the powerful drawings of South Africa’s William Kentridge, or Olafur Eliasson’s transparent spheres filled with mysterious colour, like something dreamt up by a 21st-century alchemist. Marc Bauer’s drawings and paintings feel like a shot of reality, blowing through this glossy event like a chill wind. The humanity of his picture of someone hunched dismally in front of a gasholder at King’s Cross in London cuts through all the clutter. As does Andrea Büttner’s woodcut Beggar, an anonymous figure lowering in supplication. When the shock of the new becomes a stale charade, the only art that still matters is the timeless and compassionate. Büttner’s Beggar is nominated for this year’s Turner prize, but here among the millionaires – in a year when the inequalities of London and beyond became impossible to ignore – it has a special urgency. • Frieze London is at Regent’s Park, London, until 8 October.

The battle over Holloway prison","bodyText":"In north London the gloves are off in what is likely to be an historic and bloody fight for the future of a 10-acre plot of public land on the site of the former Holloway women’s prison. In one corner of the ring is the Ministry of Justice and its property agents, GVA Bilfinger, who are preparing to sell the site to developers for maximum profit. In the opposing corner we have local people, battling to protect the site for affordable homes, public open spaces and a women’s building. Usually this would be a classic David and Goliath encounter, with developers swooping in to build luxury apartments in gated developments. However, this is no ordinary London borough. This is Jeremy Corbyn’s constituency and one in which the Labour-led Islington council is willing to take on headstrong developers. Speaking to a packed church hall at a community open day last weekend, Corbyn talked of the once in a generation opportunity offered by the Holloway prison site to alleviate the housing shortage in Islington, and create access to facilities and services for the community. The Community Plan for Holloway project has established an active alliance of individuals and organisations working together to ensure that the needs of the local community are prioritised. Islington has shocking levels of poverty and deprivation and this might explain why there has been such an extraordinary level of local interest in the site. Community Plan for Holloway received more than 900 survey responses from the public, local organisations and women in the criminal justice system. Sharing their hopes and concerns about the future development of the prison site, they have been clear that genuinely affordable housing is a key priority. Despite this, the Ministry of Justice has refused to engage in constructive discussion with local campaigners. GVA Bilfinger, acting on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, has now stepped up the timetable for the sale of the site. Listing it online as “an exceptional development opportunity”, the deadline for bids is 15 November. The brochure boasts that the site has the potential to deliver a “significant residential development of perhaps over 1,000 apartments” – well in excess of the estimate of 400 to 880 homes outlined in a feasibility study commissioned by Islington council. The GVA Bilfinger brochure makes no mention of public open green space, play space or a women’s building, as specified in the council’s draft planning document, which also has the support of London’s deputy mayor for housing, James Murray. This is a local issue with national significance. With social housing moving up the political agenda and now a key priority for both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, we may be at an important tipping point. Holloway prison could be a touchstone development for how public land can be redeveloped for public good. The Ministry of Justice could, and should, hang up its gloves and act in the public interest. The battle is not yet won, but the people of Islington might be in with a fighting chance.

Led by an artist and counsellor, its Arts on Prescription project offers a chance to work with a range of materials and techniques, including printmaking and sculpture. The impact has been outstanding. An evaluation revealed a 71% decrease in feelings of anxiety and a 73% fall in depression; 76% of participants said their wellbeing increased and 69% felt more socially included. As one participant says: “I feel so much better having had the time and space to do some art. It makes such a difference.” Gavin Clayton, executive director of the charity and one of the founders of the National Alliance for Arts, Health and Wellbeing, says: “Our evidence shows that taking part in creative activities has a positive impact on people’s mental health. “The arts are important for wellbeing because beauty has a role in our lives. If we don’t listen to that, or pay attention, then that can cause problems.” Cambridgeshire’s success has been mirrored across the UK and the findings are supported by the conclusions of a report by an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) – Creative Health: The Arts for Health and Wellbeing. The report, published in July, which followed a two–year inquiry, found that the arts can help keep us well, aid recovery and support longer lives, better lived. The arts also help meet challenges in health and social care associated with ageing, loneliness, long-term conditions and mental health. Crucially they can also help save the care sector money. Lord Howarth of Newport, co-chair of the APPG on arts, health and wellbeing, says: “The time has come to recognise the powerful contribution the arts can make to our health and wellbeing.” So why can the arts be so beneficial? “The arts are a way of forming, shaping and holding in front of your eyes something you feel internally,” says Phil George, chair of Arts Council Wales, who last November called on the government to fund the arts to improve health. “It’s about storytelling,” he says. “It helps people develop a narrative of their lives and relate to their own experience in a new way. I’m convinced from the evidence that investment in the arts for health would pay off. It would be beneficial, not just in terms of wellbeing, but in terms of the pressures and costs that mental illness puts on the system.” Sarah Wollaston MP, chair of the health select committee, agrees. Speaking at the launch of the APPG’s report, she said: “If social prescribing were a drug, people would be outraged that it wasn’t available to everyone.” Karen Allen: ‘Being in a room where you’ve got the space and time to be yourself, really helps’ A couple of years ago, Karen Allen from Denbigh, north Wales, began to have flashbacks of the abuse she had experienced in childhood. Allen, who had grown up in care, says: “It was a culmination of factors, but ultimately everything I had run away from since childhood came back. I had worked my socks off to get a really good job as a press officer in a local authority and am a single mother to two children. In the end, it got too much. Something had to give and that was me.” She was diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder and signed off work, before later being dismissed on medical grounds. Allen turned first to a specialist counselling service in Wrexham and then joined the arts and friendship group at the Denbigh Carriageworks Project. Each week, an artist visits the project to teach participants a new skill, such as sculpture, ceramics or painting. “What’s lovely about it, is that if you’re feeling depressed, the simple act of being in a room with other people – where you’ve got the space and time to just be yourself – really helps to improve your mood,” Allen says. “There’s such a feeling of camaraderie and friendship. “The art is almost a happy bonus to that connection. While you’re mindfully doing the art, it frees up your personality that had maybe been buried. It takes you away from whatever is bothering you, just for a couple of hours.” Join the Healthcare Professionals Network to read more pieces like this.

The news of an impending ban for their promising player is another blow for the club. Since they were relegated to Division Two of the County Championship a year ago as part of an ECB bailout, several players have left to further their careers elsewhere. Durham have made it clear they will support Burnham during his suspension, as has the Professional Cricketers’ Association. Burnham voiced his regret in a statement released by the club. “I am bitterly disappointed in my actions,” he said. “I’ve let my team-mates, members and supporters down. I will work exceptionally hard to retain my fitness and carry out the rehabilitation procedures that have been put in place.” The statement added: “Durham will continue to support Jack and work alongside the PCA and England and Wales Cricket Board to give him the appropriate level of support.” A statement from the PCA read: “We are aware of the situation surrounding Jack Burnham and we will continue to work closely with Durham and the ECB to support Jack.

Speaking three days after his government’s unilaterally held independence referendum was marred by police violence, Carles Puigdemont said Catalans were united as never before but added he was disappointed by the king’s recent intervention. “The king endorses the discourse and policies of the government of [prime minister Mariano] Rajoy, which have been catastrophic for Catalonia and deliberately ignore the millions of Catalans who do not think like them,” he said. Addressing himself directly to the king, he added: “Not like this. Your decision yesterday disappointed many people in Catalonia.” King Felipe had said on Tuesday night the Catalan authorities were attempting to break “the unity of Spain” and said their push for independence could put at risk the country’s social and economic stability. In a rare and strongly worded television address he described the regional government’s actions as “an unacceptable attempt” to take over Catalan institutions, adding that it had placed itself outside democracy and the law. Puigdemont on Wednesday repeated his calls for dialogue and mediation with Madrid but said his government was still planning to take the results of the referendum to the Catalan parliament over the next few days to prepare for a declaration of independence. “I have to represent all of Catalonia’s citizens,” he said. “On Sunday we had a referendum under the most difficult circumstances and set an example of who we are. Peace and accord is part of who we are. We have to apply the results of the referendum. We have to present the results of the referendum to parliament.” The Spanish government, which has accused Puigdemont of engaging in blackmail, was quick to respond. The deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, said that he had squandered an opportunity to steer the region back toward co-existence, adding: “If Mr Puigdemont wants to talk or negotiate or send mediators, he knows perfectly well what he needs to do: get back on the legal path that he should never have abandoned.” In an interview with the German newspaper Bild on Thursday, Puigdemont said he had not discounted the possibility that he could be arrested, but said he was not afraid. “I’m not surprised any more about what the Spanish government is doing,” he said. “My arrest is also possible, which would be a barbaric step.” More than 900 people were injured on Sunday after Spanish police attempted to halt the vote by raiding polling stations, beating would-be voters and firing rubber bullets at crowds. Despite the Spanish authorities’ attempts to stop the referendum, which both the government and the country’s constitutional court had declared illegal, 2.26 million of Catalonia’s 5.3 million registered voters took part. The figures suggest that that turnout was only around 43% as many Catalans who oppose independence boycotted the poll for fear of lending it legitimacy. According to the Catalan government 90% of participants voted for the region to become independent. Puigdemont told the BBC on Tuesday that Catalonia would not abandon its quest for independence and warned the Spanish government that any move to stop the independence process by using article 155 of the constitution to take control of the region could be the “ultimate mistake”. The EU’s executive on Wednesday had called for the Spanish and Catalan governments to begin talks over the biggest political challenge Spain has faced since its return to democracy four decades ago – but said Madrid had the right to use “proportionate force” to uphold the law. Addressing the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said the images emerging from Catalonia were saddening but it was clear that the regional government had “chosen to ignore the law” when organising the referendum. “Let me be clear: violence does not solve anything in politics. It is never the answer, never a solution. It can never be used as a weapon or instrument,” he said. “Europe knows this better than anywhere else … It is a duty of any government to uphold the rule of law and this does sometimes require proportionate use of force.” Timmermans said it was “time to talk” and backed the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, to bring the dispute to a peaceful resolution. He said the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was in touch with Rajoy but stressed that the vote on Sunday was “not legal” and it was “an internal matter”. Puigdemont and other senior Catalan politicians, including the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, have called repeatedly for the EU to weigh in on the issue. Earlier this week thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona to protest against the actions of some Guardia Civil and national police officers during the referendum. Amnesty International said it had documented a “dangerous and disproportionate” use of police riot equipment on Sunday. “In several cases the actions of national police and civil guard officers involved excessive and unnecessary use of force and the dangerous use of riot control equipment, injuring hundreds of peaceful protesters,” said John Dalhuisen, the group’s Europe and central Asia director."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/07/dynasty-camp-classic-rebooted-for-21st-century","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T09:58:18Z","webTitle":"Dynasty: a camp classic rebooted for the 21st century","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/07/dynasty-camp-classic-rebooted-for-21st-century","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/07/dynasty-camp-classic-rebooted-for-21st-century","fields":{"headline":"Dynasty: a camp classic rebooted for the 21st century","bodyText":"‘Family dynasties flow through blood, from parent to child,” says Fallon, coolly adjusting her hair. “Wives, they just come and go.” We’re less than half an hour into the first episode of the all-new Dynasty (Netflix, available from 12 October) and we’ve already had the first display of hair-to-hair combat. It won’t be the last, either: the battle lines have been drawn between Cristal Flores and Fallon Carrington who, despite being roughly the same age, are soon to be stepmother and stepdaughter. Dresses are torn, ringlets are yanked and dignity is set aside. Rejoice, all ye lovers of bitch-slaps and all-day evening wear, the Carringtons are back. It is a brave soul who reanimates one of the most beloved soaps of the 80s, not least within recent memory of the ratings calamity that was the Dallas reboot. It’s no wonder that its original creators, Esther and Richard Shapiro, have stepped in as executive producers to keep an eye on things, wisely joining forces with Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz, writers of Gossip Girl, Dynasty’s modern-day spirit animal. Thus, all the Carringtons of old can be found here, only they are young again and have slightly better taste in furnishings. There’s gazillionaire patriarch Blake (rich and boring); his daughter Fallon (quite the Ivanka), son Steven (wisecracking black sheep), and Blake’s second wife Cristal (saint). There is also a supercilious butler, played by Alan “Jim from Neighbours” Dale, who looks as if he’s attending his own wake. And so to the plot, which has undergone minor tweaks to bring it into the 21st century. Blake’s business, Denver-Carrington, is now Carrington Atlantic, which deals in “power” and is busily fracking its way around Native American reservations, much to the dismay of Steven who, as well as having the temerity to be gay, is also an environmental campaigner. As for Fallon, she’s impervious to the carbon footprint created by her private jet, concerned instead with how she can rise past the pale, stale males who have crept through the family company like bindweed. When Blake’s children are summoned to the faux Greco-Roman monstrosity that is the family pile, Fallon discovers her plans for promotion have been thwarted by the future Mrs Carrington, who has been appointed executive cog in the business empire. Elsewhere, nods to current events are dropped in with the subtlety of cluster bombs. “Like it or not, we live in an age of dynasties,” says Fallon in the opening voiceover, as images of the Kardashians, the Murdochs and the Trumps flash past. This is, inevitably, a decadent potboiler bubbling with family grudges, double-crossing business deals and illicit humping on beautiful mahogany desks and in chauffeur-driven cars. It’s a place in which women wake up with perfect blow-dries, children and poor people don’t exist and, despite running vast businesses, no one seems to do any work. It is – how shall I put this? – the most fabulous tripe. We are yet to meet Alexis, Blake’s ex, and judge whether she can live up to Joan Collins’s career-defining, turban-wearing original. Still, the Fallon v Cristal war of attrition is shaping up nicely. “Bite me, Cristal,” hisses Fallon, a clump of her nemesis’s hair still balled up in her fist. “Please,” comes the reply, “call me Mom.” Ring for the butler and crack open the bubbly. Things are about to get interesting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2017/oct/04/un-draft-report-blacklists-saudi-coalition-violations-against-children-yemen","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T17:29:52Z","webTitle":"UN moves to blacklist Saudi coalition for violations against children in Yemen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/04/un-draft-report-blacklists-saudi-coalition-violations-against-children-yemen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/oct/04/un-draft-report-blacklists-saudi-coalition-violations-against-children-yemen","fields":{"headline":"UN moves to blacklist Saudi coalition for violations against children in Yemen","bodyText":"The Saudi Arabia-led coalition in Yemen has been included in a draft version of the UN’s annual blacklist for grave violations against children in conflict. The report, parts of which have been seen by the Guardian, conceded that the coalition has put in place measures to improve child protection. It is the first time the annual study has distinguished between parties that have introduced measures to “improve the protection of children” during the reporting period and those that have not, a move campaigners have seen as an attempt to reduce controversy. The coalition’s inclusion in the UN list means all parties to the Yemen conflict will be named for violations. The infractions identified included the recruitment of child soldiers, bombing of schools and hospitals, and the killing and maiming of children. “In Yemen, the coalition’s actions objectively led to the listing for the killing and maiming of children, with 683 child casualties attributed to this party, and, as a result of being responsible for 38 verified incidents, for attacks on schools and hospitals during 2016,” said a draft explanation of the blacklist. “The coalition is included in section B of Annex I, as it has put in place measures during the reporting period aimed at improving the protection of children.” The draft annex – first seen by Reuters – also blacklists the Houthis, Yemen government forces, pro-government militia and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula for violations against children in 2016. Each of these parties featured in the UN report on violations in 2015, which was published last year. The coalition was briefly added to the blacklist last year before it was removed pending review by Ban Ki-moon, the UN chief at the time. Ban later accused Saudi Arabia of exerting “unacceptable” and undue pressure after reports that Riyadh had warned it would cut its UN funding. Saudi Arabia denied threatening Ban. The report is set to be published this month, before the children and armed conflict debate on 31 October. It has to be approved by António Gutteres, the current UN chief before publication and is subject to change. Save the Children said it hoped the final version would include the Saudi-led alliance. Kevin Watkins, CEO of Save the Children, said: “All sides in Yemen’s war have failed to respect international law, and children have paid a terrible price. As a cholera epidemic continues to infect thousands of children every day, they are also being bombed in their homes and schools, denied humanitarian relief and forced to fight on the frontlines. “The secretary general has stood up for Yemen’s children and for the rights of all children in conflict with this decision. Now the UN and wider international community must make sure the violations by all parties to the conflict end. Being added to this shameful list should act as a wake-up call to every party in Yemen’s conflict – and countries that are supporting or arming them.” UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric told Reuters the UN does not comment on leaked documents. In August, following the publication of an earlier draft of the UN report, the Saudi UN mission told Reuters there was “no justification whatsoever” for including the coalition on the blacklist. The earlier draft said about half of the 683 child casualties caused by the Saudi-led coalition were killed, with the others injured. Houthi rebels and affiliated forces were responsible for nearly one-third of the total 1,340 child casualties verified by the UN in 2016, it said. In August, human rights groups including Save the Children and Global Citizen wrote a letter to the secretary general asking him to protect Yemen’s children by naming and shaming all parties committing violations. Rather than triggering UN action against blacklisted parties, the report seeks to shame them into implementing child protection measures. In a separate development,the UN human rights council agreed last Friday to set up a panel to examine all allegations of human rights violations committed in Yemen’s three-year civil war and identify those responsible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/04/boris-lion-king-to-theresa-may-p45-malarial-week-tory-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T13:52:01Z","webTitle":"From Boris the Lion King to Theresa May’s P45 – my malarial week at the Tory conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/04/boris-lion-king-to-theresa-may-p45-malarial-week-tory-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/04/boris-lion-king-to-theresa-may-p45-malarial-week-tory-conference","fields":{"headline":"From Boris the Lion King to Theresa May’s P45 – my malarial week at the Tory conference","bodyText":"By the end of the Conservative party conference, Theresa May had suffered so many painful betrayals and humiliations that she should have ditched her speech and dropped a 60-minute visual album on Tidal instead. A lot of people wouldn’t have begrudged her the chance to stalk along the street in a yellow dress, baseball-batting a few cars. That, clearly, would have been a show of strength a million miles beyond the prime minister: currently third among equals, dropping down the rankings fast, and agonisingly handed a P45 by a bottom-tier comedian during her own coughed-out conference speech. Even bits of the set were trying to escape. She had already spent four days in Manchester having to suck up all manner of indignities, while Boris Johnson’s address concluded “Let the lion roar!” Thanks, Uncle Scar! But you probably want to wipe Mufasa’s blood off your chin before you get the party faithful to sing along to The Circle of Life. I lost count of things that were obviously being said for a dare. “We were pleased with the way it went,” judged May’s spokesman of her speech. “I witnessed a great speech from a prime minister at the top of her game,” declared Michael Gove. “That is their cosmic role in life,” explained James Cleverly about Labour, “to screw things up, so we can come and fix them.” Has he been watching the past two years on tape delay? The Tories are like something out of Cowboy Builders: they tell you that you need a new boiler, and by the time they’re done, you’ve got no roof, a sinkhole and euro parity. For the love of God, guys, please stop fixing things. May herself was asked if she would change tack and do the leaders’ television debates during the next general election. I mean, really … you might as well ask her if she’s going to take four strikers to the Qatar World Cup. “Weak leadership,” she said later, “is having a cabinet full of yes men.” A reminder of how lucky we are to live in the time of this inspiring Team of Rivals reboot. With the Brexiters, it was mostly excruciatingly easy to see what they were playing at. “We are the country of William Shakespeare and Jane Austen,” announced David Davis, “of Alexander Fleming and James Dyson.” Assuming anyone can join in this game: we are the country of John Milton and George Eliot, of Isaac Newton and that guy who owns Wetherspoons. But before we go on: the science bit. Last year, the Tories were bedding in for a good 15 years of uninterrupted rule; this year, they were coming to terms with the fact that the bed had been shat. “We had an election that nobody expected to take place,” said party chairman Patrick McLoughlin. The snap election had caught the Tories off guard, May explained to the House magazine, recalling that moment a highly emotional Withnail accosts a farmer and explains: “We’ve gone on holiday by mistake!” The Tories seemed to have called an election by mistake. This conference was a bogglingly unsuccessful attempt to contain the fallout, which repeatedly threatened to spill over into open recrimination. Everywhere you went, you could hear party members muttering furiously about wanting big ideas, a big vision. Yet the main vision they were offered by main-stage speakers was the dystopian one of Jeremy Corbyn being in No 10. Thus, by the time of May’s almost unwatchable speech announcing a council house-building programme, it felt logical to ask: if he’s so appalling, why are your only memorable policies ones you’ve nicked off him (or, in the case of the energy cap, off Ed Miliband)? Forgive me, that’s unfair. May had raised the curtain on conference with a promise of a “revolution in tuition fees”, which turned out to be keeping them at the same level. Chris Grayling announced “a revolution in rail ticketing”, which turned out to be the chance to get your season ticket on your smartphone. The key revolution seemed to be in the definition of the word “revolution”. Other malarial moments? No one could fail to salute whichever Tory brain judged that this already toxic conference would benefit from issuing a guest pass to Katie Hopkins. It’s akin to surveying survivors of the Lusitania and thinking: you know what would really lift the spirits round here? A visit from Typhoid Mary. For reasons I briefly considered looking up, Katie had got herself up in a full wedding dress for her turn at a fringe event. All that effort and still only the second most irksome and publicity-crazed blond at conference. And so, without delay, to wantaway foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the blond black hole, whose gravitational pull is such that nothing here could resist it. He’s not so much a cabinet minister as an event horizon. Almost entirely because of Boris, the Tories now resemble a franchise of the reality-TV show Real Housewives: a cast of behaviourally incontinent people with zero idea of how to act when people are looking at them, with the most ambitious star seemingly having decided that conflict is winsome. Boris’s May-undermining Sun interview on the eve of conference was the intellectual equivalent of pouring a whisky sour over the head of someone called Cristee, yet was analysed as though it were one of Talleyrand’s more complex gambits. According to what one cabinet minister told the FT: “Boris’s own psychology is a matter of infinite fascination.” Only to Boris, surely. For the rest of us, a one-word diagnosis always suffices. Having said that, two-word analyses were not in short supply. According to various ministerial briefings, these ran the full gamut from “vain tit” to “fat fucker”. The general consensus was that Boris actively wanted to be sacked: a political version of suicide-by-cop. It’s a little flattering to him, but after this week we must finally accept that Johnson is the Tories’ Raoul Moat. Like Moat’s story, Boris’s will eventually end the way it was always going to end; it’s just a question of how many people/economic regions/diplomatic relationships he takes down with him on the way. Over the course of the conference, I heard several former loyalists advancing the theory that their former darling had finally gone too far. And by the time Boris was answering a Newsnight query as to where the “red lines” row had come from with a “search me, guv!”, it was hard not to be reminded of Sharon Stone down the cop shop in Basic Instinct. As that earlier exhibitionist reasons: “I’d have to be pretty stupid to write a book about killing and then kill someone the way I described it in my book.” Yup, well. SPOILERS. Even so, the foreign secretary’s confidence did seem to have been slightly dampened by the time he got to his speech, which leaned less heavily than usual on a rhetorical style best summarised as: “Let me impregnate you with my word-seed.” Consider its rather wan conclusion: “We are not the lion. We do not claim to be the lion. That role is played by the people of this country. But it is up to us now – in the traditional non-threatening, genial and self-deprecating way of the British – to let that lion roar.” As Steven Seagal is forced to enquire in Under Siege: “What kind of babbling bullshit is this?” The only possible satisfaction to be gleaned was in imagining Johnson’s reaction to being eclipsed on the fringe by Jacob Rees-Mogg – that bumptious squit from F block, in the parlance of their school. Moggmania is clearly a midsummer night’s Downton wank from which the party should have awoken by now, but it was all the rage in Manchester. To see the queues outside the North East Somerset MP’s events and the party members running after him in the street for selfies was to picture Boris somewhere across town, smashing his magic mirror and preparing a poisoned apple. For his part, Rees-Mogg turned in various scenery-chewing performances at no fewer than nine fringe meetings. He is now at that stage in an overexposed starlet’s career when they’ve got four independent films in pre-production and have just made the gatefold cover of Vanity Fair’s Young Hollywood issue. To couch this in terms Rees-Mogg would instinctively understand: let’s hope it doesn’t all go Mischa Barton from here. As far as that other rising star goes, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson mostly stayed well out of it bar her speech on opening day, possibly concerned that too much fraternisation with colleagues from south of the border might result in her catching total inadequacy. Was there any light relief at the conference centre? Well, there was a massage tent in the shape of a cloud, sponsored “lounges”, and a retail area known as “the maker’s market”. This amounted to various opportunities to buy pashminas, terrible art and plenty of scented candles. Unfortunately, there was nothing on sale to mask the stench of “natural wastage”, which seems to be the Tories’ euphemism of choice for the fact that the average age of their members is around the 70 mark. “The truth is we’ve all been caught rather blindsided by this,” confessed George Freeman, chairman of the PM’s policy board. And yet, looking back, perhaps there was the odd clue that this sort of reckoning was in the post. The endless giveaways to baby boomers. The pollsters who used to cheerfully explain that the only demographic one needed to pay less attention to than young people was dead people. The sense among the constituency associations that Iain Duncan Smith was a nice young man. Either way, the party does now seem to have become aware that it has a couple of problems with young voters. The first problem is that it doesn’t have any, and the second is that the definition of young stretches to anything under 48. This made the thrice-hourly cautionary reminders of the 1970s from the likes of Philip Hammond seem rather exposing. At this rate, the Tories might have to accept the inconvenient affront that even some people who can remember the Winter of Discontent prefer Jeremy Corbyn to them. And yet … it must be must be said that for all their wanton ineptitude, and at times grotesque dysfunction, the Tories are still polling around 40%. Meanwhile, at the last count by YouGov – the firm that called the election most accurately - Theresa May led Jeremy Corbyn by eight points on who would make the best prime minister. Each party – even given their occasionally radioactive levels of self-regard – must be privately gripped by one question: how the hell are we not thrashing this lot? Behind closed doors, both sides must surely be experiencing something of the sensation that has memorably attended various England football internationals down the years. Namely: “How is it possible we’re 1-0 down/only 1-0 up to a ski resort/country with the population of Bristol?” At moments such as these, most England fans know all too well what that says about their side. Yet neither the Tories nor Labour – both of which can’t wait to tell you how historically useless the other lot are – seem dimly aware what their failure to put themselves comfortably ahead against that kind of adversary says about them. Consider how each has characterised the other. Do the Tories wonder in private: “How is it possible we’re not 6-0 up against Venezuela’s commie king-over-the-water? What does that say about us?” Do Labour wonder in private: “How is it possible we’re not 6-0 up against this empty-of-ideas, toddler’s telenovela of a government after seven long years of austerity? What does that say about us?” The numbers suggest that at present Labour and the Conservatives are not far from evenly matched, while each side openly professes themselves the natural party of government. Yet, without wishing to go out on a limb here, we might hesitate to characterise them as what is known in fiction as “worthy foes”. You know the sort of thing – they’re such class acts that when they meet in battle, one adversary might break off momentarily to compliment the other’s swordsmanship and say what a shame it is that they’re going to have to kill them. No, as conference season draws to a close, it feels a stretch to imagine we are watching two equally formidable adversaries grappling at the Reichenbach Falls. Two drunks fighting in a puddle feels more like it. We might get a clear victor, we might not. But let’s not be deluded as to the quality of the spectacle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/06/protect-lives-indigenous-people-can-limit-climate-change-says-un","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T08:53:11Z","webTitle":"Protect indigenous people to help fight climate change, says UN rapporteur","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/06/protect-lives-indigenous-people-can-limit-climate-change-says-un","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/06/protect-lives-indigenous-people-can-limit-climate-change-says-un","fields":{"headline":"Protect indigenous people to help fight climate change, says UN rapporteur","bodyText":"Global leaders must do more to protect indigenous people fighting to protect their land and way of life if the world is to limit climate change, according to the UN special rapporteur Victoria Tauli-Corpuz.

In Brazil, deforestation in indigenous community forests from 2000 to 2012 was less than 1%, compared to 7% outside those areas. “They are the most effective stewards of these key areas,” said Tauli-Corpuz. “The needs of these indigenous people are converging with the wider environmental needs to protect these areas.” Indigenous people are locked in fierce conflicts with mining, logging and agricultural companies and their private security firms in hundreds of places from Indonesia to Brazil. 2016 was the deadliest year on record for land rights defenders with about 200 people killed in conflicts in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In addition, thousands more community activists were threatened or harassed. A Guardian project working with Global Witness is highlighting the pressure many of these groups face and has identified at least 134 people who have been killed so far this year. Tauli-Corpuz, who was speaking at the launch of a new global institution dedicated to securing the land rights of tens of millions of indigenous people, said there was an atmosphere of fear and intimidation in many of these communities. The event in Stockholm was the official launch of the International Land and Forest Tenure Facility which aims to help communities protect their land resources as well as combat climate change. Funded by Sweden, Norway and the Ford Foundation, a US charity, the Tenure Facility, has already provided grants and guidance for pilot projects in six nations. The Ford Foundation president Darren Walker said it was an important development in the fight against climate change and inequality. “Creating mechanisms that allow indigenous peoples and local communities to gain tenure over their land or forests is a way to tackle both these problems.” The Ford Foundation has pledged $5m, and Norway has announced a grant of $20m over the coming years. Sweden pitched in $10m during the pilot phase and will fund future projects. Walker said he expects donations to rise to $100m overall within a year. The project aims to boost forestland properly titled to indigenous peoples by 40m hectares, an area twice the size of Spain, within a decade. Organisers say this would prevent deforestation of 1m hectares and the release of 500m tonnes of CO2, more than the annual emissions of Britain or Brazil. Indigenous leaders representing tens of millions of people involved in land disputes in Asia, Africa and South America attended the conference. They said the tenure programme was an important step towards stopping the persecution of indigenous communities – but warned more needs to be done. Rukka Sombolinggi, the first female secretary-general of the world’s largest indigenous organisation, Aman, which represents 17 million people in Indonesia, said: “Our houses are being burnt down, people are being killed, tortured, and sent to jail as we speak.” Sombolinggi said some progress had been made, with much of the forests where indigenous communities live in Indonesia mapped for the first time. And she said “dominant communities” would benefit, not only environmentally from more rights for indigenous people, but argued they could also learn important lessons from the way many of these groups lived. “If we want to see the beautiful centuries ahead … we need to shift our paradigm of what constitutes wealth or prosperity because too many people see happiness only in terms of material goods and achievements and it is having a devastating impact. Many of us have lost our ability to connect with natural things and no longer seem able to live in harmony with the simple happiness around us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/05/the-apprentice-review-another-batch-of-ridiculous-people-who-talk-better-than-they-walk","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T05:30:15Z","webTitle":"The Apprentice review – another batch of ridiculous people who talk better than they walk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/05/the-apprentice-review-another-batch-of-ridiculous-people-who-talk-better-than-they-walk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/05/the-apprentice-review-another-batch-of-ridiculous-people-who-talk-better-than-they-walk","fields":{"headline":"The Apprentice review – another batch of ridiculous people who talk better than they walk","bodyText":"Here they come again then, a fresh batch of tossers with their wheelie suitcases stuffed full of ambition, egotism and gibberish. “I’m a fine-tuned money-making machine, I smell like success.” “I look like a nice guy, but do nice guys earn £200,000 a year?” “In business, I’m like a bulldog. If you mess with me, I do have lockjaw.” “I’m going to throw people under the bus, I’m going to throw people over the bus, I’m going to get on the bus, take the wheel and get that investment from Lord Sugar …” Wow. Well, if The Apprentice (BBC1) doesn’t work out, Jeff, then I think Metroline is hiring drivers. You might not get £200,000 a year, but I think the uniform will suit you. Series 13, can you believe it? And how many winners do you remember? Here, in the boardroom, are a few of them, to jog your memories, and to inspire Jeff and Michaela and the other new hopefuls. This is Alana, who won last year, and is that Leah who opened a plastic surgery clinic? Oh dear, I seem to be mainly remembering blond women, which may say more about me than the show. Anyway, we’re in strange times now, says Sugar. “We’ve got Brexit, but be under no illusion, in this process I’m the one who decides who’s going to remain, and I’m the one who decides who’s going to leave, simple as that.” Is task one going to be Brexit-related? That would be interesting. To develop and market a cut-price Marmite substitute in response to Unilever’s Brexit-related price rises, perhaps? Selling off cheap commercial property when all the companies bugger off to Paris? A soup kitchen, for the people who stay behind, without a job? No, task one is to make and sell burgers on the streets of London. Pretty much the same as making and selling products made of fish on the streets of London (series 11), puddings (series 10), beer (nine), condiments (eight), etc. It is a problem with The Apprentice, the lack of imagination in the tasks. Basically, they have remained the same since series one (which was won by Tim, I do remember, and he was neither blond nor female). It’s buy, process, market, sell. They might say that viewing figures speak for themselves, and remain high, the customer is happy, it’s all about the sales, and ratings. But continued high ratings don’t necessarily mean continued essentialness, and it’s been a while since The Apprentice was essential, or memorable. More like just inevitable now. Burgers it is though. They go back to the house in Notting Hill (I think they have been there before, haven’t they?) to argue over names. Graphene for the girls (“Sounds like a northern energy drink with gravy in it,” says Sugar, which to be fair, is pretty good, did someone write that one for him?). The boys are Vitality, which “sounds like something you take before you go out on a date”. Not so good that one, Al, and it sounds more like health insurance to me … oh, maybe because it is. The alarm clock goes off, they buy their meat – beef and chicken, plus buffalo and turkey – and make their burgers, and their mistakes. Too much water, not enough leadership, the wrong labels, the wrong locations. Has everyone already left London, for Paris and Brussels? Or is it just that while they have been faffing, and falling out, and looking more like children than masters of the universe, that lunch time has come and gone and there’s not much demand for mid-afternoon buffalo burgers. By the end of the day, they’re practically forcing them on people, for nothing. I get hopeful every time a bus appears – hopeful that Jeff is going to throw someone under it, or over it, or at least get on and take the wheel. But it doesn’t happen. Could it be that some of these ridiculous people talk better than they walk and might not live up to their own promises? Back in the boardroom and Graphene, the girls, have turned a profit of £236.78. “Not bad,” says Sugar. Not bad? Really? They have been up since 2am, worked a 16-hour day, there are nine of them. If they divided up their profit, it works out at about £1.65 an hour. To me that smells less of success, more of considerably less than quarter the minimum wage. But it’s still better than the boys, Team Vitality, who have made a £114.17 LOSS. Losers. Especially the project manager, taxi for Danny! And for Jeff, when it’s his turn, hopefully a bus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/05/us-abortion-bill-20-weeks-criminalize-hurt-women","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-05T10:58:02Z","webTitle":"Don't be fooled: the latest abortion bill is about one thing – hurting women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/us-abortion-bill-20-weeks-criminalize-hurt-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/05/us-abortion-bill-20-weeks-criminalize-hurt-women","fields":{"headline":"Don't be fooled: the latest abortion bill is about one thing – hurting women","bodyText":"On Tuesday, the US House of Representatives passed a ban that would criminalize all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with punishment that would include fines and up to five years in prison. The Majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said that the goal of the bill was “ending suffering and helping people live”, an ironic sentiment just three days after Republicans let a health program expire that could leave millions of children without insurance and two days after a massacre in Las Vegas that the GOP insists has nothing to do with the shocking availability of guns. The truth is that this bill, like all anti-abortion legislation, is not about helping people and never has been. It’s a blatant attempt to challenge Roe v Wade and to end all abortions – despite the human suffering such a ban would cause. The legislation passed on Tuesday, a move supported by the Trump White House, is particularly cruel: 20 weeks is about the time pregnant women find out if their fetus has chromosomal abnormalities. Almost 99% of abortions happen before 20 weeks; the vast majority of women who end their pregnancies past that stage do so because of risks to their own health or because their fetus has severe complications. Many women choose to end their pregnancy, for example, after finding out that their child will either be unable to survive, or will live a short, painful life. One woman, Cheryl Axelrod, wrote today about her “loved and wanted and waited for child”, whom she discovered had an abnormality that would have meant him dying by suffocation during delivery if he should live that long: “You can never know what the right decision is for a family in impossible circumstances until you’ve been there yourself.” These are the kind of decisions that Republicans want to put people in jail for. Supporters of the bill claim, without any credible scientific backing, that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks’ gestation. In fact, studies show, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say, that a fetus does not have the capacity to feel pain until the third trimester of pregnancy. Jennifer Conti, an OB-GYN and clinical assistant professor at Stanford University told Vox.com that 20 weeks “is just an arbitrary limit set in place by politicians that has no medical or scientific backing”. In addition to relying on complete junk science, Republicans are strangely silent about how they are directly responsible for women getting abortions later than they want to. The majority of counties in the US do not have an abortion provider (thanks to Republican Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (Trap) laws), and one-third of women who want to have an abortion need to travel more than 25 miles to get one. Then there are waiting periods, mandatory multiple visits to clinics, parental notification laws or judicial bypasses to deal with – to say nothing of the cost of the procedure, which the Hyde amendment ensures is unaffordable for the poorest women. Republicans enact as many hurdles as possible to keep women from getting abortions early on, and then they insist – with no proof – that seeking abortions later causes fetal pain. It’s absurd. The Republican party does not care about human life or suffering – just in the last weeks, they’ve showed us that with their disregard for the people of Puerto Rico, the people killed by guns, and children who need medical care. This has never been about helping Americans, just hurting women.

The demise of public funding and the overbearing existence of large, commerce-oriented galleries that even museums rely on these days, has distorted the capacity of artists to work freely. We are increasingly mollified by commercial obedience. There needs to be plurality again: other ways, more confusion, fewer defined routes. Rivane Neuenschwander Artist Recently, artists and cultural institutions in Brazil have been censored and subject to attacks by ultra-conservative groups and politicians. This is both very serious and dangerous, putting our already fragile democracy at risk. We are experiencing a period of profound social inequality, times of intolerance and polarisation worldwide, where the discourse of fear and hatred has rapidly dominated and impoverished discussions. The artist must resist and point out diversified paths of deeper reflections, defending their field of action in order to guarantee a place for experimentation and freedom for all within society. Stefan Kalmár Director of the ICA The big question for us all – but particularly for artists because it’s more pressing – is, essentially, can we bite the hand that feeds us? The economic make-up of the 21st century has forced us to shy away from more fundamental questions. An artist is now someone who sells work through a commercial system, to people they might not know, whose political and social affiliations they might not know. As a director, you wonder how long those contradictions are sustainable. Your exhibition might be sponsored by people who you oppose. How many galleries in the US have Trump supporters as their major donors? How does that sit with the more progressive curatorial decisions? Equally, how does the ICA behave with those contradictions? I mean, at least we can talk about them, rather than pretending they’re not there. Then there is the question of education in general, and art education in particular. Why is it that a society that largely communicates through visual media then deprives generations of young people of an arts education? To do so essentially produces a visual illiteracy, so people can’t understand or read the world. They cannot understand that the world projected at them has social, economic preconditions and interests behind them. In a world that is saturated by image, where ideologies talk to each other through imagery, it is a basic human right to understand how images are produced, circulated and distributed. It’s like learning a language or learning the alphabet. Isn’t looking after the people the basic foundation of any politics? Why would it ever be interesting to introduce tuition fees and reduce people’s access to education? The same for healthcare. Why should it be difficult? Shouldn’t it always be government’s prime mandate to produce a well-educated and healthy society? We could get more political and say, “Why is it always conservative governments that do this?” There isn’t a liberal or social democratic element that would do that. You very, very rarely get well-educated fascists or racists. Jeremy Deller Artist “WTF?” That’s the question facing artists today. Marina Abramović Artist For me, it is the question of morality. I think it’s not enough for artists to make work, and to show that to the public. We also have to see ourselves as human beings; to ask what can we do in the world, which is really in the biggest crisis it has ever been in. As a human being, how can you help on a human level? It’s a crisis in every possible form. Human beings suffer everywhere in the world. It’s the increasing natural disasters, which have never been so frequent; hunger; the movement of large populations of people; the people who run the government. Just doing art, being in the studio, is not enough. You have to think about what you can do as a human being. Artist Talks: Marina Abramović is presented by Fondation Beyeler and UBS and will be livestreamed on 4 October at 7pm on Facebook. Maria Balshaw Director of the Tate Where can I afford to live and make my work? Where is my creative community? Arthur Jafa Artist and film-maker In the bluntest terms, the thing that seems to be true of most artists is: “How do I get paid?” You have better odds of becoming a successful NBA player than you do of becoming a successful artist. What I’m preoccupied with is creating things that feel like a real embodiment of everything that makes me who I am. And that is completely bound up with everything that makes me black. As soon as I say I’m black, I’m constrained. On one hand I assert that I’m black because I’m about dealing, but on the other hand I don’t want other people to impose any kind of narrow limits on what black might be. It puts me in a position where I often feel somewhat contrary because I just don’t want to be boxed. I just want to be free to do what I want to do. If you take Love Is the Message, I found myself being disturbed that it is so often framed in sociopolitical, Black Lives Matter terms. Why don’t people ever talk about it in relation to Bernini’s Ecstasy of Saint Teresa? But at the same time, if people talk about it in formal terms, then I’m irate because they just want to talk about it in formal terms while black people are getting killed like dogs! I aspire to complexity, nuance, beauty – those are the things that I value. They are also the things that are congenitally denied to me as a black person. I know, for example, that if I made Mark Leckey’s masterpiece, GreenScreenRefrigerator, it would be read in a completely different way. My reading of that piece is that it’s about the emotional life of objects, and historically, black people, when we came into life in the west, we were not people; we were things. So we have a really crazy, complicated relationship to the life of the thing. We’re situated somewhere between the subject and object. Arthur Jafa’s Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death is co-presented by the Serpentine at Store Studios until 10 December. Catherine Opie Artist My biggest concern is equality for women artists and affordable housing: the practicality of making a living and being a practising artist is daunting. Perseverance, my fellow artists! And be authentic with your practice. In a world in which political upheaval seems to be at every turn, I think one of the larger questions is: what type of artist do I want to be? There is no right or wrong answer; it is important to know that the artist’s voice and work can span a larger discourse in relationship to contemporary culture, politics and practice. Kim Yong-ik Artist The “surplus” of production and consumption has become an imposing threat to us. As an artist, I am not so keen on the idea of excessive production and circulation of the visual image. Kim Yong-ik will exhibit at Spike Island, Bristol, and the Korean Cultural Centre UK. His work will be in the Kukje gallery booth at Frieze London. Oreet Ashery Artist For me, there are a lot of questions around the ethics of funding and the politics of representation. Who are we representing, who are we taking pictures of or filming, what is the work about? I also have a lot of ecological concerns. I think for a lot of artists, trying to negotiate their position around funding and sponsorship is a minefield. If your work is around climate change, to work with or be sponsored by certain oil companies would be very weird. We can’t fight all the wars, but, if your practice has particular areas that it deals with, then the funding around that has to make sense. Saying that, I don’t think anyone should be working with money that comes from arms dealing. A lot of responsibility is put on to artists rather than structures. There’s a lot more demand to find private funding but that can put artists in positions where they’re forced into corporate strategies. There’s quite a finger-pointing culture among artists. That pressure to say the right thing can distract from the battles we actually need to fight. I have had to negotiate an identity around being queer, around being non-binary, from a working-class background, not having children, being single; all these things that in an institutional context are a lot more difficult. But for me, now, there are more categories for identity. It has a way to go but it feels like there is more official recognition for different types of identity, by those institutions. A lot of the young people I teach identify as non-binary and that has to be accounted for. The whole debate around identity is more subtle now. And, of course, that identity affects the kind of work you want to make. Oreet is shortlisted for the 2017 Film London Jarman award announced 20 November. Touria El Glaoui Founding director of 1:54 Contemporary African art fair It’s a question of security in your career: how to be true to yourself while surviving in a commercial market. There is pressure on artists to be activists, with a message to society, to think about how their work will influence certain political changes. So for them the question is: how can my work transmit some sort of social, political message? How will I fit into the future? In Africa, the market is still finding its ground, so the future has a bigger space and that affects the way artists think about their work. When I hear artists discussing their practice in Africa or as part of a diaspora, a lot of what they’re talking about is how to become part of a gallery or a particular show. The 1:54 Contemporary African art fair is at Somerset House until 8 October. Interviews by Nell Frizzell.

I saw a friend of mine killed in front of me’","bodyText":"“Racing is a brilliant game but it’s very tough. That’s why it’s important not to get above your station and appreciate what you have,” Jim Crowley says as he reflects on his rise from being a journeyman over jumps to becoming Flat racing’s champion jockey while seeing death and paralysis on the track. Crowley has reached an even higher level this year. Apart from the increased prestige and excellent horses he now rides as the principal jockey for Sheikh Hamdan al-Maktoum, Crowley won three Grade One races over the summer to record the most significant victories of his long and unusual career. Crowley has confronted disappointment and savoured glory – but he has witnessed racing tragedy. It helps explain why the 39-year-old is so approachable and philosophical in the hard-edged world of Flat racing. Last October at Ascot, his favourite track and the one just across the road from where he was born, Crowley was crowned champion jockey. He had won 148 out of 759 races and his gaunt features and sunken eyes were markers of his gruelling commitment. Sixteen days later Crowley was involved in a terrible fall at Kempton. He was concerned in the immediate aftermath that he might be paralysed. But it was the fate of Freddy Tylicki to be desperately unlucky. Tylicki’s horse, Nellie Deen, collided with the leader and went down. Three other horses followed – including Crowley on Electrify. Both jockeys were treated on the track for an hour and placed on spinal boards before being airlifted to a major trauma unit. Tylicki suffered a T7 paralysis which has robbed him of all movement in his lower body. A wheelchair has replaced the horses he loved to ride. Crowley’s racing, meanwhile, has hit fresh heights. Two weeks after Tylicki’s catastrophic fall, Crowley received a career-changing invitation to become Sheikh Hamdan’s No1 jockey. He immediately accepted the glittering opportunity and, like his great contemporaries Frankie Dettori and Ryan Moore, Crowley sacrificed his championship defence and chose quality over quantity. This mature strategy has produced exceptional results and over six weeks in July and August Crowley won the Eclipse Stakes, Sussex Stakes and Juddmonte International. But darker memories of Kempton remain. “It was like a normal day of racing but another horse came in on top of Freddy’s horse and clicked heels,” Crowley remembers. “We all came down in a big melee. I had no feeling all down my left side so I thought it could be serious. You’re kept very still so I wasn’t aware of how bad Freddy was. It was not until we got to the hospital that we realised the severity.” Crowley looks up and, gently, shakes his head. “It’s awful because he’s a friend of mine. You ride together and when you see one of your colleagues hurt like that it puts life in perspective. I see Freddy as often as I can when I go to Newmarket. But in our job you have to be tough. Otherwise, if you thought about that accident too much you wouldn’t be able to ride.” What was the extent of Crowley’s injuries apart from a badly broken nose? “Just little things – ribs and I’d hurt my back. I basically got a kicking all over. Jump racing is more dangerous but you fall harder on the Flat especially on an all-weather track. The only way you could compare it is if you hit a golf ball down the fairway it will bounce – but you hit one into the bunker and it stops dead. That’s like falling on the all‑weather. “Racing really is a very tough game. I saw a friend of mine killed in front of me in a race at Market Rasen [in 2005]. Tom Halliday was a jump jockey and I was in that race.” Halliday came off his horse, Rush’N’Run, who then fell on top of him. The jockey’s death was confirmed soon after he reached hospital. “It’s very hard when you see something like that happen in front of you,” Crowley says, “especially as Tom was only 20 when he died.” His friends, Halliday and Tylicki, cannot be forgotten but Crowley is a passionate defender of racing. “Eventing is probably more dangerous – and so is boxing and motorcar racing. Even a football player can drop dead on the field.” Racing, in truth, remains behind only boxing in terms of the threat its participants face every day, particularly when clearing hurdles or fences at speed on powerful horses. Does the fact he faced such danger and served a long apprenticeship underpin Crowley’s humility today? “I think so. When you’re a jump jockey there are so many ups and downs. Everybody is on a level playing field because it’s so tough. I had seven good seasons over jumps and had some great times. I was lucky enough to be able to switch to the Flat and appreciate what I do now so much. The jump lads work so hard. You see them, even [jumps champion] Richard Johnson driving to Hexham for one ride in a bumper [National Hunt Flat race]. On the Flat it’s a different way of life.” What does he miss about National Hunt racing? “The camaraderie. It’s much warmer in the jumps weighing room. Jump racing is a sport but Flat racing is a business. A very important business when you’re riding millions of pounds worth of horses. It’s very important to the owners that you put the horses in the right place for breeding. It’s a big-money game. But in the jump world there’s no pecking order and that’s great. There are some good guys in the Flat business and I enjoy it. But there’s a definite pecking order. You can’t afford to get too big for your boots on the jumps. I like to think I haven’t changed much since moving to the Flat.” A jump jockey’s hunger to find as many rides as possible, no matter how obscure the meeting or remote the track, underpinned Crowley’s relentless drive to the championship. “I went to Tony Hind,” he says of the agent who books his rides, “because I had aspirations of being champion, I’d always finished top 10 and when Richard Hughes [the champion jockey from 2012 to 2014] retired there was an opening. I called Tony and he asked: ‘What are your ambitions?’ I said: ‘I’d like to finish top three.’ He said: ‘That’s no good to me, mate. You either want to be champion or you don’t.’ “That was music to my ears and I thought he’s the man for me: 759 races is a lot but to break the record for the most wins last September was phenomenal. Anyone else will be pushed to beat 46 in a month. That was fantastic.” Sheikh Hamdan thought the same in offering Crowley his current position. Crowley’s face cracks open in a smile. “When you’re a kid growing up and you see those famous blue and white silks, in which Willie Carson rode, you dream of doing the same. So it was a lovely surprise and it’s taken my career to another level. “I’ve also enjoyed this season more because last year was very hard. I knew Silvestre de Sousa [the runner-up] wasn’t giving up so I pretty much lived on the road the last three months. I had a full-time driver and we went from racecourse to racecourse. When I was lucky enough to get the job with Sheikh Hamdan my priorities changed.” Does winning Grade One races offer an elation missing from the grind of becoming champion? “Obviously when you’re champion jockey there’s so much enjoyment because you’ve fulfilled a lifetime ambition. I’m not sure if anything can top that but this season has been special in a different way. Winning the Eclipse was a massive leg up.” In keeping with Crowley’s testing career path, his breakthrough at the Eclipse in July was preceded by disappointment. He had ridden Eminent to fourth place in the Derby but Crowley lost his ride on the horse to De Sousa for the Eclipse. “They were a bit upset he didn’t win the Derby. I felt I gave him a perfect positional ride and so to lose him for the Eclipse was tough. But I then got offered Ulysses in the Eclipse. It’s the best thing that ever happened.” Ulysses turned Crowley’s dejection into euphoria. “I was lucky to get on Ulysses at Royal Ascot through Frankie getting injured. And winning the Eclipse on him was the sweetest of all. But it was so close [with Ulysses and Barney Roy locked in a photo finish]. When there’s only a nose pixel between you and you’re waiting for the announcement there’s such pressure. I had no idea if I’d won and I walked in front of the grandstand and said a little prayer. I’m not one for punching the air but I did that day. I had to let my emotions out.” His next major success came three weeks later when winning the Sussex Stakes on a 20-1 outsider, Here Comes When, who was helped by the deluge that swamped Goodwood. “I’ve never seen weather like it and I remember the owner said: ‘We might have a place chance.’ But I’d done my homework and said: ‘I think we might win.’ He gave me a funny look but I knew the horse would relish the conditions.” Ulysses then won the Juddmonte International at York with a masterly performance under Crowley. “The more big winners you ride the more confidence you have,” he says simply. Crowley and Ulysses finished third in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, behind Dettori and Enable, on Sunday. It was his first ride in the Arc – a race that saw one of its most memorable performances in 1986 from Dancing Brave, trained by Crowley’s father‑in‑law Guy Harwood. “It would be great to win the Arc one day because it’s a very special race and obviously my wife’s father trained perhaps the greatest winner ever. But for Ulysses the Breeders’ Cup has always been the main aim and we’ve got a month to go before that so it could work quite well.” Amid these great races there will be another special occasion at this year’s Qipco Champions Day at Ascot – where De Sousa will be awarded with Crowley’s prize as champion jockey on 21 October. Crowley will be chasing another Group One winner that day and he hopes to ride as long as Mick Kinane – who, at 50, won a 2,000 Guineas‑Derby‑Arc hat-trick in 2009 on Sea The Stars. “Mick’s my racing hero,” Crowley says. “I loved the way he rode and became part of the horse. He had a great racing brain. I’d also love to be riding at 50. I run most days and there’s no reason I can’t be as fit at 50 as I was at 25. I’m riding better than ever and not thinking of retirement.” There is always time to reflect on his good fortune after such tumult over the jumps and on the Flat. “Obviously the toughest moment was that fall at Kempton. The thought of being paralysed does cross your mind. You think this could be me. So I don’t complain too much at all now – because every day I think how lucky I am.” This year’s Stobart Champion Flat Jockey will be crowned at Qipco British Champions Day on 21 October.

The sheer variety, from the potato dumplings of the Dolomites to the saffron-spiked couscous of Sicily, has much to do with it; plus the fact that – unlike, say, traditional French, or British cooking – it is not shy of a bit of heat. Not only does the south produce a lot of very fine peperoncino, but, as Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers explain in the River Cafe Classic Italian Cook Book, “in Italy, many cooks grow their own chillies” – something that is less easy for those of us in somewhat chillier climes. Pasta all’arrabbiata, a dish apparently native to Rome, is a case in point: the name refers to the “angry” heat of the chilli-spiked tomato sauce – though it’s up to you, of course, exactly how furious you’d like it to be. (Chef Lucio Galletto recalls coming across it in the Eternal City as a teenager: “The waiter asked, ‘Would you like it really angry?’ and my brother, thinking that was a standard joke, replied, ‘Yes, really, really angry – arrabbiatissimo.’ When the pasta arrived, it was inedible!”) However hot you dare to go, though, this is a simple, quick and satisfyingly spicy supper using store cupboard ingredients that doesn’t even require the minimal motor skills of those other late night favourites, carbonara or cacio e pepe. A very useful recipe to have up your utterly exhausted, or slightly inebriated, sleeve, in other words. The chillies As the thing that distinguishes arrabbiata from the tens, possibly hundreds of other tomato-based sauces in the Italian repertoire, the chilli element feels important. Gray and Rogers go on to say that in Italy, home-grown chillies are “hung upside down to dry in the autumn” to keep the household going until the following year, and the chillies used at the restaurant where they ate penne all’arrabbiata “at least once a week during the summer” used their own peppers, “dried and strong”. That said, Jamie Oliver and Galletto’s book, The Art of Pasta, both call for fresh red chillies, the first added whole, and cooked until they break down into the sauce, and the latter finely chopped. The effect is surprisingly fruity rather than fiery; no doubt a different variety could be used with better effect, but the keener heat of the dried kind proves more popular. Gray and Rogers go for a whole dried pepper, but I find chilli flakes more effective at perfuming the oil (and be generous: a decent amount of oil is necessary in such a simple sauce). (Note the amount in the recipe below gives a warm but not overpowering heat; if you’d prefer to have your socks knocked off, you may wish to add a little more.) The tomatoes The other most important ingredient in an arrabbiata sauce is, of course, tomatoes. Caz Hildebrand and Jacob Kenedy’s The Geometry of Pasta is the only book to call for fresh fruit, pureed and then cooked until they taste “fresh but no longer raw”. While this proves a delicious destination for the last of the season’s harvest, craggy and wrinkled as they are, testers express an overwhelming preference for the deeper, richer flavour of those made with tinned tomatoes, especially when well reduced, as in Gray and Rogers’ recipe. I don’t think there’s any need to puree them as Galette recommends – a good bash with a wooden spoon during cooking should do the trick, just enough to break them up and give a more interesting texture. American chef Mario Batali adds a hefty amount of tomato puree to his sauce, too, perhaps because he doesn’t allow it to reduce before use – but an extra 15 minutes on the heat while the pasta cooks is well worth it. The extras Batali’s simple recipe, included in a New York Times feature about quick dinners after a long night in the kitchen, doesn’t even include garlic, though unless you too have been chopping all day, I’d advise adding it – and not just to season the oil as in Galletto’s version. He also adds guanciale (cured pork cheek), or pancetta, to his sauce, much like that other central Italian classic, pasta all’amatriciana, but I’m going to keep this vegetarian, both because it makes it more versatile, and because, in my slower-simmered method, the meat would quickly become chewy. Jamie Oliver sticks in anchovies, which melt into the sauce, but again, good as they are with tomatoes (who doesn’t love puttanesca), the dish really doesn’t need them, and the same goes for his lemon zest, though the balancing sharpness of the juice he also adds inspires me to pop in just a drop of red wine vinegar, more appropriate for this store-cupboard classic, and one that I think pairs better with the other ingredients. The most surprising ingredient in his version, however, is a slug of vodka, apparently a popular addition to pasta sauces in Italian-American cooking. It is alleged elsewhere to bring out the flavour of the tomatoes, but we can’t detect the difference – although everyone is very enthusiastic about going back for more, just to check. The pasta Penne is the usual choice, though having run out, I have to use rigatoni for the River Cafe iteration (sorry) and can confirm it is a perfectly serviceable alternative, while Oliver uses spaghetti, which doesn’t carry the sauce in quite the same way. I have to confess that penne has always seemed, as a friend puts it, a bit “basic” in the hierarchy of pasta shapes, so my own preference would be for something else with the capacity to trap lumps of tomato – Hildebrand and Kenedy give no fewer than 14 alternatives, including the wonderful sounding dischi volanti – but it will of course do if you’re a stickler for tradition. Whatever shape you use, taking it to al dente and then adding it the hot tomatoey pan and allowing the two to finish cooking together will encourage the sauce to really coat the pasta, rather than just sitting on top of it. The finishing Recipes are divided between those who believe cheese to be an aberration on an arrabbiata (Gray and Rogers, Hildebrand and Kenedy) and those who couldn’t care less, like Oliver and Batali, who both add parmesan, and Galletto, who goes for pecorino. I don’t think this particular dish needs it – a glug of good olive oil feels like a better pairing with chilli, but I can’t resist quoting The Geometry of Pasta on the subject: “best served without cheese in my opinion … some would disagree (they should use pecorino romano, but given their dubious taste are probably sprinkling parmesan).” Oliver also stirs in flat-leaf parsley, which is a classic combination with tomatoes and chilli, but I like the sweetness of basil. If you have neither, however, no one will judge you for eating it as it is, straight out of the pan. Perfect penne all’arrabbiata Serves 2 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus a little extra to finish 1 tsp chilli flakes 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced 400g good tinned chopped tomatoes 200g penne 1/4 tsp red wine vinegar Handful of basil leaves Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the chilli. When it begins to darken, stir in the garlic and cook just until it colours slightly, then add the tomatoes and a generous pinch of salt, breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon. Simmer for about 15 minutes while you cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water until just al dente. The sauce should be thick by this time – if it looks too dry, add a splash of the pasta cooking water. Stir in the vinegar and season to taste, then drain the pasta and stir into the sauce. Cook until the sauce coats each piece, then divide between bowls, drizzle over a little oil and tear over the basil leaves. Penne all’arrabbiata: what makes you angry about my recipe? Can anyone explain the point of adding vodka to a tomato sauce … or where the tradition originates? And, I can’t resist; if you had to eat one cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/02/barcelona-in-strange-and-symbolic-eye-of-a-storm-over-catalonia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T13:37:55Z","webTitle":"Barcelona in the strange and symbolic eye of a storm over Catalonia | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/02/barcelona-in-strange-and-symbolic-eye-of-a-storm-over-catalonia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/02/barcelona-in-strange-and-symbolic-eye-of-a-storm-over-catalonia","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona in the strange and symbolic eye of a storm over Catalonia","bodyText":"At every Camp Nou game for almost six years now, chants for Catalan independence have gone up when the clock reaches 17 minutes and 14 seconds, commemorating the year the city fell to Felipe V, but not this time – not on the day they were perhaps closer to independence than ever before. This time, Europe’s largest stadium was silent. No fans could be heard, only footballers. Occasionally, the referee’s whistle rang out or somebody clapped yet there were no chants, no songs and no one to sing them. At the side of the pitch where Barcelona played Las Palmas, stewards in orange bibs lined up to keep an eye on stands that had no one in them. Ninety-eight thousand seats sat empty; barely a couple of hundred people were there, and many of those wished they weren’t. It was late Sunday morning when Barcelona’s international defender Gerard Piqué voted in the referendum on independence called by the Catalan government and declared illegal by the Spanish government and the constitutional courts. He, like many others, had insisted he would vote anyway so he had done, shaking hands with staff at the polling station, smiling and setting off for the stadium. But while that scene was repeated in many places it wasn’t the case everywhere and by the time he left the Camp Nou seven hours later, there were tears in his eyes. So much had happened and so much more could still happen, a future uncertain and scary. Barcelona had won 3-0 but Piqué called it the worst day of his career and the worst thing the state had done in 50 years. “The images speak for themselves,” he said. They had gone around the world: pictures of violence and pictures of the stadium, surreal and still, gates closed in protest, fans standing outside looking through the bars as the match was played before a television audience of millions and an actual audience of substitutes, coaches, physios, cameramen, journalists and stadium staff. “Strange,” Sergio Busquets called it. Symbolic too – which this game was always likely to be, just not like this. They say sport and politics shouldn’t mix, by which they tend to mean other people’s politics. It’s a line Spain’s secretary of state for sport has used, and one Espanyol manager Quique Sánchez Flores repeated on Sunday night after his side were defeated 2-0 at the Bernabéu, where the 12th minute saw Spain flags unfurled and a rendition of Y Viva España in response to the referendum. “I’m not going to mix politics or sport or take part in this show,” he said, but sport and politics do mix, especially with Barcelona, who the Marxist writer Manuel Vázquez Montalbán described as the “symbolic unarmed army of Catalonia”. That identification with Catalonia, while nuanced, shifting, unevenly embraced, sometimes vague and often problematic, is part of what gives Barça an explicitly socio-political dimension. It comes together, of course, in the slogan: mes que un club, more than a club. And that meant this was always going to be more than a match even if in the end it was less than one. In September 1976, Las Palmas came to the Camp Nou for the first Barcelona game broadcast in Catalan on Radio Barcelona. In October 1977, they were again the visitors when Barcelona invited Josep Taradellas, former head of the Catalan government, in exile since 1939, to preside over the game. “I’ll come on one condition,” he said: “You win.” Before the match, he told supporters they shared the “same faith” he had 40 years earlier, insisting they had inherited a Barcelona “rooted in Catalanism”. Later in 1978, Las Palmas were again their opponents when they won the Cup for the first time since the transition to democracy, Johan Cruyff collecting the trophy from Juan Carlos. And then on Sunday, the day of the referendum, Las Palmas arrived once more. This time they said they didn’t want to be silent witnesses: they came with special shirts, Spain flags stitched to their chests. During the week, national police and civil guard had arrived in Catalonia charged with preventing a referendum that had been declared illegal. Videos showed civil guard officers setting off to Catalonia, applauded by friends and families who sang the football chant “A por ellos!”. Roughly: go get them! Bizarrely, others had turned up at the port of Barcelona in a boat with a gigantic picture of Tweety Pie on the side. Arrests were made, ballot papers destroyed and websites blocked, a case for sedition brought. The government claimed to have dismantled the referendum. Of 2,315 polling stations, more than half had been sealed off, they said. They would enforce the law, they added. We’ll still vote, came the reply. “Votarem!” the chant. The government said that preventing the referendum was defending democracy. Not many footballers spoke but some did. Barcelona released a statement defending the right to vote; not necessarily to choose independence but to choose. “Voting is democracy!” the former Barcelona player Carles Puyol said. “Tomorrow is not about independence, it is about democracy,” Pep Guardiola insisted. “You can vote yes, no, or blank, but you vote,” Piqué said later. “For a long time people couldn’t vote and now it’s something we have to defend.” Electoral colleges were occupied to keep them open, voting slips printed privately, plastic ballot boxes brought in. In those conditions it was flawed, few guarantees offered, but it was going ahead, and while some – particularly those against secession – stayed away, large numbers came out. Polling stations opened on Sunday morning and some were forcibly closed down. But by the end of a day of tension and violence that felt like a point of no return, the Catalan government said over two million people had voted, and Spain’s Interior Ministry admitted that all but 79 of the 2,315 polling stations had opened. The Camp Nou, that sounding box of Catalan sentiment, on the other hand, had not. In some places, police in riot gear fired rubber bullets. They smashed through doors of polling stations and took ballot boxes. There were charges, sticks used, people hurt. There was blood and balaclavas, anger and aggression. Some of the images were brutal, horrifying. In some places national police confronted firemen who protected people; there were cases of confrontations between the national police force and the Catalan police. “We did what we had to do,” the Spanish president Mariano Rajoy later said. He called Spain an example to the world, but the reaction suggested that much of the world didn’t agree. The Catalan government claimed 850 people had been hurt. The images travelled; you’ll have seen dozens of them by now. On Sunday night, crowds gathered at the Puerta del Sol in central Madrid to show support. The images had reached the Camp Nou too, where there was a protest as well, but this was different. “Sadly, I grew up in a place that’s seen similar before,” their Basque manager Ernesto Valverde said. “We don’t live in a bubble. We’re all conscious of what happened.” In those circumstances, things changed. Barcelona’s identification with Catalonia demanded it. The traditional pre-match meal between directors of the two clubs was cancelled and meetings were held. There were many who wanted to refuse to play. The grada de animació, the fans behind the north goal, said the game should be called off and if it wasn’t they would ask people to invade the pitch. Rumours started going around that it would be postponed and at 1.40pm the Catalan Football Federation announced the suspension of all games due to be played after 2pm. Barcelona-Las Palmas, kick off 4.15pm, was one of them, but nothing explicit was said. So they waited. If it was to be cancelled, most initially assumed it was a safety issue – even though four days before, when they finally broached the fact that, hang on, the game is on the same day as the referendum, authorities had said there would be no problem. The referee said as much in his report. Barcelona though said differently. The league said there was no security threat and refused requests to postpone the match. If Barcelona pulled out, they were informed they would automatically lose 3-0 and have a further three points taken off. At 2.40pm reports started circulating that it was off, but no one knew for sure. At Camp Nou, the gates were still closed to fans. The concourse around the stadium was deserted but for a handful of staff with no idea what was happening, standing there waiting. In the offices, the assumption was that it was off, but nothing had yet been confirmed. At 3.14pm, sporting director Robert Fernández walked in. “I don’t know anything,” he said. Another director privately said it was off. The teams, though, were already inside. Players and the board were discussing it. Most players wanted to go ahead. There was still no news and still no supporters. They waited outside. Inside, passageways were empty. At the stalls, they prepared food for fans who weren’t coming. Stewards went through the motions and hostesses stood there with no one to greet. At 3.30pm, 45 minutes before kick-off, Jesper Cillissen came out to warm up in an empty stadium, followed soon after by Ter Stegen. Up in the directors’ box, Fernández sat with Ariedo Braida, just the two of them. 3.34pm, still no idea. Down below, two members of staff walked across carrying a board saying “democracy” on it. It was 3.42pm and there was no news, but the players were out now in their normal yellow-and-red-striped training tops, the colour of the Catalan flag. The thud-thud of the ball echoed around the stadium. Then, 24 minutes before kick-off, it was finally official: Barcelona would play Las Palmas, but behind closed doors. “I understand that some didn’t want to play,” Piqué said later. “There were arguments for and against.” Two directors resigned, Jordi Monés and Carlos Villarrubí walking immediately. Josep Maria Bartomeu explained that with six points the punishment for pulling out they had decided to stay, but to play behind closed doors as a way of making a point, sending an image around the world. It was a decision in keeping with his presidency – a kind of “yeah but no” that didn’t really please anyone. As Gazetta dello Sport’s Filippo Ricci put it, ultimately the decision satisfied neither tourist nor purist. The former left disappointed; the latter felt that if you really are more than a club, then forget the six points. Ex-president Joan Laporta called it an “abstention”. Headlines on Monday called it a disgrace. If not everyone agreed. Not everyone knew, either. Outside fans waited by the gate, wondering what was going on. There were 13 minutes to go until kick-off but the loud speakers there stayed silent. Journalists broke the bad news. Then at 4.05pm, an announcement was at last made and the supporters headed home. They’d waited a long time for nothing. At 4.13pm, Barcelona’s anthem blared out. The referee came out of the tunnel and picked up the ball from that absurd plinth, hurriedly throwing down the one he had in his hand, and the players followed. Echoing round, the anthem opens with the line: “The whole stadium cheers; we’re the blue and claret people.” When it closed, a “brave cry”, the place fell silent and the whistle went, heard by all. There was no one in stands, where the mes que un club slogan sat exposed. The directors’ box lay empty. The board watched it from somewhere inside. So did the players’ families, a lift-load of kids leaving together at the end. Every shout was audible. A free-kick was greeted with “oh, so you give this one?”, there was something about a “mother’s shell”, and the standard call of any park anywhere: get out, push up, man on, quick, that’s it, near post, no foul, good. There’s something odd about actually hearing someone shout: “Leo! Leo! Here, Leo!” at Messi. Something odd about it all. Something sad too, a kind of what’s the point when it’s like this? But it was fascinating too. You could close your eyes and more or less follow the game, imagining the kind of pass delivered by the noise, the ball struck or stroked. Phwump or tac. From way, way up, you could hear Messi get hit, and the satisfying sound of his free-kicks being saved: leather then latex on the ball. From way down there they could hear the radio commentators shouting when Busquets scored. And when Messi got the second and third there was gentle applause from a ballboy behind the goal. Suddenly, somehow, in an empty stadium there was also someone running on the pitch, swiftly removed by stewards. He appeared to be wearing an independence shirt and carrying a piece of paper. With barely seconds to go Luis Suárez put a shot wide. His scream rolled round the seats and he tore at his shirt, ripping it wide open and walking off. Somehow it didn’t seem to matter so much on an empty stage, like this didn’t really count. But the three points did – which was why they played. Maybe sport did trump politics? At the end, the players shook hands but didn’t swap shirts and left quietly. At the end, it says there. Could this be the end? The beginning of the end, anyway. By late evening, the Catalan government announced that 2,262,422 votes had been cast; 2,020,144 of them voting Yes to independence. On Sunday morning Marca had led with a front cover showing Neymar and Cavani embracing insisting that it is never too late to sort things out. Perhaps they should have used Piqué and Ramos, for a start, and by Sunday night, it felt more difficult than ever. “This was not a referendum, it was just a show,” Rajoy said. He said the responsibility lay solely with those who had brought the referendum, defying the law. He also belatedly talked about dialogue, but something shifted and that feels further away than ever. Although those voting figures are flawed – general elections have previously suggested that Catalonia is divided on the issue, split almost exactly down the middle – Puigdemont says it is a mandate and that a unilateral declaration of independence may follow in 48 hours. Then what? How does the Spanish state react? And what happens next? And what happens to Catalonia’s football teams? It doesn’t matter, you might think, but it does. Perhaps more than it should. It has been a recurring theme in recent years, a question asked over and over. The president of the league says that in the event of independence, they would not be able to play in La Liga. Some of them didn’t want to play on Sunday. “We discussed it,” Piqué said. “After everything that happened today in Catalonia and the pictures, which speak for themselves, the violence that everyone has seen, it was very hard to play without our fans.” As he spoke, his voice began to break. He left just before 7pm. Although he offered to step aside if the manager thinks he is a problem, Piqué will arrive in Madrid, to play for Spain. “I truly believe there are loads of people in Spain who are totally against this and believe in democracy,” he said. “There has been no act of aggression [from Catalonia] and the national police and the civil guard had to come and act the way they have. “I think this will make things much worse. It’s one of the worst decisions in 50 years, and it will only separate Spain and Catalonia more. I’m very proud of Catalonia and all its people. They were peaceful, they didn’t react. I’d tell them to keep doing it the same. However much they are incited, however much they want them to fall into the trap, remain peaceful and sing, sing loud.” Talking points • So, just the 34 goals this week, then. • For a moment, Madrid lived a little dangerously against Espanyol. A shot against the post before half-time ushered in a second half when they suffered and, although they had a one-goal lead, you wondered if they might even go a fourth league game at home without a win. But just as the pressure built, there was Isco again to score his second. “It was about time we won at the Bernabéu,” he said. • Real Sociedad finally broke a run of four consecutive games in which they conceded three – by letting in four. Still, at least they scored four as well, in a wet, wild and wonderful match with Real Betis at Anoeta which went from 0-1 to 1-1 and from 2-1 to 2-3, then 3-3, 3-4 in the 84th minute and 4-4 in the 85th. And it could have been 4-5 as well, when Sergio Leon, who’d belted in the 3-4, raced away at the very end and was brought down on the edge of the area. • “New manager, certain victory,” they say. Then again, they say a lot of things. This time, though, they were almost right. Pako Ayesteran’s Las Palmas were beaten at the Camp Nou but there were debut victories for Calleja at Villarreal, where Bakambu scored a hat-trick against Eibar, and for Alavés’s new manager Di Biasi. Their win over Levante gets them off the mark … and off the bottom. “It doesn’t always work like that, but today it did,” he said. It’s Málaga who are bottom now. “We’re not playing so badly as to only have a point but we have to accept the reality,” Míchel said. “The numbers are horrible.” • “I’ve saved a match ball,” Pepe Mel admitted. Florin Andone saved it for him with three minutes to go. • Málaga were beaten 2-0 by Sevilla, who are now second without entirely convincing. Mind you, it was hot: 36 degrees at the Sánchez Pizjuán. “You don’t have to be a genius to know that you can’t play a game in Sevilla at four o’clock,” Berizzo said. “And it’s not even the players who are at the greatest risk: the fans spent three hours in the oven.” • Atlético couldn’t score at Butarque for the second season in a row.

The big picture Both sides reported progress at the conclusion of last week’s fourth round of Brexit talks, particularly on citizens’ rights, with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, highlighting “a new dynamic” created by Theresa May’s Florence speech. But it was clear that major stumbling blocks remain and Barnier made it plain that Brexit talks were highly unlikely to advance from the key article 50 issues – of citizens’ rights, the Irish border and the financial settlement – to discuss the future trading relationship any time soon: Theresa May’s speech made it possible to unblock the situation, to some extent. But we are far from being at a stage – it will take weeks, or maybe even months – where we will be able to say, ‘Yes, OK, there has been sufficient progress on the principles of this orderly withdrawal.’” Britain’s offer to protect EU citizens’ rights in the UK by enshrining EU law in the withdrawal treaty went down well. But while it has promised that no member state will lose out from Brexit until 2020, Britain is still not prepared to say what past financial commitments it would meet, Barnier said: For the EU, the only way to reach sufficient progress is that all commitments taken at 28 member states are honoured at 28. Despite officials acknowledging that May’s speech was “full of concessions”, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, also said talks would not be able to move on to the next stage this month as the UK wants: At the end of October, we will not have sufficient progress. I’m saying that there will be no sufficient progress from now until October, unless miracles would happen. With every new round of talks, it seems to become clearer, as the Guardian’s Brexit policy editor, Dan Roberts, wrote, that the pace and direction of Britain’s retreat is being determined entirely by one side: Barnier now makes no bones about this being a game played on his turf, by his rules, and that Britain will have to keep coming back, and back, until it provides the right answer. If the government wants to move on to trade talks, it may soon face a stark choice: fold on the remaining points by ceding more money and control to Brussels, or give in to increasing demands from within the Conservative party to walk away without a deal. The view from Europe The newly re-elected German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who met May on the margins of an EU summit in Tallinn, made it clear she would not bypass Barnier to intervene in the negotiations on the UK’s behalf, but described the British prime minister’s request for a transitional period as an “interesting” proposal: Today we talked about the first phase. And this first phase means to solve the Northern Ireland question, the rights of the citizens and the financial questions. There is progress here. We will surely follow the recommendations of Barnier. The summit also heard that the European council president, Donald Tusk, would draft future options for the EU by its October summit. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, stressed that the EU will stick to its Brexit talks schedule: If we accept speaking about life after [Brexit], we will open 27 debates on future life that are profoundly weakening for the EU. That’s why the chosen method is the good one. Meanwhile, back in Westminster The political action has shifted to Manchester this week, where the Conservatives are holding a conference dominated by Brexit, or one particularly niche and insular aspect of it. Yes, conversations remain focused on Boris Johnson’s personal views on the departure from the EU, and the foreign secretary’s perceived disloyalty in calling for a transition period strictly limited to two years. It was the onerous job of Philip Hammond to tour the broadcast studios on Monday and explain all this, and the chancellor was remarkably open about a cabinet split. “There are differences of view, nobody is denying that,” he said. Hammond also warned that a lack of unity could weaken the UK’s negotiating position with Europe, saying businesses need as much certainty possible. This does seem the case. In a highly unusual intervention, the head of the British Chambers of Commerce accused Johnson of destabilising the government and warned that division was undermining economic confidence. Adam Marshall said there was growing impatience with “division and disorganisation at the heart of the party of government”. How does Theresa May get out of this? One option would be to sack Johnson – Hammond was at pains to point out that no one in the cabinet should be seen as beyond such a fate – but that could plunge the government into chaos. Instead, expect some protestations on unity in Manchester, and a speech from May on Wednesday that will attempt to move the debate on. How, and if, she can do that remains to be seen.

Read these In the Guardian, Jonathan Lis of the British Influence thinktank offers this on Brexit’s impact on the NHS: We value the NHS more than any other institution. As the defining icon of the postwar consensus and intrinsic component of our national story, it unites Britons across political, geographical and class divides. Crippled by austerity, staff shortages and low morale, our NHS is on its knees. But far from offering a helping hand, Brexit threatens to bring it down altogether. Brexit stands to damage staffing, funding, access to new products and technology, and standards of public health … The key area of risk is also the central plank of Brexit: restrictions on free movement of people. Jonathan Freedland argues that the Labour leadership’s misguided aversion to the single market is blinding the party leadership to the economic harm of leaving the EU: All but the most deluded Brexiteers concede that departing from the EU will hurt the economy, for a few years at the very least. Corbyn and McDonnell have big plans that will cost big money. But, thanks to Brexit, they will find less cash in the coffers, and less market willingness to lend the country any more. They will face early the shadow that has hung over every reforming Labour government: the prospect of the money running out. This is what should keep Labour’s ruling circle up at night. It’s not the EU that could turn their dreams to ashes – it’s leaving the EU that could do that.

As promised, the region’s pro-independence majority government staged a unilateral referendum on separating from Spain. In doing so, it defied the Spanish constitutional court and the Madrid government. The Spanish government had made it very clear that it would not tolerate such a direct challenge to the unity of Spain or the constitution itself. More than 800 people were injured as police stormed polling stations, seized ballot boxes and dragged away voters. What was the result of the vote? According to the Catalan government, preliminary results showed that 90% of people cast their ballots in favour of independence. A total of 2.26 million Catalans – 42% of the region’s 5.3 million eligible voters – are said to have taken part in the referendum. Is the result legally binding? The Catalan government, which passed legislation last month to begin creating an independent state, says it is. The Spanish government says it isn’t, pointing out that, in any case, the constitutional court had specifically suspended the referendum in September. What does the Spanish constitution say? “The constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards; it recognises and guarantees the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all.” What happens next? The Catalan government has said it will make a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain within 48 hours of a victory for the yes campaign. With no minimum turnout threshold for the referendum and 90% of voters apparently in favour of independence, it is expected to make the declaration this week. What will the Spanish government do? Just as Madrid will not recognise the results of a referendum both it and the courts have declared illegal, so it will not recognise an independence declaration. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, still has the option of tackling the independence challenge by invoking article 155 of the Spanish constitution. The article, which has never been used, allows the Spanish government to step in and take control of an autonomous region if it “does not fulfil the obligations imposed upon it by the constitution or other laws, or acts in a way that is seriously prejudicial to the general interest of Spain”. Will it actually do this? Article 155 remains the last resort. Not only has it never been used, such a move is also likely to prove highly risky in Catalonia given the enduring tensions and the violence that marred Sunday’s vote. Any chance of proper negotiations between the two governments? Very unlikely. Neither wants to be seen to make any concessions. The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, has said he is willing to go to prison over the independence issue and will only back down if the Spanish government provides a public assurance that a mutually agreed referendum will take place and provides a time frame. The Spanish government has flatly refused to engage in any negotiations on a referendum. What about external pressure? The European Union has said it will not intervene in the matter, which it views as an internal one for Spain. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has said that Brussels must abide by the decisions of the Spanish government and of Spain’s constitutional court. The commission has said on several occasions that a vote in favour of Catalan independence would be recognised but only if the referendum that produced it complied with the Spanish constitution and had been ruled legal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/02/how-was-your-weekend-running","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-02T08:39:18Z","webTitle":"How was your weekend running?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/02/how-was-your-weekend-running","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/02/how-was-your-weekend-running","fields":{"headline":"How was your weekend running?","bodyText":"As I’m off for a fun run round the streets of Chicago next Sunday, I took it pretty easy this weekend.

I felt rather sorry for the ones going over Wandsworth bridge – surely London’s least scenic – but presumably they got some prettier ones, without the charming views of the drive-through McDonalds and the white arches supporting the scenic advertising hoardings.

A new poll, conducted by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, has found 49% of Australians support a moratorium on fracking for gas in their own state, while just 24% oppose it. It also found 74% of Australians support an increased renewable energy target in their own state, demonstrating support for state-based renewable energy targets is largely unchanged since March 2016. The Australia Institute survey of 1,421 Australians took place between 17 and 26 September. It asked voters if they supported or opposed their state governments implementing a moratorium on fracking for gas and an increased renewable energy target. The poll ended last week just as the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, wrote to the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, and the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, asking them to lift their “blanket moratoriums” on new gas production and warning they were putting Australia’s energy security and industries at risk. The next day, major gas companies agreed to fill the domestic shortfall in Australia’s gas market next year, saving the Turnbull government from having to enact its export control trigger. In a move hailed as a win by the government, Santos, Origin Energy and Shell agreed to quarantine additional supply for the Australian gas market following a meeting last week between the companies and Turnbull, his deputy, Barnaby Joyce, and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg. Turnbull did not confirm how many additional petajoules were being set aside by the companies. He said he had scheduled another meeting with the gas companies for Tuesday this week. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, criticised Turnbull’s repeated meetings with the gas bosses, saying the prime minister first met with suppliers in March and said he would resolve the crisis but little had happened. Shorten said last week’s pledge from the gas companies to quarantine supply for the domestic gas market would not stop prices rising, and Turnbull ought to pull the gas export controls trigger to ensure more supply was available locally. “This isn’t a fix, this is a flop,” Shorten said. “Turnbull had the chance to show the gas giants who was in charge by pulling the trigger on export controls, but he squibbed it. “This isn’t just a supply crisis – this is a price crisis. The gas on offer is simply too high a price for Australian businesses, and that means thousands of jobs are under threat,” he said. The Australia Institute poll also contains the results of a survey of 1,408 Australian residents in April, which asked voters what they thought was increasing energy prices. The April poll found 52% of respondents believed exports of gas were having the biggest impact on gas prices, followed by market deregulation (31%), with only 17% saying state-based gas bans were having the biggest effect on price. It also found half of Australians ranked moratoriums as having the smallest impact on gas prices (54%), and a majority (58%) blamed the “business practices of energy companies” for increased power prices. More than two in five respondents (44%) blamed gas exports for increased power prices, and less than a quarter (23%) blamed renewable energy for increase power prices. Both polls were conducted through Research Now, with nationally representative samples by gender, age and state or territory. Ebony Bennet, the deputy director of the Australia Institute, said with Australia about to become the world’s biggest exporter of LNG, the public wasn’t buying that there was a supply problem. “The federal government’s twin attacks on state fracking moratoria and renewable energy are both running against the tide of public opinion,” Bennett said. “Voters continue to blame exports, not gas moratoria for gas price rises.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/03/irish-theatre-womens-rights-dublin-theatre-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T14:43:21Z","webTitle":"Irish theatre on the rise: jail confessions and the fight for women's rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/03/irish-theatre-womens-rights-dublin-theatre-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/03/irish-theatre-womens-rights-dublin-theatre-festival","fields":{"headline":"Irish theatre on the rise: jail confessions and the fight for women's rights","bodyText":"In Dublin theatre festival’s 60th anniversary year, artistic director Willie White is placing the emphasis on new Irish work – and a sense of theatre in dialogue with its own traditions is explicit in Dead Centre’s Hamnet at the Abbey theatre. This riff on Hamlet begins playfully as a boy shares his thoughts on being “one letter away from greatness”. The fact that he is Shakespeare’s only son, who died aged 11, becomes the starting point for a meeting between father and child that takes place somewhere out of time. Writer-directors Bush Moukarzel and Ben Kidd create an encounter between the living and the dead, ingeniously realised by José Miguel Jiménez’s video design and projections. There are echoes of Joyce and Stoppard alongside the text’s sometimes glib Hamlet references. Shifting from the specifics of Shakespeare’s biography, it investigates what parents can teach their children about life, its randomness and, in the case of Hamnet, its brevity. If the renowned playwright can’t find the right words to say to his son, is he really the “great man” the son grieves for? With a riveting, completely poised, solo performance by Ollie West, this fascinating production takes us into a child’s view of the world, without any sentimentality. The same could not be said for Fishamble’s production of a new play by Sebastian Barry, On Blueberry Hill (Pavilion theatre), which also explores father-son relationships and themes of crime and forgiveness. Two cellmates in a Dublin prison, Christy and PJ (Niall Buggy and David Ganly), take turns to tell the interconnected story of how they got there. Their alternating monologues evoke the Dublin of the 1960s and 70s, with a lyricism that sometimes jars. This new work is connected to Barry’s award-winning novel, Days Without End, through the character of PJ, a young seminarian who is secretly gay. “God didn’t give us words for it,” he says. The necessity to hide the truth, even from himself, drives him to an act of violence. PJ’s story alone would have made a standalone monologue, but the interweaving of Christy’s narrative gives a cumbersome structure to Jim Culleton’s production, which has little scope for theatrical energy. And while the subject of the death of a child is undoubtedly sombre, the prevailing tone is mawkish rather than tragic. Parents’ inability to protect their children is also explored in the Corn Exchange’s multi-layered Nora (Project Arts Centre). Novelist Belinda McKeon, in collaboration with the company’s artistic director, Annie Ryan, has taken Ibsen’s A Doll’s House as scaffolding for a new play, set in the international art world in 2025. Transposing it to the near future ensures that nothing seems too outlandishly different from today. Details seep out: beyond the elegant fortress where Nora (played by Ryan) lives with her gallery-owning husband (Declan Conlon) and teenage daughter (Venetia Bowe), the streets are dangerous; it’s risky to venture into the Third Zone. Civil liberties for women have been curtailed, especially for free-thinking artists like her old friend Krista (Clare Perkins), who turns up on the day of a glitzy party, with Nora finessing decor and clothes like a power version of Mrs Dalloway. The dystopian conceit is a clever twist on the constraints experienced by Ibsen’s heroine in 1879. In this new context, the changes in the political climate might be enough to cause a married woman to think twice before walking out on the world of privilege she has spent years constructing, partly through manipulation and deceit. As in the original, the plot mechanics are more than a little contrived, but serve as pretexts for McKeon’s acute and witty character observation. While the marital crisis seems to come too quickly in the drama, it is directed by Eoghan Carrick as a Bergmanesque battle of wills and souls. All the performances have depth, especially Bowe as Emmy, the sparkling teenager who has inherited the artistic talent that her mother has long buried. It is one among many things, this production suggests, that are as precarious as they are precious. In the latest site-specific work from Anu Productions, women’s freedoms and rights are far from secure. The Sin Eaters (Pigeon House Lab) explores how they have been contested and stifled in Ireland over decades, throughout the 20th century, and up to the present day. In a series of choreographed scenes and tableaux, the audience is taken in small groups through a former scientific laboratory at the edge of the city, in Dublin Bay. The bare rooms are transformed by director Louise Lowe and the superb design team, Owen Boss, Carl Kennedy and Paul Keogan, to create a sense of institutional entrapment, evoking past trauma. We watch through glass as a woman is nailed to a table, while another pins herself against a wall with chair legs. Screams are heard in the distance. While this is all somewhat generalised, specific historical cases of injustice and suffering are also enacted, with audience members being taken on separate routes. In a room crammed with legal files, an actor (Katie Honan) enacts the case of Ann Lovett, the schoolgirl who died giving birth in 1984. In another, a tribunal of sorts is held, holding the Irish state to account for the restrictive role it assigns to women, under the constitution. The script tends towards the didactic and the production is most powerful in its elemental movement sequences, choreographed by Sue Mythen. As with all of this company’s work, it succeeds in taking theatre into political domains, personal as well as public. Seeing The Sin Eaters on the weekend of a major public march in Dublin, calling for an end to Ireland’s abortion ban, gave the production an enormous urgency. • Dublin theatre festival runs until 15 October.

Mike Bartlett did, in the end, detonate the Tom bomb as his parents’ self-absorbed awfulness finally drove him to desperate measures. But not, thank the gods, to the ultimate desperate measure. The body count (mercifully) remains at zero as the curtain falls on this most theatrical of sagas. But how did we get here? The rest of us know, but his parents seem confused. Diagnosis We left Gemma last week, veering her SUV towards Simon as he walked along that deserted forest road. Would you have blamed her if she’d turned him to roadkill and buried his sorry ass in the woods? Instead she finally puts Poor Tom first and races Simon back to the hotel, determined to get Tom out of harm’s way before his dad arrives and tries to drive another wedge between them. Arriving too late, Simon stands in the hotel car park glowering while a child’s ride tinkles away in the background, its queasily jolly theme tune at odds with the tragedy playing out yards away. Gemma’s motives in these last sequences are as confused as she is. She hurries Tom away but knows Simon will find them because they’ve gone home to the house they once shared, full of memories. She changes the locks but opens the door to her now broken ex-husband, knowing the only way to finish this once and for all is to talk. “Stay away from him,” Gemma warns as the emotionally volatile patriarch looms at his son, eyes wild with unpredictability. “You’re using me to get at her,” says Tom, finally slicing his dad’s smug countenance in two like a Samurai blade. It’s the first time he’s vocalised his hatred of being a pawn in his parents’ hateful game. “You should stab yourself,” hisses Gemma as Simon suggests he’d like to stab her in the eyes. Their hatred has reached a pitch beyond which there is only violence and her grabbing of the scissors is the inevitable (madly theatrical) next step. In Gemma’s flashbacks, they are a normal family – familiar, irreverent and teasing one another. How could the pendulum have swung so far from the domestic bliss of these visions? Is it all Simon’s fault or is Bartlett (through Simon) trying to lay some blame on the working mother, trying to have it all? I shifted uncomfortably in my seat during Simon’s suggestion that Tom would like to see more of his mum. By the time Simon comes to haunt them again, at their meal out with Ros and her new husband, he is human wreckage, thumping the restaurant window. “It should be me in there,” he says uselessly before suggesting to Gemma, quite seriously, that they should just forget about all this and get back together. “We are as bad as each other,” he tells her. “We could decide to be a family again. It’s not too late,” he continues – and for a minute I wonder if she’s mad enough to accept. “I should choke you to death,” he says, reverting to type after she viciously rejects him. And then comes the worst cut of all as Tom joins in. “You’re a massive failure,” son tells father, burning the last of Simon’s bridges. Unbelievably, through all of this, James is still hanging in there and gives Gemma a pair of earrings to which she is completely indifferent. His insistence that they keep seeing each other is the final nail in the coffin of their relationship, as Gemma explains she doesn’t need someone to fix her (er, she does). Tom’s midnight flit in a taxi prefigures his eventual flight from Parminster and panics her sufficiently when she hears that a desperate Simon is with him. However much Tom hates his dad’s actions, he responds to his emotional blackmail and ends up by a busy dual carriageway, watching Pops play chicken with the oncoming traffic. Rather than pulling the same stunt on Gemma that she pulled on him – are we calling this a reverse Medea? – Simon wants Poor Tom to somehow give him a reason not to end it all. When Gemma catches up with them, she drags Simon out of harm’s way and persuades him with a forceful, “Not like this,” suggesting she’ll help him if he’s really intent on ending it all, away from the terrified gaze of his son. The three go for the world’s bleakest meal, Simon ordering whisky and Pepsi (dear lord) and Gemma telling the cheerful waitress that he’ll also have an English breakfast with mustard and brown sauce. If the intravenous drugs don’t kill him, the acid reflux will. And we finally find out what Simon told Tom to make him leave his mum all those weeks ago – that she abandoned him as a baby during a particularly bad bout of post-natal depression. Not enough on its own, but for Poor Tom it only compounded the feeling that she never really wanted him. Why else would she spend all that time at the surgery? When Gemma returns from her mystery mission to the car park, it becomes clear she has set up a one-woman portable Dignitas in the hotel room so Simon can quietly pop off having said his goodbyes and wiped up the last of that brown sauce. Impressive that Simon can always eat, no matter how black the void into which he is staring. “Bye Tom,” he says as Gemma asks him to follow the instructions she’s left for him. This is unbelievable. None of them really want this do they? Tom cries desperately in the passenger seat. Surely Simon can get better? Why such a hopeless resolution? Gemma’s eleventh hour decision to stop him is bang on time for Simon, but too late for Poor Tom. While his mum idly flicks through her messages, he has made the cleanest of breaks, leaving his mobile on the passenger seat and walking away from his mad parents forever. He leaves Gemma a message with one final, devastating, “Love you”. We’ve been watching these maniacs hack away at each other for four episodes as Poor Tom sat between them, dodging the shrapnel. How could they not have noticed his utter despair? That closing speech of Gemma’s to camera is an unashamedly theatrical flourish only missing a red velvet curtain falling to wild applause as she finishes. “I’m here. Tom, I’m your mum. I’m sorry and I’m here. I’ll always be here waiting. When you want to come back. Whenever you want to come back.” She looks hopefully out on to the empty garden in an ending which reminded me of the superb National Treasure, where Robbie Coltrane’s desperate Paul Finchley searches in vain for his wife at the party to celebrate his “not guilty” verdict. Prognosis For me, the story of Doctor Foster is done. Yes, the potential for a sequel exists while Tom roams the streets and Gemma shivers pensively in a turtleneck. And Simon is, presumably, still out there somewhere, putting his life back together. But I have feasted on their misery long enough. It was delicious, but I’m full. Time of death – 23.00, Tuesday 3 October 2017. Notes • Of all the characters who need a good therapist after this, I’m most concerned about James and his need to throw himself at emotionally unavailable women. I bet his mum was a nightmare. • I liked the shrinking of focus down to just Gemma, Simon and Tom in the last episode. The scenes between Bertie Carvell and Suranne Jones packed such a punch. • Hands up if you thought Poor Tom had committed suicide when the sirens swelled on the soundtrack and Gemma approached that dual carriageway? • Gemma Foster isn’t Medea. It was Mike Bartlett all along, constantly making us think he’d murdered a child. I knew he wouldn’t go through with it. • She never did make it to Gloucester."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/04/support-for-marriage-equality-rises-in-guardian-essential-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T23:06:00Z","webTitle":"Support for marriage equality rises in Guardian Essential poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/support-for-marriage-equality-rises-in-guardian-essential-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/support-for-marriage-equality-rises-in-guardian-essential-poll","fields":{"headline":"Support for marriage equality rises in Guardian Essential poll","bodyText":"Public support for same-sex marriage is on the rise in the latest Guardian Essential poll, and 47% of the sample say they have already voted in the postal survey. The weekly survey of 1,841 voters finds headline support for the legalisation of same-sex marriage at 61%, compared with 58% a week ago, and opposition on 32%. Among people who have already voted, a clear majority have cast a yes vote – 64% say they’ve returned a yes ballot and 30% a no ballot. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Tuesday that an estimated 57.5% of enrolled Australians have already cast their votes in the postal survey, with a month still to go – and just under half of the Guardian Essential survey reported they had now returned their ballots. While 47% say they’ve already voted, 33% are reporting they will definitely vote, 6% say they will probably not vote, 3% will definitely not vote and 5% say they are not sure. The cohort reporting they will definitely vote are split 61% in favour of marriage equality and 37% against. People saying they will probably vote are split 57% in favour and 37% against. Only 2% of the cohort reporting they will definitely vote say they now don’t know which way they will cast their ballots, with that number 10% among people reporting they will probably vote. The clear majority support in favour of change, and the rising headline support for a yes vote during the business end of the postal survey, will significantly boost the morale of the yes campaign – but the Equality Campaign executive director, Tiernan Brady, warned on Tuesday there was “no room for complacency”. “The rest of this campaign we will not give up any single day, making sure that everybody out there knows how important this is – this is a vote about the lives and dignity of real people,” Brady said. On Wednesday Malcolm Turnbull told ABC’s AM that the 57.5% turnout estimated by the ABS was a “very high” participation rate and a “ringing endorsement” of the government’s policy to give Australians a say on same-sex marriage. The latest weekly opinion poll shows Labor has retained an election-winning lead over Turnbull’s Coalition government. Labor is ahead on the two-party-preferred measure 54% to the government’s 46%. Last week Labor was ahead 53% to 47%. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 3%. As well as tracking sentiment about the postal survey, voters were also asked questions this week about trust in institutions. The Australian federal police ranked top of a list of 15 institutions and organisations, trusted by 71% of the sample. Religious organisations, trade unions and political parties were the least trusted organisations on the list. Trust in religious organisations has declined from 30% in October 2015 to 26% in this week’s survey. When presented with a list of media organisations and categories, ABC television news and current affairs ranked at the top of the trust list, while commercial radio talkback programs and internet blogs were at the bottom of a list of 11."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/03/catalonia-holds-general-strike-protest-referendum-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T12:14:23Z","webTitle":"Thousands protest and strike over Catalonia referendum violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/03/catalonia-holds-general-strike-protest-referendum-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/03/catalonia-holds-general-strike-protest-referendum-violence","fields":{"headline":"Thousands protest and strike over Catalonia referendum violence","bodyText":"Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Barcelona headquarters of Spain’s national police force on Tuesday amid strikes in protest at police violence during the disputed referendum on Catalonian independence. As Madrid comes under growing international pressure to resolve its worst political crisis in decades, the crowd gathered in the Catalan capital, chanting “independence”, calling Spanish police an “occupying force” and urging them to leave the region. In Barcelona, municipal police said about 15,000 people had stopped traffic as they rallied, many draped in the blue, yellow and red Estelada flag used by Catalan separatists, shouting: “The streets will always be ours.” The protest came as several small labour unions and grassroots pro-independence groups urged workers throughout Catalonia to go on partial or full-day strikes. “An attack on democracy without precedent in recent times calls for a united response,” said Javier Pacheco, the secretary general in Catalonia of the Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) union. “We have called on all sectors to take part.” However, while the Catalan sections of the CCOO and UGT unions are supporting the strike, the two organisations’ national leaderships are not. Schools and universities were shut on Tuesday and most small businesses were closed after unions called for the stoppage to “vigorously condemn” the police response to the poll, in which Catalonia’s leader said 90% of voters had backed independence from Spain. Metro stations in Barcelona that are usually busy were deserted as services were cut back sharply, and the Boqueria market was almost empty. Elsewhere, the response to the strike call was patchy. There were no reports of disruptions affecting big industry or Barcelona’s airport. “People are angry, very angry,” said Josep Llavina, 53, a self-employed worker who had travelled to Barcelona from a nearby town to participate in the protest outside the police building. “They brought violence with them. They have beaten people who were holding their hands up. How can we not be outraged?” José Bolivar, 54, a town hall employee, said: “I disagree with the strike. In fact, at work nobody told me anything about a strike. So I decided to come.” Office worker Antonia Cuello, 37, was in two minds about the industrial action. “On one side it is a hassle to try to get to work in the midst of a strike,” she said. “We are suffering this because a few decided to behave in an improper way. On the other hand, I understand the circumstances surrounding the strike.” Barcelona’s contemporary art museum and the Sagrada Família, the basilica designed by Antoni Gaudí and one of the city’s most popular tourist sites, were expected to join the strike. FC Barcelona said it would take part in the strike, adding that it would close its headquarters and that none of its professional or youth teams would train. The central government has vowed to stop the wealthy north-eastern region, which accounts for a fifth of Spain’s GDP, breaking away from Spain and has dismissed Sunday’s poll as unconstitutional and a “farce”. At least 893 people and 33 police officers were reported to have been hurt on Sunday after riot police stormed polling stations, dragging out voters and firing rubber bullets into crowds. Violent scenes played out in towns and cities across the region as riot police moved in to stop people from casting their ballots. The UN rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, said he was “very disturbed” by the unrest while the European Council president, Donald Tusk, urged Madrid to avoid further use of violence. The European parliament will hold a special debate on Wednesday on the issue. “We call on all relevant players to now move very swiftly from confrontation to dialogue. Violence can never be an instrument in politics,” said the European commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas, breaking weeks of virtual EU silence on the Catalan issue. The government of the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, held emergency talks after the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, declared on Sunday that Catalonia had “won the right to an independent state”. Puigdemont has appealed for international mediation to help solve the crisis and called for police deployed to Catalonia from other parts of Spain to be removed. The regional government said 2.26 million people had taken part in the poll, or just over 42% of the electorate. But any attempt to unilaterally declare independence is likely to be opposed not just by Madrid but also a large section of the Catalan population, a region of 7.5 million people that is deeply split on the issue. Puigdemont said he would present the results to the region’s parliament, where separatist lawmakers hold a majority, and which has the power to adopt a motion of independence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/04/30000-guns-handed-in-during-australias-second-firearm-amnesty","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T05:35:06Z","webTitle":"30,000 guns handed in during Australia's second firearm amnesty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/30000-guns-handed-in-during-australias-second-firearm-amnesty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/30000-guns-handed-in-during-australias-second-firearm-amnesty","fields":{"headline":"30,000 guns handed in during Australia's second firearm amnesty","bodyText":"More than 30,000 firearms are expected to have been handed in during Australia’s first national firearms amnesty since the national gun buyback prompted by the Port Arthur massacre in 1996. Figures for most states and territories are yet to be finalised, but New South Wales police said they had received more than 20,000 guns between 1 July 1 and 30 September. Of those, more than 5,000 were surrendered in the past month. Western Australian authorities announced on Monday that they had received 1,242 surrendered firearms during the amnesty period, including 186 shotguns, 860 rifles, 196 handguns and 65,628 rounds of ammunition. The surrendered weapons included first world war rifles and handguns, a second world war sub-machine gun and luger pistols, as well as three guns from the 19th century. Tasmanian police collected 1,924 firearms, comprising 754 shotguns, 1,071 rifles and 109 handguns. The surrendered firearms included two SKS military-style semi-automatic rifles, a 150-year-old Belgian Lefaucheux 9mm pin-fire revolver plus a tin of original rounds, which had been used to guard the mail coach between Richmond and Hobart, and two guns that had been reported stolen since 1995: a .222 calibre rifle and a Norinco NZ759mm pistol. While it is the first national firearms amnesty since the buyback scheme in 1996, under which more than 650,000 guns were collected and melted down, there have been a number of smaller, state-based amnesty periods. WA police ran a statewide gun amnesty in 2013, which collected 1,281 firearms and 80,000 rounds of ammunition. South Australia has held five gun amnesties between 1997 and 2017, amassing a total of 13,252 firearms. In the most recent amnesty period, between December 2015 and June 2017, just before the national amnesty began, 5,472 firearms were surrendered. Queensland has held amnesties in 2004 and 2013, collecting and destroying 2,835 and 2,000 guns respectively. NSW reportedly collected 63,000 guns in two amnesties in 2001 and 2003 and a further 4,323 in 2009. Tasmania and Victoria have had standing gun amnesties since 1997, meaning that a person can at any time surrender an unregistered firearm to a police station or gun dealer. All firearms surrendered in the national amnesty will be destroyed, with the exception of a few antiques that have been passed on to state museums. University of Sydney emeritus professor Simon Chapman, who has researched the decline in gun deaths since the national firearms agreement was put in place six weeks after the Port Arthur massacre, said he suspected many of the guns surrendered in 2017 should have been surrendered 20 years ago. Chapman’s research found there had been no fatal mass shootings since the national firearms agreement was put in place and gun deaths had declined at an accelerated rate, from a 3% decline annually prior to 1996 to a 5% annual decline in the 20 years since. “The guns which have been handed in in the most recent one are guns that people kept in defiance of the law since 1996,” he told Guardian Australia. “At the time I can recall going on to gun blogging sites such as they were at that stage, and people talking about hiding them and burying them and all that sort of stuff … there are obviously more out there.” Chapman said the initial gun buyback and rolling gun amnesties were an important part of Australia’s gun control system because they reduced the likelihood that unregistered and unaccounted for guns would be available to people who had no proper purpose to have them. Under Australia’s gun laws, semi-automatic or automatic firearms of the type suspected to have been used in the Las Vegas massacre cannot be legally owned and possession of one of these weapons, or any other unregistered firearm, carries a potential fine of $280,000 or 14 years imprisonment. “Obviously there will always be some guns that come in illegally, but the world looks on to Australia’s gun laws with great envy,” Chapman said. The NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge questioned the effectiveness of gun amnesties, which he said did not balance out the number of guns being imported, legally or illegally, into Australia. “NSW alone is on track to have a record 1 million registered firearms by 2020,” he said. Shoebridge said the 2017 national firearms agreement, which resulted from the 20-year review of the Port Arthur laws, was focused on reducing red tape for gun owners. Gun Control Australia will release an audit of the 2017 laws on Thursday. “There is nothing in Australian law that stops a person from buying hundreds of guns and creating what are in effect private arsenals in suburban Sydney or Brisbane,” Shoebridge said. “This is a hole in the current laws that needs an urgent fix.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2017/oct/04/illegal-behaviour-uk-accused-of-failing-to-press-home-anti-slavery-law","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-04T13:50:14Z","webTitle":"'Path to illegal behaviour': UK accused of failing to press home anti-slavery law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/04/illegal-behaviour-uk-accused-of-failing-to-press-home-anti-slavery-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2017/oct/04/illegal-behaviour-uk-accused-of-failing-to-press-home-anti-slavery-law","fields":{"headline":"'Path to illegal behaviour': UK accused of failing to press home anti-slavery law","bodyText":"The government must start enforcing new legislation requiring companies to disclose slavery and trafficking risks in their supply chains, say anti-slavery campaigners. Under the Modern Slavery Act 2015, any company with a turnover of more than £36m that is registered and provides goods and services in the UK must file an annual statement under the Act’s transparency in supply chain (Tisc) clause. In the statement, they must identify risks of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain, and outline the steps they are taking to tackle those risks. But according to the Tisc report, a global supply chain transparency register, of the 3,939 UK companies who should have filed a statement, only 1,683 – less than half – have done so. Jaya Chakrabarti, CEO of the Tisc report, said: “Non-compliance is an alarm bell as to whether companies have all their ducks in a row and are operating within the law. Some companies will be accidentally non-compliant. Others are deliberately ignoring the act. The path to illegal behaviour begins with non-compliance.” Similar concerns were expressed in a report released on Wednesday by the Core Coalition that analysed the modern slavery statements of more than 50 consumer brands sold to customers in the UK. The study criticised cosmetics companies including Revlon and Boots for failing to acknowledge the risk of child labour associated with the mining of mica, a mineral widely used in the production of cosmetics, in India. Core also looked at anti-slavery statements filed by chocolate companies including Hershey, Ferrero and Lindt &amp; Sprüngli, none of which outlined the risk of child and forced labour in cocoa plantations in west Africa. Similar shortcomings were identified in statements provided by jewellery firms, which did not acknowledge the risk of labour abuses linked to gold mining. The International Labour Organisation estimates that almost 1 million children work in gold mines worldwide. A spokesperson said the Home Office was confident the legislation was working. “Thousands of transparency statements have now been published … All new legislation takes time to embed but the Modern Slavery Act is clearly already having a significant impact in driving business action against this abhorrent crime. “We are confident that compliance will largely be driven by public scrutiny, without the need for burdensome regulation, and are looking at what we can do to amplify the value of statements to customers, stakeholders, investors and activists.” But Marilyn Croser, director of the Core Coalition, said it was up to the government to enforce the legislation it had passed to tackle modern slavery in corporate supply chains. “It is essential that the government makes this law work,” said Croser. “At the moment it is very difficult for the public and civil society to scrutinise the reporting because the government has not provided a public list of the companies covered by the legislation. Giant corporates cannot continue to profit from the exploitation of millions of people.” Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said: “The Tory government announced its anti-slavery policies with great fanfare, but we see now there has been almost no action. There is a general chaos at the heart of this government. But in failing to implement anti-slavery measures, it is unforgivable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/03/theresa-may-defends-decision-not-to-sack-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T07:54:27Z","webTitle":"Theresa May defends decision not to sack Boris Johnson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/03/theresa-may-defends-decision-not-to-sack-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/03/theresa-may-defends-decision-not-to-sack-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May defends decision not to sack Boris Johnson","bodyText":"Theresa May has defended her decision not to sack Boris Johnson for making public demands about her Brexit policy, arguing she does not want a “cabinet of yes men”. Asked why the foreign secretary was still in his job, the prime minister said she was showing strong leadership by having a “diverse range of voices around the cabinet table”. “Weak leadership is having a cabinet full of yes men,” she said. “Weak leadership is having a team of people who only agree with you.” May delivered the same line in a range of broadcast interviews after previously demurring on Sunday about whether Johnson was unsackable because he could provoke a leadership challenge. He has made a series of interventions setting out his own personal blueprint for Brexit and making demands for the transition period, including limiting it to two years and refusing to submit to new rules from the EU during that time. Asked again on ITV whether he was too dangerous to move, May avoided any direct threat to sack him but stressed that “of course a prime minister makes decisions about who is in their cabinet”. She also made clear she had seen an advance copy of Johnson’s speech to the Conservative party conference, which is intended to deliver a message about the importance of a “global Britain” after Brexit. Her interviews come after a range of cabinet ministers and senior Conservatives suggested Johnson needed to make his interventions in private and abide by cabinet collective responsibility. Jeremy Hunt issued a warning to Johnson on Monday that failure to swing behind May risked opening the door to a Labour government, which he claimed could stop Brexit in its tracks. The health secretary made the comments to the Guardian after being asked if he feared the foreign secretary was “looking at the top job”. “What do you think?” replied Hunt, laughing, before adding: “All I would say to anyone who might be eyeing a different job is that Jeremy Corbyn is also eyeing a different job. “And if they don’t swing behind Theresa, who I think is doing a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances, they will just open the door to Jeremy Corbyn and probably the most dangerous leftwing government this country has ever seen.” When Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was asked whether Johnson should show more unity, he said: “I think the more we can show unity, the stronger our negotiating position with the European Union would be.” The Tory Scottish leader, Ruth Davidson, had a further dig at the foreign secretary, saying: “I have a lot of MSPs at this conference – if any of you think about writing anything without telling me that runs counter to Conservative policy, you’re out on your ear because nobody is unsackable.” Privately, other figures also expressed their frustration. One cabinet member told the Guardian: “Please don’t mention the B word”; another said that the interventions were damaging, but little could be achieved by forcing Johnson out. Johnson appeared to swing into line again on Monday after making his series of demands about what the transitional period should look like in the Sun just 24 hours before the party’s conference. The foreign secretary told the BBC’s Newsnight: “Contrary to some of the stuff that I notice has been knocking around in the media, you have a cabinet that is totally united behind every comma, every full stop, every syllable of the prime minister’s excellent Florence speech.” Conservative activists at fringe meetings appeared supportive of Johnson’s vision for Brexit. When one panel of Tory MPs was asked whether Johnson should be sacked, the audience shouted “no”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/03/sack-boris-johnson-for-sake-of-brexit-talks-key-mep-urges-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T12:30:49Z","webTitle":"Sack Boris Johnson for sake of Brexit talks, key MEP urges May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/03/sack-boris-johnson-for-sake-of-brexit-talks-key-mep-urges-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/03/sack-boris-johnson-for-sake-of-brexit-talks-key-mep-urges-may","fields":{"headline":"Sack Boris Johnson for sake of Brexit talks, key MEP urges May","bodyText":"A key ally of the German chancellor has called for Boris Johnson to be sacked to ensure progress in the Brexit talks, as the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, warned of a continuing lack of clarity from Britain’s warring cabinet. Speaking before a vote in the European parliament on Tuesday on the progress of the talks, Manfred Weber, the German leader of the largest political grouping in the chamber, told MEPs that Theresa May should remove the foreign secretary from his post to provide greater certainty on the UK’s positions. “The question for the moment is who shall I call in London [on Brexit]?” Weber said. “Who speaks for the British government – Theresa May, Boris Johnson, or even David Davis? “By reading Johnson’s attacks against his own prime minister he shows the British government is trapped by their own party quarrels and political contradictions … Please sack Johnson because we will have clear answers as to who is responsible for the British position.” As Johnson, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and trade secretary, Liam Fox, gave their speeches at the Conservative conference in Manchester on Tuesday, Weber added: “First Florence, and then Manchester. We listen to a lot of speeches but the substance is different. London is very creative at putting red lines on the table for pleasing their party supporters but they fail to have any solution for the voters and citizens. “I fully agree with Theresa May on at least one single point she said [in her Florence speech last month]. We can do so much better than this. Theresa May, please don’t put your party first … Show leadership on content.” The parliament later overwhelmingly supported a resolution condemning the UK for its handling of the negotiations and backing the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to hold out for the EU’s demands on money and the “indispensable” role of European court of justice in overseeing an agreement. Among those who voted in support of the resolution, which also accused the government of discriminating against EU nationals, were the Tory MEPs Richard Ashworth and Julie Girling. The chamber in Strasbourg, which will have a right of veto over any future withdrawal agreement with the UK, further advised EU leaders on the European council that there had been insufficient progress on the opening issues of citizens’ rights, the divorce bill and the Irish border to allow trade talks to commence. The leaders will make a decision on whether talks can move on to discuss the terms of a transition deal and a future trading relationship at a summit on 19 October. Weber’s concerns were echoed by the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, who told MEPs: “I want to express a big worry of mine. And that is the lack of clarity – or I can even say disunity – at the other side of the negotiation table. Hammond, Fox. Johnson, May.” The comments reflect deep concerns in Brussels that even in the wake of May’s Florence speech, in which she made a series of well-received pledges, there remains deep uncertainty about the British government’s future approach due to the internecine cabinet warfare. Addressing MEPs on Tuesday, Juncker said May’s address two weeks ago had been “conciliatory”, but he added: “When it comes to Brexit we still cannot talk about the future with any real clarity … Speeches are not negotiating positions.” Juncker said he was awaiting concrete proposals from the UK, following the Tory conference, on what financial commitments it was willing to honour and that the “devil as always will be in the detail”. With apparent reference to attempts by Davis and May to persuade EU capitals of their arguments for early trade talks, the commission president added: “For those in the UK, who think the UK should just go over Michel Barnier’s head, I remind them that the commission has been appointed by the 27 member states and the choice of Michel Barnier has been welcomed by them. He acts on their behalf on the basis of clear negotiating mandates.” Barnier also sketched out his concerns about the “serious divergences” between the UK and Brussels negotiating teams, “especially in the financial settlement”. To applause from MEPs, Barnier said that the UK most honour all the commitments it had made as a member, “no more, no less … no more, no less”. He added: “We will never accept for the 27 to pay for what was decided on by 28. The taxpayers of the 27 will not have to pay for the consequences of a decision they did not take.” Barnier backed the parliament’s resolution and further accused the British government of implementing discriminatory policies against EU nationals since the referendum result, telling MEPs that worries over a future weakening of rights was why it was crucial for the bloc to have the European court of justice oversee any future withdrawal agreement. He said: “This concern as you recall in your resolution is aggravated by certain discriminatory measures taken a few months ago by the UK authorities … We need a consistent interpretation of the agreement on both sides of the Channel. That only the ECJ can guarantee.” A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the EU said: “We have made considerable progress on citizens’ rights, Northern Ireland and Ireland, and have reassured our EU partners in regards to our mutual financial obligations … We want to get on to discussing the future deep economic and security partnership that we believe is in all our interests.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/03/chatterbox-tuesday","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T07:06:48Z","webTitle":"Chatterbox: Tuesday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/03/chatterbox-tuesday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/03/chatterbox-tuesday","fields":{"headline":"Chatterbox: Tuesday","bodyText":"It’s Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/03/ban-bump-stocks-las-vegas-shooter-automatic-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T20:42:51Z","webTitle":"Call for ban on 'bump stocks' – owned by Las Vegas shooter – that boost rate of fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/ban-bump-stocks-las-vegas-shooter-automatic-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/ban-bump-stocks-las-vegas-shooter-automatic-fire","fields":{"headline":"Call for ban on 'bump stocks' – owned by Las Vegas shooter – that boost rate of fire","bodyText":"Gun control advocates are calling for a ban on “bump stocks”, the largely unregulated novelty devices which Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock may have used to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that mimics the continuous fire of a fully automatic weapon. At least two bump stocks were recovered in Paddock’s hotel room, the Associated Press reported on Monday night, citing law enforcement sources. It is not yet clear whether they were used in his attack. Bump stocks attach to semi-automatic weapons and harness the recoil of the gun to allow a shooter to fire much faster than they could do if they repeatedly pulled the trigger – as the rifle recoils, the trigger bumps forward into the shooter’s finger to speed up the rate of fire. As one company that sells the devices, Bump Fire Systems, put it on its website: “Did you know that you can do simulated full-auto firing and it is absolutely legal?” It listed the price of one stock at $99.99. Gun experts called bump stocks a “toy” and “something a gun geek would want”, not a mainstream product or a tool for serious shooters who care about accuracy. Before Sunday’s attack, bump stocks featured prominently in gun enthusiast stunt videos on YouTube. Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, who authored the 1994 ban on assault weapons and has tried unsuccessfully to renew the ban in recent years, said in a statement on Tuesday that she has advocated banning bump stocks for years. “This is the least we should do in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US history. It should be our highest priority,” Feinstein said. “Hardware that turns legal guns into automatic weapons should be prohibited,” Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, one of America’s largest gun control groups, wrote on Twitter. “Automatic weapons are highly regulated; this evades federal law.” David Chipman, who spent 25 years as an ATF agent and now works as a policy adviser for Americans for Responsible Solutions, a gun control group, said the bureau has repeatedly confirmed that bump stocks and similar devices are not strictly regulated under the National Firearms Act or the Gun Control Act. Bump stocks allow rapid fire “by throwing the trigger against your finger as opposed to your finger pulling on the trigger”, he said. He called the device “a masterful creation of a technical workaround creating a loophole to circumvent the intention of the law”. Rich, a refinery operator from Wilmington, Delaware, who owns more than 40 guns, said he bought a Bump Fire Systems device for about $100 two years ago because it was “the closest thing that I could have that would simulate a machine gun”. Delaware, where he lives, bans the ownership of machine guns, which he would otherwise add to his collection. He requested that his last name not be published so he could candidly discuss his large gun collection without fearing that it might be targeted by thieves. Purchasing the bump stock did not required a background check, he said. “It’s just like ammo: you order them online, they ship them to your house.” The device was fun as a “range toy”, but tricky to master, and very difficult to fire accurately. “This thing requires practice,” he said. “It’s not something that somebody off the street could do the first time.” Many gun stores do not sell bump stocks, perhaps because they might attract “the wrong kind of crowd”, he said, meaning “irresponsible gun owners, people that they watch YouTube videos [and go], ‘Hey, I guess I don’t own a machine gun now,’ and they go out and they do things without seriously thinking about the impact of what they’re doing.” Many shooting ranges do not allow bump fire devices for a similar reason, he said. “I got my fun out of it but the novelty kind of wore off,” Rich said. “It’s definitely not reliable as a self-defense method or anything else.” He said on Monday night that he expected the devices would face intense scrutiny, and that some politicians would call to ban them, which he said would be regrettable. “I don’t want to see anything banned because of the actions of one person,” he said. “That just doesn’t jive with my principles of freedom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/01/si-newhouse-conde-nast-dies-aged-89","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T20:22:18Z","webTitle":"Si Newhouse, media baron who ran Condé Nast, dies aged 89","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/01/si-newhouse-conde-nast-dies-aged-89","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/01/si-newhouse-conde-nast-dies-aged-89","fields":{"headline":"Si Newhouse, media baron who ran Condé Nast, dies aged 89","bodyText":"The media baron Si Newhouse, chairman emeritus of Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair, the New Yorker and other leading magazines, has died. He was 89 and had suffered from a long illness. In a statement on Vogue.com, editor-in-chief Anna Wintour said: “Si Newhouse was the most extraordinary leader. Wherever he led, I followed, unquestioningly, simply because he put as much faith in me as I had in him. “Si never looked at data or statistics, but went with his instincts and expected his editors to do the same. He urged us to take risks and was effusive in his praise when they paid off. “This humble, thoughtful, highly idiosyncratic man, quite possibly the least judgmental person I’ve ever known, preferred family, friends, art, movies, and his beloved pugs over the flashiness of the New York media world.” Announcing Newhouse’s death to staff, Condé Nast’s chief executive, Bob Sauerberg, wrote: “In all realms, he wanted Condé Nast and its writers, artists and editors to be at the center of the cultural conversation.” Nephew Steven Newhouse, chair of Condé Nast owner Advance Publications, told the Associated Press: “He was passionate about journalism and he supported journalists and editors. He set an example of caring about the right things in media, which is great stories, great design, great magazines, great websites.” Newhouse became chairman of Condé Nast in 1975, going on to revive the fortunes of Vanity Fair and to purchase the New Yorker – to the consternation of many long-serving staff members and readers – in 1985. In an interview with the New York Times in 1989, he said some of the secret of his success lay in the fact that he was “not an editor”. “I flounder when people ask me, ‘What would you do?’” he said. “We feel almost that whichever way it goes, as long as it doesn’t do something absolutely screwy, you can build a magazine around the direction an editor takes.” Though his Condé Nast stable included magazines that did much to shape American fashion, literature and design, Newhouse himself was known for his lack of personal style. “Si Newhouse is nothing like his magazines,” read an Observer profile of Newhouse in 2009. “Short, physically unimposing, dressed for the office in khakis and beat-up loafers, he’s the opposite of glamorous. ‘He’s always had the luxury of being himself,’ says a friend. He’s notably inarticulate, speaking softly, with long, excruciating pauses between words. “A decision to commit millions of dollars might be communicated with a ‘very, very quiet whispered yes’, says one former editor.” In the same profile, the editor of the New Yorker, David Remnick, said: “He loves magazines, meaning the whole and all of it, the variety of things published, the business details, the visions and actions and personalities of his editors, the problems, the problem-solving, the ink and paper … the all of it.” Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr was born on 7 November 1927 in Staten Island, the grandson of Russian Jewish immigrants. His father, Sam Newhouse, bought the Staten Island Advance in 1922 and used its profits to buy more papers. Newhouse attended the elite Horace Mann high school in the Bronx. Among his classmates was Roy Cohn, a lifelong friend who went on to become a New York powerbroker, aide to the infamous Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy and mentor to the young Donald Trump. Newhouse dropped out of Syracuse University in his junior year, worked at his father’s newspapers and lived a playboy lifestyle. By the mid-60s he had found a place at Condé Nast. Once on the board of the Museum of Modern Art, he had a major collection including works by Picasso, Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns. Newhouse also owned, with his younger brother Donald, Advance Publications, a media empire which includes 26 newspapers based in cities across the US, including the Newark Star-Ledger in New Jersey, the Plain Dealer in Cleveland, Ohio and the Oregonian, based in Portland. Advance also has a 25% stake in Discovery Communications and cable TV assets. In 1998 he sold Random House for around $1.1bn. While he owned the publishing house, he commissioned a book by Donald Trump. The Art of the Deal became an infamous bestseller.

But they were also making history as the first same-sex couple able to marry in Germany, after a new law came into force which finally puts gay and lesbian couples on an equal legal footing with heterosexuals. “After 38 years together, this is a day we’ve waited a long time for,” 59-year-old Kreile told the Guardian ahead of Sunday’s ceremony. “We’ve actively campaigned for decades for the state to recognise us as equals. and finally we are able to celebrate a day we once thought may never come in our lifetimes.” Mende, 60, said it was a “huge honour” for the couple to be the first in Germany to marry. “I remember the shame we felt when we were turned away from a registry office 25 years ago when we confronted the registrar as part of an organised protest. They made us feel like second-class citizens.” Instead of feeling like pariahs, Kreile and Mende were on Sunday elevated to the status of heroes. Many of those who had campaigned with the couple over the years clapped and cheered alongside them as they kissed after saying their vows and signed their marriage documents. Germany has now become the 14th European country to legalise gay marriage, and the 23rd worldwide following a historic Bundestag vote in June. Gordon Holland, the registrar overseeing the ceremony, said Schöneberg was proud to be “firing a symbolic starter pistol”. Since the 1920s, the district has been a centre for gay and lesbian life, its free-spirited culture immortalised in the novels of Britain’s Christopher Isherwood, who lived in the district. It has also been the centre stage, over the decades, of strident battles for homosexual rights, a reputation it first earned when it held the world’s first gay demonstration in 1922. “Schöneberg has been shaped by the way it has stood up for gay rights for the best part of a century,” said Mende, who has lived there for years. “The world’s first gay and trans bars started here, and it has survived two world wars and many attempts to eliminate it,” he added, recalling the thousands of homosexuals from the district who were murdered by the Nazis. “So it’s fitting we’re here again today to mark this historic moment,.” Since 2001, same-sex couples in Germany have been allowed to register civil partnerships. At the time they were introduced, Germany was praised by campaigners for its trailblazer role. But it went on to lag behind other countries that subsequently introduced gay marriage. When Ireland made it legal in 2015, German campaigners called it highly embarrassing that Germany had been beaten even by a country with strong Catholic roots. In June, apparently caught off-guard by a question on gay marriage fired at her at an event hosted by a women’s magazine, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she believed same-sex partnerships were “just as valuable” as heterosexual ones. The U-turn following years in which she had resisted giving the issue her support was seized on by the Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in her government, who called a snap vote on it ahead of the summer recess. The motion saw 393 voting in favour, to 226 against. Merkel, who invited MPs to vote according to their conscience, voted against the move. Mende said he still did not know whether he should feel grateful towards Merkel. “Was it political calculus, to take the wind out of the SPD’s sails, or was it one of those things that just happened by accident, like the opening of the Berlin Wall?” he said, referring to the gaffe made by East German functionary Günter Schabowski that inadvertently led to the opening of the wall. But, he added, amid the political upheaval caused by Germany’s election last Sunday, in which the far right Alternative für Deutschland won 94 seats in the Bundestag, gay rights campaigners were under no illusion that such a vote would be as easy to push through under the future government. Jörg Steinert, head of the Berlin branch of Germany’s lesbian and gay association LSVD said now couples would be able to adopt, to enjoy equal tax and inheritance rights and the right to determine end-of-life care for a partner. Some issues still remain unresolved however, including women not having motherhood of a lesbian partner’s child automatically recognised. Following their ceremony, Mende and Kreile cut into a huge wedding cake decorated with a rainbow and the phrase “Ehe für alle”, (marriage for all). The reception was to be followed by a short break for the two bureaucrats in Vienna. “We partied big when we celebrated our civil partnership in 2002, so we don’t feel the need to do so in quite the same way this time,” said Kreile. “Since then we’ve referred to each other as ‘husband’, but the state has not seen it that way. We’re relieved they came round finally.” But one hurdle still remains for the couple. Their union cannot yet be entered in the marriage register because the software has yet to be updated to allow for two entries with the same sex. “Having made such a leap in other ways, it’s a bit embarrassing for the German state that they couldn’t rise to such a straightforward digital challenge,” said Steinert."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/01/m3-closure-boy-17-is-charged-over-potentially-hazardous-material","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T13:36:32Z","webTitle":"M3 closure: boy, 17, is charged over 'potentially hazardous' material","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/01/m3-closure-boy-17-is-charged-over-potentially-hazardous-material","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/01/m3-closure-boy-17-is-charged-over-potentially-hazardous-material","fields":{"headline":"M3 closure: boy, 17, is charged over 'potentially hazardous' material","bodyText":"A 17-year-old boy has been charged with arson after a flammable substance found on the M3 led police to close the motorway for 11 hours.

The Frenchman sustained a hamstring problem in the 3-0 win over Basel in a Champions League group game on 12 September. Since then United have beaten Everton 4-0, Burton Albion 4-1, Southampton 1-0 and CSKA Moscow 4-1 before the victory over Roy Hodgson’s bottom-placed side. Along with Pogba, Mourinho is also missing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Marcos Rojo and Michael Carrick, and the manager had been without Phil Jones and Marouane Fellaini for the trip to CSKA. Yet Mourinho said: “When we moan all the time about injuries it looks like we don’t trust the other people and we have to. We never miss the players that are injured, that’s our way of seeing. They are injured, we don’t think about them. It’s an opportunity for others, is a moment for others to step up and to get the chance, so I think that’s good.” United’s sixth win from seven league outings kept them in second place, only behind Manchester City by a goal difference of one. This is Mourinho’s second season in charge of United and he has previously won the championship in the second term of all of the clubs he has managed. Yet asked if he can see similarities between United and those other title-winning teams, he said: “It’s too early. Seven matches. It’s too early.” Juan Mata, who scored the opener against Palace, echoed Mourinho’s view. “We need to try to focus on each game and not think farther,” the Spaniard said. “We are happy with the start of the season, we cannot lie. And we arrive at the international break in a very good moment, scoring a lot of goals, not conceding in different competitions, so we know we have a good start but as well the manager is telling us all the time, and we know it, that it’s just the beginning and we need to keep calm.” While that was Mata’s opening goal of the season, Fellaini took his tally to four by registering twice against Palace. Romelu Lukaku completed the scoring to make it 12 in 10 appearances since the Belgian signed for £75m from Everton in the summer. In all, United have scored 21 times in the league and 32 in all competitions. Last year they lacked a cutting edge in front of goal and Mata is unsure what has changed. He said: “We are being more efficient. We are not training more on finishing than last season; it’s just down to confidence. Maybe it’s true that last season Zlatan was scoring almost every game and we tried to help with some goals but he was very responsible for our attack and this season everyone seems to enjoy the offensive duties. I don’t know the reason. It’s just – we are putting the ball in the back of the net.” Of Lukaku, Mata said: “It’s a lot of goals, especially when you come to a new environment. I knew he would score a lot but I didn’t know he would do it so quick, that’s true. He gives a lot more to the team, too, but for a striker it’s important to score, especially when you see other strikers are scoring. “I believe that is what he feels and he’s a good lad, a very humble lad and everyone likes him in the dressing room, so we are happy for him.” After the international break United travel to Liverpool. Last year’s corresponding fixture was a 0-0 draw but Mourinho insisted he has yet to plan for the match. “I didn’t even think about it, I just ended this game,” the 54-year-old said. “I’m not even thinking about Liverpool, I can promise you that; I didn’t have a second to think about the Liverpool game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/01/share-your-experiences-of-the-catalan-independence-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-01T09:34:07Z","webTitle":"Share your experiences of the Catalan independence referendum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/share-your-experiences-of-the-catalan-independence-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/01/share-your-experiences-of-the-catalan-independence-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Share your experiences of the Catalan independence referendum","bodyText":"An unprecedented challenge to Spain’s territorial unity will take place on Sunday as the Catalan regional government stages an independence referendum.

As a director of plays, especially Shakespeare, Pinter and Beckett, he was very fine. In the opera house he brought real musical understanding to the work of Mozart and Verdi. But it was through his creation of the Royal Shakespeare Company in the early 1960s and his stewardship of the National Theatre from 1973 to 1988 that he affirmed his passionate faith in subsidised institutions. If we now take their existence for granted, it is largely because of the pioneering battles waged by Hall and his visionary enthusiasm. As a man, he was extremely complicated. To many in the theatre, he was seen as a consummate politician: someone who hid his manipulative skills behind a mask of public affability. And he certainly possessed the politician’s ability to get things done. But he also had the vulnerability of the artist and, on many occasions, I glimpsed the melancholia and wounded spirit that lay beneath the geniality. Far from being a consummate Machiavel, he always struck me as a candid, generous and open person who made little attempt to conceal either his euphoria or his disappointment. Hall’s life and career were inevitably shaped by his upbringing. He was born in Bury St Edmunds, the only child of a Suffolk stationmaster, Reg Hall, and his wife, Grace (nee Pamment). Not only was Hall the sole recipient of his parents’ love: they encouraged his precocious interest in music and drama. Hall was the classic, working-class scholarship boy who was, in his own words, “avid for art, hungry for culture”. Free railway travel, because of his father’s job, enabled him to get to London to see the legendary Laurence Olivier-Ralph Richardson seasons at the New Theatre at the end of the second world war. A visit to Stratford-upon-Avon in 1946, where he was enchanted by the 21-year-old Peter Brook’s production of Love’s Labour’s Lost, made him decide he would like to run the Shakespeare Memorial theatre. He studied at the Perse school in Cambridge, where he played Hamlet, became head boy and learned the art of public speaking, and then did statutory national service. This was a deeply formative experience since in 1949 he was posted to Germany, where he saw first-hand evidence of the civic impact of arts subsidy. Having got a scholarship to read English at St Catharine’s College, Cambridge, Hall fell under the spell of two influential dons. From FR Leavis he learned the importance of textual rigour and the moral power of art. From George “Dadie” Rylands, who ruled the Marlowe Society, he absorbed the primacy of Shakespearean verse-speaking over scenic decoration. Cambridge provided Hall with a perfect springboard into the profession. His undergraduate production of Pirandello’s Henry IV was given a two-week London run at the Arts Theatre in 1953. Alec Clunes, who ran the Arts, liked what he saw, and when Clunes passed on the directorship to John Fernald he recommended that Hall be retained as a £7-a-week assistant. Hall quickly made his name with productions of Lorca’s Blood Wedding and Gide’s The Immoralist. After Fernald’s departure, Hall was offered the directorship of the Arts and so, at 24, found himself running his own London theatre. The decisive moment, both for Hall’s career and the future of British theatre, came in 1955 with the arrival on his desk of a play by an unknown Paris-based Irish dramatist: Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett. Hall passionately believed in the play without immediately understanding that it was a turning point in modern drama. Although it was initially greeted with derision (“a remarkable piece of twaddle”: Bernard Levin), the Sunday notices by Harold Hobson in the Sunday Times and Kenneth Tynan in the Observer turned the play into a box office hit and a national talking point. Hall’s directorial reputation was made and, with reason, since it was he who had interpreted Beckett’s characters as tramps rather than clowns and who had realised the text’s austere music. Hall was suddenly British theatre’s golden boy, in demand in the West End, Stratford, New York and at Sadler’s Wells. His 1956 production of Colette’s Gigi introduced him to a Hollywood star in Leslie Caron. They soon married and had two children. At the time, largely because of the Caron connection, Hall was even offered a job by MGM. But, having put down his marker at Stratford with productions of Love’s Labour’s Lost, Cymbeline and Twelfth Night, he was suddenly asked to succeed Glen Byam Shaw as the theatre’s director, a bold appointment that was to have huge repercussions for British theatre as a whole. Hall inherited a thriving, star-oriented Shakespeare festival: the 1959 season alone boasted Olivier, Charles Laughton, Paul Robeson and Edith Evans. But Hall’s vision was of a permanent company playing in Stratford and London and bringing its Shakespearean skills to both epic and experimental new work. His plans met entrenched opposition from London commercial managers, reactionary actors and funding bodies more concerned with embryonic plans for a National Theatre. However, Hall’s chairman Sir Fordham Flower, and loyal colleagues including Brook and John Barton, supported his dream. The result was the formal creation in 1961 of the Royal Shakespeare Company, which finally proved that permanence was possible in the freelance whirligig of British theatre. If there was a moment when the RSC achieved artistic maturity, it was with the 1963 production of The Wars of the Roses, Barton’s three-part conflation of the Henry VI plays and Richard III. During rehearsals Hall suffered a severe breakdown in health and was ordered prolonged rest. Instead, on the advice of Brook and Peggy Ashcroft, he went back to work and the result was a defining company triumph: a production that discovered in these ancient history plays a metaphor for modern statecraft and power-politics. But even that achievement was superseded in 1965 by Hall’s staging of Harold Pinter’s The Homecoming and Shakespeare’s Hamlet, with David Warner; he brought the same ruthless textual clarity and emotional precision to both. When you consider that in the same year he directed Arnold Schoenberg’s opera Moses und Aron at Covent Garden it looks like his annus mirabilis. Running the RSC, however, was a Sisyphean struggle, particularly since the pussy-footing Arts Council viewed its London base and expansive tendencies with disfavour. In 1968 an exhausted Hall handed over the reins to Trevor Nunn in order to become a freelance director of plays, operas and films: the result was a hectic period in which Hall’s constant success at Glyndebourne with Mozart and Monteverdi was not matched by the quality of his work in the movie studios. But Hall was, by temperament, a man who loved running things. And, after an abortive agreement to join Colin Davis as joint director of the Royal Opera House, Hall responded positively to discreet overtures to succeed Olivier as director of the National Theatre. Even Hall, however, found that his formidable political skills were tested when news of his appointment leaked out in 1972. Olivier felt that he had been shoddily treated by the board, and Hall faced a concerted guerrilla attack from discontented members of the ancien régime, hostility in the press and uncertainty about the opening date of the new National. The golden boy of the 60s had become the theatrical carpetbagger of the 70s. He weathered the storm; but, as his diaries, published in 1983, reveal, his early years at the National were marked by tension, turmoil and despair. Hall’s great achievement, however, was to make the new National Theatre a living reality. He did this by adroitly colonising the building stage by stage, so that the Lyttelton opened in March 1976, followed by the Olivier six months later, and the Cottesloe (now Dorfman) in spring 1977, the year in which he was knighted. Hall ensured from the start that the National’s obligations to world drama were matched by its commitment to living writers. He quickly got young dramatists such as David Hare, Howard Brenton and Stephen Poliakoff on board as well as more established talents such as Alan Ayckbourn, Peter Shaffer and Robert Bolt. In retrospect, this was Hall’s great legacy at the National: a belief that it should not simply acknowledge the past but also, at the risk of controversy and debate, warmly embrace the present. The struggle to get the show on the road inevitably affected Hall’s own work as a director. There were also criticisms of his acceptance of outside work (not least a Ring cycle at Bayreuth and his hosting of the television arts show Aquarius). There were even allegations, which he steadfastly denied, that he was abusing his position as director of the National by earning substantial amounts from West End and Broadway transfers of his work. But, after a shaky start, Hall did some outstanding productions at the National: best of all, Shaffer’s Amadeus (1979), Tony Harrison’s version of The Oresteia (1981), and a matchless Antony and Cleopatra (1987) with a witty, mercurial Judi Dench and a ruggedly ruined Anthony Hopkins. When he left in 1988, Hall handed over the National to Richard Eyre: one of his achievements, as he showed at the RSC, was his shrewd, unselfish choice of successors. But, for a man used to running large institutions, it was difficult to return to freelance life. His answer was to create the Peter Hall Company, which enjoyed spasmodic, and not always happy, relationships with a number of co-producers, including Duncan Weldon, Bill Kenwright and the Old Vic. The abrupt termination in 1997 of an Old Vic season, which included first-rate revivals of Waste, The Seagull and Waiting for Godot, was a bitter disappointment to Hall. But in 2003 he established a vibrant annual summer season at the Theatre Royal, Bath, which ran for 10 years and yielded excellent productions of Shakespeare, Pinter, Coward and Rattigan as well as helping to re-establish Shaw’s reputation with a brilliant revival of Pygmalion (2007) starring Michelle Dockery and Tim Pigott-Smith. Hall was also a driving force behind the creation of the Rose theatre in Kingston modelled on its Elizabethan namesake. Even if Hall’s dream of pursuing an eclectic repertory with a semi-permanent company never materialised and he resigned shortly after his opening 2008 production of Uncle Vanya, he returned there several times and in 2010 directed a magical production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream with Dench as Titania. Late in 2010, to mark his 80th birthday, Hall returned to the National to direct a quietly autumnal Twelfth Night starring his daughter, Rebecca, as Viola. While it did not possess the comic vigour of Hall’s earlier productions, it was profoundly moving. Hall’s last major production was of the two parts of Shakespeare’s Henry IV at the Theatre Royal, Bath, in 2011: it was a fitting swansong to an extraordinary career. After that, his health declined; he developed dementia and moved to a care home for the theatrical community, Denville Hall, in north-west London, and later to accommodation at Charterhouse within the City of London. In his earlier years, Hall’s private life had been a turbulent one. After the break-up of his marriage to Caron in 1965, he was married in the same year to his onetime RSC assistant, Jacqueline Taylor. The marriage was dissolved in 1981, and the following year he married the opera singer Maria Ewing. When the couple divorced in 1990, he found with Nicki Frei the stability and domestic happiness that had long eluded him. Hall had six children from his four marriages and created his own theatrical dynasty: his son Edward is a distinguished director in charge of Hampstead theatre and his daughter Rebecca has become a film star. But Hall’s ultimate legacy is his public one. If we still have a thriving Royal Shakespeare Company, a globally envied National Theatre and a network of subsidised regional playhouses, it is in large part because of his vision, tenacity and militant campaigning fervour. Deeply wounded by the Arts Council’s refusal to support his Old Vic seasons, he once ruefully said to me: “I feel I have done the state some service.” And it was his ability to harness his formidable private ambition to the traditional notion of public duty that made him such a powerful force for good in the British theatre.

Elite athletes, the thinking goes, train at altitude to improve their performance at sea level; ergo, if a non-elite athlete were to exercise in a hypoxic chamber (a sealed room in which the oxygen level has been decreased), then that person’s workout would improve. In normal life, I would have gone to a Virgin Active, or Third Space in central London, done some cross-training in a hypoxic area, and reported back that it was incredibly hard. But just on a whim, I thought I’d check how it worked, which is how I fetched up in the hypoxic chamber of UCL’s Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health, with the intensive care consultant Dr Dan Martin. “In gyms where they have a hypoxic area, if you go in there and do your normal training session – say you cycle for 20 minutes – you will find it much harder and you will feel wrecked when you come out,” Martin tells me. He fixes me with his straight-talking, intensive-care face. “You will feel like you worked harder, but you will not have worked harder. This is simple physics and physiology. You will feel terrible and your heart rate will be super-high, but that’s just because your heart is working harder to get your blood round your body.” OK, but what about the whole rich sporting heritage of going to Kenya for a month, then coming back and winning the Olympics? “There is evidence of a small benefit from living high and training low,” he says. That is, having a hypoxic area for resting, triggering a cascade of useful adaptations to improve the body’s uptake of oxygen (higher haemoglobin, more capillaries), and then training at low altitude. It is a world away from 20 minutes in a gym chamber, and also the opposite way around. So why the hypoxic fad? “Because athletes are desperate to try anything that’s legal.” After 10 minutes in UCL’s chamber, my blood oxygen level was down 16% and I felt ropey – not breathless, but sluggish and oppressed. I came out starving and dumb, went into Yo! Sushi and had the same dish three times because I was outwitted by the conveyor belt. It’s a bit like being pregnant. The persistent misconception that high altitude is good for you relates, I think, to the erroneous conviction that anything painful must be gainful. In that sense, the fitness world can – doesn’t always, but can – operate as a shadow science. It uses the same language, but it doesn’t mean the same thing – and often means nothing at all. This is probably quite obvious from far away; but the closer you get to these trends, the more convincing they are, simply because so much money is sunk into them, and so much sweat. What I learned If you spend time at serious altitude, you lose a huge amount of weight, however much you eat.

The Financial Conduct Authority said anyone investing in ICOs should be prepared to lose all their money, with some of the schemes floated potentially outright frauds. ICOs use the language of conventional initial public offerings (IPOs) and are designed to raise money for internet-based startups. But their similarities with IPOs end there. Instead of raising funds from the public in sterling, euros or dollars, investors in ICOs pay in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. In return, they are issued with a “coin” or “token” that is in effect their share in the firm. ICOs have become popular enough for celebrities including Hilton and Floyd Mayweather to jump on board. Last week the hotel heiress tweeted her 16 million followers that she was investing in something called LydianCoin that aimed to raise $100m (£75m). In recent months it is believed as much as £1bn may have poured into ICOs, with China the centre of speculative activity. But following a crackdown by regulators around the world, bitcoin values have slumped, with the price plummeting from $4,950 at the start of September to below $4,300, although it remains substantially up on the year. “ICOs are very high-risk, speculative investments,” said the FCA. “You should be conscious of the risks involved … and prepared to lose your entire stake.” In a long list of warnings, the regulator said ICOs were almost completely unregulated, offered no investor protection, were subject to extreme price volatility, and had the potential for fraud. It added that the prospectuses for ICOs, often called white papers, “might be unbalanced, incomplete or misleading”. The FCA’s warning follows similar action by regulators around the world. Last week the People’s Bank of China banned ICO fundraising and the launch of digital currencies, saying the practice constituted illegal fundraising. ICO trading has been most frenzied in Beijing and Shanghai, with 65 ICOs launched during the year, raising about £300m from 105,000 investors, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Investors in ICOs make money when the value of their coins goes up, and following the huge gains in bitcoin – up sixfold since January despite recent falls – and another cryptocurrency, called ethereum (which has gone from $12 to $308), a lot of investors have been prepared to speculate. Ethereum itself was launched with a sale that netted 31,591 bitcoin (then around $18.5m) in exchange for its first 60m ether tokens. It was followed by at least 10 other ICOs run on ethereum alone, including the Basic Attention Token used for tracking-free advertising on the Brave adblocking browser ($35m raised), the MobileGo token used in a cryptocurrency-based video game marketplace ($26m raised), and the Bancor Network Token, which backs a platform designed to make it easier for users to make and launch their own blockchain tokens ($152.3m raised). The most notorious failure to date has been a startup called the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation – DAO – which sold itself as a crowdsourced hedge fund. It lost about $150m of investors’ money, after a vulnerability in the code was discovered which allowed funds to be siphoned off by an anonymous attacker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/12/royal-shakespeare-company-chooses-all-women-directors-summer-2018-season","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T14:01:49Z","webTitle":"RSC chooses female directors for all plays in summer 2018 season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/12/royal-shakespeare-company-chooses-all-women-directors-summer-2018-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/12/royal-shakespeare-company-chooses-all-women-directors-summer-2018-season","fields":{"headline":"RSC chooses female directors for all plays in summer 2018 season","bodyText":"For the first time in its history, all plays in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s new season at its two main theatres will be directed by women. On Tuesday the company announced its summer 2018 season, with a directorial lineup of Polly Findlay, Erica Whyman, Fiona Laird, Maria Aberg and Jo Davies. The RSC’s artistic director, Gregory Doran, said it was not a deliberate act but part of a process whereby they had “reached a point where those women directors had been with us and had grown, developed”. Equal representation for women in theatre is one of the liveliest debates in the sector and strides have been made in addressing what were often shocking imbalances. But many believe more changes are needed. Michelle Terry, the recently appointed artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe, has promised a 50:50 gender balance on stage across a season. Doran said his autumn 2018 production of Troilus and Cressida would be the first RSC production of a Shakespeare play that had a 50:50 split, but he said he would not be following Terry’s wider ambition. “I don’t want to impose that on directors, it might mean we couldn’t do an all-female production. I want to keep it much more fluid and much more organic than that.” The season will include a production of Macbeth directed by Findlay, with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role, making his RSC debut. Doran said the actor had contacted him more than two years ago asking to play the part. “It is one of those roles which is difficult to cast,” he said. “We don’t breed Macbeths much in this country and it is great to have someone of his clout and his talent. There is something about the mind and the grit of Chris Eccleston that I think will be brilliant in that play.” Whyman, the company’s deputy artistic director, will direct Romeo and Juliet, which she said should be seen as a political play “about a group of grown ups who have let their young people down quite profoundly”. While audiences may read the play’s 2018 setting as a commentary on Brexit, Whyman said the politics of the moment would not be directly mentioned. “There will be an emotional analogy rather than a direct one.” The third new production in the Royal Shakespeare theatre will be The Merry Wives of Windsor, directed by Laird and starring David Troughton as Falstaff. Doran said the plays were deliberately three of Shakespeare’s most popular as part of a string of RSC initiatives to to encourage a passion for Shakespeare in young people. In the Swan theatre, Whyman will direct a musical based on the life of one of the 20th century’s most influential and troublemaking theatre directors, Joan Littlewood; Aberg will direct a new production of Webster’s The Duchess of Malfi; and Davies will direct a play by a writer lost to history, Mary Pix. Doran said her play The Beau Defeated emerged because of an RSC workshop trying to uncover female playwrights from the late 17th and 18th centuries who had been “shamefully disregarded”. A comedy of manners, it will be retitled The Fantastic Follies of Mrs Rich. The company is also the subject of frequent protests because, like the British Museum and Royal Opera House, it takes sponsorship money from BP. Doran said it was money that was needed. “In the economy we are in it is very difficult to unpick what is ‘good’ money ... if you can answer me that question I’d be delighted.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/12/murdochs-sky-takeover-bid-referred-to-competition-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T18:21:58Z","webTitle":"Murdochs' Sky takeover bid to be referred to competition watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/12/murdochs-sky-takeover-bid-referred-to-competition-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/12/murdochs-sky-takeover-bid-referred-to-competition-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"Murdochs' Sky takeover bid to be referred to competition watchdog","bodyText":"The Murdochs face the biggest investigation into their record as media owners since the Leveson inquiry after the culture secretary said their proposed £11.7bn takeover of Sky should face a further six-month inquiry. Karen Bradley surprised MPs by announcing that she was minded to refer 21st Century Fox’s planned takeover of Sky to the Competition and Markets Authority on the grounds of their commitment to broadcasting standards, as well as on the expected grounds of media plurality. It means the Murdochs face an investigation not only into their media power in Britain but into their track record as broadcasters and publishers and their commitment to high editorial standards in both the UK and the US. Fox is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James. If the Fox bid is successful and it owns all of Sky then the satellite broadcaster will join the Sun, the Times and talkRadio in the Murdochs’ wider British media empire, giving the family a bigger reach than any news provider apart from the BBC. It had been expected that Bradley would order an inquiry by the competition regulator on the grounds of media plurality. But the minister effectively overruled Ofcom, the media regulator, in also calling for a broadcasting standards investigation after misconduct allegations at Fox News in the US. Correspondence between Bradley and Ofcom revealed that the minister raised concerns about both a string of sexual harassment allegations at Fox News and claims that the broadcaster colluded with the White House on a discredited story that the murdered Democrat aide Seth Rich was the source of leaked emails. Bradley told parliament that the existence of “non-fanciful concerns” about compliance procedures at Fox News and corporate governance at the Murdochs’ companies meant the legal threshold for widening the investigation of the deal to broadcasting standards had been met. “The fact that Fox belatedly established such [compliance] procedures does not ease my concerns, nor does Fox’s compliance history,” Bradley said. “Third parties also raised concerns about what they termed the ‘Foxification’ of Fox-owned news outlets internationally. On the evidence before me, I am not able to conclude that this raises non-fanciful concerns. “However, I consider it important that entities which adopt controversial or partisan approaches to news and current affairs in other jurisdictions should, at the same time, have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards here. These are matters the CMA may wish to consider in the event of a referral.” Ofcom had said in a report published in June that the evidence available did not justify a broadcasting standards investigation and that Fox and Sky had a record of compliance in line with other major broadcasters. Shares in Sky closed down almost 2% after Bradley’s announcement as concerns increased among investors about delays to the takeover and whether it would go ahead. There will be a 10-day consultation before Bradley makes her final decision. During this time, Sky and the Murdochs can make submissions to the government. An investigation into the Murdochs’ commitment to broadcasting standards would be unprecedented for the CMA, which typically focuses on market share and consumer rights. Wilton Fry, a media analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, said: “The CMA is likely to look at the relationship between Fox, the Murdoch family and control of the organisation. We believe the issues raised – such as potential undue influence, corporate governance etc - should all be able to be resolved via either behavioral and/or structural remedies. “The real question in our mind, is where is the point of pain, at which point Fox would not be willing to accept the remedies - very tough remedies could include, for example, a prohibition on James Murdoch’s executive powers given his prior relationship with News Corp at the time of the phone-hacking scandal.” Fox said it was disappointed that Bradley had not followed the advice of Ofcom. “As the correspondence between DCMS and Ofcom makes clear, we do not believe that there are grounds for the secretary of state to change her previous position.” However, Labour welcomed the prospect of an investigation on the grounds of broadcasting standards. Tom Watson, the deputy leader, said: “I think it’s the first time a minister in the current government has ever stood in the way of what the Murdochs want, and frankly not before time, so, well done,” he said. “As they say in the Black Country, she’s [Bradley] a good ‘un.” Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, criticised Ofcom’s handling of the Sky deal as well as comments made by the regulator in a letter to Bradley that recent complaints about Fox News – including programmes covering its Seth Rich story – were not a breach of the broadcasting code because the shows in question were not news programmes. “Ofcom is less alert about the danger of the Murdochs than the Conservative secretary of state,” he said. “They are far too credulous and gullible about the Murdochs.” Ofcom said: “As an independent regulator we act without fear or favour, free from political or commercial influence. We provided independent and evidence-based advice, and it is then right for the secretary of state to use her statutory discretion to reach a decision.” Fox News has become increasingly troublesome for the Murdochs as they attempt to buy Sky and it was announced last month that it would no longer be broadcast in the UK for “commercial reasons”. A sexual harassment scandal at Fox News has led to a string of high-profile figures leaving, including the chairman Roger Ailes, who has since died, and leading presenter Bill O’Reilly. Critics of the Murdochs have also compared the Rich story with the News of the World hacking the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler because of the distress it caused the victim’s family. Fox News denies colluding with the White House on the story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/12/the-march-on-russia-review-david-storey-orange-tree-richmond","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T12:31:40Z","webTitle":"The March on Russia review – dreams turn to despair in David Storey's family reunion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/12/the-march-on-russia-review-david-storey-orange-tree-richmond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/12/the-march-on-russia-review-david-storey-orange-tree-richmond","fields":{"headline":"The March on Russia review – dreams turn to despair in David Storey's family reunion","bodyText":"There could no better tribute to David Storey, who died in March, than to revive this neglected play from 1989. It is both a poignant family drama and a portrait of a world that, with the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the consequences of a decade of Thatcherism at home, is witnessing the extinction of utopian dreams. But Storey was more of a poet than an ideologue, and Alice Hamilton’s production neatly captures the play’s delicate shifts of mood. As in his earlier play, In Celebration, Storey finds drama in an uneasy family reunion. On this occasion, it’s the diamond wedding anniversary of the Pasmores, a retired couple living in a Yorkshire coastal bungalow. He is an ex-miner with a permanent lung disease but with memories of youthful military adventures in the Crimea: his wife is a grudgingly affectionate working-class Tory. It is the arrival of their three children, however, that exposes the fissures within the family. Colin, a Storey-like writer and lecturer, is burdened by guilt while the abrasive Wendy, busy in local politics, has jettisoned both her husband and her Labour affiliations. Only Eileen, the third child who has settled for less, appears moderately happy. As in Chekhov, not a lot seems to happen but in reality an immense amount does. At first the oldsters’ marital bickering is rancorously funny: they even use ailments as a form of one-upmanship so that his pneumoconiosis is meant to cap her hysterectomy. But, with great skill, Storey slowly reveals Pasmore’s private disintegration and dependence on his wife’s protection. The family itself also becomes a microcosm of the wider world’s disappointments. Colin symbolises the angst of the working-class renegade alienated from his past and Wendy the plight of the political activist appalled by party machinations. Without one noticing it, a family drama turns into a state-of-the-nation play. Hamilton’s production, however, is rightly rooted in domestic detail. Sue Wallace is particularly fine as Mrs Pasmore, whom she plays as an outwardly plucky figure whose sadness is revealed only in her eyes. Even if Ian Gelder is not my idea of an ex-miner and ladies man, he captures perfectly Pasmore’s surface bravado and secret vulnerability. Eileen’s character is underwritten but Colin Tierney is morosely haunted as Colin, and Sarah Belcher pinpoints Wendy’s festering filial resentment. Storey’s play survives as a deeply moving study of the quiet despair behind the materialist orthodoxy of the 1980s. • At the Orange Tree, Richmond, until 7 October.

Top stories Australian primary schools have larger class sizes than the developed world average and the country has lower than average public spending on education as a percentage of GDP, according to a new report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It examined education metrics across 35 countries and found that Australian primary schools had an average of 24 students, compared with the average of 21. Total public spending on education was just 3.9% of GDP, below the OECD average of 4.4%. The Australian Education Union federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said the below-average public spending showed that “there is no doubt that our schools are under-resourced”. Haythorpe said that trend was “set to continue” because the Gonski 2.0 package cut $3bn in funding over two years, compared with previous needs-based funding agreements.

The Turnbull government’s unwillingness to take rising inequality seriously means it is increasingly at odds with conservative global economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund, Australia’s peak union body has warned. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has released a new report on rising inequality, warning Australia is at risk of becoming an Americanised society of working poor if people are not given a pay rise. The paper shows income inequality in Australia has been steadily rising in recent decades, “since neoliberal approaches began to dominate economic policy in the 1980s”.

But the moment that the absence of stuff became zero, a number in its own right, is regarded as one of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of mathematics. Now scientists have traced the origins of this conceptual leap to an ancient Indian text, known as the Bakhshali manuscript – a text which has been housed in the UK since 1902. Radiocarbon dating reveals the fragmentary text, which is inscribed on 70 pieces of birch bark and contains hundreds of zeroes, dates to as early as the 3rd or 4th century – about 500 years older than scholars previously believed. This makes it the world’s oldest recorded origin of the zero symbol that we use today. Marcus du Sautoy, professor of mathematics at the University of Oxford, said: “Today we take it for granted that the concept of zero is used across the globe and our whole digital world is based on nothing or something. But there was a moment when there wasn’t this number.” The Bakhshali manuscript was found in 1881, buried in a field in a village called Bakhshali, near Peshawar, in what is now a region of Pakistan. It was discovered by a local farmer and later acquired by the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Translations of the text, which is written in a form of Sanskrit, suggest it was a form of training manual for merchants trading across the Silk Road, and it includes practical arithmetic exercises and something approaching algebra. “There’s a lot of ‘If someone buys this and sells this how much have they got left?’” said Du Sautoy. In the fragile document, zero does not yet feature as a number in its own right, but as a placeholder in a number system, just as the “0” in “101” indicates no tens. It features a problem to which the answer is zero, but here the answer is left blank. Several ancient cultures independently came up with similar placeholder symbols. The Babylonians used a double wedge for nothing as part of cuneiform symbols dating back 5,000 years, while the Mayans used a shell to denote absence in their complex calendar system. However the dot symbol in the Bakhshali script is the one that ultimately evolved into the hollow-centred version of the symbol that we use today. It also sowed the seed for zero as a number, which is first described in a text called Brahmasphutasiddhanta, written by the Indian astronomer and mathematician Brahmagupta in 628AD. “This becomes the birth of the concept of zero in it’s own right and this is a total revolution that happens out of India,” said Du Sautoy. The development of zero as a mathematical concept may have been inspired by the region’s long philosophical tradition of contemplating the void and may explain why the concept took so long to catch on in Europe, which lacked the same cultural reference points. “This is coming out of a culture that is quite happy to conceive of the void, to conceive of the infinite,” said Du Sautoy. “That is exciting to recognise, that culture is important in making big mathematical breakthroughs.” Despite developing sophisticated maths and geometry, the ancient Greeks had no symbol for zero, for instance, showing that while the concept zero may now feel familiar, it is not an obvious one. “The Europeans, even when it was introduced to them, were like ‘Why would we need a number for nothing?’” said Du Sautoy. “It’s a very abstract leap.” In the latest study, three samples were extracted from the manuscript and analysed at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit. The results revealed that the three samples tested date from three different centuries, one from 224-383 AD, another from 680-779 AD and another from 885-993 AD, raising further questions about how the manuscript came to be packaged together as a single document. The development of zero in mathematics underpins an incredible range of further work, including the notion of infinity, the modern notion of the vacuum in quantum physics, and some of the deepest questions in cosmology of how the Universe arose – and how it might disappear from existence in some unimaginable future scenario. Richard Ovenden, head of the Bodleian Library, said the results highlight a Western bias that has often seen the contributions of South Asian scholars being overlooked. “These surprising research results testify to the subcontinent’s rich and longstanding scientific tradition,” he said. The manuscript will be on public display on 4 October, as part of a major exhibition, Illuminating India: 5000 Years of Science and Innovation, at the Science Museum in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/sep/29/sukhumi-spotlight-hope-ruins-russia-abkhazia-georgia","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-29T06:30:18Z","webTitle":"Sukhumi in the spotlight: hope amid the ruins of a pro-Russian breakaway state","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/29/sukhumi-spotlight-hope-ruins-russia-abkhazia-georgia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/sep/29/sukhumi-spotlight-hope-ruins-russia-abkhazia-georgia","fields":{"headline":"Sukhumi in the spotlight: hope amid the ruins of a pro-Russian breakaway state","bodyText":"Towering over the Black Sea city of Sukhumi, Abkhazia’s abandoned parliament is a poignant sight. Burnt beyond repair during a secessionist conflict between this picturesque territory and Georgia in the early 1990s, the 12-storey building remains as a striking reminder of a traumatic past. “We have plans to reconstruct it,” explains the breakaway state’s leader, Raul Khajimba. “Finances are the main issue.” The president has more pressing issues on his agenda than a derelict building. Abkhazia has endured more than two decades of international isolation since the conflict, and is today recognised by only its patron Russia and a few unlikely allies. Khajimba’s territory is derided as a Russian puppet state; the American state department describes it as “Russian occupied” region. Ongoing hostility from both sides and the severe economic consequences of non-recognition mean that much of Sukhumi, once a jewel in the Soviet crown, remains in ruins. Even the name is controversial – the city is transliterated as Sukhumi or Sokhumi by Georgians (and Guardian Cities, pursuant to our style), but Sukhum to Abkhazians. “Sukhum/i” is often used to maintain neutrality. ‘Rebuild your motherland’ Despite their international isolation, quiet optimism can be discerned among the Sukhumi residents who stroll the seaside promenade and play backgammon outside coffee shops. Cultural events are flourishing – the Sklad collective run a number of contemporary art programmes, while local theatres regularly stage new productions. Last year residents coordinated the installation of a sculpture, “Yes Sukhum”, in the vein of similar iconic structures in Amsterdam and Pristina. The food scene is also burgeoning – hipster burger joints, elegant traditional restaurants and Turkish cafes compete for business near the waterfront. Chilled Abkhazian wine and locally brewed Sukhumskoe beer are both popular during the warm summer months. Not all is rosy – unemployment is high, there is a major drug problem in the outer suburbs and a reported increase in crime. A Russian tourist was murdered in Sukhumi in July, prompting the Russian Embassy to Abkhazia to issue an advisory. But almost a decade after the 2008 Russian-Georgian War, which led to Russia’s recognition of Abkhazia, there is a sense of hope. On the abandoned parliament’s second floor, now used as a late-night hangout by teenagers, graffiti artists have taken to the walls. “Rebuild your motherland,” one scrawl demands. In Sukhumi, those words are being heeded. Sukhumi in numbers ... 8 – the number of baby shops in central Sukhumi, profiting from Abkhazia’s high birth rate. 1.67m – the number of Russian tourists who have visited Abkhazia in the last reported year. 1 – international football tournament has been hosted by Sukhumi. The ConIFA World Football Cup for unrecognised territories and ethnic minorities was held in Abkhazia last year; the home team won. 62 – letters in the local alphabet. Abkhaz is an exceedingly complex language, and the high proportion of other ethnicities in Sukhumi means that Russian is the lingua franca. 100% – historian and politician Stanislav Lakoba jokes that the city’s religious makeup is “80% Christian, 20% Sunni Muslim and 100% pagan”. ... and pictures History in 100 words Sukhumi’s history has ancient Greek roots. Known then as Dioscurias, the city is discussed by Strabo as the “common mart” of 70 distinct ethnic groups. It stagnated under Roman rule and was sacked by the Arabs, before regaining prominence during the Kingdom of Abkhazia (700s–1000s) and Georgian Golden Age (1100s–1200s). Ottoman rule followed in the 16th century, before Sukhumi was taken by the Russian Empire in 1810 on its southward sweep. Following the Bolshevik Revolution, Sukhumi served as Abkhazia’s capital during various political iterations. It was heavily contested in the war, and reminders of that conflict remain. Sukhumi in sound and vision Imported monkeys housed at the city’s Institute of Experimental Pathology and Therapy have attracted the attention of documentary makers in recent years. Some of the first tests on monkeys were carried out at this research centre, established in the 1920s and known locally as the monkey colony. Lost Colony (2008) and the provocatively-titled Tarzan’s Testicles (2017) both recount the institute’s unusual history. Set in a small village near Sukhumi (albeit filmed in Georgia), Tangerines (2013) offers the tale of a hospitable farmer who nurses back to health two opposing fighters in the 1992-3 Abkhazian-Georgian war. Oscar and Golden Globe-nominated in 2015 for best foreign language film, Tangerines is an understated contemplation of the pointlessness of violence. “You know what this war will be called,” one protagonist muses. “The Citrus War … [the victors] will get my tangerines.” What’s everyone talking about? Russian holidaymakers are Abkhazia’s economic lifeblood. Locals report that the tourist influx was lower than usual this summer; they blame Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea for offering middle class Russian tourists another nearby holiday destination. Abkhazia is slowly attracting non-Russian visitors, and British company Regent Holidays spent five days in Sukhumi on their first-ever group tour to the region earlier this year. What’s next for the city? On 30 September Sukhumi will commemorate Victory Day, when the war with Georgia ended in 1993 and Abkhazia gained de facto independence. There will be a large military parade and festivities along the city’s promenade. With the 25th anniversary due to be celebrated next year, the event will be a test-run for grander celebrations in 2018. The longer-term future of Sukhumi largely rests on Abkhazia’s ambiguous political status. Partial recognition inhibits access to international aid funding and government coffers are under pressure, preventing a comprehensive reconstruction programme. Until reconciliation results in either international recognition for Abkhazia or integration with Georgia – and neither seems likely – Sukhumi will remain in limbo. Not that the locals are too concerned. Viacheslav Chirikba, who recently stepped down as Abkhazia’s foreign minister, looks content sipping tea at his favourite cafe. “Recognition is not vital,” he says. “What is important for us is to be secure, have jobs, raise our children and enjoy life – and we have all that!” Close zoom War journalism aside, little has been written in English about Sukhumi. Discover Abkhazia, which describes itself as the “simple, apolitical guide”, is one of the few sources of information for would-be tourists. Australian music critic turned foreign correspondent Andrew Mueller has an amusing chapter on his visit to Sukhumi in I Wouldn’t Start From Here.

The carrier, which declared bankruptcy last month after years of losses, is negotiating the transfer of staff to a potential buyer. Bids for the airline must be submitted by Friday, with a decision on the sale expected as early as next week. On its website, Air Berlin cited “operative reasons” for the cancellations on Tuesday, and asked passengers to call a helpline and refrain from travelling to the affected airports. Because the carrier no longer offers compensation for cancelled flights, customer advice centres recommended that people affected by the strike book replacements at their own expense. Berlin’s Tegel airport and Düsseldorf airport, Air Berlin’s hubs, were hit hard by the strike action, which also affects 42 planes run by Air Berlin on behalf of Eurowings and Austrian Airlines. Spiegel Online said about 250 pilots called in sick on Tuesday morning. Air Berlin employs approximately 1,500 pilots. Vereinigung Cockpit, a collective bargaining group for German pilots and flight engineers, has expressed concern that the airline is planning to offload its long-haul flights branch, which pays staff higher wages. Air Berlin has already announced that it will cease to operate flights to the Caribbean and Boston from 25 September. Air Berlin made a loss of €782m (£703m) in 2016. Last month, Etihad Airways, which owns almost 30% of Air Berlin, said the developments were “extremely disappointing”, but it could not keep injecting cash after investing an additional €250m in April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2017/sep/12/peter-hall-british-theatre-dies-aged-86-royal-shakespeare-company","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T09:53:43Z","webTitle":"Peter Hall: the peerless showman who transformed British theatre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/12/peter-hall-british-theatre-dies-aged-86-royal-shakespeare-company","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/sep/12/peter-hall-british-theatre-dies-aged-86-royal-shakespeare-company","fields":{"headline":"Peter Hall: the peerless showman who transformed British theatre","bodyText":"The roles of director and producer in theatre often involve contrasting qualities – academic and bureaucrat, happy collaborator and back-room schemer, maverick and establishment figure – but what was remarkable about Sir Peter Hall, who has died aged 86, is that he possessed all of these attributes in rotation and only occasional contradiction. Hall’s most startling and lasting achievement is to have been the founding father of the UK’s two biggest subsidised theatres in the form that we now know them: the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. As a director, he had a range that could encompass one of the most radical and audience-baffling plays of the 20th century – Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, which he premiered in London in 1955 – and one of the most conservative and crowd-pleasing: Peter Shaffer’s 1979 operatic whodunnit Amadeus, which transferred from the National to the West End and Broadway, swelling a personal wealth that was one of the recurrent controversies during a career in which Hall – a large, loud, stubborn man – tended to attract admirers and detractors of equal fervour. Born working-class – the son of a Suffolk railwayman – Hall had scholarships to Perse public school then Cambridge University. Even as a boy, he had an impresario’s touch – organising his fellow 11-year-olds into a band – but the most crucial event of his adolescence was when, as a 15-year-old, he saw at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre a production of Love’s Labours Lost by the then wonder-boy of British theatre, Peter Brook, only six years his senior. Revealingly, Hall admitted to having succumbed at that moment to the double ambition of not merely becoming a Shakespearean director but also being in charge of the theatre. Within a few years – when Hall, just out of Cambridge, was already in charge of the Arts Theatre in London – Brook invited Hall for a drink to talk about working in Stratford. Though they became mutually supportive, the two Peters were professionally and personally opposites: Brook an ascetic, shamanistic perfectionist who retreated to Paris where he was happiest spending years working in private on productions, Hall a workaholic hedonistic showman who sought and enjoyed power in both the subsidised and commercial theatre. In 1958, aged only 28, Hall was appointed to run the Stratford Memorial theatre, driving its transformation into the Royal Shakespeare Company and adding a London base (at the Aldwych theatre) to its headquarters in Shakespeare’s birthplace, exploring (with Brook and John Barton) radical rethinking of Shakespeare – such as Barton and Hall’s rearrangement of the English history plays as The Wars of the Roses and Brook’s circus-based A Midsummer Night’s Dream – and introducing, in Harold Pinter, the concept of a living house dramatist in a classical playhouse. This experience in expanding and rebranding a subsidised theatre made him, in the early 70s, when the National Theatre was moving from the Old Vic to huge new premises on the South Bank in London, the logical candidate – except to a few of the devoted lieutenants of the NT’s actor-manager, Laurence Olivier – to take over. Few visitors to the current National Theatre – recently lavishly extended with £80m of private money – remember or appreciate the near-fatal difficulties of the building’s birth. Construction delays and budget over-runs meant that, in 1975, Hall, as artistic director, took occupancy of a building site which he opened in steps over the next two years. The developments were plagued by financial crises and union disputes, which, his diaries later revealed, led Hall, in 1979, to vote Conservative for the only time in a life in which he always defined himself on the political left, despite lavish tastes and a belief in private schooling for his children. Although he often adopted an outward manner of invincibility and bonhomie – a much-republished picture from the National years caught him doubled-up in a lion’s roar of laughter – this public armour hid sensitivities that could easily be inflamed by domestic crises or the newspaper abuse for which he became a frequent target, partly due to being seen as a champagne socialist and poster boy for the funding of culture by the taxpayer. In his 20s, he suffered a physical and emotional collapse at the RSC and, for a while, directed from a day-bed in the rehearsal room. His diaries record treatment for a variety of stress-related illnesses (including high blood-pressure and shingles) and, in his memoirs, he admitted to suffering such depression while running the theatrical behemoths that he contemplated suicide. A committed atheist, Hall once admitted to thinking about death every day, from as early as his 20s, but this Larkinesque terror of extinction drove him not, as it did Larkin, to alcoholism but to a punishing work rate in his hurry to get everything done. Even past his 80th birthday, he admitted to feeling most alive when rehearsing, finding backing for commercial companies first in London and then Bath, although his retirement was eventually forced by a final phase of frailty that was heralded by an incident – heavily publicised, to the mortification of himself and his family – in which he fell asleep during a West End production (not his own) and woke up shouting confused abuse. But, as he admitted in private, Hall’s frenetic diary during six decades was also driven by the pressures of alimony and school fees. He married successively – and with more or less progressive levels of success – the actress Leslie Caron, his assistant at the Royal Shakespeare Company Jacqueline Taylor, the opera singer Maria Ewing and the former National Theatre publicist Nicki Frei; earlier in his National regime, there had also been another long and close relationship with a female colleague. There is a moment in his diaries when, in 1977, he is almost terrified to read Harold Pinter’s new play Betrayal, which concerns adultery, because of the implosion of his own private life. He managed, though, to maintain close and proud relationships with his six children, who include Edward Hall, currently artistic director of the Hampstead Theatre in London, and the actress Rebecca Hall, whose movies include Woody Allen’s Vicky Cristina Barcelona. One of her father’s favourite anecdotes in later interviews was that, when he expressed the desire to cast her in a National Theatre production of Twelfth Night to mark his 80th birthday, he was asked: “Do you think you can get her?” The question of the extent to which the financial demands on Hall affected his artistic decisions is complex. Some members of the National Theatre boards feared that the repertoire might sometimes be shaped by the need for lucrative commercial transfers directed by Hall himself and there were certainly some odd projects, including the disastrous Marvin Hamlisch musical Jean, inspired by conspiracy theories surrounding the death of the film star Jean Seberg. And yet, as the National was threatened with financial collapse during most of Hall’s regime, the need for profitable box office products was as much public as private, although his diaries record a number of commitments – including presenting the ITV arts series Aquarius, appearing in wallpaper commercials and directing operas around the world – that brought no benefit to the National and resulted in the absence of the artistic director. It was, in effect, a criticism of Hall that the contracts of his successors have been notably tough about leaves of absence and commercial earnings. Hall always attracted implacable foes who felt sidelined by him. Michael Blakemore’s 2013 book Stage Blood published a lengthy memo read by Blakemore at a 1976 directors meeting, which accused Hall of personal greed and self-aggrandisement in his scheduling of productions and negotiation of deals for commercial transfers of NT shows. Apart from his alleged egomania and megalomania, the aspects of Hall that irritated his enemies were his personal earnings, first-class lifestyle (he drove a Rolls Royce in the 1960s and was a keen Concorde-commuter in the 70s and 80s) and perhaps also his success with so many much younger very attractive women, even as his waistline expanded and hairline retreated. However, no other theatrical figure in his lifetime would have been able or willing to put in the long nights and bloody fights that brought the National Theatre into being. Hall’s legacy as a director is less concrete than the buildings. The approach to Shakespeare that he ultimately favoured – full texts staged in period costume and spoken with a metronomic attention to the iambic pentameter of the verse – has been overtaken in recent years by a fashion for shorter, more demotic and time-shifted productions. But Harold Pinter’s receipt of the Nobel prize in literature in 2005 was at least partly due to Hall’s achievement, in directing every Pinter stage premiere from The Collection at the RSC in 1962 to Other Places at the National two decades later, in finding a spare, crisp style of staging and acting for scripts that, on the page, contained almost no instructions for performance. Even the greatest directors of theatre leave nothing beyond them, except possibly a filmed record of key productions, but Sir Peter Hall, more in the manner of an architect, leaves his legacy on the skyline in two huge buildings – the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company – that would almost certainly not have been built nor survived without him. Surely, eventually, a room or even an auditorium at one of the theatres will be be named after him. Anyone who works in, or goes to see, a production in subsidised theatre for the foreseeable future will be in the debt of this driven, energetic man who, though never short of personal ambition, put it to the service of larger public causes. • This article was amended on 29 September 2017. An earlier version said Jacqueline Taylor was Peter Hall’s secretary at the National Theatre. This has been corrected to assistant at the Royal Shakespeare Company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2017/sep/12/samsung-galaxy-note-foldable-screen-2018-smartphones","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T11:12:04Z","webTitle":"Samsung plans to sell a Galaxy Note with a foldable screen in 2018","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/12/samsung-galaxy-note-foldable-screen-2018-smartphones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/sep/12/samsung-galaxy-note-foldable-screen-2018-smartphones","fields":{"headline":"Samsung plans to sell a Galaxy Note with a foldable screen in 2018","bodyText":"Samsung is aiming to launch a Note smartphone with a screen that folds next year, which would likely be the first available to feature such an innovation. Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung’s mobile business, said the company is setting its eyes on 2018 to release a smartphone using its bendable OLED screen technology, but he said there are several hurdles it has to overcome, leaving room to push back the release if those problems are not solved. Koh said: “As the head of the business, I can say our current goal is next year. When we can overcome some problems for sure, we will launch the product.” Analysts said mass-producing a foldable phone with top tech features and a thin body will take time. Koh did not elaborate what the problems facing consumerisation of the foldable screen technology were. When Samsung will release its first foldable phone, previously dubbed the “Galaxy X”, has been a question in the market since Samsung first showcased a flexible display prototype called Youm in 2013. For at least the past two years, there have been rumours that Samsung is close to showing off its first folding smartphones. South Korean rival LG gained patents for a foldable tablet and displayed a working concept device earlier this year that could fold to create a phone-shaped device or unfold to create a much larger tablet. Chinese rival Lenovo showed off a similar 7.8in foldable tablet device, the Folio, which converts into a device with a 5.5in screen. But neither LG nor Lenovo publicly stated a timeframe for a consumer release of a foldable product. Samsung has used its bendable screen technology in a variety of smartphones and televisions to create curved displays displays for its Galaxy S and Galaxy Note devices and curved TVs. It also sold a large, 78in TV that could convert from curved to flat and back again by bending the screen at the edges. For years the idea of a device that could be both a tablet and a smartphone, altering its form to serve the user best at different times, has been the holy grail of technology. While the screen technology has been in place to enable it for several years, at least in prototype form, longevity of the displays and the inflexibility of other necessary components has held the concept back from the market. Analysts are sceptical the technology can be perfected in a short space of time, but science fiction, including the recent HBO series Westworld, has shown how well the concept could work should the technology be ironed out.

Verhofstadt said it was in the British prime minister’s interests to drop her plans to speak only in private to the chamber’s political leaders, known as the conference of presidents. “I would encourage her to address the whole house, the plenary,” he said. “Other heads of state have done this in the past.” The parliament’s president, Antonio Tajani, invited May earlier this year to speak to a full session of the chamber to explain her position on Brexit. The parliament has the right to veto any withdrawal deal reached between the EU and the UK. The Guardian revealed last week that May had rejected the offer in favour of speaking behind closed doors at a date yet to be finalised. She would have followed in the footsteps of Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher if she had faced MEPs in the chamber. Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, told reporters in Strasbourg that while he was pleased May had committed to talking to the parliament’s leaders, an open debate with MEPs could help the flow of the negotiations. “I think that can only he helpful because it will be the European parliament that will need to give the green light to the outcome of the negotiation,” he said. “And what is at stake at the moment are issues very near to the heart of the European parliament, most members of the European parliament. The question of citizens’ rights, the Irish border, the question about the financial settlement, also the future. All this I think needs to be debated in an open dialogue between Mrs May and all members.” Verhofstadt said he was yet to be given a date for May’s appearance before the conference of presidents, but the UK’s permanent representative to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, made contact with the chamber’s officials last week. The prime minister’s decision has displeased key figures in the parliament, who believe Britain has not taken the chamber’s role in the process seriously enough in the past. The co-leader of the Green bloc in the parliament, the Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts, was scathing of May’s decision when asked to comment at a press conference. “I don’t know her personally, but the impression I get of her is that she is a lady out of her depth, meaning that she is reaching the very edge of her skills now and it is starting to show,” he said. “If I were her adviser, I would advise the same. I think she had more to lose than win by coming. I think it was the right calculation for her. If she were to come to Brussels or Strasbourg, I think she would risk further weakening the UK’s position.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
