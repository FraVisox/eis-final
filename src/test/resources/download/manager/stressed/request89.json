He relished the challenge of bringing both a practical architect’s eye to understanding and decoding important buildings, and a historical literacy to their conservation. Although he worked on new designs for everything from housing schemes and offices to schools and churches, he also maintained research interests in architectural history, and this blend of skills led to major conservation projects including West Dean College, West Sussex; St Mary’s College, Strawberry Hill, in west London; and the Naval and Military Club in central London. In the Middle East he carried out extensive building conservation in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. He fought the destruction of historic buildings in the wholesale redevelopments that were common in Britain in the 1960s and 70s, and was responsible for saving many of them. He was involved in the creation of the Weald &amp; Downland Living Museum of historic buildings and the Amberley Museum of industrial history in West Sussex, and carried out building conversions for the Landmark Trust. John was born in London to Jessie (nee Parker), a commercial artist, and Cecil, who worked in insurance. In 1940 the family moved to Sussex, where he attended Collyer’s school, in Horsham, going on to study architecture at King’s College, Newcastle upon Tyne, then part of Durham University, now Newcastle University. There he met Judith Kershaw, and they married in 1957. After graduating John worked on government projects in Pakistan before winning a Rose Shipman award from the Royal Institute of British Architects that allowed him and Judith to spend eight months in Turkey and Greece studying Ottoman architecture. In 1964 he co-founded the Architectural and Planning Partnership in Horsham, which by the 80s employed 120 people, with offices in Brighton, London, Edinburgh, Bombay and Baghdad. Moving to Wensleydale, Yorkshire, in 1998, he continued to work as an architect and to lecture, write and paint, having an associate position at York University. He wrote and contributed to a number of books and papers on architectural conservation and held various advisory appointments including being a Unesco world heritage site inspector. His interests included industrial history, growing fruit and the contemplative purposefulness of the Quakers. A skilled artist, he had work displayed at several Royal Academy summer exhibitions. He is survived by Judith, his children, Rebecca and me, and his grandchildren, Kit, Matthew, Francis and Alex."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/22/manchester-city-everton-women-champions-league-semi-final-first-leg","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T14:52:47Z","webTitle":"Manchester City Women keep clean sheet in Champions League semi-final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/22/manchester-city-everton-women-champions-league-semi-final-first-leg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/22/manchester-city-everton-women-champions-league-semi-final-first-leg","fields":{"headline":"Manchester City Women keep clean sheet in Champions League semi-final","bodyText":"Manchester City may not have found a way past the formidable Wendie Renard at the heart of Lyon’s defence but they denied the reigning European champions an away goal and have everything to play for in France on 29 April. The route through the second leg at the Stade de Lyon and on to the Women’s Champions League final in Kiev in May still looks hazardous but Nick Cushing’s side can be cautiously optimistic. Following a slightly shaky start here, they grew into the tie, pressing assiduously and doing enough to suggest they might yet negotiate the tactical tripwires next week. Well before the end Reynald Pedros’s supposed sophisticates had lost all semblance of midfield passing rhythm, turned direct and looked reliant on dead balls for scoring opportunities. “I’m definitely happy,” Cushing said. “It’s definitely a positive result. Not letting Lyon score an away goal was so important and we defended really well. We denied them any kind of momentum. We go to France as underdogs. No one expects us to win and that can help.” A City starting XI featuring 10 members of Phil Neville’s England squad and, in Jennifer Beattie, a Scotland centre-half, were up against opponents showcasing some of Europe’s foremost talents. Frequently driven forward by the former City right-back Lucy Bronze’s scouring advances, Lyon began in irrepressible fashion. As shots from Shanice van de Sanden, Ada Hegerberg, Eugénie Le Sommer and Dzsenifer Marozsán were blocked, Cushing’s players could barely escape their own half. With City initially unable to string two passes together, it was easy to see why Pedros’s richly gifted team are regarded Europe’s best. Yet for all Lyon’s abundant pressure and possession, the home goalkeeper, Karen Bardsley, was rarely stretched to the limit. If the visitors’ often disappointing final balls offered City hope, they needed to make the most of their own strictly rationed chances, the moments when Renard could be dodged. They almost scored when Nikita Parris’s persistence in harrying Bronze into an error resulted in the dispossessed right-back watching in horror as she cued up Melissa Lawley for a shot which Sarah Bouhaddi did well to divert for a corner. Thus emboldened, City began pressing higher up the pitch and Jill Scott made things happen in midfield. Suddenly Lyon’s hitherto unruffled Amandine Henry had her work cut out in the holding role and must have been relieved when the increasingly influential Scott was warned by the referee for fouling her. Yet if Scott needed to watch her step so, too, did Bronze, after going in hard on Parris and being shown a yellow card. “Off, off,” demanded the defender’s former public. Although Le Sommer looked inches from scoring as half-time approached, frustration was mounting among a Lyon side struggling to unlock their full attacking repertoire in the face of the increasingly assured Beattie and Steph Houghton. At full-back Abbie McManus and Demi Stokes ensured Lyon did not really hurt their team down the flanks while Izzy Christiansen proved midfield intelligence personified. Bouhaddi needed to keep Christiansen’s shot out but generally chances from open play were becoming as elusive as the sun on this , sometimes rainy,Manchester Sunday. Outmanoeuvred in midfield, Lyon began seeking to win as many set pieces as possible. Parris missed an inviting chance to score from a Christiansen corner but, equally, City had the impressive Bardsley – who made some important interventions – to thank for a fine late save from Henry’s header. “I’m not overly disappointed,” said Pedros. “ City’s midfield is very strong. Everything still hangs in the balance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/23/jeremy-corbyn-momemtum-supporters-antisemitism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T11:45:37Z","webTitle":"Labour’s far left must tame itself to root out antisemitism | Keith Kahn-Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/jeremy-corbyn-momemtum-supporters-antisemitism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/jeremy-corbyn-momemtum-supporters-antisemitism","fields":{"headline":"Labour’s far left must tame itself to root out antisemitism","bodyText":"I would like to think that tomorrow’s meeting between Jeremy Corbyn and Jennie Formby, the Labour general secretary, and a delegation from the Board of Deputies of British Jews (BoD) and the Jewish Leadership Council (JLC), will mark a turning point in the party’s troubles over antisemitism. Last week’s speeches in parliament by Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth, among others, detailing the antisemitic and misogynistic abuse they had received, demonstrated the need for such a turning point. Since the demonstration against antisemitism in Parliament Square at the end of March, there have been some signs of progress. The letters exchanged between Corbyn and the Board of Deputies and the Leadership Council that paved the way for the meeting were measured and serious. Influential voices on the left of the party, including Jon Lansman and John McDonnell, have also acknowledged that Labour antisemitism is a serious issue. No one is under any illusions as to the difficulty of the challenge ahead. The anger in much of the Jewish community is such that the delegation will not be appeased by tea and sympathy. Other organisations, such as the Campaign Against Antisemitism, are nipping at the heels of the BoD and JLC’s and favour a much more aggressive approach. Many of Corbyn’s supporters will be encouraging him to give no ground, and Jewish Voice for Labour (JVL), will remind him that the BoD and JLC do not represent them. In fact, the planned presence of the Jewish Voice for Labour at a “roundtable” organised by Formby led the BoD, JLC and other Jewish groups to decline the invitation. Wednesday’s roundtable now appears to have been called off. Some progress might be made on a few items on the BoD and JLC’s agenda. One key demand, that outstanding disciplinary cases on antisemitism should be resolved quickly, is surely in everyone’s interests. It is hard, however, to see Corbyn agreeing to the demand that “the party will seek to understand and engage with the Jewish community via its main representative groups, and not through fringe organisations who wish to obstruct the party’s efforts to tackle antisemitism”. Even if the meeting proceeds in a cordial atmosphere, even if both parties reach a clear understanding acceptable to all, monumental difficulties remain that may be beyond the capacity of any of them to address. The central problem is that much (although by no means all) of the antisemitism in the Labour party has emerged from the online-fuelled grassroots movement that has been a major factor in sustaining Corbyn’s leadership. By its very nature, this movement resists control. The passion that drives it is not conducive to careful speech. Antisemitism is more than just carelessness (for some it is very deliberate) and it is more than just speech, but any attempt to address it must begin with serious attention to language in an age in which communication – on any issue – constantly threatens to spiral out of control. While many in the Labour party are aware of the problems that unrestrained speech can cause, there are few practical suggestions as to what to do about it. Owen Jones has called for a mass “political education” campaign, but it will be difficult to corral Labour supporters into the institutional frameworks necessary for this. In any case, antisemitism is one symptom of a wider culture of tit-for-tat purging and abuse that has permeated the party for decades. Those who currently hold the whip hand (Corbynites now, New Labour in the past) are never eager to address it. Corbyn has repeatedly condemned abuse, antisemitic or otherwise, although he rarely goes into specifics. Yet his supporters tend to ignore his less convenient pronouncements. He does not wield his authority with an iron fist and is unlikely to have the ability or the will to lead a mass disciplining of unruly Labour voices. While no one who sees themselves as part of the grassroots Labour movement really knows how to draw on its productive energies without its dark side, there is another section of the Labour left that does understand discipline and control. Parts of the trade union movement – and those, such as McDonnell, who are close to it – have considerable experience in these political arts. Formby’s appointment, backed by Unite, as Labour general secretary, backed by Unite, and the failure of the bid for the post by the Momentum founder Lansman, were a demonstration of the vulnerability of grassroots politics when it comes up against machine politics. Cynics might therefore suggest that Jewish organisations who want Labour antisemitism addressed should concentrate on building ties with Formby, McDonnell and with the unions. Although some of the more authoritarian leftists within the party have themselves been accused of antisemitism, they are also pragmatic, and they have the ruthlessness to rid the party of antisemites and the message-discipline to refrain from hateful language – should they feel it’s in their interests to do so. Of course, not only am I not advocating such an alliance, no appetite exists for it on either side. For one thing, ties between the Jewish community and beleaguered Labour centrists, including the centrist-leaning Jewish Labour Movement, are strong and deep. But the prospect of the decentralised grassroots Labour left eventually being subjugated by its centralising cousins is a very real one, whether or not it is antisemitism that provokes it. Those who value the idealistic passion that permeates the Labour grassroots (including, with much ambivalence, myself) need to grapple with how its abusive, uncontrollable tendencies can be curbed, since these invite its suppression. Facing up to antisemitism and to the wider issue of abuse on the left isn’t just the right thing to do for its own sake, it is the key to ensuring the resilience of the movement. • Keith Kahn-Harris is a sociologist and the author of Judaism: All That Matters"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/22/former-police-race-adviser-charged-with-racially-aggravated-offence-stun-gun","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T14:46:35Z","webTitle":"Former police race adviser charged with racially aggravated offence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/former-police-race-adviser-charged-with-racially-aggravated-offence-stun-gun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/former-police-race-adviser-charged-with-racially-aggravated-offence-stun-gun","fields":{"headline":"Former police race adviser charged with racially aggravated offence","bodyText":"A former race relations adviser to the police who was allegedly injured when a police officer fired a stun gun at him has been charged with a racially aggravated offence. Judah Adunbi, also known as Ras, was arrested at his home in Bristol on Wednesday and will appear in court next month. Adunbi, of Easton, Bristol, was charged with a racially aggravated public order offence following an alleged incident at a betting shop on the city’s Stapleton Road on 29 March. The 64-year-old, who is a former member of an independent advisory group to Avon and Somerset police, has been released on conditional bail to appear at Bristol magistrates court on 22 May. His solicitor, Tony Murphy, of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, said he would be challenging the charge. “Ras Judah has a long history of challenging racism in all its forms and he shall be resisting this prosecution,” Murphy said. Last year, Adunbi was allegedly shot by a police officer using a Taser electrical weapon in Easton. A video of the alleged incident was widely shared on social media and made headlines around the world. PC Claire Boddie, of Avon and Somerset police, is due in court on Monday for a pre-trial hearing in relation to that case. She denies a charge of common assault. The Justice 4 Judah campaign called on the public to support Adunbi at court. “We encourage campaign supporters to gather outside Bristol magistrates court this coming Monday at 1.30pm to show some solidarity,” they said. Avon and Somerset police said: “A 64-year-old man has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence following an incident at a betting shop in Stapleton Road, Bristol. “Ras Adunbi, of Easton in Bristol, was arrested on 18 April and subsequently charged with a racially aggravated public order offence. He has been released on conditional bail to appear at Bristol magistrates court on 22 May.” Adunbi has sat on Bristol’s independent advisory group, which forges links between the police and the community, and worked with the CPS’s local community involvement panel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/22/democrats-chair-tom-perez-lawsuit-trump-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T20:27:20Z","webTitle":"'Protecting our democracy': DNC chair defends suit against Trump and Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/22/democrats-chair-tom-perez-lawsuit-trump-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/22/democrats-chair-tom-perez-lawsuit-trump-russia","fields":{"headline":"'Protecting our democracy': DNC chair defends suit against Trump and Russia","bodyText":"Chairman Tom Perez on Sunday defended the Democratic National Committee’s decision to sue Russia, WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign over Russian election interference, saying the DNC was “protecting our democracy” and could “walk and chew gum” when it came to keeping its focus on the midterm elections. The multimillion-dollar civil suit was filed on Friday in federal court in the southern district of New York, and claims senior Trump officials conspired with the Russian government in an attempt to damage Hillary Clinton. The suit seeks damages for the hacking of DNC email servers. Donald Trump tweeted about the suit over the weekend, seemingly promising a legal counter-move. “So funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning,” he wrote on Saturday. “Now he [sic] R’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including Servers and Emails!” It was unclear why Republicans would sue to obtain Democratic party emails, many of which are already public owing to Russia-directed hacking that began in April 2016. Trump’s mention of “servers” refers to a conspiracy theory he has advanced for more than a year, ironically set off by congressional testimony of then FBI director James Comey, who is currently touring behind a bestselling memoir in which he portrays Trump as “morally unfit” for office. In January 2016 testimony about an FBI investigation of cyber-attacks including on the DNC, Comey said Democrats had not turned over computer servers but substituted a review of the system performed by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. “This, my folks tell me, was an appropriate substitute,” Comey said. Trump disagrees. On Friday, he wrote: “Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI...” Appearing on ABC’s This Week on Sunday, Perez said he was “not in the least” concerned by Trump’s bluster. “The beauty of the civil justice system,” he said, “is that it’s not trial by tweet. This isn’t going to be a kangaroo court with [House intelligence committee chair and Trump backer] Devin Nunes. This is going to be a court where facts matter and justice is served. And if they want to relitigate all of their wild theories, there’s this thing called rule 11 where you get sanctioned for trying to do things like that.” Asked if the DNC risked taking its eye off the ball ahead of November elections in which control of Congress will be at stake, Perez said: “We can walk and chew gum.” Perez also sad he had “great confidence” the suit would not interfere with or distract from the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference and alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow and has indicted or secured plea deals with four key Trump aides so far. Responding to a claim by Trump 2020 director Brad Parscale that the suit was merely a fundraising ploy by a “desperate, dysfunctional and nearly insolvent Democratic party,” Perez told NBC’s Meet the Press: “Those are almost the precise quotes we heard from the Nixon campaign in 1972.” In that year, Democrats sued the president’s re-election committee for $1m over the Watergate break-in. A $750,000 settlement was paid in 1974, on the day Richard Nixon left office. Trump has denied collusion or obstruction of justice and called all investigations into Russian election interference a “witch hunt”. He did so again on Sunday afternoon. His campaign, meanwhile, sent out a fundraising email that called the DNC lawsuit an attempt “to keep the Russia witch hunt going and their bankrupt party alive”. The president also tweeted at length over the weekend about New York Times coverage of the plight of Michael Cohen, his personal attorney, whose office, hotel room and home were raided by federal authorities last week. The Times published a Saturday front-page piece that suggested Cohen could “flip” in order to lessen possible jail time and thereby work with federal authorities against Trump. Personally attacking – and misspelling the name of – Maggie Haberman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who worked on the piece, the president forcefully denied Cohen was a risk. Contention over Cohen’s fate consumed the US Sunday talk shows. Also on ABC, the Harvard lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who like Comey has dined with Trump at the White House, said the country was now seeing “an enormous battle for the soul of Michael Cohen”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/24/when-you-watch-your-country-play-in-the-world-cup-who-do-you-watch-with","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T09:10:54Z","webTitle":"When you watch your country play in the World Cup who do you watch with?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/24/when-you-watch-your-country-play-in-the-world-cup-who-do-you-watch-with","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/24/when-you-watch-your-country-play-in-the-world-cup-who-do-you-watch-with","fields":{"headline":"When you watch your country play in the World Cup who do you watch with?","bodyText":"With the World Cup fast approaching, we’d like to hear from families and/ or groups of friends living all over the UK watching their home country play.

From publishers requesting cover quotes, newspapers requesting reviews and self-published authors requesting advice. I’ve done my best to read as many as I can, as they flood unbidden into my house. They range from terrible to fine, occasionally tipping into good. (Who knew that so many people with fascinating lives would be able to make them come across as so boring on paper?) The Language of Kindness, however, has thoroughly resuscitated my faith in the genre. Christie Watson spent 20 years working as a nurse, before pivoting to a career in writing – she is a former winner of the Costa first novel award and now teaches creative writing. The book darts around, chapter to chapter, from her first days as a student nurse to her final day as a very senior one – flitting backwards and forwards in time and through specialties, immersing us in her world. In her introduction she tells us that she started her career thinking of nursing as a combination of chemistry, biology, physics, pharmacology and anatomy, but now realises that it’s actually much more about philosophy, psychology, art, ethics and politics. This is an argument she explores throughout the book, with a series of vignettes that evoke – as effectively as any I have read – the experience of being in a hospital. “I think of Hogarth’s portrayal of London in Gin Lane”, she says about an inner-city A&amp;E waiting area. “The poverty is palpable. There are drunk mothers and skeletal fathers. The room smells of body odour and of the metal of old blood.” I shivered with recognition. This is not a story of a high-octane career in a pioneering surgical field; it’s not a memoir filled with blockbusting anecdotes. Instead, it is a gently remarkable book about what it means to be a nurse, what it means to care. It struck me again and again how little we hear from nurses, how quiet their voice is, how poorly represented they are on our bookshelves. All this despite the crucial role they inevitably play in our lives and those of our families. It also struck me how poorly we understand what this role truly involves – even if, like me, you have worked alongside them. It’s a privilege to have Watson as our guide, walking us through the corridors, into the cubicles and the occasional operating theatre. Watching a paediatric heart-lung transplant as a student, she describes the child’s body – horrifically, wonderfully – as “a dugout canoe”. The patient, Aaron, makes it through the treacherous procedure, and Watson helps nurse him through a long recovery. With her trademark humanity, she sits with him and helps him write a letter to the mother of the boy who died, giving him his heart and an adulthood. “Did your son like strawberry ice-cream?” Aaron writes. Then: “It’s not fair that your son died so I can live.” The book is shot through with love – not just the love she has for her patients, but also for her colleagues and for her former profession. It’s also, by the very nature of the job, filled with a great deal of sadness. She tells us of a 12-year-old girl who dies in paediatric intensive care following a horrific house fire. To make it perhaps a little less painful for the family, Watson and her colleague wash this poor girl’s hair so she doesn’t smell so acutely of the smoke that took her life. It is a scene, powerfully told, that won’t leave me for a long time. And one, of course, that will never leave the people around that bed. Watson also opens up about her father, as he’s palliated in his final weeks, and receives his own excellent care from his nurse, Cheryl. Cheryl becomes much more than a nurse to her father – she becomes his closest confidante, his friend; something of course that thousands of nurses are every day to their patients. The Language of Kindness tries to be rather more than a memoir – there are significant sections on the history of nursing, of detailed medical explanation, of scholarly writing about the carer. These sections, while well researched and for the most part interesting, don’t quite succeed like the rest of the book and, at times, make for a slightly disjointed read. The jumps from chapter to chapter add to this feeling. It’s not a perfect book, and ends too abruptly. The sometimes matter-of-fact telling of heartbreaking stories can give it a feeling of emotional disconnection. But it still seems very important. It made me cry. It made me think. It made me laugh. It encouraged me to appreciate this most underappreciated of professions more than ever, and then to text a mate who’s working as a nurse to meet up for a drink. As a student, Watson fainted at the sight of her blood filling a syringe during a blood test. When she came to a short while later, the phlebotomist told her: “You might want to rethink your career.” We should all be very glad she went through with it.

Hossein Salami, the deputy commander of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, reacting to earlier comments by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanhayu, said on Friday: “If any war happens, it will definitely be followed by your annihilation.” Marking Israel’s 70th birthday, Netanyahu said in Tel Aviv: “We hear the threats from Iran. IDF fighters and the security branches are ready for any development. We will fight anyone who tries to harm us.” The ramping up of the rhetoric comes at the time when the region’s most bellicose states have locked horns over the fate of Syria, particularly in the era after the Islamic State’s collapse. In recent months, Israel has increasingly become militarily involved in response to what it believes is Iran’s growing influence on its doorstep. An Israeli airstrike on a Syrian airbase near the Syrian city of Homs this month killed at least seven Iranian military personnel in an incident that Tehran vowed would not be left unanswered. That episode, which marked a direct confrontation between Israel and Tehran, albeit in Syria, demonstrated that the change of dynamics in the Syrian conflict might escalate the risk of direct war between the two enemies. “Hands are on the trigger and missiles are ready and will be launched at any moment that the enemy tries to carry out its sinister plot against our lands,” Salami said, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated to the Guards. The senior Iranian commander said Iran could target the existence of Zionists if it came under attack. “North and west of Israel are at the intersection of fire; you will not escape … You live in the dragon’s mouth,” he said. “The smallest goal would be targeting your existence,” he added. “You cannot bear it. When your civilians and military forces escape, you’ll have no way but to the sea. Don’t trust in your airbases, they are within reach … your miscalculation would be dangerous.” Netanyahu told senior Israeli officials that Israel would “not be deterred by the cost and we will exact a price from those who seek our lives”, the Israel news website Ynetnews reported. In February, Israel downed a drone in its airspace that it said was Iranian; this week it claimed to have been loaded with explosives tasked to attack. The Israeli military said its “combat helicopters prevented the attack Iran had hoped to carry out in Israeli territory”. After responding by bombing what Israel said was an Iranian target deep in Syria, one Israeli F-16 fighter jet crashed in February amid a barrage of Syrian anti-aircraft missiles. Having lost its first jet in decades, Israel again hit what it said were Iranian targets, this time near Damascus. Iran is a staunch ally of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, providing his government with crucial ground support, thanks to a combination of Hezbollah fighters, Shia volunteers from across the Middle East and its own Revolutionary Guards. Russian and Iranian backing has swung the conflict in Assad’s favour, at the same time as the so-called caliphate of Isis has crumbled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/21/london-marathon-could-be-biggest-ever-despite-heat-worries","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"London Marathon could be biggest ever despite heat worries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/21/london-marathon-could-be-biggest-ever-despite-heat-worries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/21/london-marathon-could-be-biggest-ever-despite-heat-worries","fields":{"headline":"London Marathon could be biggest ever despite heat worries","bodyText":"Organisers of the London Marathon are hoping to break participation and fundraising records, despite predictions that Sunday’s race could be one of the hottest ever.

Katie Price, who has previously said she will run dressed as a lung for the British Lung Foundation, chef Gordon Ramsay and former Great British Break Off contestant Selasi Gbormittah are among the celebrities taking part. Organisers also believe they are on target to break the world record for the most funds raised by a single-day event for the 12th consecutive year. In 2017, runners raised £61.5m. “Our contingency plans for the forecast hot weather on Sunday include increasing the supply of water to all drinks stations to enable runners to douse themselves with water, increasing the number of showers on the route and increasing the supply of ice to first aid stations,” said Hugh Brasher, the event director. Brasher advised against aiming for personal best times without prior training in such temperatures. “Most importantly, runners should adjust their goal for Sunday and plan to run at a slower pace,” he said. “If they were planning to run in fancy dress, they should think carefully if that is appropriate.” Alison Coleman-Cross and her niece Tanya Martin are apprehensive about running their first marathon. “I’m not good with the heat,” said Coleman-Cross. “I’m trying to block it out because the stress isn’t good for my muscles.” Neither Coleman-Cross or Martin has been able to train since the weekend before Easter, due to a chest infection and a knee injury respectively. “If you’ve been training in [heat] your body gets used to it,” said Martin. “We have had snow and ice. Our last run was in zero degrees.” Elite athletes are equally susceptible to hot weather. Scotland’s Callum Hawkins looked set for gold in the Commonwealth Games marathon last Sunday, but collapsed near the finish in 27C conditions on Australia’s Gold Coast. In 2007, the last time the London Marathon was run in 22.2C heat, 600 people failed to complete the course; one participant died from drinking too much water, and organisers attracted criticism for water shortages at some points along the route. “There was a raft of learnings from 2007,” said Brasher, who explained that the directors of the world’s biggest marathons learned from each other . “There’s been a sea change of things we’ve done since,” he added. Sean Jones, a barrister running for Save the Children, said he was not worried by the weather forecasts. He has run marathons, including one in Milan, where temperatures were higher than those expected in London. “I’m running in my barrister’s wig and gown,” he said. “I will still be wearing them despite the weather. There are two reasons: most of my sponsors are lawyers and I couldn’t hope to fend off all those legal actions; and the costume is my excuse for moving slowly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/20/chat-googles-big-shot-at-killing-apples-imessage","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T11:49:41Z","webTitle":"Chat: Google’s big shot at killing Apple’s iMessage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/20/chat-googles-big-shot-at-killing-apples-imessage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/20/chat-googles-big-shot-at-killing-apples-imessage","fields":{"headline":"Chat: Google’s big shot at killing Apple’s iMessage","bodyText":"Google has unveiled a new messaging system, Chat, an attempt to replace SMS, unify Android’s various messaging services and beat Apple’s iMessage and Facebook’s WhatsApp with the help of mobile phone operators. Unlike traditional texting, or SMS, most modern messaging services – such as Signal, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Apple’s iMessage – are so-called over-the-top (OTT) services, which circumvent the mobile phone operator by sending messages over the internet. Google’s Chat is different. Users will not need to download another chat app or set up a new account. Instead of using OTT, it is based on rich communication services (RCS), a successor to SMS (short message standard), which has been used by people all over the world since 1992 and is still the fallback for most. RCS has been in the works since 2007, steered by the GSMA mobile operator trade body. Various mobile phone operators have offered their own versions, typically called “advanced messaging” or similar, but they haven’t usually worked with the outside world. With Chat, Google is unifying all the disparate versions of RCS under one interoperable standard that will work across networks, smartphones and operating systems. In doing so it hopes to take the surefire nature of SMS – anyone can send anyone else with a phone a message without them requiring a specific account or app – and bring it up-to-date with all the features modern chat demands. “The GSMA has been working for almost a decade to foster broader adoption of RCS as a way to compete with third-party instant messaging and voice apps, but adoption over the years has been patchy,” said Raghu Gopal from CCS Insight. “If Google is able to establish its RCS client as a truly universal and usable client on Android devices globally, it may offer a way to reduce Facebook’s stranglehold on messaging services. “Google and operators must come to the realisation that it’s getting late in the game, and it will take something special to establish RCS as a global standard.” For mobile phone operators the move offers one last chance to ensure they do not end up simply as dumb data pipes providing the internet access through which others offer the services users demand, be it voice, video or text chat. Anil Sabharwal, Google’s lead on the project, told the Verge: “We don’t believe in taking the approach that Apple does [with iMessage]. We are fundamentally an open ecosystem. We believe in working with partners. We believe in working with our OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] to be able to deliver a great experience.” Google’s special sauce in this effort is the Android Messages app, the company’s default text message app, which is bundled with the majority of smartphones not made by Samsung or Apple. It is here Google hopes that, having corralled the 55 or so mobile phone operators, it can make the experience competitive with the likes of Apple’s iMessage or Facebook’s WhatsApp, with read receipts, photos, gifs, videos and all the trappings. Users will be able to download the Android Messages app on to any Android device that doesn’t come with it, while Samsung and others that currently use their own SMS app have pledged support for Chat. The only major manufacturer not currently on board is Apple. Unlike many of the best messaging services, RCS, and by extension Google’s Chat, is not and will not be encrypted. Despite being sent over the internet, it will be carried by mobile phone operators and therefore subject to all the traditional communications regulations of search and surveillance. For users, they’ll see their regular SMS experience be enhanced with RCS once their phone operator switches on support; when all else fails, the service will fall back to SMS so there will be no fear that the text of the message is not getting through. Getting people to use Chat will certainly be a “tough ask”, says Kester Mann, mobile operator analyst for CCS Insight. He said: “The messaging space is a tough market to crack, but if the support of Google, the GSMA and leading operators isn’t enough to give it a chance, then I can’t see RCS taking off.” Google’s previous efforts to produce an iMessage beater, of which there have been many, have fallen way short of the billions of users Facebook has across its WhatsApp and Messenger apps. But none of Google’s failed apps have had the backing of phone operators or been oriented around a system millions already use. “Things have become convoluted in the mobile industry,” Gobal said, “with Google – a provider of several over-the-top services – working to promote a technology designed to tackle the threat of such services.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/20/county-cricket-yorks-v-notts-somerset-v-worcestershire-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T17:56:42Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Yorkshire rally against Notts, Renshaw stars for Somerset – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/20/county-cricket-yorks-v-notts-somerset-v-worcestershire-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/20/county-cricket-yorks-v-notts-somerset-v-worcestershire-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Yorkshire rally against Notts, Renshaw stars for Somerset – as it happened","bodyText":"It was a day for Australian batsmen and English seamers at Taunton. Matt Renshaw, the Yorkshire-born Australian Test player, drafted into Somerset’s squad after the curious incident in Cape Town, was only announced as a replacement for Cameron Bancroft a week ago. Here, batting at No 3 rather than at the top of the order, he hit a battling unbeaten century on a pitch somewhat greener than those he is accustomed to seeing in Brisbane. Renshaw’s debut innings enabled Somerset to reach 202. James Hildreth with a skittish 48, which was aided by two dropped catches by keeper Ben Cox, was the only other player to contribute against persistent seamers. Of these Ed Barnard, the mini-Woakes from Worcester, was bang on target in the afternoon session and he finished with career best figures of 5-52. For a while Renshaw was matched by Travis Head, another Aussie left-hander, who struck a belligerent 49 after Lewis Gregory had snatched three early wickets, including the highly-rated Joe Clarke for a golden duck. As batsmen panicked against the moving ball the wickets kept falling. In front of more than 2,000 sun-drenched onlookers Worcestershire ended the day 49 runs behind with two wickets remaining. Here’s all the latest scores at the end of day one, where Yorkshire have turned their game with Notts around, taking four wickets in the 19 overs available to leave the visitors on 53-4. Yorkshire had been 93-5 before rallying to finish on 256 all out, and now lead by more than 200 runs. Division One Yorkshire 256 all out, Nottinghamshire 53-4; Notts trail by 203 runs Surrey 211 all out, Hampshire 52-3; Hants trail by 159 runs Somerset 202 all out, Worcestershire 153-8; Worcs trail by 59 runs Essex 150 all out, Lancashire 141-8; Lancs trail by nine runs Division Two Northamptonshire 147, Warwickshire 113-3; Warks trail by 34 runs Sussex 254-7, Leicestershire yet to bat Gloucestershire 236, Glamorgan 26-0; Glamorgan trail by 210 runs Durham 91 all out, 13-1; Kent 169 all out; Durham trail by 65 runs Derbyshire 265 all out, Middlesex 45-3; Middx trail by 220 runs Yorkshire are all out for 256, some recovery from 93/5. Andrew Hodd’s 62 led the way, while Jack Brooks finished 30 not out and shared 44 for the tenth wicket with Ben Coad (18 not out). Notts are now presented with what looks like a tricky 19 overs before close. I’m starting to think this could be Yorkshire’s day. Take a look down the scorecards and there remains little batting success around the country, which is making me think Yorkshire are in reasonable health at 223/9, including Andrew Hodd’s 62. He has just fallen, bowled by Harry Gurney. Lancashire are 41/3 in reply to Essex’s 150, with Jamie Porter getting rid of Hameed, Jennings and Davies. That much vaunted Red Rose batting line-up under early pressure again. Worcestershire are also three down – 31/3 in reply to Somerset’s 202, while down a division Warwickshire are 38/3 in reply to Northants 147. At Durham, Kent have a lead of 40. They are 131/5 in reply to 91. Heino Kuhn is 48 not out (I was a touch concerned what spellchecker may throw up there). Tea at Headingley, where Yorkshire are closing in on a batting point. They are 198/8, with Andrew Hodd unbeaten on 55. If he, Jack Brooks and Ben Coad can somehow get the score up to 250, this could be a good score. Notts certainly didn’t bowl as well this afternoon, not making use of conditions – more swing than seam. It was pretty similar in the first 15 minutes of play this morning before they found their range. Ed Barnard, the mini-Woakes of Worcestershire, rocked Somerset in the afternoon session with his first five-wicket haul in first class cricket. While Matt Renshaw enjoyed a perfect debut – he became the first Somerset batsman to make a century since Alviro Petersen in 2013 and the 14th man to achieve this feat – Barnard, with his lively seamers, tormented the rest of the batsmen. Barnard finished with 5-49 while Somerset, despite Renshaw’s best efforts, limped to 202 all out. Barnard found a flicker of movement in the air and off a green pitch, albeit one that is beginning to lose some if its verdancy. Meanwhile the more familiar of the Somerset batsmen looked flaky against Worcestershire’s four-pronged pace attack. Renshaw has arrived at Taunton eager to please his new employers and to gain vital experience in case he is selected for next summer’s Ashes series. On this evidence he has a fine chance of being on that tour. This was an archetypal test for an Australian playing his first first-class innings in this country with regular movement available off a juicy April pitch, though as a kid in Yorkshire Renshaw played plenty of cricket in Sheffield alongside Joe Root. Renshaw reached his century with an emphatic lofted drive off Travis Head, who bowled the solitary over of spin in the match so far. Soon after he was stranded but contented, having proven his worth to his new colleagues at the first opportunity. Renshaw would not be here without those shenanigans with the ball by the Australians in Cape Town last month, which had so many consequences. One of the smaller ones was that Cameron Bancroft’s contract with Somerset was terminated and he was replaced by Renshaw. It may be that Somerset have been done an unwitting favour by David Warner and Steve Smith. Ed Smith, the former cricketer, broadcaster and journalist, has been confirmed as England’s new national selector and will now head up a restructured scouting system for identifying the best players in the country, writes Ali Martin. The 40-year-old replaces James Whitaker in the top role and will be given licence to appoint a deputy to sit alongside himself and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, on a new three-man panel that picks the men’s national teams. You can read the full story here. Essex 150 all out against Lancashire at Chelmsford, including Peter Siddle’s 33 from number 10. Joe Mennie led the way with three wickets for Lancs, while Onions, Clark and Bailey all adding a couple apiece.They are the third of three teams to have already been bowled out today, the other two being in Division Two. Durham were 91 all out against Kent, who are 88/4. I can’t see that one going to the final session of day four. Northants were bowled out for 147, with Warwickshire 14/0 in reply. Here, Yorkshire are edging towards a batting point thanks largely to Andrew Hodd. He has 47 of 184/7. Luke Fletcher, the pick of the Notts attack, has taken his second and third wickets in the last half hour or so, with Yorkshire now 161/7. Jack Leaning was caught at second slip and Tim Bresnan lbw. Andrew Hodd is Yorkshire’s biggest hope of a recovery – he has 37. Wickets continue to tumble around the country, with Essex 150/9 against Lancashire. In fact, only Surrey, Kent and Sussex have had what you would describe as a successful day with the bat. The title defence hasn’t started so well for Essex. Frustrated off the field here at Headingley last week, they are being frustrated on it this week at Chelmsford. They are currently 105/8 against Lancashire, including two wickets apiece for Graham Onions and Jordan Clark, who has picked up his wickets either side of lunch. Australian Joe Mennie has claimed three-for … he was their standout performer in the Notts defeat by all accounts. No further alarm for Yorkshire after lunch, who are 135-5 with Andrew Hodd on 28 and Jack Leaning on 12. They have shared 42 unbroken. Talk about a hectic morning. I make that 37 wickets falling before lunch across the country, with 23 of those being in Division Two. Mind you, I certainly didn’t get an A in GCSE maths, so please don’t shoot the messenger. Here at Headingley, Yorkshire are in a spot of both at 107/5, losing two of those to Jake Ball – loose shots from Alex Lees and Gary Ballance. The hosts have had their moments, however, through Adam Lyth’s eye-catching 45 and a good looking 22 from teenager Harry Brook before he was yorked by Luke Wood’s left-arm seam. Much like Yorkshire, it has been a pretty frustrating start to the campaign for champions Essex. Washed out at Headingley last week, they are four down for 65 against last season’s runners up Lancashire. Jordan Clark removed Ravi Bopara on the cusp of lunch. Much more sedate at the Oval and Taunton, where Surrey are 83/2 against Hampshire and Somerset are 102/3 against Worcestershire. Down in Division Two, most of the action has come at the Riverside, where Durham have been bowled out for 91 by Kent. Five for New Zealander Matt Henry and a cheeky three-for for Darren Stevens. Northants, Sussex and Derbyshire all three down in their respective games, while Gloucestershire are 86/4 against Glamorgan at Bristol. Somehow Somerset took lunch contentedly. They were 105/3 which is a fine outcome for them. The pitch was green, the ball darted around and vital catches were spilt. In the seventh over Somerset were 7/2, with old Trescothick and young Byrom back in the sheds (sorry, not been long back from New Zealand). Steve Magoffin, who has a fine record at Taunton, was making the ball talk. Batting was a trial despite a cloudless sky. James Hildreth in particular was in skittish, scatty mood. He clipped one straight ball from Magoffin for six over square leg and failed to middle anything else for about half an hour. On 13 he offered a tall skier from a leading edge. Keeper Cox, normally so reliable, circled as Hildreth headed for the pavilion; he barely laid a glove on the ball. When Hildreth was on 20 he edged a fine delivery from Josh Tongue, offering another tricky yet routine catch to the keeper and the ball fell to ground. There was another six from Hildreth from an upper cut, but he could not quite make it to lunch. He was caught at slip for 48 just before lunch. Meanwhile Matt Renshaw, the Australian opener and a late replacement for Cameron Bancroft, proceeded in more orthodox style. Not always pretty, not always at ease on such a green surface, he battled impressively. Eventually he was clipping the ball off his hip with increasing certainty and delivering a few meaty on drives. He was 45 not out at the break. Over 2000 spectators are engrossed and enthralled by this old fashioned game. Wickets tumbling up and down the country, including a fourth here at Headingley – Adam Lyth lbw to Harry Gurney for a breezy 45, including a pulled six off the other left-armer, Luke Wood. If Yorkshire can take anything from this morning, it’s that their teenager Harry Brook has settled nicely at the crease and has 22 of 91/4. Elsewhere, champions Essex are 54/3 against Lancashire at Chelmsford, with Tom Westley the latest to go to Tom Bailey for 17. Other wickets for Onions and Mennie. Yorkshire are in a spot of bother now, at 47/3. Gary Ballance was the latest to fall for a nine-ball duck, caught at point off Jake Ball. Having seen Alex Lees caught at third slip following a loose shot to Ball, Ballance steered a short ball straight to point. Teenager Harry Brook has come in and played a lovely back foot punch through the covers to get off the mark, however. Adam Lyth is with him on 25. Jeepers, Durham are 46/6 against Kent! Wickets everywhere but Grace Road in the opening 45 minutes of the day, with Sussex 17-0 against the Foxes. Surrey are 28/2 against Hampshire at the Oval, having lost Mark Stoneman and Scott Borthwick lbw to Fidel Edwards for four and five. Oh, hang on, just as I finished that paragraph, the full house is complete as Luke Wells is caught behind off Leicester’s seam bowling all-rounder Ben Raine. Here at Headingley, we have just seen a second wicket go, that of Che Pujara – or Steve to his Yorkie mates – lbw to Luke Fletcher for two. It’s 36/2. Early action at Durham as they lose two in the third over to Kent’s overseas New Zealander Matt Henry, leaving them at 4/2. That has included Durham’s overseas Aiden Markram lbw for an eight-ball duck. Will Smith, bowled, followed him back to the hutch. Quiet but steady start here by Yorkshire, who are 14/0 in the fourth. Ed Smith, meanwhile, has been announced as England’s new national selector, replacing James Whitaker. A cloudless sky, Quantocks fully visible and the Marcus Trescothick Stand is almost full at 10.40am. It seems to be farewell – or at least au revoir – to Ciderabad. The grass is green and there was no toss so Somerset are batting first against Worcestershire with Matt Renshaw on the card at number three, preparing to make his debut. Dom Bess is twelfth man and Jamie Overton is not fully fit, which may not please the new chief selector. So off we go. Let’s enjoy it while we can. We are set for a start on time here for the opening day of Yorkshire’s season as Nottinghamshire visit. After seven straight washed out days against Leeds/Bradford MCC Universities and Essex, the wet outfield has dried thanks to the last few days of sunshine. “Someone told me it’s going to be warmer than Ibiza this week,” smiled Andrew Gale on Monday, shortly after the Championship game against Essex fell by the wayside. Thankfully the warm weather arrived, while the outfield was also subject of deep spiking aeration work on Tuesday via a Verti Drain machine (never thought I’d be looking that up when I started out on the county circuit!). The same work had been done approximately a fortnight ago as well before more wet weather came. Notts arrive here on the back of an impressive opening round victory over Lancashire at Old Trafford, inspired by seamers Jake Ball and Harry Gurney. They will be hoping to catch the Yorkies cold. Elsewhere, champions Essex are in a similar boat to Yorkshire having been kept in the starting blocks last weekend. They face Lancashire at Chelmsford … Down at Taunton, Somerset host Worcestershire, where Vic Marks is on duty, while it’s Surrey against Hampshire at the Oval. In Division Two, Northants host Warwickshire, Leicestershire face Sussex, Gloucestershire face Glamorgan, Durham host Kent and it’s Derbyshire versus Middlesex."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/20/north-korea-suspends-nuclear-missile-tests","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T09:55:09Z","webTitle":"North Korea halts nuclear and missile tests ahead of planned Trump summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/north-korea-suspends-nuclear-missile-tests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/20/north-korea-suspends-nuclear-missile-tests","fields":{"headline":"North Korea halts nuclear and missile tests ahead of planned Trump summit","bodyText":"North Korea has said it will end its tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and shut down its nuclear test site, in a dramatic development ahead of a much-anticipated meeting between its leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump. The suspensions went into immediate effect on Saturday, according to state-run KCNA news agency. The US president greeted the news in a tweet: “This is very good news for North Korea and the World – big progress!” The British Foreign Office described the announcement as a positive step. “We hope this indicates an effort to negotiate in good faith,” a spokesperson said. The European Union’s foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, said the move was part of a process that must lead to the country’s “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation”. The news comes less than a week before Kim meets the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, for a summit in the demilitarised zone that divides the peninsula. South Korea’s presidential office welcomed the announcement as “meaningful progress” towards denuclearisation. “It will create a very positive environment for the success of the upcoming inter-Korean and North-US summits,” said. The move goes some way towards meeting US demands for denuclearisation, as Pyongyang and Washington work towards agreement on when and where Kim will meet Trump for historic talks that barely seemed possible just a few months ago. KCNA quoted Kim as saying that North Korea should focus on economic development now that it had achieved its aim of becoming a nuclear state. “The whole party and the whole nation should now focus on the development of the socialist economy,” he was quoted as saying. “This is the party’s new strategic policy line.” He added: “A fresh climate of detente and peace is being created on the Korean peninsula and the region, and dramatic changes are being made in the international political landscape.” The decision to suspend nuclear tests and missile launches came at a plenary meeting of the ruling party’s central committee, which met on Friday. Kim told the meeting that the North’s development of nuclear weapons should be seen as a “great victory”. “As the weaponisation of nuclear weapons has been verified, it is not necessary for us to conduct any more nuclear tests or test launches of mid- and long-range missiles or ICBMs. The northern nuclear test site has completed its mission,” he added, according to KCNA. North Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests at Punggye-ri test site in the country’s north-east. It tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, while its last and most powerful test came last September. Those tests, plus a string of missile launches ordered by Kim throughout 2017, at one point appeared to be taking the peninsula to the brink of conflict. Some analysts greeted the North’s move with caution, noting that the regime had reneged on previous nuclear deals and that Saturday’s announcement did not mention shorter-range ballistic missiles capable of striking Japan and South Korea. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, cautiously welcomed North Korea’s pledge. “We welcome it as a forward-looking move … but an important thing is whether the move will lead to the complete abandonment of missile and nuclear developments in a verifiable and irreversible manner,” Abe said. “We want to watch it closely.” The Japanese defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said he and the US defence secretary, Jim Mattis, had agreed during talks in Washington that any deal must include weapons with which North Korea could continue to threaten its neighbours. “This is not the time for Japan, the United States and the international community to ease pressure” on North Korea, Onodera said. Japan’s deputy prime minister and finance minister, Taro Aso, added a note of scepticism. “[North Korea] has made a lot of promises and we paid money on the condition that they will give up [nuclear] experiment sites, but they continued,” Aso said in Washington. Catherine Dill, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said a promise to end missile and nuclear tests “does not equate to the dismantlement of the nuclear and missile programmes”. She added: “Perhaps this signals that North Korea is confident enough in its nuclear and missile programmes to concede testing while stringing along the prospect of verifiable dismantlement for years past Trump’s presidency.” Scott LaFoy, a Washington-based satellite imagery analyst focusing on ballistic missile and space technologies, said Kim’s comments should be seen as “the first part of a negotiation. It can be easily undone, but could also turn into the foundation of a deal. It shouldn’t be read as a concrete promise, it should be seen as the start of a complex discussion. The North’s quest to develop a deterrent against what it has long described as US hostility resulted in an extraordinary exchange of insults between Kim and Trump last September, and frequent warnings from Washington that it would not rule out military action to end Kim’s nuclear ambitions. Saturday’s announcement came the day after a hotline between Kim and the South Korean president went live. It connects Moon’s desk at the presidential Blue House with North Korea’s state affairs commission, which is headed by Kim, Yonhap news agency said. Earlier this week Moon, a liberal whose election in May raised hopes of an inter-Korea detente, said that Pyongyang had expressed a desire for the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula without attaching preconditions such as the withdrawal of US troops. The two countries are due to hold a summit next Friday on the southern side of the demilitarised zone. The meeting is to be followed in May or June by a meeting between Kim and Trump. The US president on Wednesday pledged to meet Kim “in the coming weeks” but said he was prepared to walk away if the talks were not fruitful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/apr/22/parents-boycott-sats-tests","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"Must do better?

Why parents plan boycott of school Sats tests","bodyText":"When children across England start their week of Sats tests next month, 30 primary schools will be under particular scrutiny. That is because children from those schools have performed poorly once they have moved to secondary schools. That has raised suspicions that their good Sats results – more properly known as key stage 2 tests – were the result of cheating. Children from other primary schools feeding the same secondary schools, meanwhile, have performed roughly as expected. “For example, if the children were predicted 10 Bs [at GCSE], they would get 10 Cs,” said Dave Thomson, chief statistician at Education Data Lab, which carried out the analysis. “I don’t think we can say with absolute certainty why this is happening but it warrants further investigation.” Cheating is one of the many reasons why Sats continue to face serious opposition. Parent groups such as Let Our Kids Be Kids plan to boycott Sats this year by taking their children out of primary school when the tests start on 14 May. Last year a headteacher of a Leeds primary school locked the Sats papers in a cupboard and took the children to the Captain Cook Museum in Whitby instead. In 2010 nearly 15,000 children in London did not take Sats after a boycott and had continuous assessments instead. Campaigners against Sats object to the huge pressure primary schools are under to deliver improvements year after year, which they say encourages schools to teach only the core subjects of reading, writing and mathematics, almost abandoning art, music, foreign languages and even science, which is only assessed in a random selection of schools. “Schools are judged, compared and ranked on these results,” said James Bowen from the National Association of Head Teachers. “If the scores aren’t good enough, teachers start fearing the implications and the interventions they might face – even the future of the school. The stakes are far too high.” Those stakes are high enough for some teachers to risk their careers. Over the last 12 months, three headteachers have been taken to a disciplinary panel of the National College for Training and Leadership – now the Teaching Regulation Agency – for altering Sats papers after they had been completed. In each case the heads resigned or were dismissed. A National Union of Teachers source told the Observer that in other cases, borderline pupils had done Sats in the headteacher’s office so they could be helped to get the right answers. “Another head prepared for a mental maths test by giving all the children a copy of the paper so they could see the questions,” the source said. “There was a teacher who read the multiple choice test aloud and emphasised the right answers. One pressed so hard when she was altering exam scripts that the marks came through on other papers in the pile underneath. “Those numbers are an overwhelming minority of cases,” Bowen said. “You have to question what is going on with the system where people feel driven to that kind of behaviour. No one trains to be a teacher thinking ‘one day I’m going to cheat in tests’. It says something about the system where people feel under so much pressure they start taking questionable action.” While the vast majority of the 15,000 primary schools in England do not cheat, Sats are still seen by some as disruptive. Little London primary school in Leeds decided to boycott the exams last year after parents backed the idea in a consultation, says Ivelina Metchkarova, whose son was in year six. The key factor was that school would continue as normal in the remaining eight weeks of term after Sats finished. “We were told that if there are no Sats, but there are extra assessments, then there will be continuous learning throughout the year until July,” she said. “If there had been Sats, after they finished the school would have been putting on plays. My son learned a huge amount in those three months and it really built his confidence.” Unlike GCSEs and A-levels, Sats have no bearing on a child’s future – they aren’t used for school selection, and primary schools send far more detailed assessments of each child when they move up to secondary level. Yet there is growing concern that the stress felt by teachers trickles down to the children. The Commons education committee said last year that young children were at risk of developing mental health problems, with evidence that growing numbers of children suffering from panic attacks, anxiety and depression. Alison Roy of the Association of Child Psychotherapists, which is part of the More Than A Score campaign group seeking to replace Sats, said it was common now to hear children as young as six say they feel “stressed out”. “We’re seeing higher levels of physical responses, like headaches, tummy aches and feeling sick, not wanting to go to school,” she said. “At this time of year [around Sats] we see a lot more emotional stresses and difficulties, and relationship issues from being put under pressure.” Madeleine Holt, More Than A Score’s spokeswoman, said it wanted to see a broader range of assessments. “In Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales they don’t do this. In New Zealand they got rid of them,” she said, referring to the National Standards tests that have been abolished. “The driving motive behind More Than A Score is to show that we are an international outlier. Most countries don’t do this. More and more parents are starting to feel that something is going wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/20/man-arrested-over-suspected-role-in-hither-green-burglary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T21:14:44Z","webTitle":"Man arrested over suspected role in Hither Green burglary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/man-arrested-over-suspected-role-in-hither-green-burglary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/man-arrested-over-suspected-role-in-hither-green-burglary","fields":{"headline":"Man arrested over suspected role in Hither Green burglary","bodyText":"A man suspected of being an accomplice in a burglary in which one of the intruders was stabbed to death earlier this month has been arrested, police have said. Billy Jeeves, 28, who had been on the run since the incident on Wednesday 4 April, was tracked to northern Kent and arrested on suspicion of two counts of burglary, theft and possession of a controlled substance at about 5.30pm on Friday. Henry Vincent, 37, was killed during the incident in Hither Green, southeast London, after a struggle broke out between him and the 78-year-old homeowner, Richard Osborn-Brooks. The latter was arrested over the death, but released and told he would face no further action shortly afterwards. Following the incident, police appealed for information about an alleged accomplice and said he may have escaped in a white van. The vehicle was found burned out on the evening of Saturday 7 April in Orpington. Jeeves was detained by officers from the Metropolitan police’s homicide and major crime command, with support from officers from the territorial support group and Kent police officers. He was taken into custody at a Kent station. Scotland Yard said it was not looking for anyone else in connection with this investigation, though they stressed that inquiries would continue. The incident was the subject of national attention and tempers were frayed when friends and family of Vincent sought to mark the site of his death with flowers and other tributes. Some people repeatedly tore down the monuments, only for them to be replaced soon afterwards. The tensions led police to step in to appeal for calm. “I do not want anyone to feel intimidated or that they are not being allowed to respond in a dignified way to a tragic death,” said Ch Supt Simon Dobinson. “We would urge members of the public to respect the wishes of those who choose to place flowers and other tributes in the area.

Fulham have returned to the Championship’s top two, ousting Cardiff from the automatic places for 24 hours at least, with the rousing nature of this win an indication that their pursuit of promotion remains relentless. Millwall, outstanding themselves of late, had not lost in 17 league games. In the end even they appeared diminished. The south Londoners would leave the pitch with their fans applauding their efforts, and their own ambitions to reach the play-offs apparently unfazed by defeat with two games to play but their manager, Neil Harris admitted this had been a reality check. Fulham, now without a defeat in 22 league matches in a notoriously treacherous division, weathered the hosts’ early storm and imposed themselves impressively after the break. They were untouchable at times. Few teams at this level can muster such a blend of zest and panache and much of their approach play was Premier League ready. The pace of their passing and fluid movement up-field would grace the top flight with Ryan Sessegnon, at 17 the Championship’s player of the season, truly a a gem of which the elite have long heard talk. It was his instinctive dart and finish, pouncing for a 15th goal this term after an indecisive Jordan Archer had only parried Aleksandar Mitrovic’s long-range shot, which set the tone 41 seconds into the second half. “After that, we started to move better, finding more space,” said the Fulham manager, Slavisa Jokanovic. “It was a brilliant second half.” The Serb’s own assessment of Sessegnon’s display included a nudge towards Gareth Southgate. “I believe Ryan can be there (at the World Cup),” he added. “But, if not this time, then in two years in another big tournament.” The teenager, the product of a fine academy, caught the eye but plenty excelled. Matthew Targett clipped the bar from distance. Mitrovic would thump in his team’s third, and his 11th in his last 12 games on loan from Newcastle, after Tomas Kalas’s run from deep, and Kevin McDonald, the unsung worker at the base of a dazzling midfield, would enjoy his own moment. With Millwall disoriented and the atmosphere momentarily deflated, he left George Saville on the floor and meandered inside to belt a shot which swerved viciously to pass inside Archer’s post via the goalkeeper’s fingertips. If the hosts could curse Archer’s uncharacteristic errors, their own evening degenerated into frustration as the cautions mounted up and Tim Cahill appeared to floor Ryan Fredericks with an elbow. Harris had not seen that incident, on the far side of the pitch, but was clearly unimpressed by Andre Marriner’s display on a rare outing in the second tier. “He did very well for the away team in the first half,” said the Millwall manager, Saville having been denied an opening goal after Jed Wallace was penalised for a foul on Targett. “If I was the defender, I’d probably want the foul. But it was 50:50. There was a lot of protection for Fulham, though. But, as the referee told me at half-time, he thought he’d been ‘excellent’.” Harris’s team, too, had been excellent through that frenetic opening when their intensity knocked Fulham off their stride. Jake Cooper saw a powerful header turned on to the crossbar by Marcus Bettinelli from the game’s first corner, with Tim Ream scrambling Wallace’s close-range shot from the goalline. But the chances were not taken and, once Fulham found their rhythm, they proved more ruthless from the moment their hosts’ tempo dipped even marginally. The lead from Cardiff is a slender two points and the Welsh club can reassert control against Nottingham Forest and Derby in the next four days, but the pressure is on them. Jokanovic suggested he would watch his rivals’ game with Forest on Saturday evening “if I don’t find something more interesting to do”. At present, as this game proved, there is little better than watching his own team in action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/21/mark-hughes-magic-touch-southampton-fa-cup-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T09:30:00Z","webTitle":"Mark Hughes hoping Southampton can find magic spark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/21/mark-hughes-magic-touch-southampton-fa-cup-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/21/mark-hughes-magic-touch-southampton-fa-cup-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Mark Hughes hoping Southampton can find magic spark","bodyText":"The memory of one of the most famous goals Mark Hughes scored helps fuel his belief that one moment of magic in Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final could kickstart a recovery for Southampton and make a season of struggle end in relative success. The Welshman recalls how his dramatic late volley against Oldham in the 1994 semi-final gave renewed impetus to a Manchester United side that went on to win the Double. So Southampton’s manager views Sunday’s showdown with Chelsea not as an excessive burden in the middle of a relegation fight but as an opportunity to trigger a turnaround at the club he was hired to rescue last month. Hughes says his acrobatic equaliser against Oldham in the last minute of extra time is one of the three goals that people still mention to him regularly (along with his winner against Barcelona in the 1991 European Cup Winners’ Cup final and a preposterous volley he struck for Wales against Spain in 1985) and he remembers how it helped reinvigorate United’s season at a time when they appeared to be waning. “We had been going for a treble at one point but we got beaten in the League Cup final, it looked as if we were stalling in the league and then the FA Cup was slipping away too,” says Hughes. Oldham were on the verge of a glorious victory until Hughes fired in a spectacular volley to take the semi-final to a replay, which United won 4-1. They went on to thrash Chelsea 4-0 in the final and beat Blackburn to the league title. “It had looked as if we were going to lose everything but in one moment we got back on track and ended up with the Double. Those key little things can change a whole season. Let’s hope one of our guys can produce a moment that changes our season on Sunday.” If such a moment arrives, it may come from a player who has been on the fringes since Hughes replaced Mauricio Pellegrino five weeks ago. The manager has declared his intentions to rotate his starting lineup to preserve certain players for next Saturday’s game at home to Bournemouth, in which victory is vital for Southampton’s Premier League survival hopes, especially after the pain of last Saturday’s 3-2 defeat by Sunday’s opponents. Hughes will not only alter personnel in the rematch: he also hinted that he will use the semi‑final to deploy a new formation in an effort to solve the scoring problems that have plagued Southampton since long before Hughes’s appointment. That could mean fielding two strikers instead of a lone frontman, which is a tactic that many Southampton fans have been demanding since last season. So far Hughes has used a similar one-striker system to the one favoured by the club’s last two managers, Claude Puel and Pellegrino, but he hinted he may introduce a new approach on Sunday. “We’re in a situation where we’re going to have to be more expansive and take more risks from this point onwards,” he said. “I think fans will see that [on Sunday].” Questions remain as to whether Southampton have one sharp striker, let alone two. Charlie Austin remains their top scorer with seven goals in all competitions this season while Manolo Gabbiadini has four, Shane Long two and Guido Carrillo, who became the club’s record signing in January when he joined for £19m from Monaco, has yet to get off the mark or even look worthy of a place in the squad. At least those players have a manager who knows what it is like to be a top striker. He says the only solution is to keep plugging away – and have the courage to try to conjure a moment of magic. “You’ve just got to keep on doing the right things in terms of getting in the right areas, affecting back fours,” says Hughes. “We are creating chances but maybe it’s just about that little bit of devilment in the box you need to get on the end of things. And sometimes make things happen yourself. Maybe we need that little bit of stardust in our team to create that chance out of nothing.” It will be a fine trick if Southampton can muster a happy ending to their season of woe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/21/antonio-conte-fa-cup-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T21:30:04Z","webTitle":"Antonio Conte believes FA Cup will be much harder to win than last year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/21/antonio-conte-fa-cup-chelsea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/21/antonio-conte-fa-cup-chelsea","fields":{"headline":"Antonio Conte believes FA Cup will be much harder to win than last year","bodyText":"Antonio Conte believes Chelsea passed up “a great chance” to win the FA Cup last season and will find success this year far harder to come by as they prepare for Sunday’s semi‑final against Southampton. The Italian, who has yet to claim a knockout trophy as a manager, had seen his team secure the Premier League title by seven points last term, finishing 18 clear of Arsenal, their opponents in the cup final. Yet Chelsea failed to maintain the high standards they had set – they won 19 of their last 23 fixtures in all competitions before the showpiece – and his 10 men succumbed to a late Aaron Ramsey goal to lose 2-1. Conte was speaking before knowing that Manchester United, rather than Spurs, would await in the final if Southampton, struggling badly in the top flight, were overcome. “I must be honest: last season, we missed a great chance to win the FA Cup,” said Conte. “This season, if we can win against Southampton and reach the final, it would be more difficult against Tottenham or United. Last season we were in the best condition to try to go and win the FA Cup, and we missed that chance. It was our fault. “I remember that some refereeing decisions were not good. The first goal scored by [Alexis] Sánchez was handball, and we finished the game with 10 men [after Victor Moses’ dismissal for two bookings]. But, despite this, we were able to equalise only to concede a goal at the last with our mistake. Arsenal did a great job to win the FA Cup but we could have done better. At that moment we were stronger than them. This season, it would be more difficult to win it.” Conte, who is expected to leave Stamford Bridge in the summer, will not be appeased for a difficult campaign by a second successive appearance in the FA Cup final. “You have to know that I play only to win,” he said. “I don’t play to enjoy. I play only to win. Every season I start the season with only one idea in my mind, in my heart, in my soul: to win. “If I win something, I did my job, not something special. If we don’t win, I’m very angry, above all with myself. But I’m ready to work harder to try and win something the next chance I have.” Southampton were overcome in a league meeting between the sides last Saturday despite Chelsea trailing 2-0 at St Mary’s with 20 minutes remaining. Olivier Giroud, who should start at Wembley, transformed that occasion following his introduction from the bench, and Conte hopes his players have learned lessons from the contest on the south coast. “If we are the team that played the first half and a part of the second half, we must be concerned, really concerned,” added Chelsea’s head coach. “But if we go to play with the right team spirit, we have a possibility of reaching the final. My players have to go on to the pitch with the right fire in their eyes, with the right desire to reach the final, and with our crowd with us. We must give them the best satisfaction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/20/eight-convicted-in-italy-over-secret-mafia-negotiations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-20T20:59:15Z","webTitle":"Eight jailed in Italy over secret talks between state officials and mafia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/eight-convicted-in-italy-over-secret-mafia-negotiations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/20/eight-convicted-in-italy-over-secret-mafia-negotiations","fields":{"headline":"Eight jailed in Italy over secret talks between state officials and mafia","bodyText":"A court in Italy has convicted eight men, including mob bosses, police investigators and a close associate of Silvio Berlusconi, over a secret attempt to negotiate with the Sicilian mafia in order to end a bloody bombing campaign in the 1990s After the verdict, members of the public cheered the prosecutors. Eight men were handed jail sentences ranging from eight to 28 years, including three former heads of the security police department – Mario Mori, Giuseppe De Donno and Antonio Subranni – and the co-founder of Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party, Marcello Dell’Utri. The five-year case has thrown light on one of the murkiest chapter’s in Italy’s recent history: secret talks held between who were seeking to overturn harsh anti-mafia laws. As part of their campaign to put pressure on the state, the mafia – at the time led by the Corleone family – unleashed a string of bombs and assassinations which killed 23 people including anti-mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. “As judges were being blown up, some people in the state helped the cosa nostra,” said prosecutor Nino Di Matteo after the sentence. “This is is an historic ruling.” Di Matteo said the verdict proved that Dell’Utri was the go-between linking the mafia and the new Berlusconi government in May 1994. “The relationship didn’t stop with Berlusconi, the entrepreneur, but arrived at Berlusconi, the politician,” he said. According to the prosecutors, the Italian officials communicated with mafia “godfather” Totò Riina, who died in prison last November, in the attempt to stop the wave of mafia murders and bombings. During the contacts with state officials, mafia bosses offered to stop the bombings in return for reduced sentences for jailed mobsters and a review of all convictions. Dell’Utri was sentenced to 12 years in prison for undermining the state, as were two retired Carabinieri generals and an ex-colonel. Dell’Utri is already serving a seven-year sentence for tax fraud, false accounting and acts of conspiracy with the Sicilian mafia. A convicted killer for the Corleone mafia family, Leoluca Bagarella, was handed 28 years and Antonio Cina, another high-ranking Corleone mobster, got 12 years. Both are already in prison. The Corleone bosses of that period, Salvatore “Toto” Riina and Bernardo “the Tractor” Provenzano, are dead. In a statement, Berlusconi denied ever having anything to do with the mafia and said his governments fought against organized crime.

The Dundee University-based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours. The method is non-invasive and cheaper than current detection techniques. Prostate cancer has become the most common cancer in men in the UK. One in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47,000 new cases being diagnosed every year. Men aged 50 or over, men with a family history of prostate cancer, and black men are at greatest risk of developing the condition. “Current diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient, leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients,” said the Dundee University team’s leader, Professor Ghulam Nabi. “Our new method is far more accurate and also allows us to identify the difference between cancerous and benign tissue in the prostate without the need for invasive surgery.” The prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system and is normally about the shape and size of a walnut. Current methods for determining if a prostate has become cancerous include a physical examination of the prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE), MRI scans, a biopsy or tests to determine levels of the chemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. Each carries problems. PSA results can be unreliable; a DRE is not good at identifying which cancers are benign and which need treatment; MRI scans cannot always give a definitive answer; while a biopsy carries a risk of infection and is expensive. The new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound. Cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue so shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour. “We have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as MRI,” added Nabi. “The technique has picked up cancers which MRI did not reveal. We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. This is a significant step forward.” The trial tests involved around 200 patients. “Now we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer,” Nabi said. SWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases. However, to make it applicable to prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed by the team. “The technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers, while also ruling out those who do not have prostate cancer,” said Simon Grieveson, head of research funding at Prostate Cancer UK, which funded the Dundee project (with support from the Movember Foundation). “With an average of one man dying every 45 minutes from prostate cancer in the UK, the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever.” In the past few years, a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease, including Michael Parkinson, Ian McKellen and most recently Stephen Fry, the comedian and former rector of Dundee University, who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour. “This breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the UK, not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence,” said Fry. “It is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging. 47,000 Number of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed every year in the UK 11,000 The number of men who die each year from the disease 1 in 8 Proportion of UK men who will get prostate cancer in their lifetime"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/21/verdict-due-kim-wall-swedish-journalist-murder-trial-peter-madsen-submarine-inventor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T23:05:05Z","webTitle":"‘Everyone is following it’: millions gripped by Kim Wall murder trial as verdict nears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/21/verdict-due-kim-wall-swedish-journalist-murder-trial-peter-madsen-submarine-inventor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/21/verdict-due-kim-wall-swedish-journalist-murder-trial-peter-madsen-submarine-inventor","fields":{"headline":"‘Everyone is following it’: millions gripped by Kim Wall murder trial as verdict nears","bodyText":"Just a few hours before embarking on his fateful submarine trip with Swedish journalist Kim Wall, Peter Madsen worried that he lacked the self-control to face a murder trial. “He talked about how he needed to learn to shut up because he had difficulty keeping things to himself,” Australian documentary maker Emma Sullivan told the Copenhagen district court last month, referring to an interview she filmed that summer afternoon with the Danish rocket and submarine builder. If he were, for instance, to become the main suspect for the murder of his neighbour’s wife, he speculated he would find it hard to keep quiet, even though he knew he was entitled not to comment, and that anything he said was likely to be used against him. When Danish prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen sums up the first 10 days of Madsen’s trial for murdering Wall on Monday, the 47-year-old is likely to discover how right he was in that self-assessment. The first thing he said in court when the trial began at the start of last month, after denying that he murdered Wall, appeared to reveal the “narcissistic traits” forensic psychiatrists had identified. “There is nothing worse that can happen to a person like me,” he said of the gruesome death and dismemberment of the talented 30-year-old journalist. “The moment Kim Wall died, there was nothing left for me to fight for.” The case has gripped Denmark and Sweden, with at least six newspapers and broadcasters live-blogging every minute of the trial. “Everyone follows it,” says Anna Gottschalk, who covered the trial most days for the Berlingske newspaper. “It doesn’t matter if you’re at a café or a family birthday, everyone knows this case.” The interest has also been international. The court had to open a special room with a video link to accommodate more than 115 journalists from 15 countries, drawn by the unusual suspect, with his rocket-building projects, and the macabre circumstances of Wall’s death on his submarine. Buch-Jepsen believes Madsen strangled or beheaded Wall after torturing her to fulfil a violent sexual fantasy. The prosecutor read out and played a selection of more than 140 clips or links showing murder, torture, beheading and the sexual torture of women that were found by police on Madsen’s computer, hard drives and among the reconstructed contents of his iPhone. The night before Wall’s death, he Googled “beheading” and “girl”, and then watched a video of a girl having her throat slit. But when Madsen gave his own account of how Wall died from asphyxiation after an accident caused the submarine to fill with exhaust fumes, he was so plausible that it was easy to see how he had convinced so many people that he could launch a manned space mission from a rusty hangar in a disused Copenhagen shipyard. When Buch-Jepsen read part of a text found on one of Madsen’s hard drives about torturing women with skewers, the defendant maintained it was no different from a horror film. “Of course it’s crazy,” Madsen said, ignoring the chilling parallels between the content and the wounds on Wall’s body. “It’s as crazy as the movie you’ve seen, Seven. It’s the same as films you’ve seen, Jakob.” Cross-examined on how and why he cut off Wall’s arms, legs and head, Madsen initially appeared subdued, calling it “a very, very traumatic event, which I do not want to describe”. Eventually he admitted he had no idea why it had been necessary to cut off Wall’s head to remove her body from the submarine. Kim Winther, an expert witness from the Danish Technological Institute, had told the court that Madsen’s account of the accident was technically “plausible”, and questioned the claim made by a submarine expert that traces of carbon monoxide or soot would necessarily have been found in the submarine and its filters if his account was true. The fact that forensic pathologists have been unable to determine the exact time or cause of Wall’s death could also be a problem for the prosecution. However, Mette Grith Stage, who has defended some of Denmark’s most high-profile murderers, told the Observer that the defence faced “an uphill struggle”. “It doesn’t make it any easier when he has all this material on his computer,” she said. The forensic pathologist found no signs of carbon monoxide poisoning on Wall’s body, and determined that some of her wounds were inflicted when she was alive, or very shortly after death, rather than many hours later, as Madsen claims. The biggest problem for the defence, Stage said, was Madsen’s own shifting testimony, which has moved from a claim that he dropped Wall on land alive, to saying that she died when a heavy hatch fell on her head, to saying she died of asphyxiation. “In a case like this where you don’t have any witnesses, it’s very important that the defendant is trustworthy, and he was in the beginning,” Stage said. “But every time the police came up with something new, he had to make a new explanation, and this has happened so many times that he’s not trustworthy any more.” The verdict is due on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/27/rbs-profits-treble-792m-first-quarter-costs-fall","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T09:39:29Z","webTitle":"RBS profits treble to £792m in first quarter as costs fall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/27/rbs-profits-treble-792m-first-quarter-costs-fall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/27/rbs-profits-treble-792m-first-quarter-costs-fall","fields":{"headline":"RBS profits treble to £792m in first quarter as costs fall","bodyText":"Profits at Royal Bank of Scotland more than trebled in the first three months of 2018, easily beating expectations as income rose and costs fell. The bailed-out bank, which is still majority owned by UK taxpayers reported first-quarter profits of £792m, compared with £259m for the same period last year. RBS made a bigger profit in the first three months than for the whole of 2017, when it posted its first annual profit in a decade at £752m. However, the bank is braced for a multibillion-pound fine from US regulators, which will ultimately weigh on the bank’s financial position. It is not clear when the US Department of Justice will conclude its investigation into RBS, involving the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. “This is a good set of results showing the progress we are making, despite a more competitive market,” said Ross McEwan, the bank’s chief executive. “Income is up, costs are down and we’ve maintained capital strength.” The bank’s operating costs between January and March were 18% or £442m lower than the same period in 2017. RBS said the trend towards greater internet and mobile banking continued in the the first quarter. About 5.75 million customers regularly use the bank’s mobile app, up by a fifth compared with the first quarter last year. At the same time, customer visits to branches continued to fall. Branch counter transactions were down by about 7%, while cheque usage fell by 17%. The Federation of Small Businesses said RBS’s ongoing programme of branch closures would hurt small firms and vulnerable customers. “With RBS’s finances improving, it’s disappointing to see the majority taxpayer-owned bank continuing to reduce in-person support for the public,” said Mike Cherry, the FSB national chairman. “Local businesses rely on local bank branches, as do their customers. When a bank branch closes it makes accessing cash that much harder. Less cash flow in a local economy means less growth.” The bank also announced on Friday that Patrick Flynn would join the board from 1 June as a non-executive director.

The FTSE too jumped 80 points to close at 7,502, its highest finish since 31 January. It’s mainly due to the slide in the pound, which pushes up the value of exporters (as their overseas earnings are more valuable). Major multinational firms led the risers, including Burberry (+3%), Unilever (+2.5), and Diageo (+2.2%). European stock markets showed more modest gains, with Germany’s DAX gaining 0.65% and France’s CAC up 0.5%. Markets were also cheered by the remarkable scenes from Korea today, where the leaders of North and South have held talks and even hugged like a couple of old friends. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: The drop in the pound has helped the FTSE 100. The British equity benchmark is internationally focused and the slide in the pound has helped the market hit its highest level since early February. The geopolitical mood is improving after the historic meeting between North and South Korean leaders, as it suggest the two nations are on the road to peace. And that note, it’s time to wrap up. Thanks, and have a good weekend. GW These charts help tell the (unhappy) story of Britain’s economy in the last three months: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says there are three reasons why the UK economy slowed to a near-standstill in the last three months. First, construction had a terrible start to the year, with a drop in output of more than 3%. Without that, growth would have been 0.3%, in line with City forecasts. Activity had been weak in every month, not only in late February and early March, the ONS made clear. Some analysts said the first-quarter collapse of the construction company Carillion, which had knock-on effects to smaller subcontracting firms, had a bigger impact than the weather. Second, the strong performance by manufacturing during 2017 came to an end in early 2018. Factory output was up 1.3% in the final three months of last year but by 0.2% in the latest quarter. A slowdown in the eurozone has led to weaker demand for UK exports but survey evidence suggests that manufacturers have run into capacity constraints following years of underinvestment. Third, the lack of spending power for consumers is having an impact on the service sector, which accounts for around 80% of the economy and grew by only 0.3% in the first quarter. More here: Back in the markets, the pound has hit an eight-week low as traders continue to digest Britain’s alarmingly sharp slowdown. Sterling has shed a cent and a half, to $1.37, its lowest point since the start of March. The pound has also shed one eurocent against the euro, dropping to €1.14. Investors are concluding that an early UK interest rate rise now looks a lot less likely, given the weak growth in the last quarter - and the fact that the poor weather is only partly to blame. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says the UK GDP figures have undermined the pound sharply. Buying sentiment towards the British Pound was dealt a severe blow on Friday, following reports that the U.K economy grew much slower than expected in Q1. U.K GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in the first quarter, much worse than the expected 0.3%, and its weakest since 2012. While the snow had some negative impacts on GDP, the bad weather really can’t bear all the blame - its effects on growth were small. Today’s dismal GDP figures have not only dented confidence in the health of the U.K economy, but also in the Bank of England’s ability to raise interest rates in May. With the Pound notorious for its extreme sensitivity to monetary policy speculation, further downside is likely as investors heavily reduce bets of a rate hike next month. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are teaming up to protect the financial services industry from Brexit risks. Details are sparse, but presumably it will look at the issue of access to the EU by City banks after Brexit, passporting, regulatory equivalence, and the huge number of EU-based derivative contracts owned by UK banks. In a statement, the UK government says: Today, the European Commission and HM Treasury have asked the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to convene a technical working group on risk management in the period around 30 March 2019 in the area of financial services. The European Commission and HM Treasury will attend as observers and other relevant authorities will be invited on an issue-specific basis. This technical work is separate from the on-going negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK and from the negotiations on the overall understanding of the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. In a nutshell.... Here’s Moody’s take on the American growth figures: U.S. GDP growth moderated in the first quarter, but at least part of the slowdown is statistical coming from residual seasonality in the data. Real GDP grew 2.3%, better than expected but below the 2.9% in the fourth quarter and the weakest growth in a year, according to the advanced estimate from the BEA. Growth, though modest, was widespread including investment, consumer spending, trade and government. Imports and durable goods spending were drags. Real disposable income growth accelerated to 3.4% on the back of tax cuts, after rising 1.1% in the fourth quarter. The saving rate jumped to 3.1%, from 2.6% in the fourth quarter. The US GDP report shows that consumer spending, the biggest portion of the American economy, only rose by 1.1% in the last quarter. However, business investment remained solid, and trade boosted growth (having been a drag on growth at the end of last year). Growth in government spending slowed to 1.2%, from 3%, but inventory building by companies added almsost 0.5% to growth. That all added up to a growth rate of 2.3% (if the pattern in Q1 was expanded over the full year) - a little better than expected. Here’s some snap reaction: NEWSFLASH: America’s economy grew much faster than Britain in the first three months of this year. US GDP expanded by almost 0.6% between January and March, or at an ‘annualised rate’ of 2.3%. That beats forecasts of 2.0% annualised growth, but is a little slower than the 2.9% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. More to follow.... We’re about to discover how America’s economy fared in the first three months of this year. But first, here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the disappointing UK growth figures: Britain’s economy slowed to a virtual standstill in the first three months of 2018, the weakest period of activity in more than five years. Office for National Statistics figures showed a sharp contraction in the construction sector, weaker manufacturing growth and a squeeze on consumer spending power contributed to GDP growth of 0.1% in the first quarter. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the economy was strong and that the exceptional weather in late February and early March had been partly to blame for the slowdown. The ONS, however, said the “beast from the east” had been only a minor factor. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “The truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. “It’s clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt.” Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “One week of snow doesn’t explain a decade of weak growth, dismal productivity and falling wages. It’s the avalanche of cuts that has done the long-term damage.” The performance of the economy was much worse than the Bank of England had been expecting and almost certainly puts paid to any chance of an interest rate rise when the monetary policy committee meets early next month. City firm Fathom Consulting reckon there’s an evens chance that Britain suffers two quarters of negative growth this year - the official definition of a recession. In another worrying sign, the ONS says there is a “longer-term weakening” in Britain’s service sector, particularly in “domestic consumer-facing industries”. Here’s a chart showing the details of today’s UK GDP report: TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady blames government cutbacks for Britain’s slowdown: “One week of snow doesn’t explain a decade of weak growth, dismal productivity and falling wages. It’s the avalanche of cuts that has done the long-term damage. “We need to modernise Britain’s infrastructure. The government should set up a National Investment Bank to upgrade roads and rail, and to bring high-speed broadband and clean energy to every part of Britain. “And it’s time to get our public services back up to strength. Schools, hospitals and other vital services are part of Britain’s core economy. If they remain starved of resources, the rest of the economy will continue to struggle too.” The Evening Standard (edited by former chancellor-turned-newspaper editor George Osborne) has pinned the blame firmly on Brexit: The latest figures out today show gross domestic product grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of this year. There’s been a sharp fall in construction, manufacturing barely grew and the consumer is squeezed by higher inflation. All this against the backdrop of a world economy that, by contrast, is going gangbusters. Two years ago, Britain was the fastest growing of the major Western economies. Then the country voted to leave the EU, and the Government said we would also leave the single market and customs union. Now we are the slowest growing of the major Western economies. Draw your own conclusions. Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, says Britain is still ‘Tiggerish’ despite the slowdown (referencing a line from chancellor Hammond’s budget speech) Today’s figures also show that Britain’s economy has only expanded by 1.2% in the last year. That’s much slower than average, illustrating how growth has slowed in recent quarters. Professor Costas Milas and Dr Mike Ellington of the University of Liverpool argue that such weak growth “kills the case” for the Bank of England raising UK interest rates next month. How likely is for this first GDP estimate to be revised upwards? Our database suggests that since 2006, the ONS has produced a first annual GDP growth reading which has on average been only 0.11 percentage points lower than the revised one. Therefore, if history repeats itself, the revised GDP growth reading will be only slightly higher at 1.2%+0.11%=1.31% which is equally disappointing! MPC members cannot, and will not, ignore the fact that the latest data for GDP growth and inflation are substantially weaker than their most recent predictions. Annual GDP growth of 1.2% is far below their forecast in February 2018 that suggested 1.65% was the most likely outcome for the first quarter of 2018. Likewise, the figure for 2018Q1 CPI inflation, of 2.7%, is also far lower than their prediction of 2.92% reported in February 2018. Theresa May’s official spokesman has opined: Alfie Stirling, Head of Economics at the New Economics Foundation, makes an important point - the link between wages and economic growth has frayed badly since the financial crisis: “Today’s GDP estimates from the Office for National Statistics are again disappointing, and fall far short of what would be expected from a healthy economy. “But worse still is that GDP growth of any kind is no longer leading to higher real wages. Since 2010, GDP growth has become ‘decoupled’ from growth in pay with the latest estimates showing that total pay in February was the lowest monthly level seen for 2 years. “This grim phenomenon is unique, both to the community of major economies and to the UK’s own historical record. It points to an economic model that is no longer working for people.” Danielle Haralambous, UK analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, isn’t buying the ‘snow excuse’ either. She says: Growth was surprisingly soft in the first quarter of 2018, even lower than our expectation, which factored in the impact of bad weather in February-March. This hit output in the construction sector particularly hard, but there is more to the story than snow, and the slowdown will be a big consideration in the Bank of England’s deliberations next month. Ivan Petrella, associate professor at Warwick Business School, says the UK economy is showing signs of weakness - and Brexit may well be to blame. Today’s GDP number confirms a recent trend of slow growth and a weakening economy. “One is tempted to attribute a large part of that to uncertainty following the Brexit referendum. In fact, after the initial boost to growth associated to the fall of the pound, the UK economy considerably under-performed with respect to its European partners last year and shows all the signs of heading for the same trend this year. Here’s Rob Kent-Smith of the Office for National Statistics on Britain’s shock slowdown: “Our initial estimate shows the UK economy growing at its slowest pace in more than five years, with weaker manufacturing growth, subdued consumer-facing industries and construction output falling significantly. “While the snow had some impact on the economy, particularly in construction and some areas of retail, its overall effect was limited with the bad weather actually boosting energy supply and online sales.” John McDonnell MP, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor, says Philip Hammond should blame his own government, not the weather, for Britain’s alarmingly weak growth this year. McDonnell argues that the UK urgently needs fresh investment: “Today’s disappointing GDP figures further confirm that continued Tory austerity cuts are weakening growth. “The Chancellor will want to blame this all on a bit of bad weather, but the ONS say this had a limited impact. The truth is that the last eight years of Tory economic failure has allowed our economy to be left exposed. “This is the weakest Q1 growth since 2012. It’s clear to everyone except Philip Hammond that our economy is in need of increased investment and working families are struggling with the cost of living and the burden of increasing household debt. “The next Labour government will end austerity and provide the investment vitally needed to kick-start the economy to deliver rising living standards for the many, not the few.” UK chancellor Philip Hammond has blamed the ‘Beast from the East” for Britain’s weak growth, saying that “exceptional” bad weather had some impact. One problem, chancellor.... the Office for National Statistics says the snow only had a “generally small” impact. According to the ONS, Britain’s services industries were “broadly unaffected” by the bad weather, while there is “no evidence to show that the fall in the manufacturing growth was due to the effects of the snow.” Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, says Britain’s GDP figures are “particularly disappointing”. Growth has slowed much more sharply expected, and he singles out Britain’s exit from the EU as a factor: “The icy weather slowed industrial deliveries, grounded construction projects, and pushed consumers off the high-street, so some cooling was expected. But it clear that some further underlying weakness persists in the economy. “It should hopefully bounce back this quarter. Some of the business activity lost due to the snow will be recovered over the coming months, leading to a rebound in the figures. Consumer spending power will also be bolstered by the fall in inflation. “But, the bigger picture remains one of a safe but sluggish economy. Confidence amongst business leaders, whilst no longer outright pessimistic, remains very much on the fence, and that is largely a result of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the precise nature of Brexit. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says Britain’s economy is suffering from political paralysis. “Sadly, the latest GDP figures confirm what we have been saying for some time: the UK is stuck in the global growth slow lane, while other countries race ahead. “Westminster politicians need to start focusing their attention on a much stronger, more proactive drive to boost growth and investment. While the ‘Beast from the East’ clearly had an impact in the first quarter, the underlying slow-growth trend is real cause for concern. Marshall adds that Britain’s “faltering infrastructure, a training system in chaos and patchy digital connectivity” are all holding the economy back. Most worryingly, Britain’s economy has actually shrunk - once you adjust for population increases. Although gross domestic product has risen by a meagre 0.1% in the last three months, it contracted by 0.1% on a per-capita basis. The ONS is adamant that this slowdown can’t just be blamed on the icy weather that blasted Britain over the winter: There were gasps on the City’s trading floors (and in at least one newsroom) when the unexpectedly weak UK growth figures were released. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, says the slowdown in growth caused “a sharp intake of breath”. 0.1% is the lowest quarter on quarter growth since Q4 2012 with particular weakness seen in construction and services sectors – sectors worth over 80% of the UK economy. There are some caveats within this number of course; it is only the advance reading and therefore subject to revision and the poor weather that the UK suffered will have had a large effect on demand, particularly private consumption. That being said, March’s numbers were horrific, are unlikely to be part of the sample yet and any revision to this advance number could easily be lower as opposed to higher.” “It’s not just UK voters who could call themselves the JAMs – Just About Managing - it now seems that the wider UK economy is in that predicament too.” Marc Brütsch, chief economist at insurance group Swiss Life, says the UK economy failed to hit expectations: Economist Howard Archer also fears that the economy is weakening: Sterling is tumbling as City traders react to the news that the UK economy barely grew in the last three months. The pound has lost a whole cent against the US dollar to $1.3815, its lowest level since 9 March. Investors are wagering that the Bank of England will be reluctant to raise interest rates next month, when the UK economy looks so fragile. The Office for National Statistics reports that Britain’s construction sector shrank sharply in the last three months, dragging the UK growth rate down to just 0.1%. The ONS says: UK GDP growth was the slowest since Quarter 4 2012, with construction being the largest downward pull on GDP, falling by 3.3%. Production increased by 0.7%, with manufacturing growth slowing to 0.2%; slowing manufacturing was partially offset by an increase in energy production due to the below-average temperatures. The services industries were the largest contributor to GDP growth, increasing by 0.3% in Quarter 1 2018, although the longer-term trend continues to show a weakening in services growth. While some impacts on GDP from the snow in the first quarter of 2018 have been recorded for construction and retail sales, the effects were generally small, with very little impact observed in other areas of the economy. BREAKING! UK economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of 2018, with GDP rising by just 0.1%. That’s the weakest quarterly growth since the last three months of 2012, and a worse result than expected. More to follow.... Tensions is building as the City prepares for the first estimate of UK GDP to be released, in just three minutes... Economist Catherine Colebrook has written about the shortcomings with GDP in the Guardian today. She says it fails to measure whether poverty is being reduced, whether the environment is being protected, or if people are happier (themes that Bobby Kennedy picked up in 1968). She explains: If we want to understand whether the economy is really delivering for its citizens, we need some new indicators. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), where I am the chief economist, is proposing a dashboard of five outcome indicators, to be updated annually, which would directly measure our progress against the outcomes the public wants the economy to deliver – broadly shared prosperity, justice and sustainability. Our chosen indicators are the distribution of the gains from growth; poverty rates among children and adults; levels of wellbeing among individuals at different income levels; the gap between the median income of the poorest region of the UK and the richest; and the gap between projected carbon emissions and the cost-effective path to decarbonisation. Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce is also expecting a UK slowdown.... Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, says there’s a risk that Britain’s growth rate slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year, to below the City forecast of 0.3%. If so, that would cut the chances that the Bank of England raises interest rates next month. It’s now 50 years since Robert F. Kennedy gave his now-famous speech explaining why gross domestic product is a flawed measure that tracks “everything, except that which makes life worthwhile”. Here’s a Youtube clip of the speech, given to the University of Kansas in March 1968, three months before Kennedy’s assassination. As Kennedy brilliantly put it: It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman’s rifle and Speck’s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. The UK Treasury have created a short video explaining GDP: Sylvia Walter, senior economist at insurance company Swiss Life, says the French government shouldn’t panic about the slowdown: Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the current rolling strikes on France’s railways will hurt growth this quarter. Bloomberg’s Marcus Bensasson says bad weather hurt the French manufacturing sector: France’s economy saw growth slow sharply in the first quarter as winter storms ripped through the country, hitting factory production. Gross domestic product expanded 0.3 percent, the weakest in more than a year and less than half the 0.7 percent pace recorded in the previous three months. It’s also slightly below the 0.4 percent estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Just in: Spain’s economy has posted another quarter of solid growth. Spanish GDP rose by 0.7% during the first three months of this year, official figures show. That means Spain has grown by 0.7% per quarter for nine months in a row. The annual growth rate dipped slightly, to 2.9% from 3.1%, but is still fairly strong. Bad weather, falling business investment and weaker export growth have combined to slow the French economy. Statistics firm INSEE explains that a series of factors meant French growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last three months, from a bouncy 0.7% in the last three months of 2017. According to INSEE: French household consumption rose by 0.2%, the same as three months earlier Business investment (gross fixed capital formation) dropped to +0.6%, from +1.1% Exports fell by 0.1%, having risen by 2.5% in October-December. Manufacturing production shrank by 1.1%, compared with 1.5% growth previously That all adds up to a chunky slowdown - economists had expected growth to slow to +0.4%. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, says it’s a poor - but not catastrophic - result, adding: [Annual] Growth of above 2.5 per cent in the second half of 2017 was never going to be sustained for long, and one-off factors such as weather also likely dented consumers’ spending in Q1. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a major healthcheck on the global economy with new growth figures for Britain, the United States, France and Spain. Economists predict they will show a slowdown on both sides of the Atlantic in the first three months of this year, as bad weather and worries over trade wars hit growth. In the UK, quarterly growth is tipped to fall to 0.3%, from 0.4% in October-December. That would be rather weak performance in historical terms., below the country’s long-term trend growth rate. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada thinks Britain could have suffered an even sharper slowdown, given the bitter weather that gripped the country this winter. Q1 GDP is out today, but will likely be affected to the severe weather conditions in the quarter. Our economists are in line with consensus (0.3% q/q), but markets would probably be tolerant of a downside miss in particular, given the weather-related uncertainty. US growth is also expected to have slowed, from around 0.7% to 0.5% on a quarterly basis. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says the American growth figures will be closely scrutinised by investors. Economic growth in the first quarter is forecast to have slowed to 2% on an annualised basis, down from 2.9%, as consumers spending braked sharply. This is expected to more of a bump in the road rather than the start of a full on change in direction for the US economy, which remains supported by a tightening labour market and sizeable tax cut. And we’ve just learned that French growth rate slowed sharply, to just 0.3% from 0.7% in the previous quarter. That appears to confirm fears that the eurozone is slowing, after a strong 2017 (more in a moment).

We spent 48 hours analysing whether Scott Morrison was or wasn’t Santa Claus because the Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, in a fit of new-boy ebullience, had gushed about his Liberal colleague, characterising him as “Scott ‘Santa Claus’ Morrison” poised to sail forth on budget night with a sack laden with “goodies”. • Sign up to receive the latest news in Australian politics every weekday Not so, harrumphed the non-plussed treasurer. This would be a serious budget, delivered by serious people. Hashtag serious. Hashtag shut up new boy, the grown-ups are talking. Poor old McCormack, mildly shell-shocked, was dispatched to the naughty corner to ponder his thought crimes. Just a hop skip and a jump later, the artist formerly known as Santa Claus confirmed that a proposed tax increase (worth $8.2bn) that the Coalition had spent 12 months insisting was necessary to help fund the national disability insurance scheme wasn’t actually necessary at all. Deep economy magic had kicked in. Tax receipts were up, and up sufficiently for the Coalition to abandon its proposed 0.5% hike in the Medicare levy. Ho ho ho. Meeerrryyy Christmas. Sorry, I will stop this soon. The why of this story is fairly simple. The Coalition wants to deliver income tax cuts in the budget on 8 May. It wants to offer a fistful of dollars (reportedly with a slow start and baked in for a decade according to doubtless well-sourced speculation) because the government has to assume this coming budget is an election budget. No one knows whether there will be another economic statement before we stagger off to the polls. We are in use-it-or-lose-it territory, and everyone knows it. A fistful of dollars, even a modest one, is a straightforward political story. It’s best told without complications. One complication was the proposed Medicare levy increase, which hit all workers earning more than $21,000. If it stood, the government would be giving with one hand, and taking away with the other. Given Labor had spent a solid 12 months seeding that very argument, neutralising it was a priority. So bye-bye levy increase. A couple of news cycles worth of confusion sparked by how the NDIS could have had a funding shortfall serious enough to warrant a structural fix, then not have one because everything is suddenly fine, would have seemed a small price to pay, given the larger objective. Flexibility in politics tends to correlate with adversity. The Coalition has been behind in the polls since it almost lost the last federal election. Despite its significant collective talent for political misjudgment and self-sabotage, the government thinks that, with the right reset, it can remain in the fight. That is certainly possible. Politics is a dynamic business as we all know, and given how stagnant wages growth has been, and how inflation keeps nudging people into higher tax brackets, any hip-pocket relief will doubtless be welcome in households around the country. But there are a couple of obvious wrinkles with project reset. Central to the mission is the compare-and-contrast fight the Coalition wants to have with its opponents. The government wants to sharpen the differences with the ALP. It wants, as Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday, perhaps more in hope than in certainty, the next election to be a “very, very stark choice”. But it’s a bit hard to punch on with your political opponent, heaping soundbite upon soundbite, if they point-blank refuse to enter your chosen arena. Labor has been happy to defend its progressive tax measures unveiled during this period of opposition, and will either match the coming personal tax cuts, or craft a comparable package of its own. That’s currently the safest bet in Canberra. Labor has been working to create fiscal room. There another potential quirk here when it comes to emphasising points of difference. While no meaningful judgment can be made until we see the final numbers on 8 May, and Labor’s ultimate riposte, it’s possible that under the cover of “very, very stark” differences, the fiscal stories of the major parties are also beginning to converge. At the last election contest, there was a $16bn deficit gap between the Coalition and Labor over the forward estimates. Labor’s medium-term picture was healthier because of policies like negative gearing and capital gains tax reforms, but their four-year cycle was a complete blow out. The Coalition pursuing its own reset, doing things like dumping a revenue measure forecast to raise $8.2bn, potentially helps to narrow the fiscal gap over the forward estimates, which helps Labor tell a more positive economic management story over the short as well as the medium term. There would be another way for the Coalition to approach its current political difficulties of course, other than lobbing the obvious fistful of dollars pre-election budget, and that would be to dig deep, and chart a budget course quantifiably different from the cycles of the past. Instead of waiting for the economic tide to turn, and then spending the proceeds – a zero-sum Canberra game Australians are entirely familiar with – there could be some thought given to a different approach. Some in the government would argue that Tony Abbott tried to chart a different course back in the halcyon days of the budget emergency and the debt and deficit disaster (what a time that was) and look how that one panned out – but that’s rather missing the point. The first Abbott budget was a dog because it was disgracefully and indefensibly unfair, and it broke a bunch of election promises, not because it pursued the objective of budget sustainability per se. What’s been lacking in the story of the Turnbull government all along has been a clear sense of what the government stands for, and a steady projection of where it sees Australia a decade from now. Mostly we get patch up jobs and crisis management in between bouts of open warfare – not a national project with some coherence that voters can identify with and buy into in an age where cynicism and disaffection is rife, and people are losing trust in institutions. The lack of trust in the system becomes a vicious cycle, where it becomes harder and harder for governments to pursue any meaningful reform in the national interest that involves creating winners and losers. This is an existential problem for politics, and too often this government is entirely tone deaf about it. It’s been a long time since any budget has saved a government, and that line of thinking is one of the more vacuous lines of punditry doing the rounds, but it is possible to use an economic statement to tell a story about yourself as a government, and a story about the direction of the country, that more or less makes sense, and is more or less focused on the needs of ordinary people as opposed to the revered “base”, or the rent seekers, or the institutional interests, or the incoherent pumped up ranters in the disrupted and caterwauling media. Thus far, the Coalition’s record in that regard has been less than stellar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2018/apr/27/banking-royal-commission-financial-advice-groups-under-microscope-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T07:02:25Z","webTitle":"Banking royal commission: Westpac, AMP and CBA may have breached Corporations Act – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/apr/27/banking-royal-commission-financial-advice-groups-under-microscope-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2018/apr/27/banking-royal-commission-financial-advice-groups-under-microscope-live","fields":{"headline":"Banking royal commission: Westpac, AMP and CBA may have breached Corporations Act – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re all finished here. After two weeks of shocking revelations out of the financial industry, today’s hearing culminated in the counsel assisting the commission recommending criminal charges against AMP and the financial planning firm Henderson Maxwell. Here are the key takeouts: The senior counsel assisting, Rowena Orr, has told the commissioner, Ken Hayne, that it is open to find that AMP breached the Corporations Act by making “material” and “deliberate” attempts to mislead Asic about the “extent and nature” of the ongoing fee for no service conduct Orr also said Henderson Maxwell, the firm of celebrity financial advisor Sam Henderson, could face charges over information supplied in a financial document Henderson’s advice to FWC Donna McKenna might amount to misconduct under the Act, with Orr saying he may have breached his obligation to act in his client’s best interest and to give priority to her over his own interests. Orr has also recommended that AMP be charged for breaching Section 64 of the Asic Act, which is a criminal offence She has also found that it is open to the commission to find that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia breached obligations under the Corporations Act by not reporting fees for no service issues to Asic for two years She says it would be open for the commission to find that CBA’s Colonial First State breached the Corporations Act by charging investment platform fees inappropriately Earlier, it was heard that Asic had taken just one criminal action against any licensee in 10 years - that was in 2010 Turning to Dover Financial and to Terry McMaster – who collapsed while giving evidence on Thursday – Orr says the three cases examined leave it open to the commission to find that the firm engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in connection with the client protection policy and in failing to comply with financial services laws under the Corporations Act. Henderson Maxwell - the firm of the celebrity financial adviser Sam Henderson, which gave deeply flawed superannuation advice to a fair work commissioner – has been recommended for criminal charges. Henderson advised Donna McKenna to roll her public sector super fund into a self-managed super fund to be managed by the firm. It would have given Henderson’s firm thousands of dollars in fees. But the advice would also have cost McKenna $500,000 for withdrawing early from one of her public sector super funds. Orr says the firm may have committed an offence under the Corporations Act by issuing a defective financial services guide. Henderson’s conduct might amount to misconduct, breaching his obligation to act in the best interests of Ms McKenna and to give priority to her over his own interests. The firm also breached community standards by allowing its employee to impersonate Ms McKenna on five occasions, and Mr Henderson’s failure to assist the FPA and his personal criticism of Ms McKenna during the FPA’s investigation. Orr tells the commission it could make multiple findings of breaches under the Corporations Act against AMP in relation to the conduct of its financial advisers and against the advisers themselves. In one instance, she says there has been a “culture of emphasising the growth of the business over ensuring advisers are appropriately qualified”. We’re on to the conduct of three AMP advisers. You can read our report on what the commission heard earlier this week here: Orr says ANZ accepted high risk in its wealth arm for years without doing anything to reduce it. She also says it placed a low priority on remediation of the problems of customers who were mistreated by the bank’s advisers. Orr finds that three financial advisers employed by ANZ, as well as two of its advice groups, RI Advice and Millennium 3, may have breached the Corporations Act in relation to financial advice given to clients. She said one of the advisers – a Mr A – may also have breached provisions in the Asic Act not to engage in conduct that is misleading, deceptive or likely to deceive. We’re now moving on to financial advice provided by ANZ and its associated entities. Orr has also posed the following questions: Do the remuneration and incentive policies that reward advisers for revenue generation create an unacceptable risk that they will prioritise revenue over their obligation to act in the best interests of the customer? How can companies incentivise good quality advice where the best advice is to do nothing? How can companies ensure audits are escalated when appropriate? We’ve returned from the break. The senior counsel assisting, Rowena Orr, has immediately told the commission that it is open to find that Westpac may have breached its obligations under the Corporations Act in relation to two of its financial advisers. Orr says it is open to commissioner Hayne to find that the conduct of two of Westpac’s financial advisers might amount to misconduct, and that Westpac conceded as much in its evidence. She said it was open to the commission to find the two advisers may have breached their statutory obligations under the Corporations Act to act in the best interest of clients and to provide appropriate advice to them. Orr also said Westpac’s conduct in the period when both men provided the advice might amount to misconduct. She says Westpac may have breached obligations under the Corporations Act to ensure advice provided by the advisers was efficient, honest and fair, and to take reasonable steps to ensure its financial representatives complied with the Corporations Act. Wesptac may also have breached its statutory obligation to report significant breaches to Asic within 10 business days. She pointed out that at the relevant period, Westpac’s variable renumeration scheme “directly incentivised the generation of revenue”. “Westpac had a system of renumeration for employed financial advisers which incentivised revenue generation and created a risk [that] customers would not be provided with financial advice in the best interests of its customers. Well, we’ve very abruptly stopped for lunch. Orr was outlining the evidence heard in relation to inappropriate advice and conduct by financial planners, specifically the conduct of Westpac advisers. You can read more about what the commission heard about the advice last week here. Here’s what we’ve heard in a stunning session so far: The senior counsel assisting, Rowena Orr, has told the commissioner, Ken Hayne, that it is open to find that AMP breached the Corporations Act by making “material” and “deliberate” attempts to mislead Asic about the “extent and nature” of the ongoing fee for no service conduct Orr has also recommended that AMP be charged for breaching Section 64 of the Asic Act, which is a criminal offence She has also found that it is open to the commission to find that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia breached obligations under the Corporations Act by not reporting fees for no service issues to Asic for two years She says it would be open for the commission to find that CBA’s Colonial First State breached the Corporations Act by charging investment platform fees inappropriately Earlier, it was heard that Asic had taken just one criminal action against any licensee in 10 years - that was in 2010 As Orr continues laying out her recommendations to the commission, there’s a mea culpa from the financial services minister, Kelly O’Dwyer. O’Dwyer held a trainwreck interview on the ABC’s Insiders program last weekend, defending the government’s delay, but now concedes the government got the timing wrong. “With the benefit of hindsight, we should have called it earlier. I am sorry we didn’t, and I regret not saying this when asked earlier this week,” she told a self-managed super fund conference in Melbourne on Friday. Orr has summarised evidence in relation to so-called platform fees. Her advice is that it is open to the commission to find that Colonial First State may have breached its obligations under the Corporations Act to have in place adequate arrangements for the management of conflicts of interest that may arise in relation to the provision of financial services. She says it is open to the commission to find that Colonial First State preferred its own interests and that of its related entities – CBA’s related advice licensees – to the interest of those who invested in its financial products. She asks these questions about platforms: - does vertical integration of platform operators with advice licences serve the interests of clients? If so how? - why should platform operators get an asset-based fee from fund managers if it’s not passed on to clients? - if platform operators continue to deduct advice fees, why should they not be required to ascertain that there is a lawful entitlement to the fees? On to the Commonwealth Bank. Orr says CBA’s culture had been aimed at “maximising revenue streams” rather than providing meaningful advice to its clients. She says it is open to the commission to find that CBA managers were aware for 18 months before Asic was told clients were being charged fees for no service. Orr says there was a “cultural tolerance” of risks and of “conduct detrimental to clients but to the financial advantage of CBA”. Orr says it is also open to the commission to find that AMP breached the Corporations Act for describing a Clayton Utz report as independent. She says the conduct is “at least inaccurate if not misleading”. She says changes to the Clayton Utz report by AMP’s general counsel Brian Salter appeared, “on their face”, to be intended to limit the findings about the knowledge of senior executives about the misconduct. Orr outlines interventions by Mr Salter and the AMP chairwoman, Catherine Brenner. She says it is open to the commission to attribute this misconduct to the culture at the top of the company. We’re hearing that AMP may have breached the Corporations Act by making “material” and “deliberate” attempts to mislead Asic about the “extent and nature” of the fee for no service conduct. Orr says that senior managers at AMP were aware that the conduct was a breach of their obligations but continued to do so, despite warnings from junior employees. She says that between 2013 and 2015, AMP made 20 false or misleading statements to Asic, which may have breached the Corporations Act. She says it is open to the commission to find that the statements were material because they were likely to “affect and appear intended to affect the manner in which Asic went about investigating the conduct”. Orr says that on the evidence, it is open to the royal commission to find that the charging clients fees for no service by AMP and its advice licensees “might have amounted to misconduct”. In particular, by contravening their statutory obligation to do “all things necessary” to ensure financial services were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly by contravening the obligation to have adequate risk systems in place and by contravening their obligation to report misconduct to Asic within 10 days. Orr says AMP’s head of financial advice, Jack Regan, accepted under questioning that there was “no lawful basis” for the conduct. She says Regan conceded the conduct was “unlawful, and ethnically and morally wrong”. He accepted that unless there was a customer complaint, the only way AMP could detect misconduct was through audits, which, Orr says, it did not undertake consistently and regularly. Orr begins on evidence of fees for no service by AMP. She says AMP charged fees to clients “in circumstances where they did not and could not provide services to the clients for those fees”. Asic first became aware of the issue on 15 January 2009. The breach first occurred in 2007 and AMP first became aware of it in 2008. But Orr says the practice continued for years after it was first reported to Asic. She says the commission heard evidence that the application of fees for no service continued until at least January 2017. Orr’s opening gambit lays out what we’re in for: Over the last two weeks the commission has heard evidence of misconduct, and of conduct falling below community standards and expectations in relation to the provision of financial advice by employees and authorised representatives of financial service entities. Here’s the roll call of issues: fees being charged for no service, platform fees, inappropriate advice, improper conduct and the financial services disciplinary regime. Orr proposes to lay out each of the case studies that have been the subject of evidence in turn, and to identify findings that counsel believes are open to the commission. Orr is now up, about to begin her closing statement, which will wrap up the last two weeks of evidence. Steele concludes and now Orr is up entering a great raft of documents into evidence. They all appear to relate to what we’ve heard about AMP’s fee for no service scandal. The evidence includes emails between Brian Salter from AMP and Asic representatives and Clayton Utz. Steele asks Macaulay how often Asic takes criminal action against individual financial advisers. “Very frequently,” she responds, in cases of fraud or serious dishonesty cases. In 2015, Asic asked the big financial institutions to provide it with information about advisers it suspected of serious compliance breaches. The five big institutions reported about 147 cases. Of those, Macaulay says Asic was still working through about 60 cases. However, she says, most of the 2015 advice “is now somewhat old”. Mark Steele, SC, counsel for Asic is now questioning Macaulay. He’s taking her to the limitations of Asic’s powers, asking her to clarify, for example, the extent to which licensees share information with the regulator about the details of serious misconduct by advisers. Not often, she says. Licensees often claim legal professional privilege to avoid handing over the results of internal investigations about advisers. Asic has taken on only six civil penalty proceedings against licensees since 2013. Four of them were commenced this year. Orr wants to know why. “You can only use civil penalty proceedings to address conduct that occurred after [2013] so there needs to be a period in which the conduct occurred,” Macaulay responds. She said the civil actions were taken against “egregious conduct which needed to be dealt with by way of a significant response”. Some of the proceedings included injunctions to stop the conduct occurring. Orr concludes her examination. Asic has taken just one criminal action against any licensee in 10 years - that was in 2010. “We’d usually look at the conduct of the individuals who were behind that licensee,” explains Macaulay. “The consequence of a criminal finding against a corporate entity is that there would be a fine imposed. We generally address the motivating minds of the corporation and their conduct ... and take criminal proceedings against the individuals.” The two entities suspended were solely because of giving poor financial advice. They were suspended for six and eight weeks respectively, resulting in the advisers being unable to provide advice during that period. But Macaulay’s understanding – for which she says she has no evidence – is that the advisers would have gone and used the licence of another licensee, either individually or en masse, to keep working. One of the suspended entities held a second licence, so they all just used that during the suspension period. Macaulay concedes the suspension had no practical effect. There are “a range of powers” to take action against licensees for breaches of general obligations, says Macaulay. Civil proceedings, revocation or restrictions on licenses, for example. Seeking to remove a license is a “difficult process”, she says. It has succeeded once, and on two other occasions they have gained suspensions, under section 912A. Orr asks if the movement of advisers who have engaged in misconduct between financial licensees is a problem for the industry. “Yes.” 95% of licensees are not members of the ABA and there is no obligation to share information about planners under ABA protocols, says Macaulay. Even within theABA, there are questions about how effective the protocols are. Macaulay is asked why the FPA and AFA aren’t proscribed disciplinary bodies. She doesn’t know. Asic has no power to direct licensees to take corrective action, but has recommended it be given the power. The federal government has accepted this in principle but will consider it alongside findings from this royal commission. “Why does Asic negotiate with entities about sanctions?” asks Orr. If an adviser under investigation approaches Asic with “an offer”, they would consider that, Macaulay says. “We would accept an enforceable undertaking if what was offered to us was better than we could get before a delegate. An example of that would be a period out of the industry which we thought was a realistic assessment of what a delegate might decide to impose, plus something else such as ... further education [before re-entering the industry], and pre-vetting of the files.” It takes one to three years to get from a notification of misconduct by an adviser to a banning order from Asic. It takes Asic about two months to a year to commence an investigation, another six to 12 months to get a brief to a delegate, and another five months for a delegate to make a decision about a banning order for misconduct by a financial adviser. Macaulay’s team of 60 receives about three notifications per week. If it’s serious misconduct, it may take longer, Macaulay says. There are also resourcing issues, the length of time for delegates to make decisions on evidence presented, requests for surveillance. If it turns out an adviser is no longer in the industry, then Asic would set the investigation aside and “may” return to it if the adviser re-enters the industry. “Just so I understand the purpose of a banning order is protection of the public,” says Orr. “That’s right,” says Macaulay. “But it might take a couple of years before Asic gets a banning order for that purpose?” “That’s right.” “Is that satisfactory?” “No it’s not.” Orr wants to know what Asic is doing to fix that. Macaulay says resources are part of the issue, but also licensees need to be more prompt in reporting misconduct and providing material. They also try to speed things up where they can, like preparation of briefs. But other elements, like surveillance, take longer if there aren’t enough resources at the time. Louise Macaulay is discussing the lack of resources to investigate every case. She says in her view Asic should only become involved in cases of serious misconduct but she’s not confident Asic is made aware of all of them. Ken Hayne wants to know whether “public denunciation” to call out bad conduct factors into how Asic approaches issues of breaches. “I think you can say it doesn’t at the moment,” she says. “Investigations, surveillances are private, the decision is also private.” Asic is calling for a reversal of a 2003 law change that allowed licensees to subjectively determine if a potential breach was serious enough to be reported. It is proposing that law be returned to an objective test, as well as extending the reporting deadline from 10 days to 30. Macaulay said Asic found the 10-day limit was leading to delays in reporting of potential breaches by licensees who take some time to “form their view”. The 30 days should allow for a licensee’s investigation without missing the deadline. Asic learns of potential misconduct through a number of ways, Louise Macaulay says. reports of misconduct from the public or other advisers notifications under the Corporations Act through surveillance or other sources of market intelligence information from the ombudsman or other associations Asic received 170 reports last financial year, and investigated about 40%. 106 reports were received from financial service organisations, of which 46% were investigated. Investigations are launched based on: the seriousness of the misconduct the impact on consumers the material Asic is provided with the age of the conduct Asic’s strategic priorities of risk areas (for example, currently professionalism and training) The hearing has begun. The commissioner, Ken Hayne, has excused McMaster of further attendance. Hayne says he will consider any request from McMaster in the future to offer further evidence. So we will start with Louise Macaulay, from Asic. Asic’s conflict of interest policies are under the microscope, reports Gareth Hutchens. The Greens have written to request the auditor general investigate the declaration of interest and conflict of interest policies of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The letter says the investigation is necessary after concerns “raised in the media in regards to the potential conflicts of interests between former Asic chairman Greg Medcraft and the, currently stood aside, senior counsel for AMP, Brian Salter”. Hello and welcome to today’s coverage of the royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. Today will continue the second round of hearings into the financial advice industry. Yesterday heard from three witnesses – the chief executives of the Financial Planning Association and the Association of Financial Advisers, and the head of Dover Financial Group, Terry McMaster. McMaster collapsed in the dock yesterday and was taken to hospital. He hadn’t finished his testimony but we haven’t heard if he’s well enough to reappear today, so I’m assuming we’ll begin with Louise Macaulay, senior executive leader of Asic’s financial advisers team. You can read a wrap of yesterday’s hearings here, and below is quick summary of the day’s revelations. McMaster defended the company’s hiring of financial advisers who were under investigation and later sanctioned for serious breaches. McMaster was also questioned over clauses in Dover’s client protection policy, which absolved its advisers of responsibility for bad conduct. Dover appears to have not properly answered a notice to produce documentation from the commission, by supplying a truncated spreadsheet logging when staff reviewed statements of advice, instead of the full information. The spreadsheet contained no names. Dover Financial was the only large-scale financial advice group to decline to assist the royal commission. McMaster advised the company to retain him as a lawyer to review its statements of advice and “add gravitas”. Dante De Gori, the chief executive of the Financial Planning Association, defended the lack of resolution on a March 2017 complaint against the celebrity adviser Sam Henderson. De Gori also defended FPA practices that saw Henderson talk with both the investigator of the complaint and the FPA head of professionalism. The FPA continued to suppress the identities of expelled or suspended members for years after a change to its constitution that ended the standard practice. The FPA asked the royal commission to keep Henderson’s name suppressed to protect its processes and Henderson’s reputation. The FPA budgets the same to the department of the CEO as it does to its professional standards unit, with four staff. Philip Kewin, chief executive of the Association of Financial Advisers, told the commission there could be a tension between promoting the industry and its aim of being a co-regulator. The AFA only suspended a member who was found by Asic to have engaged in misconduct and banned for five years, because it believed it would be relying on “hearsay” unless it did its own investigation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/27/finally-women-are-believed-bill-cosby-guilty-verdict-welcomed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T23:16:10Z","webTitle":"'Finally women are believed': Bill Cosby guilty verdict welcomed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/finally-women-are-believed-bill-cosby-guilty-verdict-welcomed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/27/finally-women-are-believed-bill-cosby-guilty-verdict-welcomed","fields":{"headline":"'Finally women are believed': Bill Cosby guilty verdict welcomed","bodyText":"Gloria Allred, the lawyer who represented many of Bill Cosby accusers, said the guilty verdict against the comedian was a vindication. “We are so happy that finally we can say, women are believed, and not only in a hashtag #MeToo, but also in a court of law,” she said. Other supporters of the #MeToo campaign have also welcomed Cosby’s conviction. Cosby was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former basketball player who was 30 years old at the time. Cosby claimed the two had a consensual relationship. Five women in addition to Constand testified for the prosecution at the trial that Cosby had assaulted them. Cosby did not testify in his own defense. The five women joined a news conference outside the courthouse with Allred. “After all is said and done, women were finally believed, and we thank the jury for that,” Allred said. The actor Rose McGowan, who has made rape allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein, said on Twitter: “Cosby is guilty. I’m sorry if you loved a lie. His victims can now exhale. Thank you judge and jury. Thank you society for waking up.” Mira Sorvino, another Weinstein accuser, said it was “unbelievably amazing news” that Cosby had been convicted. Tarana Burke, cofounder of the #MeToo movement, said the verdict against Cosby made her cry. Actor Jessica Chastain tweeted: “Just because you’re rich and powerful doesn’t mean another person’s body is automatically available for sex. Consent must be given.” Susan Sarandon said: “With Bill Cosby’s guilty verdict I hope these women find some peace and that all those who have not been able to find justice in other instances with other men have hope that they too will be heard.” Filmmaker Seth MacFarlane said: “The Cosby conviction is a resonant reminder that power and influence come with significant responsibility, and must never, ever be abused in an evolved society. Hopefully this is only the first step forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/26/un-syria-donors-conference-trump-under-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T21:46:30Z","webTitle":"Trump administration under fire for not contributing to Syria donors conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/un-syria-donors-conference-trump-under-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/26/un-syria-donors-conference-trump-under-fire","fields":{"headline":"Trump administration under fire for not contributing to Syria donors conference","bodyText":"The Trump administration is under fire for contributing nothing to a Syria donors conference, helping lead to a $5bn shortfall in a UN fund for Syrian civilians in need inside the country and in refugee camps around the region. The unprecedented US failure to contribute anything to the Syria humanitarian fund came soon after Donald Trump called for a rapid withdrawal of US troops from the country, and for wealthy countries in the region to bear more of the financial burden of the Syrian crisis. The US state department said that the US remained the biggest funder of humanitarian efforts over the seven years of the Syrian conflict, with nearly $8bn in total contributions, and will contribute to provide funds. “The United States is committed to being a global leader in providing humanitarian assistance to people forcibly displaced by conflict and persecution around the world,” a state department spokesperson said. “We urge other donors to also step forward to contribute to commit additional resources to this response. The United States has always provided humanitarian assistance in tranches as it is prepared, matched up with programs and partners.” However, aid experts and critics said that contributing nothing at the Syria donors conference in Brussels this week was not the right way to encourage other nations to step up their own contributions. Jeremy Konyndyk, who was head of US foreign disaster assistance in the Obama administration, said that typically the US made aid announcements rather than pledges at donor conferences – so the US declares money already donated or about to be donated, rather than predicting what will be given. “Fundamentally, that means the US is choosing not to announce what it has already given,” Konyndyk, now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. “What this says to me is that they wanted to send a message of US retrenchment and for others to step up. But if you want to send that message it’s much more effective to actually say it. “It’s really counterproductive and misunderstands the nature of international leadership,” Konyndyk said. “The approach the Trump administration is taking is do as I say, not as I do, and that’s not how it works. International leadership is about showing what you are willing to do.” He added that another possibility was that with large number of unfilled positions at the US Agency for International Development and turmoil at the state department, “they just couldn’t manage a process as simple as pulling together a funding announcement”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/26/hannibal-buress-how-a-comedian-reignited-the-bill-cosby-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T21:07:48Z","webTitle":"Hannibal Buress: how a comedian reignited the Bill Cosby allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/hannibal-buress-how-a-comedian-reignited-the-bill-cosby-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/26/hannibal-buress-how-a-comedian-reignited-the-bill-cosby-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Hannibal Buress: how a comedian reignited the Bill Cosby allegations","bodyText":"Allegations of sexual assault had swirled around Bill Cosby for years, but it is the comedian Hannibal Buress who is often credited with helping to put the actor’s treatment of women front and center in public consciousness. Cosby was convicted by a Pennsylvania jury on Thursday of drugging and molesting Andrea Constand in 2004. Dozens of other women have now come forward to say that Cosby sexually assaulted them or attempted to, with some claims dating back as far as the 1960s. But the allegations didn’t stick until 2014, when Buress mocked Cosby as part of a standup routine in Philadelphia. “Bill Cosby has the fuckin’ smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,” Buress said at the time. “He gets on TV, ‘Pull your pants up black people, I was on TV in the ‘80s! I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom!’ Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches.” Buress also asked members of the audience to “Google ‘Bill Cosby rape’” when they got home, joking that it would have a whole lot more results than a search for his name, “Hannibal Buress”. In the following days, the joke went viral, prompting dozens of women to step forward to accuse the star of The Cosby Show of assault. Among them was former radio host Kathy McGee, who told the Hollywood Reporter: “For 40 years, I didn’t say anything because I thought it was just me,” adding she stayed quiet because she thought “nobody would believe me”. In July 2015, New York Magazine dedicated a cover story to 35 women accusing Cosby of assault – and from there, the numbers of accusers grew. He now faces accusations of sexual misconduct from more than 60 women. On Thursday a Pennsylvania jury found Cosby guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, who first reported Cosby’s behavior back in 2004. In 2005, a district attorney declined to bring charges against Cosby, citing “insufficient credible and admissible evidence”. Buress has rejected the notion he played a pivotal role in bringing claims against Cosby to light, telling GQ in 2015: “People are going to put on you whatever they want to put on you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/26/shahid-khan-buying-wembley-would-move-nfl-london-team-step-closer-to-reality","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T19:40:57Z","webTitle":"Khan Wembley deal would move NFL London team step closer to reality | Les Carpenter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/26/shahid-khan-buying-wembley-would-move-nfl-london-team-step-closer-to-reality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/26/shahid-khan-buying-wembley-would-move-nfl-london-team-step-closer-to-reality","fields":{"headline":"Khan Wembley deal would move NFL London team step closer to reality","bodyText":"On the morning Shahid Khan increased his profile in the London sports scene, he sat in the headquarters of the Jacksonville Jaguars and laughed into the phone. It was a great roaring laugh that lingered even as he began to speak. “If you know the NFL, you know you don’t choose them they choose you,” the Jaguars and Fulham owner told the Guardian on Thursday. He was speaking about the elite society of 32 NFL team owners who form one of the most exclusive clubs in sport, overseeing a $14bn operation. Their selectivity in who they allow to buy a franchise is legendary, as evidenced by their famous refusal of Donald Trump’s bid to buy the Buffalo Bills. Each owner must add something to their group – many of whom are part of families that have owned their teams for years. Khan’s, it seems, is in the dual lives he has planted in the US and UK. For more than a decade the NFL has been serious about expanding globally, fearing that while it is the most lucrative league in the world its popularity does not stretch much beyond the US. Several league executives and team owners have told the Guardian in recent years they are committed to seeing whether a franchise could be placed in London full‑time. Given that Khan – who was raised in Pakistan and the US and spends considerable time in London – also owns a precarious NFL franchise with limited resources, he has been viewed as an obvious link to make the NFL’s aspirations come true. The fact he has embraced London, committing the Jags to an annual game at Wembley, has only raised that perception. The announcement of his £500m-plus proposal to buy Wembley stadium immediately sounded alarm bells that he may be looking to move the Jaguars to London, which has become a regular host of NFL games. While he did not make a promise to keep them in Jacksonville, he was quick to say “it is too early” to determine whether an NFL team would work in London full-time. He then added “this is a step to stabilise the Jaguars” in Jacksonville. He said he hopes to have them play a second game each season at Wembley and believes doing so will be key to the team’s success in Florida, which is home to two other NFL franchises. “How do we grow?” the 67-year-old asked. “Most football fans in north-west Florida are not Jaguar fans because they are from somewhere else. We have to work hard to find football fans.” London, he believes, offers an opportunity to grow that base. He added that the team’s international profile has grown, especially since the Jags ended years of losing with a run that left them just short of this year’s Super Bowl. He said the team is “one of the five most recognisable” NFL franchises overseas and their merchandise outsold the other 31 teams internationally in November and December. He said these gains offset the limits of Jacksonville, which is the NFL’s seventh-smallest market. Khan has been speaking with the FA for more than a year, ever since worries arose around the Jaguars that a sale of Wembley to a group uninterested in the NFL may take away the one obvious spot for the league to play most of its London games. As talks expanded, team officials realised the potential of keeping the revenue from food and beverage sales of not only Jaguars games at Wembley but also from all events. They also liked the idea of no longer paying rent at the stadium. But his interest in London makes Jacksonville fans nervous he intends to move the team. He was something of a mystery when he bought the Jags in 2012. He had not been a major player in US sports. Forbes Magazine has labelled him the NFL’s fourth-richest owner – with an estimated worth of anywhere between $5bn and $7bn, grown through his ownership of the car-parts company Flex-N-Gate – a firm for which he worked as a student at the University of Illinois. His purchase of the Jaguars for $760m was not a surprise. He had tried to buy a majority stake in the Rams, then in St Louis, two years before. He became the league’s first non-white and Muslim owner. And he immediately gained a profile as an American comfortable in London, establishing the Jags as the NFL franchise regularly playing in the UK. “I love sports,” he said on Thursday, gushing repeatedly about Wembley’s prestige, calling the stadium’s name “holy” to him. He also said Wembley is “underutilised” and promised to bring renovations that would make it a more desirable facility. Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, has made figuring out London a priority and one source told the Guardian that several years ago, before Khan bought the team, Goodell had expressed concerns about Jacksonville’s viability as an NFL market in private meetings. While Khan and Jaguars officials were careful to say a Wembley purchase will only help the market, an NFL team owning a London stadium makes the whole idea of a full‑time London team a bigger possibility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/30/will-you-drop-out-of-university-report-reveals-australian-students-at-risk","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T18:00:50Z","webTitle":"Will you drop out of university?

Report reveals the Australian students at risk","bodyText":"The government should provide students with an individualised assessment of their likelihood of dropping out of university, the Grattan Institute has said. In a report to be released on Monday the Grattan Institute finds that the probability of dropping out is relatively easy to predict, with characteristics including studying part-time and being a mature-age student strong indicators of risk. The report by higher education program director Andrew Norton and fellow Ittima Cherastidtham finds that one in five students are more likely to drop out than complete university. It estimates that about 50,000 students who start in 2018 will not finish their degrees based on the fact one-quarter of students who started university in 2008 dropped out within eight years. The Grattan Institute found that part-time study was the strongest indicator of risk, with students studying three or four subjects in their first year – rather than a full load of eight – only a 50/50 chance of completing university. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Grattan Institute developed a model to use these and other factors (field of study, admission marks, age, sex, disability, nationality, indigeneity, postcode during year 12 study, failed courses and study in person or online) to predict an individual’s chance of completing university. The report recommended the government’s student website, Quality Indicators for Teaching and Learning, should include “personalised information about the risk of not completing a degree” and how to reduce that risk. For example, the Grattan model calculated that a non-Indigenous male who moved from a remote area in Western Australia to a metro area, studied off-campus and took four subjects a year has a 72% chance of dropping out within eight years. But taking a full load of subjects and studying on-campus more than doubles that student’s chances of completing, slashing the risk of failure to 32%. “With better advice, some prospective part-time students may opt to study full-time,” the authors said. “Some prospective university students would take a vocational education course instead. Some may not study at all, but look for a job instead.” The federal government is also concerned about attrition rates and wants to introduce an element of performance funding so universities are incentivised to maximise outcomes as well as enrolments. In February the education minister, Simon Birmingham, told the Universities Australia conference that the attrition rate reached almost 15% in 2015, up from the lowest point of 12% in 2009. Birmingham has asked the higher education standards panel to look at how providers could support student success and course completion. The Grattan report argues that dropping out “is not always a bad outcome” because students report receiving benefits despite not finishing. “Yet for a significant minority, an incomplete degree leaves them with debt and regret,” it said. According to a survey of 950 students who did not complete university, nearly 40% would not begin their degree again knowing what they did now, and about a third of them felt they had received no benefits from their course. “These students do not get value for time and money. Australia should do more to manage the risks and costs of enrolment.” The Grattan report suggests universities should warn part-time students more clearly about what they need to do to finish within the maximum time allowed, and check students have a credible plan to graduate. It said universities should actively warn students of the census date, before which they could drop out without incurring fees, by using text messages rather than emails. Norton and Cherastidtham argued that students who were disengaged – failing to attend classes and hand in assessments – should be disenrolled before the second semester rather than at the end of the first year. If these efforts failed, the government could make students opt back in to study at census date rather than opt out. The Universities Australia’s deputy chief executive, Catriona Jackson, said while universities continued to make significant efforts to deal with attrition, a student leaving a course wasn’t inherently a bad thing. “Students must be supported to make good choices but sometimes the best choice is to leave,” she said. “The factors that cause non-completion are complex and often beyond the control of students and their universities – including everything from health problems and financial difficulties to the challenges of juggling work, study and family life. “The key is good information for students. Universities Australia supports any efforts that would help students to make the best decision they can.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/27/number-of-australians-who-earned-more-than-1m-a-year-yet-paid-no-tax-surges-30","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T05:26:56Z","webTitle":"Number of Australians who earned more than $1m a year yet paid no tax surges 30%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/27/number-of-australians-who-earned-more-than-1m-a-year-yet-paid-no-tax-surges-30","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/27/number-of-australians-who-earned-more-than-1m-a-year-yet-paid-no-tax-surges-30","fields":{"headline":"Number of Australians who earned more than $1m a year yet paid no tax surges 30%","bodyText":"Sixty-two Australians who earned more than $1m in the 2015-16 financial year paid no income tax. That represents a 30% increase from the previous financial year. New data from the Australian Tax Office, released on Friday afternoon, shows that despite a political focus on wage stagnation and income inequality in recent years, the ranks of Australia’s millionaires paying no income tax is growing swiftly. The data shows Australia has 12,706 taxpayers earning more than $1m, the vast majority of whom have paid some sort of tax on their taxable income. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon But in the 2015-16 financial year, 59 millionaires claimed to have taxable income below $6,001, one claimed to have taxable income between $6,001 and $10,000, and two claimed to have taxable income between $10,001 and $18,200, putting them all below the tax-free threshold. None of them paid the Medicare levy. Twenty-two reduced their taxable income to zero by claiming a combined $4.34m for the “cost of managing tax affairs” – nearly $198,000 each. Fourteen claimed gifts or donations worth $54.9m to help them do so. A tax office spokesman said there were legitimate reasons why a wealthy taxpayer may not pay tax in a particular year, including prior year tax losses (which are able to be carried forward indefinitely), large costs associated with the production of assessable income (such as the start-up phase of a business), and the cost of managing tax affairs. The “cost of managing tax affairs” includes the cost of getting advice from a registered tax agent, barrister or solicitor, the cost of preparing and lodging tax returns and activity statements, and the cost of court appeals. “Notwithstanding this, a wealthy taxpayer who does not pay tax is more likely to attract the ATO’s attention and be subject to further scrutiny to assure they are complying with their tax obligations,” the spokesman said. The data show in the 2013-14 financial year there were 56 millionaires who paid no income tax, which decreased slightly to 48 millionaires in 2014-15, but it has jumped up to 62 millionaires in 2015-16. Sally McManus, the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has criticised the news, saying it highlights again why tax rules have to be changed. “The fact that more than 60 millionaires paid no tax is obscene,” she said in a statement. “Our schools and hospitals are suffering because companies and individuals at the big end of town are getting away with paying no tax.” The ATO stats also show the number of landlords with an interest in six or more rental properties has grown quickly in the last four years, up 13%, from 17,671 to 19,967 individuals. This group of investors is growing at three times the rate of those who own just one investment property. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the data proved Labor’s point that the federal government’s generous property tax breaks were skewed towards a small number of Australians. “The new data from the tax office again draws out the problems with the current tax concessions on housing – an investor buying their fifth, sixth or seventh property gets more assistance than a first home buyer trying to get into the market,” Bowen said. First-home buyers needed to be on a level-playing field with investors, and money provided for negative gearing of multiple properties could be put to better use, he said. The ATO figures also show more millennials filed tax returns than baby boomers in 2015-16, as the composition of Australia’s population continues to evolve. The ATO says if the 13.5 million people who filed tax returns were represented as 100 people, the ATO received 18 tax returns from generation Z, 26 from millennials, 27 from generation X, 23 from baby boomers, and six from the generation before that. Using the same formulation of 100 people, it said after tax returns were assessed 77 people received a refund, 16 people owed tax, and seven balanced perfectly.

Joseph James DeAngelo Jr, 72, a former police officer, was arrested on Tuesday evening at his home in Citrus Heights, following a DNA breakthrough. He is accused of 12 murders and at least 45 rapes from 1976 to 1986. Law enforcement used a DNA sample from one of the crime scenes and matched it to distant relatives who had used a genealogy website to find out about their family background, the chief deputy district attorney, Steve Grippi, told the Sacramento Bee. From the relatives they were able to chart the family tree until they found someone the right age who lived in the area. After that, investigators obtained more recent “abandoned” DNA samples from DeAngelo. “You leave your DNA in a place that is a public domain,” district attorney Anne Marie Schubert told the New York Times. The district attorney’s office would not give any more information about the mechanism through which investigators made the initial match, citing the “ongoing investigation”. However, the development raises questions about the privacy of individuals who use these DNA database. People typically sign up to service such as 23andMe or AncestryDNA to find out about their health and family trees. By sending off a DNA sample to be tested and uploaded to the platform, individuals can identify other users of the service who might be related. They probably don’t expect police to screen their profile to see if they might be linked to a crime. 23andMe said the company was not involved in the case and that it had never given customer information to law enforcement officials. The platform does not support the comparison of genetic data processed by any third party to genetic profiles in its own database. An Ancestry.com spokeswoman said: “We have not been in contact with law enforcement regarding the Joseph James DeAngelo case. Ancestry advocates for its members’ privacy and will not share any information with law enforcement unless compelled to by valid legal process.” It is possible that law enforcement may have signed up as customers to these services and submitted an old DNA sample to be tested. Under these circumstances, it would be accurate to say that the services did not give customer information to law enforcement. The Golden State Killer, also known as the East Area Rapist, remained free for decades after a homicidal spree. He wore a mask and gloves and would break into homes to attack his victims. DeAngelo was as a police officer with the Exeter and Auburn police departments, but was fired in 1979 on suspicion of shoplifting a can of dog repellant and a hammer. It is not the first time police have tried to identify suspects for cold cases by searching genealogy databases. In 2014, Idaho investigators used a publicly searchable Ancestry.com database to identify an unknown suspect in a murder case because the suspect’s father had donated his DNA sample years before. The suspect, Michael Usry, was interrogated and a DNA sample was taken, but it turned out that his DNA was not a match to the crime scene DNA. “This case highlights the extreme threats posed to privacy and civil liberties by familial DNA searches and by private, unregulated DNA databases,” the EFF’s Jennifer Lynch wrote at the time. “People should be able to learn about their ancestors and relatives and about possible risks for genetic diseases without fear that their data will be shared with the cops without their consent.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/26/arsene-wenger-legacy-arsenal-atletico-madrid-europa-league-emirates","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T23:03:47Z","webTitle":"Lightweight Arsenal fail to pack a punch on Arsène Wenger’s big night | Jacob Steinberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/26/arsene-wenger-legacy-arsenal-atletico-madrid-europa-league-emirates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/26/arsene-wenger-legacy-arsenal-atletico-madrid-europa-league-emirates","fields":{"headline":"Lightweight Arsenal fail to pack a punch on Arsène Wenger’s big night","bodyText":"It is a lovely thought, Arsène Wenger burnishing his legacy by collecting the first European trophy of his career in Lyon next month, and for a while Arsenal’s manager could dream about that perfect send-off. Atlético Madrid were on the ropes, Diego Simeone was growling in the stands and for once it seemed that Wenger was not going to regret talking about a team with the potential to win the Europa League before this match. Yet the awkward truth for Arsenal’s eternal optimist is that the best teams show no mercy when the odds are stacked so heavily in their favour. This was an occasion that ought to have been remembered for a thrilling Arsenal performance, Alexandre Lacazette’s deft header and one of the most raucous atmospheres in the Emirates Stadium’s short history. Instead, it will live in the memory because of the generous defending that allowed Antoine Griezmann to steal a potentially decisive away goal and expose the fragility that explains why Wenger is leaving. This one could end up being even more painful than the Uefa Cup final defeat to Galatasaray in 2000 and the Champions League final defeat to Barcelona in 2006. Arsenal played against 10 men for 80 minutes and they could have killed the tie with sharper finishing and more maturity. Now, having burgled a 1-1 draw, Atlético will fancy their chances of reaching a fourth European final under Simeone. Wenger’s insistence that Arsenal deserved better was a familiar lament and his players will have to do it the hard way in next week’s second leg at the Wanda Metropolitano, where Atlético are a formidable proposition. It is not over yet, but a team without an away point in 2018 will need to produce a feat of tremendous defiance at one of Europe’s most intimidating venues. Will Arsenal rise to the occasion? It is hard to trust them. Their big players cannot hide. They will need more incision from Mesut Özil and more poise from their forwards. They cannot afford any more laxity from Laurent Koscielny and Shkodran Mustafi. Diego Costa, an unused substitute here, must be champing at the bit. There can be no more naivety. For while it is true that there was plenty to admire about the way Arsenal set about Atlético with ferocious intent in the early stages, it all felt a little too vague after Sime Vrsaljko’s red card for two rash fouls inside the first 10 minutes, with Wenger’s side guilty of not paying enough attention to detail in the key moments. Arsenal fed off the crowd’s emotion in their first European semi-final since 2009, but the killer touch eluded them. Lacazette had missed two glorious opportunities before Vrsaljko’s dismissal and Wilshere and Danny Welbeck both fluffed their lines when in front of the goal. Champions League finalists in 2014 and 2016, Atlético were there for the taking during the first 20 minutes, and Simeone’s mood was as dark as his outfit after seeing Clément Turpin dismiss Vrsaljko. When he erupted after Héctor Bellerín’s foul on Lucas Hernández in the 13th minute, the coach was sent from the touchline by the French referee. Yet Atlético relish these rearguard actions and the longer the game stayed goalless, the more anxious Arsenal grew. The Spanish team crept forward and Griezmann fired two warning shots before half-time. Arsenal had to regain their composure and they finally found a crack in the yellow wall just after the hour, Lacazette heading Wilshere’s cross past Jan Oblak. But disaster was on the way. “The task was clear for us,” Wenger said. “Not to be caught on the long ball.” And still Arsenal were caught by one hopeful punt in the 82nd minute. Griezmann won the chase with Koscielny and although David Ospina blocked the striker’s first attempt, he converted the rebound when Mustafi, the £35m German defender, fell over. The muted applause at the end spoke volumes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/27/bobby-reid-bristol-city-lee-johnson-striker-championship-golden-boot","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"Bristol City’s Bobby Reid: the ‘wind-up toy’ who cannot stop scoring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/27/bobby-reid-bristol-city-lee-johnson-striker-championship-golden-boot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/27/bobby-reid-bristol-city-lee-johnson-striker-championship-golden-boot","fields":{"headline":"Bristol City’s Bobby Reid: the ‘wind-up toy’ who cannot stop scoring","bodyText":"As Bobby Reid says, this season everything has clicked. A quick glance at his numbers tells you as much: 21 goals and counting, almost twice as many as he mustered across his first seven years as a professional. What has changed? As the maxim goes, the lifespan of a manager depends on their decision‑making and Lee Johnson’s move to turn a dainty midfielder into a shimmering striker last pre-season has proved a masterstroke. For Reid, it could prove a decision that elevates him to the next level. “Lee mentioned it to me and I wasn’t too sure about it at the time, I’ll be honest,” Reid says. “I didn’t want it to happen and to not be scoring goals because in that time my midfield position would probably be taken. I started in pre-season, scoring a few goals, and that gave me the belief. I hit the ground running and look where I am now.” Reid was selected in the PFA’s Championship team of the season and has a realistic chance of securing the division’s golden boot. He has 19 league goals; only Derby’s Matej Vydra, with 20, has more with two matches of the standard season remaining. For those closest to Reid, there is little shock at his breakthrough but surprise it has taken this long. In a way, Johnson is one of them. He was a player at Bristol City when Reid was coming through the academy and remembers him, in his early teens, struggling to hit the crossbar from the edge of the box “because his legs were so skinny”. Johnson later took Reid to Oldham Athletic on loan. At 25, Reid is no longer the new kid on the block. He is making his mark as City’s bustling bumblebee and trusty goal-getter. Central to his rise has been Rayan Wilson, the brother of the Macclesfield Town striker Scott, one of Reid’s best friends and a former City youth team-mate. Wilson is the founder of Back2Action, an elite performance centre a mile from Ashton Gate, and works closely with Reid as a physical consultant and mentor. “I’ve known Bobby since he was knee-high, about six,” Wilson, who used to taxi his brother and Reid to training, says. “I remember doing a coaching session, a fitness session with the under-14s coach back then. Bobby hated to run – getting fit in his eyes was not football – he just wanted to run and play with the ball. “As long as he had the ball, he was happy. Running didn’t seem a key part of the game for him. As he got older he thought: ‘Hang on, I might be gifted with the ball but a lot of these other lads are gifted without it; they are stronger, faster than me, or I’m not as fit as they are.’ He made a decision, he said: ‘Rayan, I need to do more.’” Loans to Cheltenham and Oldham were an eye-opener but it was on loan at Plymouth, Wilson says, that Reid realised he had work to do. “He was quite weak in very important areas: his core was weak, his legs. He was not a strong runner. He could cover distances but he fatigued quite early on in games, after about an hour.” When Johnson returned to City as head coach in 2016, it was the perfect appointment for Reid. “He knew him inside out,” Wilson, who works in tandem with Johnson and City’s staff, says. “Lee – out of all managers out there – was probably a blessing in disguise. I’ve said it to various coaches: ‘Watch out for Bobby Reid.’” Reid is fitter, stronger and more streetwise than ever. “He’s like a little wind-up toy that you’ve wound up as much as you can,” Wilson says. “You take it to the end of the table, it doesn’t just fall off and stop, it falls off and keeps going until the batteries are done. Bobby’s like: ‘I’ve got this energy, and I’m going give the manager everything I’ve got because he’s put me in here.’” David Horseman, the club’s head of academy coaching, who worked with Reid from the age of 11, says: “Bob had it quite tough – he played down a lot in the age groups. It was: ‘What are we going to do?’ He would never have been ready for the first team so him and his friend, Cameron Brown, who at that age was probably more talented than Bobby, were offered one-year schoolboy forms as opposed to a two-year scholarship. They were both tiny, very slight at 16 and that allowed them more time to develop and meant they could be judged at 19 rather than 18. Others would have had a smooth path but he has had nothing but hurdles.” With no under-23s football at the time, it meant Reid, who joined City as a seven-year-old, had three years instead of two to convince before signing his first professional contract in 2011. As is common in academies, Reid rotated around, playing every position except centre-back. Physically, though, he was often overpowered. “Bobby had to meander around a little bit,” Gary Probert, the academy manager, says. “It’s a great example to show the younger boys, that perseverance and resilience.” His willingness to run continues to set him apart and he has relished the responsibility of leading the line. “I have never met a kid with more energy than Bob,” Horseman says. “Bob would be the first one with the ball, he would play all night, him and his mates still playing in the road walking home. His energy now, that’s just Bob, even the way he talks is energetic.” Reid, born in Easton, in inner-city Bristol, is part of a Bristolian core with Joe Bryan, and another academy graduate, the England Under-20 defender Lloyd Kelly, has made big strides with the first team this season. “They are boys from our city and the supporters have that affinity,” Probert says. “Everyone has an association with them – he shops in my supermarket or his mum lives down my road or whatever it is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/live/2018/apr/27/north-and-south-korea-summit-leaders-prepare-for-historic-inter-korean-meeting-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T11:57:42Z","webTitle":"Korea summit: Trump hails 'end of the Korean war' - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/apr/27/north-and-south-korea-summit-leaders-prepare-for-historic-inter-korean-meeting-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2018/apr/27/north-and-south-korea-summit-leaders-prepare-for-historic-inter-korean-meeting-live","fields":{"headline":"Korea summit: Trump hails 'end of the Korean war' - as it happened","bodyText":"As the two Korean leaders wrap up the summit here’s a closing summary. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have met for the first time and agreed to end the Korean war, 65 years after the armistice. At Kim’s beckoning, President Moon briefly stepped over into the North side, in a a highly symbolic moment. The leaders agreed the Panmunjom declaration committing to seek “complete denuclearisation” of the peninsula. “South and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula,” it said. Donald Trump, who is due to meet Kim Jung-un in the coming weeks, hailed the end of the Korean war. “Good things are happening, but only time will tell,” he tweeted. South Korea praised Trump for bringing the two leaders together. All the key players in the region have welcomed the agreement including China and Japan. Russia’s Foreign Ministry says it is ready to facilitate cooperation between North and South Korea. During the closed-door morning meeting, the two leaders discussed denuclearisation and rebuilding relations. Both Kim and Moon expressed a desire for future meet-ups, and Moon hailed it as a “very good discussion”. After breaking for lunch, Moon and Kim were involved in the ceremonial planting of a tree dating from 1953, the year the Korean war ended. After a discussion in the gardens of Peace House, and another closed-door meeting, Kim and Moon signed the Panmunjom Declaration. The declaration also agreed to help unite families divided between North and South. And Moon agreed to visit Pyongyang, North Korea, in the Autumn North Korea watchers are urging caution pointing to the lack of specifics and a timetable in the declaration. Russia’s Foreign Ministry says it is ready to facilitate cooperation between North and South Korea, including in the fields of railway transportation, gas and electrical energy, Reuters reports. More from Trump. In his latest tweet he hails the declaration to end the Korean in characteristic all-caps mode. South Korea’s foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha told CNN that “clearly credit goes to President Trump” for bringing North Korea to the negotiating table. “He’s been determined to come to grips with this from day one,” she said. Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University in Beijing who focuses on North Korea issues said the main accomplishment of the summit was improving ties between North and South Korea. “The main characters are DPRK and South Korea,” he said. “Today’s summit was a giant step to improving the relation between DPRK and South Korea.” Cheng said that China made an effort not to distract from the meeting today. Chinese president Xi Jinping met Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, but Chinese media were restrained in reporting much about that meeting. But there are still big challenges. Cheng said Kim still needs to show real willingness to dismantle the country’s nuclear programme and specify under what conditions that can happen. “Today’s summit is a step towards denuclearisation, but it’s hard to call it a giant step,” he said. China, North Korea’s key international ally, has also welcomed the summit. “Today, the leaders of South and North Korea held their summit successfully,” China’s foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. The South Korean news Yonhap, quoted him saying: “(They) announced a joint declaration on their common understanding of inter-Korean relations, easing military tension on the Korean Peninsula, denuclearizing the peninsula and a permanent peace.” “The positive outcome of the summit is helpful for inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation, peace and stability on the peninsula and the political resolution of Korean Peninsula issues.” Broadcaster and former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan, one of the few people Trump follows on Twitter, has quipped that the US president could get the Nobel Prize for his role in the Korean summit. Some European reaction from the other Donald. And this from Belgium’s prime minister Charles Michel: Donald Trump has hailed the summit as a “historic meeting” after a “furious year of missile launches and nuclear testing.” In his first reaction to the meeting Trump tweeted: “Good things are happening, but only time will tell!”. Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe has welcomed the summit, but urged Pyongyang to take “concrete action” on the peninsula’s denuclearisation and other issues. “Today President Moon Jae-in and Chairman Kim Jong Un held earnest discussions about North Korea’s denuclearisation. I want to welcome that as a positive move toward comprehensive resolution of various issues concerning North Korea,” Abe told reporters in Tokyo, according to AFP. “We strongly hope that North Korea will take concrete action through this meeting and a summit between the US and North Korea,” he added. Today’s meeting represents one of the sharpest and speediest diplomatic turnarounds in living memory, writes Guardian commentator Mary Dejevsky in her first thoughts on the summit. The Kremlin has praised the Korean summit as “very positive news”, saying direct dialogue on the divided peninsula was promising. “This is very positive news,” President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The Russian news agency Tass quoted him saying: “In this case we positively regard the meeting itself between the two Koreas’ leaders and the declared outcome of the negotiations.” Korean TV has been showing footage of the leaders’ wives arriving for the summit. Here’s an English translation of three-page joint declaration agreed by Kim and Moon. Here are key passages The two leaders solemnly declared before the 80 million Korean people and the whole world that there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun. South and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. South and North Korea shared the view that the measures being initiated by North Korea are very meaningful and crucial for the denuclearisation of he Korean peninsula and agreed to carry our their respective roles and responsibilities in this regard. South and North Korea agreed to actively seek the support and cooperation of the international community for the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. After a riveting and surprisingly jovial 10 hours, I am handing over the liveblog to my colleagues in London for the final moments of the summit. A summary of today’s events: In a historic moment, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met for the first time, shaking hands at the demarcation line between North and South. At Kim’s beckoning, President Moon briefly stepped over into the North side, a highly symbolic moment. Before going into their meeting in Peace House, on the South Korean side of the border, Kim signed a message in the guest book proclaiming a “new era of peace” During the closed-door morning meeting, the pair discussed denuclearisation and rebuilding relations. Both Kim and Moon expressed a desire for future meet-ups, and Moon hailed it as a “very good discussion”. Moon said that the “weight on our shoulders is heavy” but said the conference would be a “gift to the world”. After breaking for lunch, Moon and Kim were involved in the ceremonial planting of a tree dating from 1953, the year the Korean war ended. After a discussion in the gardens of Peace House, and another closed-door meeting, Kim and Moon signed a joint statement, the Panmunjom Declaration. They pledged to denuclearise the Korean Peninsula, bring an end to the Korean War and help unite families divided between North and South. Moon will visit Pyongyang, North Korea, in the Autumn The leaders and their wives have now headed to a three hour finale banquet While the exact details of how denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula will be carried out, the pledge will be important in getting Trump to agree to another summit next month. Trump said yesterday he would only meet Kim if he thought their meeting would be “fruitful”- which would mean North Korea agreeing to give up their nuclear programme entirely. Kim and Moon’s address outside Peace House also saw the leaders pledge to jointly push for talks with the United States, and potentially China in order to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, which stopped in an armistice and left the Koreas still technically at war. The first ladies of North and South Korea are now meeting for the first time as they all head to the formal dinner The two leaders vowed to put an end to the Korean war with this declaration “We hope we will not repeat our mistake of the past,” said Kim in his comments. “ I hope this will be an opportunity for the two Korean peoples to move freely from North to South. We need to take responsibility for our own history.” The two leaders will now have regular contact through a hotline and will build liaison offices in both countries Kim and Moon hammered out a joint statement that is short on concrete steps and heavy on aspirational goals. It’s mostly about holding more talks between the two side on issues ranging from families divided by the Korean war to transport links. There’s one section about denuclearisation, but it only repeats the general idea that “the South and North have confirmed their common goal of realizing a nuclear-free Korean peninsula”. Here are the highlights: They will hold talks on formally establishing a peace treaty Agreed to “urgently resolve” humanitarian issues of divided families The two sides will work together to “ease the sharp military tensions on the Korean peninsula” and defense ministers will meet in May Starting May 1, all propaganda activities, including loudspeakers and leaflets, will be halted. Moon will visit Pyongyang in the autumn.They agreed to establish an inter-Korean joint liaison office in Kaeseong It is not known what the statement says, but the paired both signed it, and then had a warm embrace The two sides are about to make the much-awaited joint statement outside Peace House. The room in Peace House where the two leaders have held their meetings was designed in agonising detail prior to the Summit. This included “scattering onions and charcoal on the floors and running many electric fans to remove the odour” of new paint, a Moon spokesman said. This morning’s landmark encounter between Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un was deemed so important than even convicts across South Korea saw their usual diet of pre-edited TV interrupted for “emergency live programming” of the summit, the South Korean justice ministry said in a statement. “We allowed all inmates detained in detention centres across the country to join the nation for the historic moment of the South-North summit,” said the ministry. Moon and Kim have now headed back to Peace House for the final afternoon session of the summit China’s Response While Chinese media reported widely on the summit, officials said little about the meeting. Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the ministry of foreign affairs said in response to questions at a press conference, “We have all seen the summit on television. We applaud the leaders of DPRK and South Korea for this historic step and express appreciation for the decisiveness and courage they displayed.” “Through difficult times and conflict, we are still brothers. All the past resentment goes away after we smile at each other,” Hua said. Hua said China looked forward to this historic meeting as an opportunity to further long-term peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. An editorial from Chinese state news agency Xinhua was in contrast quite florid, calling on the need for both sides to “keep talking.” “The historic scene brought the dawn of peace. The related parties will need to show kindness, sincerity, patience, and caution. Complete sincerity can break even metal and stones.” The editorial added, “As long as we work hard, the issues will be resolved. If we continue to talk, the ice will melt. The day of spring and flowers in bloom will come.” The two leaders are still talking seriously but animatedly, even though the eyes of the world are on them. Against the leafy backdrop and with the serene atmosphere, you would never know that the DMZ is usually one of the most dangerous and hostile places in the world. Moon and Kim have gone for a stroll through the gardens and are now sitting privately, deep in discussion but out of earshot A plaque has been unveiled next to the tree stating: “we plant peace and prosperity,” signed by both leaders. This is significant gesture of peace in the demarcation zone, an area which is usually hostile and heavily fortified by both sides Kim has crossed back over to South Korea and met with Moon to start the tree planting ceremony. It seems they are not actually planting a tree but adding soil to a pine tree dating from 1953, the year that the Korean War armistice was signed. The soil is from both the South Korean mountain, Mt Halla, and the North Korean Mountain, Mt Baekdu- a symbolic combining of the two nations The optics of this morning’s summit are all extremely relaxed and even joyful between the two leaders Every course at this evening’s dinner has been diplomatically thought out to cause no offence to either side. Dishes will include a “Korean reinterpretation of the Swiss rosti”, a nod to Kim’s school years spent in Switzerland. The grilled beef on the menu will even come from the South Korean ranch which became famous in 1998 when the Hyundai founder Chung Ju-yung sent 1,001 cattle from the ranch in two separate convoys across the border to the North to aid reconciliation between the rivals. The guest list is not just officials either. The wives of both Moon and Kim will be attending the meal, as well as famous cultural figures from both countries, including the North’s Hyon Song Wol, the leader of Kim’s hand-picked Moranbong girl band, and South Korean pop star Cho Yong-pil. In the meantime, here is a summary of the main events of the morning: In a historic moment, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met for the first time, shaking hands at the demarcation line between North and South. At Kim’s beckoning, President Moon briefly stepped over into the North side, a highly symbolic moment. Before going into their meeting in Peace House, on the South Korean side of the border, Kim signed a message in the guest book proclaiming a “new era of peace” During the closed-door meeting the pair discussed denuclearisation and both Kim and Moon expressed a desire for future meet-ups. Moon said that the “weight on our shoulders is heavy” but said the conference would be a “gift to the world”. Kim reaffirmed his promise to stop nuclear missile tests. “It has taken 11 years for this historic moment to happen. Walking here, I wondered why it has taken so long,” he said. Moon hailed the morning meeting as a “very good discussion” before the summit broke for lunch, and Kim and his delegation returned to North Korea to eat The summit will start again at 4:30pm local time when Moon and Kim will plant a tree together, take a walk and then resume discussions Delegates from both sides are writing a joint statement which will be signed and announced at the end of the day. Korean media is reporting that officials from North and South Korea are now hashing out a joint statement, which will be signed by both Kim Jong Un and President Moon. The two will resume talks at 4:30pm local time when they will plant a symbolic tree together, and then pick up discussions again before dinner at 6:30pm Other than the leaders themselves, one of the few people allowed in on this morning’s intimate meeting was Kim Jong Un’s younger sister, proving how much of a close confidante she is to him. Kim Yo Jong has already become something of a celebrity in South Korea after she attended the Winter Olympics in February, making her the first member of her family to cross the border to the South. Moon mentioned this her celebrity status his opening comments, which apparently made her blush. Kim Yo Jong was also by her brother’s side during his inaugural visit to China to meet Xi Jinping, and it is very likely she will also attend the summit with Trump next month. Here’s footage of what Kim Jong Un’s human motorcade looked like as it crossed back over the border for lunch. With the weather sunny and pushing 20 degrees, it may have been a sweaty jog for his 12 bodyguards clad in full suit and tie Yoon Yougn-chan, the South Korean presidential spokesman, gave a brief summary of the morning’s talks, saying they lasted exactly 100 minutes and involved “sincere, candid” talks on denuclearisation. A permanent peace and ways to improve relations were also discussed. He said Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will arrive at the summit site at 6.15pm local time to join a dinner with Moon later on The South Korean Foreign ministry put out a tweet and video urging the world to cheer them on in the summit Speaking to the Guardian, Van Jackson, a former policy adviser to the US secretary of defence who focuses on Asia said: “It’s high on symbolism and definitely exciting, but you have to ask yourself what does the symbolism amount to? “Both men have a strong desire to make this look good, but I don’t see anything coming out of this except building momentum for a Kim-Trump meeting.” He added: “It’s great to have good vibes going into the Trump summit, but you need to put emotion aside and wonder what this means on the question of nukes, which is not much. Kim says he wants peace and denuclearisation, but what that means to him won’t be acceptable to South Korea or the US.” Benjamin Haas and Justin McCurry have written a full report on this morning’s historic opening to the summit and the first meeting between President Moon and Kim Jong Un Not everyone is so optimistic that this summit marks a seismic shift in North-South relations. Robert Kelly of Pusan National University warned that Pyongyang “hasn’t really changed, and it hasn’t offered a meaningful concession yet”, adding there were still “huge” strategic and political divisions between the North on one hand, and the South and the US on the other. “It’s off to a good start, but there must be a concrete commitment by Kim on denuclearisation,” said Youngshik Bong, a researcher at Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies told Bloomberg. “Otherwise it will end up as a fancy show.” The meeting also showed a thawing of relations over the contentious issue of North Korean defectors. North Korea has often accused South Korea of abducting or enticing its citizens to defect. Moon’s spokesman Yoon Young-chan says Kim mentioned the defectors among people who have high expectations for the summit to heal scars and improve relations between the rivals. “We should value this opportunity so that the scars between the South and North could be healed,” Kim was quoted as saying. “The border line isn’t that high; it will eventually be erased if a lot of people pass over it.” Seoul said Kim Jong Un apologised to Moon for interrupting his sleep following North Korea’s nuclear tests last year, when Moon had to convene security council meetings in the early hours of the morning. “We won’t interrupt your early morning sleep anymore,” said Kim, reiterating an earlier promise to stop carrying out nuclear missile tests. According to South Korean news, Moon said there had been “very good discussion today” and said it would be a “gift to the world” A briefing of the events of the morning by President Moon’s spokesperson Yoon Young-chan gives the impression it was a very convivial meeting between the two leaders. Kim said he would be willing to visit the South Korean Presidential house in Seoul if he was invited. Moon said he hoped future meetings would happen in both the North and the South. “Our meetings will continue at Pyongyang, Seoul, Jeju island and Paektu mountain,” he said. It was a proposal supported by Kim who said “let’s meet often.” All talk is of the unscripted moment when President Moon momentarily stepped over the demarcation line and into North Korea. This is reportedly how it came about: The topics trending on Korean twitter indicate that the people of South Korea have high hopes for the summit The morning summit meeting has been completed and the two leaders will now be breaking for lunch separately. Kim Jong-un and his delegation will be crossing back over to the North to eat, before coming back over the border. China is watching the summit closely, with news of the meeting occupying most of China Central Television (CCTV) coverage today. Li Xiyu, a professor of politics and diplomacy at Sungkyunkwan University told the Chinese publication, the Paper, that it’s still too early to talk about reunification but that the two sides would remain committed to peace. Still, on social media Chinese internet users were excited about the prospect and drew comparisons to the possibility of China reuniting with Taiwan. Beijing claims that Taiwan, which has been ruled by its own government for decades, belongs to mainland China. “If brothers can share the same heart and mud become gold, the two sides of the strait can reunify,” one internet user posted on Weibo. Another wrote, “Let’s witness history. I hope Taiwan can return to China someday.” “The Berlin Wall fell. The 38th parallel is blurred. I just want Taiwan to cross the ocean, like a long lost kid returning to his mother.” While people around the world were gripped by live TV coverage of this morning’s historic handshake between Moon and Kim, the people of North Korea were not among them. According to Martyn Williams, who runs the North Korea Tech blog, state run TV did not broadcast the event. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said just over a third of TV viewers in the Seoul area watched live images of the leaders’ greeting each other across the military demarcation line separating their countries. From Martin Farrer again: Amid the heady talk of a new bginning for the Koreas, there is some chatter about what reunification would mean for the countries’ economies, ie a huge bailout for the North by the South. Meanwhile, Asian shares are still in positive territory. The Kospi is up 0.7% despite that admittedly still very, very distant prospect of the South bailing out the North. Here’s what one trader, Mingze Wu, of INTL FCStone in Singapore, has told Reuters: The easing of tension and the possibility of a peace treaty coming on the horizon are bullish for the won [South Korean currency] and Kospi. However, it should be noted that prices did not have lasting weakness in the past during the periods of escalation, hence it’ll be difficult to imagine a new bullish trend emerging just from this. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has expressed doubt that the summit will bring any significant shifts. “We have had false dawns before on the Korean peninsula,” he said. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was equally hesitant to hail the meeting between North and South Korea as definite progress towards denuclearisation. “I think we should maintain our expectations,” she said. “This is a first step, a preliminary step.” Kim Chang Su from the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses said the opening greeting between the two leaders made him optimistic about the summit, particularly as the focus is on talks of “peace” rather that reunification of North and South. He pointed out that during the meeting of the two leaders at the demarcation line, the pair shook hands and then Kim Jong-un and President Moon both crossed over to the North side of the border, a very symbolic gesture “It’s very surprising but that’s a sign of harmony, rather than just one side forcing these talks on the other. It was a bold gesture by Kim Jong-un.” “So far these seem to be very open minded discussions, a sign that we are heading to a new era of peace,” he added. According a Reuters reporter, minutes before Kim entered Peace House, a North Korean security team conducted a sweep for explosives and listening devices, as well as sprayed apparent disinfectant in the air, on the chairs, and on the guest book. From Martin Farrer: The money people obviously enjoyed seeing the two Korean leaders meeting today as the Kospi index in Seoul soared more than 1%. The Nikkei in Tokyo also looks healthy after rising 0.3% so far while Hong Kong is up 0.76%. The prices are off a little bit now from earlier highs, so perhaps the early gains were as much to do with a strong showing on Wall Street overnight. But what’s clear is that nuclear tension on the Korean peninsula is not a factor in dragging stocks lower, as it was a few months ago. Kim also revealed that he had brought Moon an edible gift from over the border. “I saw earlier that the dinner menu here is a very hot topic,” he said. “I also brought with me cold noodles from Pyongyang so President I hope you can enjoy the Pyongyang noodles.” From Benjamin in the DMZ: Kim and Moon sat down for the beginning of the summit and made brief remarks in from of the cameras. Kim said he wanted to hold “frank” discussions on current issues and hoped the summit could lead to a “good outcome”. I hope to write a new chapter between us, this is the starting point for us. We will make a new beginning,” he said. “It has taken 11 years for this historic moment to happen. Walking here I wondered why it has taken so long.” “Through today’s meeting, I hope we won’t go back to square one again and non-implementation of what we agree won’t happen again,” he added, referring to past agreements that were signed but fizzled. “I hope we can live up to the exceptions that other have on us”, and “I hope there can be agreements to fulfill those great expectations.” Moon then made a few opening remarks before journalists were asked to leave. “I hope the whole world is paying attention to the Spring that is spreading throughout the Korean peninsula,” he said. “There is a huge burden on our shoulders. People around the world have high hopes.” “Your visit makes the military demarcation line a symbol of peace, not division,” he added. “I thank you very much for your courage. Our dialogue and talks today will be very frank. We will finally have the dialogue we haven’t been able to have for the past decade.” And here’s a video of the historic moment that Kim Jong-un crossed the border and shook hands President Moon- the first time the two leaders have met Japan’s defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, has said Tokyo hopes the summit will lead to demonstrable progress on North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes, and a resolution of the regime’s cold war abductions of Japanese nationals. “Japan will be watching closely for signs that North Korea is taking action on these issues,” he said. Japan claims that 17 of its nationals – and perhaps many more – were abducted in the 1970s and 1980s and put to work teaching North Korean agents their language and culture. In 2002, five abductees were allowed to return to Japan. North Korea claimed that eight abductees died and that the remaining four had never entered the country. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has reportedly received assurances from Moon that he will raise the abduction issue with Kim at today’s summit. Reuters are reporting that Kim Jong-un’s message in the visitor’s book at Peace House was: “New history starts now, the starting point of a new historic peace era.” Here is an image of the scrawled note: The Venue The Peace House, has been spruced up in anticipation of the summit. Live TV coverage showed Moon and Kim pause for photographs in front a of a new mural of North Korea’s Mount Kumgang. The mountain is regarded as a symbol of conciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas, but a joint tourism project there was suspended in 2008 after a South Korean tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier. When they begin their official talks later this morning, the leaders will sit precisely 2,018 millimeters apart - in a nod to the year of their historic summit - on opposite sides of a specially designed table with gentle, rounded edges. They will sit on chairs with backrests that feature a Korean peninsula design. The White House has released a statement on the summit We wish the Korean people well. We are hopeful that talks will achieve progress to were a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula. The US appreciates the close coordination with our ally, the Republic of Korea and looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks. This was the historic handshake between the President Moon and Kim Jong-un. Both appeared very at ease as they greeted each other. Meanwhile President Donald Trump said on Thursday that North Korea’s Kim Jong-un has made nuclear weapons concessions before even sitting down for talks, while the U.S. hasn’t given up anything. Trump told Fox &amp; Friends that his tough approach toward the North, and now his willingness to engage with Kim, had reduced the risk of nuclear war. He contended that North Korea has “given up denuclearisation, testing, research” and that “we’re going to close different sites.” “I’m saying to myself ‘wait a minute, all of these things he’s given up and we haven’t even really that much asked them,’” Trump said. He added: “We would have asked them, but they gave it up before I even asked.” He added: “This is a much more dangerous ballgame now, but I will tell you it’s going very well.” Kim Jong-un signed the guest book at peace house before he and Moon walked into a conference room for the beginning of the talks. There are no cameras in the room, so we’ll have to wait and see what comes out. The two leaders are now inspecting the Guard of Honour in the official opening ceremony. President Moon salutes the guards before the pair walk down the red carpet towards Peace House, where the summit will take place. Kim Jon-un shook the hands of all the South Korean delegation, and President Moon then greeted the North Korean delegates, before all posing for a group photo. Kim Jong-un, dressed in his signature striped Mao-style jacket, shook Moon’s hand across the border line and the two men chatted briefly before stepping over the line and posing for photos. It is the first time a North Korean leader has set foot in the South since the end of the Korean War. Kim then brought Moon over the border to the North sign for a few seconds and they held hands as the crossed back into the South. North Korean leader Kim has arrived and has greeted President Moon. The leaders shook hands warmly and Kim has now stepped over the demarcation line, holding hands as they walk- a historic moment for both countries President Moon is now heading to the demarcation line, smiling widely, which indicates that Kim’s arrival is imminent One man who will certainly be watching the Summit closely is Donald Trump. With his own historic summit with Kim expected next month, also with North Korea’s nuclear programme up for discussion, Trump said yesterday he could still pull out if he feels it’s “not going to be fruitful.” Fruitful for Trump is North Korea giving up all its nuclear weapons- though Kim may have a different view of denuclearisation means. Seoul played down denuclearisation expectations yesterday, saying the North’s technological advances with its nuclear and missile programmes meant any deal would be “fundamentally different in nature from denuclearisation agreements in 1990s and early 2000s”. “That’s what makes this summit all the more difficult,” the chief of the South’s presidential secretariat Im Jong-seok told reporters. Report from Benjamin Haas who is in Goyang, South Korea: South Korean president and his team have arrived at the Peace House in Panmunjom where the talks will take place. The two leaders will review an military honour guard shortly after Kim Jong-un crosses the border, including solider dressed in traditional Korean garb. The meeting is set to begin at 9.30am in South Korea, which actually works out to be 9am in the North. Pyongyang changed its time zone to be 30 minutes earlier from the South in 2015, in a break with “imperialism”, since the previous timing was imposed by Japan when it colonised the country in 1910. It’s not just politicians and world leaders who have something at stake in this summit. There are roughly 30,000 North Korean defectors living in the South and as this piece by Benjamin Haas illustrates, not all are happy to be away from their home, even if they have escaped oppression and poverty. Many hope this summit will also tackle the issue of reuniting families divided between North and South (it is illegal for those from the South to visit the North without government approval). Kim’s willingness to discuss denuclearisation for North Korea took on a new twist yesterday. Chinese geologists have just revealed that the main nuclear testing site in North Korea, Punggye-ri has collapsed under the stress of multiple explosions and it is now unusuable. Kim had agreed to stop testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and close down Punggye-ri before his meeting with Moon- a moved heralded by Trump as “big progress!”- but it now looks like like was out of necessity rather than just goodwill. Professor Sung-wook Nam was a South Korean government adviser at the last inter-Korean summit a decade ago. He expects no major breakthroughs this time but said the summit was a first and important step, and much more negotiation has to follow. “North Korea wants to get to the American summit with [US President Donald] Trump so they might give small concessions first at this one,” Professor Nam told ABC news Australia. “The summit is very much about Kim Jong-un trying to improve his image internationally too. It seems he now wants to be presented as a reasonable man so he can get economic gains.” Professor Nam said one of the other problems was everyone had a different definition of denuclearisation. “America wants complete dismantlement immediately before any concession are given,” he said. “South Korea is prepared to go step-by-step and give a little if the North gives a little in terms of denuclearisation. What is it hoped the summit will achieve? In short, nothing concrete. Turning the day’s talks into a formal joint declaration will be “difficult”, according to Im Jong-seok, the South’s chief presidential secretary. However, the fact they are both even willing to meet sends a powerful signal. Justin McCurry has written a curtain raiser on what both sides are expecting from the summit. “Much of the positive signs from North Korea have come not directly from the Kim regime but from South Korean officials. Moon, though, has been playing down the suggestion that he and Kim will emerge from the talks declaring peace in their time. He acknowledged this week that a formal peace treaty would require the approval of other parties that fought in the Korean war, notably China and the US. Instead, they could reach a less ambitious interim deal to “end hostilities” – a move that comes very close to agreements brokered during previous inter-Korean summits in 2000 and 2007. On wider security, perhaps the most that can be expected is some clarification from Kim of the security guarantees he is seeking in return for dismantling his nuclear arsenal.” When Kim crosses the demarcation line, it is not just high level Korean officials, his wife Ri Sol-ju and his sister Kim Yo-jong that will accompany him. He will also bring his own toilet, according to the Washington Post. Lee Yun-keol, who before defecting to South Korea worked in a North Korean guard unit that protects the leader, said there was a national security reason for Kim to use his own toilet in this case. “The leader’s excretions contain information about his health status so they can’t be left behind,” said Lee . Our correspondent Benjamin Haas has written profiles of both the leaders and 38 North, the US Korean Institute at Jons Hopkins University, has tweeted useful biographies of all those in the North Korean delegation These are not talks that will go on well into the night. The strict schedule specifies the politics will be wrapped up before 6:30pm, to make way for an evening of ceremonial activities. Schedule 9:30am: Proceedings will begin with Kim walking across the border to the city of Panmunjon on the South Korean side. He will review the honour guard with Moon, sign the guest book and pose for photos. They two leaders will have a informal chat in the reception room. 10:30am: The talks will officially begin Lunch is at an unspecific time but the North and South Korean delegations will eat separately, with the North Koreans crossing back over the border for lunch Sometime before 6:30pm: Kim and Moon will plant a pine tree from 1953 (the year the Korean War armistice was signed) and take a stroll on a foot bridge in Panmunjom. They’ll have some more time to chat. This is the point when any joint declaration will be announced. 6:30pm: Dinner will be served (full details of every diplomatically curated course here). After dinner they will watch a film together projected onto the façade of Peace House. The summit will finish with a farewell ceremony and then Kim and his delegation will cross back over. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has left Pyongyang for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, North Korean state news agency KCNA has reported this morning. KCNA said: Kim Jong-un will open-heartedly discuss with Moon Jae-in all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula. Good morning/afternoon/evening. Wherever you are, welcome to the Guardian’s live blog of the much-awaited meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea – only the third such meeting since the end of the Korean war in 1953. For an analysis of what the summit is all about and some background, check out this explainer from our correspondent in Seoul, Benjamin Haas: But it’s not just the relative rarity that makes this summit so important. North Korea’s fast-developing nuclear weapons program was striking fear into neighbouring countries in the region only a few months ago, and also posed a direct threat to the United States. The threat remains but 2018 has seen a rapid de-escalation of tension helped by intensive diplomacy and February’s Winter Olympics in the South and the remarkable prospect – despite all the violent rhetoric between them – of a meeting between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. A measure of progress is that one of the aims of this summit is to try to denuclearise the Korean peninsula. But we might be getting ahead of ourselves. In half an hour or so Kim will walk across the border and into the House of Peace. Here’s an insight into what his state of mind might be from another of our foreign correspondents, Emma Graham-Harrison, who recently visited the North Korean capital Pyongyang:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/26/fa-sale-wembley-stadium-shahid-khan-sign-of-the-times","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T18:04:49Z","webTitle":"FA’s proposed sale of Wembley to Shahid Khan is a sign of the times","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/26/fa-sale-wembley-stadium-shahid-khan-sign-of-the-times","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/26/fa-sale-wembley-stadium-shahid-khan-sign-of-the-times","fields":{"headline":"FA’s proposed sale of Wembley to Shahid Khan is a sign of the times","bodyText":"The Football Association’s proposed sale of Wembley stadium to the US car parts billionaire Shahid Khan was not greeted by a widespread shriek of patriotic indignation, perhaps illustrating how accustomed British people are now to crown jewels being sold overseas. Liverpool, thrillingly reconnecting with their European Cup-winning heritage and rampaging towards the Champions League final, are owned by US sports franchise billionaires, as are Manchester United, Arsenal and other grand clubs including Fulham, which Khan, owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team, bought from Mohamed Al Fayed in 2013. Fayed sold his other London landmark, Harrods, to Qatari state funds, which also owns the Shard and many prestigious chunks of the West End. The Premier League champions and large tracts of east Manchester are owned by the Abu Dhabi ruling family after decades in which no British investors could be found to arrest economic decline. At the same time, government investment in its own public responsibilities has been relentlessly cut, with sports facilities, swimming pools, public parks and playing fields inevitably falling victim. Before the 2010 general election, the then shadow Conservative sports minister, Hugh Robertson, expressed displeasure at a Guardian article in which the Labour sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, proudly presented his government’s record of investment in school and public sports facilities and warned that the Tories would initiate cuts. Eight years on, as Sutcliffe predicted, hundreds of millions of pounds have been scythed from local authority budgets now struggling to maintain existing sports facilities, let alone modernise or build new ones. This is the context to the FA’s acknowledgement that it is considering a £500m-plus proposal from Khan to buy Wembley, and presenting it as a positive plan because it would spend the money on improving grassroots facilities. The new Wembley was built for £757m after serious financial difficulties, after the FA took ownership because its England matches and FA Cup semi-finals and finals provide the bulk of the income, and it has been a financial and administrative burden. Eleven years since the stadium finally reopened, with its new arch, 90,000 seats, Bobby Moore statue and girth of Club Wembley Club Wembley corporate feasting, the FA still owes £140m and Wembley makes a loss after paying the interest. The FA’s own history since it took charge of the Wembley project in 1999 has been turbulent, working through a series of chairmen and chief executives and repeatedly coming off worse in battles for governance authority with the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Scudamore. Gradually, however, the FA has focused more on the abject conditions in which the public has to play football and begun to explore the potential for improving things. Hence this proposed deal to sell Wembley and the FA’s careful presentation of it as an opportunity to release substantial, transformational money for public facilities. The argument is that having sweated for years to pay off the enormous debt on the new stadium, the FA has a prime asset in north London, still sucking in time and effort and whose value could be put to better use. If Khan, who has nursed a long-term project to bring the NFL and his Jaguars franchise more regularly to Wembley, were to buy it, the £500m-plus would be released for good works. This commitment at the outset of negotiations, that the bulk of the millions will go towards upgrading facilities, is the promise to which the FA must be held and against which it should be judged. The FA is making it clear it will still look to earn valuable money from playing matches at Wembley, retaining the Club Wembley receipts. In its most recently published accounts, for the year to 31 July 2016, the FA recorded £56.5m revenue from Club Wembley, 10-year packages having been sold to City firms and other corporate clients from the stadium’s opening. Last year Club Wembley packages were revamped to provide more luxury, reduce tenures to three seasons, and prices are now running from £2,148 for a seat per season to £11,064 in the One Twenty club and £37,200 – per person, per seat – in a private box. The FA is saying it will retain all this income and revert to playing matches on the basis it used to and on which most national teams do: pay rent to use the stadium and keep the money from the tickets. Khan will buy out the stadium itself, take the food and beverage revenue from the rest of it, and take on the burden of its upkeep. The public money provided for Wembley’s rebuilding and the infrastructure around it: £79m from Sport England, £18m from the government, £17m from the London Development Agency and further smaller amounts making a total of £119m, will have to be repaid or an accommodation reached. For Khan, the attraction appears to be expanding the NFL into London and ensuring the Jaguars have pre-eminent rights to be the team who play there. While the NFL season is on, from September to January, the FA has accepted that England matches will not be played at Wembley and move around major club grounds instead, a prospect many fans are likely to welcome. During those months, traditionalists might avert their gaze from the goings-on within England’s national football stadium. But it is a sign of the times that the FA’s proposal itself is being entertained as a potentially workable idea to husband scarce resources, rather than dismissed with a cry of betrayal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/27/stolen-succulents-california-hipster-plants-at-center-of-smuggling-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"Stolen succulents: California hipster plants at center of smuggling crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/stolen-succulents-california-hipster-plants-at-center-of-smuggling-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/27/stolen-succulents-california-hipster-plants-at-center-of-smuggling-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Stolen succulents: California hipster plants at center of smuggling crisis","bodyText":"In China, they are prized for their chubby limbs and cute shapes. In Korea, they are a treasured hobby for housewives. But on the coastal cliffs of California, the dudleya succulent plants are vanishing, snatched up by international smugglers and shipped to an Asian middle-class market hungry for California native flora. California department of fish and wildlife wardens have made five busts this year, involving more than 3,500 stolen plants, evidence that the succulent, a symbol of American hipster style, has gone global to grievous effect. “Right now these plants are a boom in Korea, China and Japan. It’s huge among domestic housewives. It’s a status thing,” said the department warden Pat Freeling, who spearheaded the investigation. “It’s become an exotic lotus flower succulent. Someone likened it to the next Pokémon.” The succulents, dubbed “Live Forevers” by early California explorers for their ability to survive long ocean crossings, require little care and are often mistakenly thought to be ideal for apartment living. Each five-inch plant, with waxy, white-green leaves that grow in bud-like circles, is said to fetch $40 to $50 on the Asian market. While they are not rare in California and can be grown in nurseries, the process takes years. And nursery owners said they were not available in the huge quantities that Asian shippers seem to want. Freeling began investigating the thefts after getting a tip in January from an anonymous woman, who got stuck in a line at a post office in Mendocino County, 150 miles north of San Francisco, behind a man who was mailing dozens of boxes to Asia. Freeling said the man was holding up the whole line and and the boxes were dripping dirt. When the women asked him what he was shipping, the man said: “Shhhhh, something very valuable.” When she asked where he got it from, he pointed to the ocean. Thinking he had been tipped off to an abalone poaching ring, Freeling got customs officials to X-ray the 60 boxes. He was puzzled when what they found inside was not rare sea life but hundreds of plants of the species Dudleya farinosa being mailed to Korea and China. So began the search for dudleya smugglers. Soon Freeling found a man pulling the plants off a cliffside and shoving them into a big backpack. When Freeling asked him what he planned to do with the 50 plants, the man said: “They are for my garden.” But when Freeling confronted him about the thousands of plants being shipped through the post office, the man admitted he was shipping them for profit. The man, Xiao Yang, 41, of Elk Grove, California, pleaded guilty to unlawfully taking plant material and ended up with a $5,000 fine, 240 hours of community service and three years probation. In March, Freeling caught two men loading boxes and boxes of dudleya – about 850 large plants – into a van they had rented from the San Francisco airport. The men had both recently arrived from Korea on one- to three-month visas. On 4 April, three more men were arrested while denuding hillsides of dudleya – and over 2,000 more plants were found. Last weekend, an individual and a couple were caught taking small numbers of dudleya from the coast. And a bag of the plants was found abandoned in the parking lot of a Mendocino shopping center. “I have dedicated my career to catching poachers,” said the fish and wildlife department captain Patrick Foy. “But that has always been animal and fish poachers. Now we have this new kind of poaching: plant poachers.” While adored for their sculptural looks, succulents often make for finicky house plants because of their high light requirements and intolerance of overwatering. In the US, images of succulents are now almost cliche in trendy merchandise, with plastic replicas available in chain stores and succulents adorning T-shirts and even wedding cake decorations. They have become so popular in Korea and China that they are sold in huge emporiums, some the size of several basketball fields. In Korea, raising succulents is considered an “addiction” popular among housewives, students and others with small living spaces. Korean articles refer to the trend as “succulent fever” and quote wives telling husbands who complain about oversized collections not to worry because “I will take all of my succulent plants with me when I leave you”. In China, succulents are known as “fat plants”. China’s new class of consumers loves anything that is trendy in Korea, according to Alison Hulme, a lecturer at the University of Northampton and editor of the book The Changing Landscape of China’s Consumerism. Hulme said collecting dudleyas and other succulents may fulfill the quest for “suzhi”, or “quality of personhood”, sought by many in China’s burgeoning middle class ranks, because the plants require care and knowledge and show good taste. “I think things like this can quickly become a symbol of the middle class,” she said. “For the generation 30 and under, it’s important for them to show that they are the generation that got the privilege of buying things.” California native plant lovers came out in droves last week to help replant thousands of confiscated dudleyas into northern California cliffs. Kathy Crane, owner of Yerba Buena Nursery, one of the oldest growers of California native plants in the state, said her company had received numerous emails, Facebook messages and texts from Asian plant collectors looking for dudleyas. “We grow and sell this rare dudleya at our nursery,” advertised an instagram post from the company. “Much less expensive than a court case and jail time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/03/west-by-carys-davies-review-stunning-debut-novel-from-a-short-story-writer","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T06:30:34Z","webTitle":"West by Carys Davies review – stunning debut novel from a short-story writer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/03/west-by-carys-davies-review-stunning-debut-novel-from-a-short-story-writer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/03/west-by-carys-davies-review-stunning-debut-novel-from-a-short-story-writer","fields":{"headline":"West by Carys Davies review – stunning debut novel from a short-story writer","bodyText":"Carys Davies won multiple awards for her 2014 short story collection The Redemption of Galen Pike, a spare and wonderfully varied anthology that illuminated moments of human drama against the vast backdrops of landscape, history and myth. From the isolated wife fearing the visit of a neighbour in “The Quiet” to the nanny who is too much in love with her charge in “The Taking of Bunny Clay”, her stories overturned expectations with brutal, breathtaking flair: the world could shift in a sentence. In her slim first novel, again not a word is wasted; the canvas is as wide as her brush is fine. It opens abruptly, as though lights are coming up on a dark stage: “How far must you go?” “That depends.” “On where they are?” “Yes.” Gradually we orient ourselves; we are in Pennsylvania, 1815, where settler Cy Bellman is jolted out of grief for his dead wife by a curious notion: that the animals whose gigantic bones have recently been dug out of a Kentucky swamp might still be wandering about in “the unexplored territories of the west”. Despite the ridicule of his no-nonsense sister Julie, he equips himself with trinkets to trade with the natives and a new stovepipe hat to intimidate them and sets off on a one-man, thousand-mile expedition, promising to be back in a year or possibly two. “I have to go. I have to go and see. That’s all I can tell you.” His 10-year-old daughter Bess has no doubt he’ll return; Julie is equally convinced that he won’t; and their down-at-heel neighbour Elmer, labouring on the farm while Bellman is away, has increasingly ominous plans to become one of the family. The novel encompasses all their perspectives, as well as the Shawnee boy with the unpromising name of Old Woman from a Distance whom Bellman employs as a servant. Seasons pass in a sentence as Bellman makes his way west, pressing letters to Bess into the hands of travellers going in the opposite direction, scratching pictures in the soil of what he imagines the colossal creatures might look like and meeting only with blank faces or amusement. The extremities of his physical hardship are calmly described, and the grand vistas of wilderness – trees and rivers, the sky and stars, “the bright, broken face of the moon” – just as economically summoned. Of course, Bellman is not the only one on the move: Native Americans are being displaced from eastern territories as the line of European settlement advances. Old Woman from a Distance’s tribe moved west “like a dark, diminished cloud”, only discovering when they unpacked the goods they’d bargained for how badly they had been tricked. One elder prophesies “that a time would come when they would know that the whole of the earth had been pulled from beneath the skin of their feet” – that they will vanish into the setting sun as surely as the megafauna whose fossilised bones have gripped Bellman’s imagination. Extinction and collective loss, then, are the dark shadows cast by this story of individualistic folly and ambition, the counternarrative to all the endless possibilities projected on to the “unexplored” west. With marvellous economy, Davies maps the “large, unknown interior territory” where Bellman hopes to find his beasts on to her characters’ inner landscapes. Her narrative world includes vast open spaces of both incomprehension and possibility, as when Bellman and Old Woman from a Distance lie awake in the dark, with Bellman reassured by the boy’s alertness and the boy caught up in recollections of past atrocities. Bellman roars “Mine” when he finds the boy wearing his hat, but he never teaches him English; language, the boy thinks, is another weapon Europeans “did not want to give away”. The novel is studded with lists: of the meagre contents of Bellman’s house, the things he takes with him, the geegaws the settlers trade in exchange for an entire way of life. (The hat has a starring role.) What can be named is outweighed by everything that cannot. Enumerating the manmade elements of the frontier world highlights the fragility of humans within it, how little they have to shore up against the wilderness. The striped blouse and knitting needles that belonged to Bess’s mother, which she was so sorry to see her father take away, will return to her – but transformed beyond all expectation. One of the most unsettling elements is Davies’s vein of dark, gleaming humour. Her writing manages the odd feat of seeming both timeless and historically specific, and her comedy is no exception. Julie’s friend puts Bellman’s grand dreams down to no more than a male midlife crisis: “There’s a childish dissatisfaction with everything they have, Julie, that reveals itself as they approach forty … mostly in my experience they take up with other women or buy themselves a new horse or a fancy hat.” That Bellman’s name seems a tip of said hat to the hero of Lewis Carroll’s nonsense poem “The Hunting of the Snark” – another miniature epic about overblown ambitions and the search for wonder – in no way diminishes the seriousness of Davies’s project. She holds comedy and tragedy in equal, delicate balance. And she balances each individual consciousness against “the dizzying weight of all the mystery of the earth and everything in it and beyond it” – that unknown which so tempts Bellman. There are many worlds to explore within this deceptively short book, which gallops towards its conclusion with a mythic inevitability. You won’t be able to turn back. • West is published by Granta.

Pruitt said opponents of Donald Trump, and the media, had sought to “derail the president’s agenda and priorities” by highlighting the questionable use of taxpayer funds for first-class flights, office furniture and 24-hour personal security, as well as his use of a Washington apartment owned by an energy lobbyist’s wife. However, Pruitt did not offer explanations for the numerous revelations and did not deny that he authorized sizable pay increases for two staffers, against the White House’s wishes. “I wasn’t aware of the amount nor was I aware of the PPO [presidential personnel office] process not being respected,” he said, saying the matter was “delegated” to Ryan Jackson, his chief of staff. This contradicts a TV interview earlier this month when Pruitt said he had no idea about the raises. Pruitt has also previously falsely claimed that the lobbyist, Steven Hart, had no business before the EPA when he rented his wife’s apartment. Pruitt has come under severe pressure over the $50-a-night apartment deal, his spending of more than $100,000 from the public purse on first-class flights in his first year as EPA administrator, ostensibly to evade abuse from fellow passengers, as well as taking a large security detail on trips to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl. He also oversaw the spending of $43,000 on a soundproof booth for his office, in violation of federal rules, and has reportedly retaliated against staffers who questioned his spending. Pruitt is facing multiple federal government investigations over his conduct, including two different White House inquiries. Facing the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee, Pruitt departed from his prepared remarks to decry the “distorted” reporting that has exposed his activities. “I have nothing to hide as it relates to how I run the agency in the past 16 months,” he said. “Facts are facts and fiction is fiction. A lie doesn’t become true just because it’s on the front page.” Pruitt said he was “not afraid to admit there has been a learning process” and vowed to correct any problems within the EPA. But he said that those who have “attacked the EPA and me have done so to derail the president’s agenda and priorities and I won’t let that happen”. Pruitt declined to apologize but said the ethics scandals have proved a “distraction” to the EPA. He said he had no idea of the $43,000 spent on the soundproof booth and cited security concerns for the first-class travel arrangements, reading out threats to “put a bullet between your eyes” and another that said: “I hope your father dies soon in agony in front of your mother.” This was despite a recent report claiming that Pruitt flew in coach on some flights that were at his own expense. Committee Democrats poured scorn on Pruitt’s responses and repeatedly called on him to resign, in a combative hearing. “There’s seemingly endless misconduct, a pattern of putting personal and special interests ahead of the American people,” said Paul Tonko, a Democrat from New York. “You’ve abused this position for personal gain. You were never fit for this job.” Frank Pallone, another Democrat, said Pruitt had used the job to “enrich himself and his corporate friends” with the apparent approval of Trump. “If I were the president I wouldn’t want your help, I’d just get rid of you,” he told Pruitt. Pruitt has earned Trump’s admiration for his zeal in repealing environmental regulations and dismantling of action on climate change, such as Pruitt’s successful agitation for the US to withdraw from the Paris climate accords. Trump has tweeted that Pruitt is “doing a great job”. But in recent days the White House has sought to distance itself from the beleaguered EPA chief as the extraordinary number of ethical problems mounted. Sarah Sanders, Trump’s spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that “we expect the EPA administrator to answer” concerns raised by Congress. Environment groups and Democrats have called for Pruitt’s removal, joined by a small band of Republicans. During the committee hearing, Republicans praised Pruitt’s deregulation agenda but some also raised concerns over his spending. “These issues are too persistent to ignore,” said Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican. Others, though, sided strongly with Pruitt. “This is a classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that works against civility and respect,” said David McKinley, a West Virginia Republican, criticizing Democrats. Joe Barton, a Republican representative from Texas, used his time to ask Pruitt if he had rented a “party jet”. Pruitt said he hadn’t. “Well, that’s good,” Barton said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/28/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-angela-merkel-dandruff","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T14:51:12Z","webTitle":"Dandruff diplomacy: why Macron groomed Trump but Merkel got the brush-off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/28/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-angela-merkel-dandruff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/28/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-angela-merkel-dandruff","fields":{"headline":"Dandruff diplomacy: why Macron groomed Trump but Merkel got the brush-off","bodyText":"It is safe to assume that the Oval Office had never before witnessed the practice of dandruff diplomacy. Donald Trump, standing beside Emmanuel Macron, told reporters: “Mr President, they’re all saying what a great relationship we have, and they’re actually correct,” he said. “It’s not fake news.” The French leader grinned. Then, with unexpected intimacy, Trump reached for Macron’s shoulder. “In fact, I’ll get that little piece of dandruff off; you have a little piece. We have to make him perfect. He is perfect.” That night, TV host Stephen Colbert observed: “Mr President, Macron is still standing next to you, smiling, after hanging out with you for two days. That’s not dandruff – that’s cocaine.” But while many Americans rolled their eyes at 71-year-old Trump’s silverback impression, no less striking was the impeccable response of Macron, 40, graciously laughing along with the joke and giving no hint of being thrown off his game. Indeed, during the first state visit of the Trump presidency, the Frenchman offered a masterclass in how to play this most skittish of commanders-in-chief. Tactile and tactful, he established himself firmly in the front rank of Trump’s favourite leaders alongside Japan’s Shinzō Abe, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, China’s Xi Jinping and, most cryptically, Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Notably all are men and, in style or substance, strongmen. That bodes ill for Theresa May, who will host Trump in July, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The women lead fragile coalition governments, likely to be a sign of weakness in this US president’s eyes, and have proved unable, or unwilling, to flatter his ego. The contrast in body language was brutal on Friday when Merkel paid a lower-key visit and held a joint press conference. Behind the same lecterns in the East Room, Trump and Macron shared a man hug with the US president declaring, “I like him a lot.” Trump and Merkel engaged only in stiff handshakes. As they departed, Trump put his hand towards her back but did not touch. During the question and answer session, Trump rambled about how “Washington can be a very mean place; you don’t know about that, chancellor”, and joked about how quickly people in Germany can get fired. Merkel’s chilly reaction – eyebrows raised, a frown, a grimace, a forced half-smile – raised the question of how she would have reacted to the dandruff move. How to handle Trump’s improvisational, barely briefed approach to global affairs has been a puzzle for world leaders. “I think he wants to be liked,” said one western diplomat, who attended a meeting between Trump and his own country’s leader. “You’ve got to strike up a rapport, find some kind of common ground, find something that gets him in a positive frame of mind.” The diplomat, who did not wish to be named, observed how Trump sees foreign policy through the prism of relationships. “I would say personal rapport is probably more important with him than it would be with a more conventional president. The idea that getting on with someone is what’s crucial to the outcome of the discussions wouldn’t normally be the way people see it. But he’s inclined to see it as a question of personal chemistry. Even this Putin stuff, a lot of it is, ‘I think I get on with him, I think I could deal with him.’ “It’s a belief in his personal responsibility to shape things in his favour. As a businessman, as a dealmaker, as someone who’s been involved in real estate deals all his life, I think those kind of personal relationships he builds up are important to him, so I wouldn’t undervalue it all. But whether it produces the goods in the case of Macron, let’s wait and see.” The ‘Trump whisperers’ There has been keen competition for the role of “Trump whisperer”. A White House source said Macron and Abe, the prime minister of Japan, have spoken to the president by phone more often than any other leader. Abe was the first suitor at Trump Tower after the 2016 election, giving the president-elect a $3,800 golden golf club. He followed up at Trump’s luxury Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida soon after. When the American president reciprocated with a visit to Japan, he was treated to a state dinner, a white hat embroidered with “Donald &amp; Shinzo, Make Alliance Even Greater” in gold thread and a round of golf. Abe visited Mar-a-Lago again earlier this month and played another round. But is all this effort – undignified sycophancy in the eyes of critics – worth it? For Abe there is already talk of buyer’s remorse. Trump carried out this threat to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership and blindsided Tokyo by agreeing to meet the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, to discuss denuclearisation. Jon Alterman, a senior vice-president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said: “Where does it get you? There’s certainly an argument to be made in Japan that Abe has bent over backwards to court Trump yet on several crucial issues, like North Korea, Japan is outside the room looking in instead of inside the room looking out.” Others who cosy up to Trump could meet a similar fate. Dan Kurtz-Phelan, executive editor of Foreign Affairs magazine, said: “The Abe case is instructive. He was very good at the theatrics but once Trump’s priorities cut against Japan’s interests, it didn’t count for much. You can imagine it all falling apart quickly for Macron too. They both went out of their way to service Trump’s desires in a certain way and it served them until it didn’t.” However, some believe that, but for Abe’s charm offensive, things would be even worse for Japan. The Axios website reported: “Trump finds Japan’s trade practices and regulations to be very irksome. But he has a great personal chemistry with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, and would likely be going far harder on the country if their relationship were tense.” As for Macron, there will be a tangible measure of success or failure next month when Trump decides whether to heed his pleas to rescue the Iran nuclear deal. The French president could hardly have done more to woo him, starting with last summer’s Bastille Day parade in Paris that so wowed the US president that he wants a military parade of his own. This week he visited Mount Vernon – where the key to the Bastille, a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette to George Washington, is displayed – and hit grace notes at a state dinner of spring lamb served with jambalaya, a traditional Louisiana dish with French influences, followed by nectarine tart with honey and creme fraiche ice cream. Cheeseburgers and Trump wines were off the menu. Macron and Trump’s serial kissing, arm-patting, hand-patting and back-slapping offered threw the US president’s fumbling efforts to clasp his own wife’s hand into sharp relief. But while the French leader embraced Trump, he proceeded to skewer Trumpism in a speech to a joint meeting of Congress that gave a rousing defence of the liberal world order and predicted that America will one day return to the Paris climate agreement. At several moments Democrats stood to applaud and cheer while members of Trump’s cabinet remained riveted to their seats. It was a scene that illustrated the dilemma facing democratic leaders trying to curry favour with the most powerful person in the world while avoiding humilation before their own voters. There are no such concerns for Bin Salman, who rolled out the red carpet in Saudi Arabia and projected a five-storey image of Trump’s face on to the Ritz-Carlton hotel, or Xi, who duly provided what Chinese officials called a “state visit-plus”, a description Trump repeated with relish. And at a press conference with Macron this week, he slipped in a familiar line: “I have a very excellent, as you know, relationship with President Xi.” ‘Working visit’ If Trump does shred the Iran deal, it will be another win for Netanyahu, who has regularly showered him with praise. Last September, after Trump addressed the United Nations, the Israeli prime minister tweeted: “In over 30 years in my experience with the UN, I never heard a bolder or more courageous speech.” The US president has recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said little about the building of additional settlements or making concessions to the Palestinians. Perry Cammack, a fellow in the Middle East programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace thinktank, said: “I have to assume the Israelis are beside themselves with delight that pressure on settlements and the two-state approach are out of the window. For Trump, his evangelical base is very happy with that outcome.” Other relationships have not gone so well. May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump as president but things have cooled since then. When the US president retweeted anti-Muslim propaganda from the far-right group Britain First, May made her displeasure known. Trump’s one-day “working visit” to the UK on 13 July falls short of the state visit once promised. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, got off on the wrong foot by discussing in a phone call, subsequently leaked, an agreement in which the US would vet and take refugees who had been imprisoned after trying to enter Australia by boat. Trump complained that the deal was “stupid” and would “kill” him politically. Relations with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, also appear to have cooled over trade. Alterman, a former member of policy planning staff at the state department, said: “Trudeau seemed to be off to a strong start. The problem is the president likes to be the superstar in the room and Trudeau has a lot of star quality.” The pair may also be on different wavelengths. Alterman added: “The president perceives himself to be a skilled conversationalist and gracious host so there’s more to it than flattery. It’s also keeping up your end of the conversation and noticing things he notices. The president believes in personal chemistry.” He also apparently believes in the great man theory of history, with himself in the lead role. Michael Cornfield, a political scientist at George Washington University, commented: “There are a lot of populists – in Turkey, Hungary and the Philippines – and you would think Trump would forge alliances with them but not really. If anything is a special relationship, it’s Putin, and Xi may be playing him pretty well too with bombastic flattery and military stuff. They make Trump feel historic.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/03/ponti-by-sharlene-teo-review-a-vivid-coming-of-age-debut","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T07:59:35Z","webTitle":"Ponti by Sharlene Teo review – a vivid coming-of-age debut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/03/ponti-by-sharlene-teo-review-a-vivid-coming-of-age-debut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/03/ponti-by-sharlene-teo-review-a-vivid-coming-of-age-debut","fields":{"headline":"Ponti by Sharlene Teo review – a vivid coming-of-age debut","bodyText":"It’s the year 2020 in Singapore, and plans are afoot to remake Ponti!, a series of 1970s cult movies based on the traditional Malay legend of the Pontianak, a vengeful female vampire who preys on male flesh. The slick PR team for the film is led by a thirtysomething executive called Circe, who is recently divorced and enjoying all the freedom of a young woman in this furiously modern city state: a career in Asia’s rapidly growing entertainment industry, a shared apartment in the trendy neighbourhood of Tiong Bahru, hipster cocktails in bars in Chinatown. But when the film reels of the original series are screened in the office, Circe finds herself deeply unsettled, and not only because she’s fighting a mysterious parasite lodged in her gut. The haunting beauty of the original Pontianak, played by a long-forgotten C-list actor called Amisa Tan, is all too familiar to her, for she was the mother of her best friend in high school. Circe is forced to confront her 16-year-old self once more, along with the thrills, anxieties and confusion of that period of her life. In her debut novel, Teo artfully collects various stories and rolls them into one seamless narrative. It is at once a subtle critique of the pressures of living in a modern Asian metropolis; a record of the swiftness and ruthlessness with which south-east Asia has changed over the last three decades; a portrait of the old juxtaposed with the new (and an accompanying dialogue between nostalgia and cynicism); an exploration of the relationship between women against the backdrop of social change; and, occasionally a love story – all wrapped up in the guise of a teenage coming-of-age novel. At the heart of the book lies the mother-daughter axis of Amisa and Szu, a tall, awkward girl who can’t fit in at school. Struggling in her classes and shunned by the other girls, she spends her time trying, but mostly failing, to get along with her coldly distant mother and her aunt, who runs a thriving business as a medium in their shared house. This shabbily expansive property serves as an uncomfortable reminder of the father who left them when Szu was a child. When Circe, another seeming misfit, transfers to Szu’s school, Szu at last finds a friend and accomplice, even if the privileged and slightly ostentatious Circe represents the opposite of all that Szu has known. Together, they drift through Singapore’s shopping malls looking for boys. Even at 16, their lives are shaping into ever shrinking concentric circles. Teo is brilliant in her portrayal of teenage anxiety, with Szu’s school life being a source of menace at every turn, from the well-meaning teachers lacking in empathy to the coolly threatening mean girls. Even the pupil assigned to help her concentrate on her studies swiftly ends up exacerbating her misery. Szu’s angst is sharply drawn, but the sections on Amisa’s first years in Singapore are what lend the novel its particular pathos. Travelling from a small village in Malaysia to what was already a cosmopolitan city in the 1970s, Amisa struggles to carve out a place for herself. Despite her ambitions, she never truly believes she will gain fame and riches, not even when an Indonesian film-maker begs her to star as his Pontianak. Too weighted down by her past and her family – the trappings of poverty continue to dog her, even in Singapore – Amisa is destined to remain stuck in a halfway house, never destitute but never fulfilled, even as the city grows richer around her. Amisa’s sections, which run from the late 1960s to the 80s, are evocative of a time in Singapore’s history that feels gentler and full of colour and flavour compared with Circe’s slick, functional contemporary life, yet they never slip into lazy nostalgia. The city of Amisa’s early 20s may be rich in hope – ultimately dashed, in her case – but it is also full of danger. Predatory men, people out to make a fast buck: these are constants in a city where striving has always been a way of life. All the accumulated pressures of life in Singapore manifest themselves with beautiful irony in Circe. In one of the cleanest and most technologically advanced cities in the world, she is living with a tapeworm in her stomach – the kind of parasite usually associated with Singapore’s poorer neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia. “Somewhere along the line,” she reflects with characteristically Singaporean candour, “I must have been too busy to realise that I had eaten shit.” Ponti by Sharlene Teo (Picador, £14.99).

The child’s parents were granted an emergency hearing before a high court judge on Tuesday afternoon after they said the 23-month-old boy had been breathing unassisted since his life support was removed. His father later said that water and oxygen had been restored. Tom Evans and Kate James will ask that an order preventing Alfie’s removal from Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool be lifted. Roger Kiska, a solicitor for the group Christian Concern, said medical transportation was available to take Alfie to Italy, where he has been offered treatment, if they win the appeal. “We are asking to lift all orders preventing Alfie from leaving Alder Hey and allow him to go to Italy. There’s medical transportation ready at any moment to take him,” he said. “Everything is in place. We have no doubt that he would survive the trip. He would have full treatment, oxygen and everything, right to Italy. It’s in his best interests to get treatment at a hospital abroad.” Life support was withdrawn from Alfie, who has a rare degenerative brain disease, on Monday after an appeal to the high court was turned down. The boy, who has been at the centre of a protracted legal battle, is in a semi-vegetative state. Judges have agreed with doctors that further treatment would be futile and there is no hope of him getting better. Evans and James, who are both in their early 20s and from Liverpool, insist their son is not in pain or suffering, but they have lost cases in the high court, court of appeal, supreme court and European court of human rights. Alfie’s father told reporters outside Alder Hey on Tuesday morning that his son had breathed without assistance after life support was withdrawn. Evans said it became obvious he was breathing within a few minutes, although doctors re-intervened after he asked them to help. “They say Alfie’s suffering,” Evans said. “Well look at him now. He’s not even on a ventilator and he’s not suffering.” The high court confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that a judge would consider further issues in Alfie’s case in a hastily arranged hearing in Manchester, expected to begin in the next few hours. A spokesman for Christian Concern, which has been helping Alfie’s parents, confirmed its lawyers were on their way to Manchester for the hearing. Kiska later said Alfie’s parents’ latest legal attempt followed their son’s “miraculous survival” overnight. The solicitor said Alfie survived for about six hours after his life support was withdrawn, but doctors were then “forced morally to put him back on water and oxygen”. “Clearly, the hospital and court believed that by removing life-supporting treatment, he would pass away within minutes, but that proved to be false,” he said. Evans was asked what intervention doctors had made. “They left him for six hours without food, water and oxygen,” he said. “I felt blessed when they confirmed they were going to give him his water and his oxygen. He’s now on oxygen. It’s not changing his breathing, but it’s oxygenating his body. “He is still working, he’s doing as good as he can. But we do need him to be supported … In the next hour, it’s going to be hard, but we will need him to be supported in the next hour or two. “Because he’s been doing it for nine hours totally unexpected, the doctors are gobsmacked, and I do believe he will need some form of life support in the next couple of hours, and I think he ought to be respected and given that.” The toddler has been seriously ill since having a seizure in December 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/24/student-says-peking-university-trying-to-silence-her-over-claim-petition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T10:49:04Z","webTitle":"Student says Peking University trying to silence her over rape claim petition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/student-says-peking-university-trying-to-silence-her-over-claim-petition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/24/student-says-peking-university-trying-to-silence-her-over-claim-petition","fields":{"headline":"Student says Peking University trying to silence her over rape claim petition","bodyText":"A student activist calling for transparency over an alleged rape at China’s top university has accused the university of trying to silence her. Earlier this month, former classmates of a literature student at Peking University (PKU) who killed herself in 1998 came forward to say she had been raped by her professor, Shen Yang, who denies the allegation. PKU and two other universities subsequently cut ties with Shen and a group of current PKU students petitioned the school to hand over all documents related to the case. The case is at the centre of a small but growing #MeToo movement among students at PKU and other universities across China who have been calling for more accountability over sexual assault on campuses. The movement is unusual in an environment where any activism, especially among students, is closely monitored and stamped out. One of the students who signed the petition, Yue Xin, a senior at the university’s school of foreign languages, published a letter on Monday alleging harassment and intimidation. Yue said she has been called in for several meetings with school officials, often lasting until late into the night. She accused administrators of suggesting she might not be able to graduate and asking what her mother and grandmother would think of her behaviour. Yue claims that at about 1am on Monday, her adviser, accompanied by Yue’s mother, stormed into her dorm room, waking her and forcing her to delete all documents from her computer related to the petition. Afterwards Yue’s parents drove her home. She has not been able to return to school, Yue said in the letter, according to a translation by China Digital Times. Student activism at Peking University has a long history, dating back to 1919 when thousands of students protested against a treaty granting Chinese territory to Japan, the 4 May movement. In 1989, student activists converged again in Beijing on Tiananmen Square to call for reforms in demonstrations that were put down by force. Online searches for Yue’s name have been blocked and her post has been deleted, but not before users recorded it using blockchain technology. Others have circulated a screenshot of her letter upside down to avoid censors on the WeChat. A photo of a poster on a university bulletin board, a gesture reminiscent of banners and leaflets posted on the the school’s former “democracy wall”, used during the 1989 protests, circulated on social media. PKU’s school of foreign languages said on its website on Monday that Yue’s mother had been summoned out of concern because Yue could not be reached. “We always honour every student’s fundamental rights and make great effort to protect each and every student’s lawful rights”, the school said. According to Yue, the school responded to the petition by saying there were no minutes of the meeting where Shen’s behaviour was discussed. Because of an error, the relevant department did not have Shen’s statement on the case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/25/warwick-thornton-to-hand-deliver-sweet-country-to-dubbo-after-snub-by-towns-cinema","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T18:00:26Z","webTitle":"Warwick Thornton to hand-deliver Sweet Country to Dubbo after snub by town's cinema","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/25/warwick-thornton-to-hand-deliver-sweet-country-to-dubbo-after-snub-by-towns-cinema","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/25/warwick-thornton-to-hand-deliver-sweet-country-to-dubbo-after-snub-by-towns-cinema","fields":{"headline":"Warwick Thornton to hand-deliver Sweet Country to Dubbo after snub by town's cinema","bodyText":"The filmmaker Warwick Thornton will hand-deliver a copy of his critically acclaimed western, Sweet Country, to the community of Dubbo this Friday, following a months-long campaign to bring the film to the regional New South Wales city. More than 400 tickets have been sold to a one-off screening at the Dubbo Regional Theatre &amp; Convention Centre, to be held on 27 April. The screening will be followed by a Q&amp;A session with Thornton. A campaign to bring Sweet Country to Dubbo was spearheaded by Kellie Jennar, a local screenwriter, producer and cinema enthusiast. She became determined to bring the film to the city after discovering the only cinema in the area, Reading Cinema Dubbo, would not be screening it. “This is a culturally important film and they are the closest cinema within a three-hour round trip,” Jennar told Guardian Australia. “Sweet Country is a cinematic experience that should be seen on the big screen, in order to do it justice. I felt this was important particularly for the Dubbo community, due to our high Indigenous population. People really want to see the film. Why don’t they want to show it?” Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Jennar says she has been asking this question for months. According to the local resident, who has lived in Dubbo for the previous eight years, her emails to Reading remain unanswered. Sweet Country has not screened at any of the 20 cinemas operated by the company. In a post published on Facebook in February, a social media coordinator for the company wrote: “Sweet Country is on a very limited release and as such we are unable to show it.” Reading told Guardian Australia that nobody from the company was available for comment. In February, Jennar created the Bring Sweet Country to Dubbo Facebook page. She reached out to the film’s producers, Greer Simpkin and David Jowsey, who were happy to assist. “We were delighted to help arrange the screening in Dubbo,” says Simpkin. “In fact we have been contacted by a number of communities requesting a screening of Sweet Country in their region. “These have included a special screening with local schools and young people for Reconciliation week, and a ‘healing’ event between local police and the Indigenous community. We find it both moving and hopeful that Sweet Country has sparked community interest in this way.” Once Jennar identified the Dubbo Regional theatre as a potential venue, the process of screening Sweet Country encountered technical limitations. The venue is not equipped with the technology required to receive or screen encoded digital films. When this news was relayed to Thornton, the director offered to visit Dubbo and personally deliver the film. “Warwick will get to see the excitement and passion from the community about it,” says Jennar. “I’ve had a huge response from the local Indigenous community. I’m expecting about a 40-60% ratio, of Indigenous to non-Indigenous people, which I think is amazing engagement.” Sixty of the seats for Friday’s screening have been donated to local Indigenous elders. Some are expected to travel from as far as Brewarrina, more than 400 kilometres away. Dubbo has a small but devoted film community. The annual One Eyed film festival showcases locally-made short films, and the Dubbo Film Society (which has approximately 200 members) arranges monthly screenings of recent productions not included on the program at Reading. “It’s a pretty striving little place,” says Jennar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/24/toronto-shocked-silence-van-fatalities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T03:46:48Z","webTitle":"'This lady died in front of me': Toronto shocked into silence after van fatalities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/toronto-shocked-silence-van-fatalities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/24/toronto-shocked-silence-van-fatalities","fields":{"headline":"'This lady died in front of me': Toronto shocked into silence after van fatalities","bodyText":"It is rare to hear birds chirping along Yonge Street, a bustling six-lane thoroughfare that divides Canada’s largest city into east and west. But on Monday, as Saman Tabasinejad carried bouquets of flowers to the site where pedestrians were hit by a van in Toronto, she heard them. As evening fell, the road was empty, save for a two-kilometre stretch barricaded by police cars and officers. Most of the bars and patios – usually bustling as the work day wound down – were shuttered. The white rental van, with a crumpled front, was surrounded by at least nine police vehicles. The neighbourhood was now a crime scene, following the death of at least 10 people. Tabasinejad, 25, had spent much of the morning canvassing the area for the upcoming provincial election in Ontario – as a candidate for the New Democratic party – and was having more luck than expected: following a balmy weekend, a number of residents had taken the day off. “It was such a beautiful day. People just wanted to be out on the street,” she said. But as she left a sushi restaurant at about lunchtime, she saw swarms of firetrucks. She first worried there might have been an incident at the seniors centre across the street, until she noticed the debris: shoes, a mailbox and a fire hydrant scattered along the street. As she walked further north, she came upon three bodies covered in bright orange tarps. It wasn’t until just before 8pm – almost seven hours after the incident – that firefighters began to remove the bodies from the road. They formed a ring holding thick yellow tarpaulin around the deceased victims to shield them from gathering onlookers. ‘It could’ve been anybody’ Residents and passersby huddled at an impromptu memorial set up across the street from where the first victim – a young woman – was struck. They lit candles and signed messages of remembrance to memorialize the 10 lives lost. “It could’ve been anybody,” said Konstantin Goulich, who has lived across the street for 15 years and had purchased paper and markers from a craft store for the memorial. “We live in a unified society. And people support each other. The outpouring of grief here is evidence of this.” Tabasinejad planted a number of roses alongside the signed posters. “Each life had so much love. I just want to honour them.” Mehrsa Marjani broke down at the sight of the memorial and was comforted by her husband, Farzad. She had been at a cafe when the van struck its first victim at the intersection of Finch and Yonge streets. “This lady died in front of me,” she said. “People tried so hard to rescue her. They kept trying. But they couldn’t.” Messages of support were written in at least four languages, reflective of the diverse neighbourhood. The northern suburb of Toronto is home to large Chinese, Korean and Iranian populations – as well as a hub for new arrivals to Canada. More than eight hours after the attack, bewilderment hung heavily over the neighbourhood as residents who commute to other areas of the city returned home. “People were calling me at work, asking me if I was OK. I didn’t understand what they were talking about,” said Cristina Cibotaru as she surveyed the long lines of yellow tape. “This is such a safe place. I walk this road everyday.” A number of residents commented they’d never seen the street like this before. “The sun was setting, it should have been a beautiful moment,” said Tabasinejad “But the silence is deafening. It’s a little too quiet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/australia-books-blog/2018/apr/26/why-are-millennials-still-getting-married","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T18:00:03Z","webTitle":"Why are millennials still getting married? | Bridie Jabour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-books-blog/2018/apr/26/why-are-millennials-still-getting-married","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/australia-books-blog/2018/apr/26/why-are-millennials-still-getting-married","fields":{"headline":"Why are millennials still getting married?","bodyText":"When I was a teenager I used to declare that “marriage is an empty constitution”. I had misheard someone say “institution” once and, thinking it sounded grand and clever, I repeated the phrase ad nauseam for years. Then I hit my mid-20s and the wedding invites started flooding in, then as if on cue I sent out my own. In Australia, the average age for first-time marriage has risen to 29.9 for women and 31.9 for men. But still, millennials are getting married. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning We have watched our parents’ marriages disintegrate (well, half the time), been raised as feminists aware of the oppressive history of the wife, raged against the exclusion of our queer brothers and sisters, and become largely agnostic – but still, millennials are getting married. According to the last census, the marriage rate is actually on the rise – but in 2018, what possible reason is there for that? It’s a question that was rattling around my head for so long I ended up writing a novel about it; a book is a great way to ask people why they got married without sounding terribly accusing. My friend Caro married her longtime boyfriend before marriage equality was legalised and not only regrets the decision, but struggles to articulate why she did it. “I was almost a bit embarrassed we were getting married considering how strongly I identify with my progressive beliefs,” she says. For her, it was a matter of ticking boxes. “I didn’t want to have kids, I didn’t want to own a home, and I felt I needed to tick one of those boxes before I was 30. He proposed just before my 30th birthday. “The way society is structured, and the stories told from when we were little – if we don’t tick one of those boxes we feel like less of an adult.” It’s a theory the Australian writer Briohny Doyle explores in her book Adult Fantasy. “The sustained perception of marriage as a transition from the juvenile to the adult was brought home in a gross and practical way for me after I got my sparkler,” Doyle writes of her engagement ring. “When wedding plans faded, the ring became a prop. I wore it to job interviews, other people’s weddings, when speaking to the neighbours about our barking dog or loud music. It was a little bit of shiny proof I was a legit adult, a person of serious intents.” Millennials like me are still being written about as wide-eyed youths, but many are in their mid-30s now. We are thinking about how we are getting old and what ageing is going to look like for us. Most of us spent our 20s working for free or in the insecure gig economy, or getting a good job and then being stuck in the same pay bracket for years. In a property market on steroids, that leaves us with not many ways to feel secure. If you’re in a loving relationship, it’s the last raft you can cling to as you start staring down middle age. If you get married you can tell yourself at least someone loves you who is not your mum. So perhaps that’s part of it. But then someone can love you and be committed to you for life without signing a legal document. Gay couples in Australia have been forced to conduct their relationships that way until recently. But marriage – that official paperwork – still holds an allure. When talking to my friends about why they decided to get married in general, it seemed a lot more simple for the men. Caro says her partner pushed for the marriage to be a legal one. For reasons neither of them could really explain, it made him feel more secure if the marriage felt more “real”. Another friend held a commitment ceremony with his boyfriend before marriage equality was legalised; after that, they made it legal. “I wanted James and I to stand in front of the people we love and formalise our commitment to each other. I, maybe naively, feel like [getting married] makes you work harder to get through the tough times and is a constant reminder of how much you love or loved each other,” he says. “I think it was also, for me particularly, a desire to just be like everyone else; to feel included in something I see as the ultimate expression of love. It’s corny but I love love, and getting married is the pinnacle of that.” Another friend, Lucy, married her girlfriend in a big wedding that was not legally binding; she found herself single just as marriage equality was passed in Australia. She was young when she married – 25 – and looking back said her main reason was to legitimise her relationship in the eyes of others. “If I were straight I would have been way less inclined to do it – there is the conservative nature of marriage as an institution – but it seemed less expected for me to do it, so I wanted to do it,” she says. “Honestly it was about the romance, the gesture. I don’t just mean ‘love’ romance; I mean it being a big statement, a big movement in your life, a big change – which it ultimately wasn’t. I didn’t want to tell people I was married because I felt a little ashamed it wasn’t ‘real’, but also I felt like a pioneer. I romanticised it in that way, having made this statement. “I also felt like I was representing all gays ... I needed to prove we can do it better than straight people.” There are plenty of legal advantages to getting married. Although people argue that de facto couples have the same rights in Australia, it’s actually quite difficult to prove de facto status – and in extreme circumstances, say the hospitalisation of your partner, it’s much easier to walk in and say “that’s my wife”. But most millennials aren’t making the decision to marry because they are clear-eyed about the legal protections; for most, the reasons are far more complicated. If we are being brutally realistic, many marriages are probably not going to last. But the Great Barrier Reef is not going to last either, and we don’t know how much of the world is going to last if Trump and North Korea keep playing chicken. Perhaps getting married is an act of supreme optimism in what is the most anxious age to date; something to try to give solid footing to a generation who have been mainlining the internet and its accompanying anxieties for their entire adult lives. • Bridie Jabour’s The Way Things Should Be is out 1 May through Bonnier Publishing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/25/government-defends-live-export-ship-flagged-as-serious-cause-for-concern","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T22:02:31Z","webTitle":"Government defends live export ship flagged as 'serious cause for concern'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/25/government-defends-live-export-ship-flagged-as-serious-cause-for-concern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/25/government-defends-live-export-ship-flagged-as-serious-cause-for-concern","fields":{"headline":"Government defends live export ship flagged as 'serious cause for concern'","bodyText":"The federal department of agriculture says a live export ship that departed Fremantle with 75,000 sheep on board has complied with Australian standards, despite the Western Australian government describing conditions on board as “serious cause for concern”. An inspector from the WA department of agriculture inspected the Livestock Shipping Services (LSS) ship Maysora on 11 April, shortly before it left Fremantle bound for Turkey. The Maysora was the first live export ship to leave Fremantle after the release of whistleblower footage showing shocking conditions aboard five voyages from Fremantle to the Middle East in 2017, including a voyage on the Awassi Express in which 2,400 sheep died from heat stress. The inspector alleged that the sheep were crowded into pens and unable to lie down without being trampled. They also said many water troughs were either empty or dirty with faeces, and suggested some may have died. In a statement to Guardian Australia on Tuesday, a spokesman from the federal department of agriculture said conditions reported by the WA inspector did not reflect conditions on the rest of the voyage. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The majority of issues identified by the WA inspector were witnessed at the time a large volume of animals were being loaded on to the vessel for departure and do not reflect the conditions maintained on the voyage,” he said. The spokesman said the federal department received a copy of the WA report, which included photographs and video, on Friday. He said all the issues raised had been investigated by the independent vet on board the ship. “The department has confirmed that the health and welfare of animals on board is being maintained in accordance with the required Australian standards,” he said. The federal department said it was receiving reports, videos and photos of conditions on board during the three-week voyage, which is still ongoing. It said water was “clean and in plentiful supply” and only one animal was injured in loading. The WA agriculture minister, Alannah MacTiernan, said the vet did not participate in the WA inspection. The independent vet was appointed by the federal department of agriculture. An independent observer was made as a condition of sail on some ships in response to heightened public concerns following the release of the whistleblower footage. Live export ships are also required to travel with an accredited stockman, and ships to the Middle East are required to have an Australian-accredited veterinarian (AAV) on board. Guardian Australia understands the AAV was on board when the WA inspection was conducted but the independent vet was not. On Monday, MacTiernan said WA had received legal advice since the Maysora departed suggesting that state animal welfare laws could be used to block a live export ship from leaving port if conditions on board suggest “there is real risk of harm to animals.” “The findings of the inspection report from the Maysora remain a serious cause for concern; we await a formal response from the federal government to these concerns,” she said. The federal agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said he would “welcome cooperation with minister MacTiernan on this issue going forward”. MacTiernan previously warned the live export industry that WA would use its animal welfare laws to prosecute exporters if animals were exposed to “unnecessary harm”. WA began investigating Emanuel Exports under the Animal Welfare Act (WA) in March over the August 2017 Awassi Express voyage. The Awassi was due to depart for the Middle East again on 10 April but was barred from sailing by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which demanded improvements to the ventilation and feeding systems to bring the ship up to code. It was finally cleared for sail on Monday after three weeks of upgrades including installing an automatic watering system to all pens and improving the ventilation system, and is due to be loaded with livestock and depart for the Middle East later in the week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/25/collingwood-v-essendon-afl-anzac-day-clash-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T07:59:58Z","webTitle":"Collingwood thrash Essendon in ANZAC day clash – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/25/collingwood-v-essendon-afl-anzac-day-clash-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/25/collingwood-v-essendon-afl-anzac-day-clash-live","fields":{"headline":"Collingwood thrash Essendon in ANZAC day clash – as it happened","bodyText":"No surprises there after a very dominant performance from the midfielder.

Couple more goals will do it... Q4 05:08 Collingwood 12.16 (94) v Essendon 5.9 (39) Official crowd is 91,440 (eighth biggest in home and away history!) Not a great day for Essendon on perhaps their biggest stage of the year. Definitely not a great day for Brendon Goddard, with more vision rolling of him arguing with teammates. Treloar almost ices his medal with another goal - but it hits the bottom of the post. Reckon he’ll take it anyway. Q4 07:07 Collingwood 12.16 (94) v Essendon 5.9 (39) Love this vision - bit of fun but also quite an accurate representation of how exciting the Pies fans here today are! Why wouldn’t you be after such an extended period of misery and calls for your coach’s head! Ben Reid lines up for another goal from just outside 50, but it won’t make the distance. Goddard still booed every time he touches the ball. Phillips piles on the pain with a snap goal. Q4 10:08 Collingwood 11.16 (88) v Essendon 5.9 (39) Brilliant mark from Hoskin Elliott- diving back with the ball, just finds his outstretched fingers. Excellent work from Mason Cox too, with Goddard spilling the ball and Cox picking it up with ease, much to the delight of Collingwood fans. They’ll play Richmond next round, should be a huge crowd for that one. Q4 12:40 Collingwood 11.16 (82) v Essendon 5.9 (39) This could end up being the biggest margin of any ANZAC day clash, which is 71 points. Commentators are talking up Adam Treloar as the likely medal-recipient. Reckon they’re spot on, has regularly broken the lines today. Is up to 29 disposals now at 90% efficiency, with two goals. Stewart gets one back against the tide - after a nice pass from Stringer. There’s some respite for Bomber fans. Collingwood fans - you’ll creep up to fifth with the win today (from 13th!) Q4 14:50 Collingwood 11.16 (82) v Essendon 4.9 (33) Cox! That’s another really nice grab for the big man, but he misses to the left again. Brendon Goddard takes the kick-out and is getting plenty of boos from the crowd - not clear if from his own supporters or otherwise! Cox will have another chance to find the middle with another mark - this time in front of a raging Goddard. Five in a row for the Pies. The Colling-wood chant is in full flight now. Q4 17:06 Collingwood 10.14 (74) v Essendon 4.9 (33) Things continue to unravel for the Bombers, this time Devon Smith gets in the road of the ball being returned to Adam Treloar after a free, and it’s 50m. Not a lot of love for the Bombers from their own fans, or anyone much really. Aaaand, just like that, it’s another goal to Ben Reid. This one’s getting ugly. Q4 18:30 Collingwood 8.14 (62) v Essendon 4.9 (33) Some vision has emerged of Brendon Goddard having an argument with Joe Daniher at three-quarter-time, so I guess the common denominator is indeed Goddard. Not a great sign to see so much angst amongst the players. The quarter begins as the last ended - with Essendon pushing forward, but wayward on goal. Here’s some vision of the Zaharakis incident. Lovely kick by the Pies into the forward line, this time to Ben Crocker. He misses to the near side for just the behind. Nothing doing for the Bombers - Hurley runs onto a loose ball and kicks it out of bounds on the full... they’re playing a possession game with the lack of rotations and pace, but can’t prove any threat going forward. The quarter ends with a push deep into the Bombers’ 50, but it’s spoiled. Q3 04:41 Collingwood 8.13 (60) v Essendon 4.8 (32) Everyone getting into Goddard on Twitter, but to be honest the vision shows Zaharakis having a go at Goddard, not the other way around. Treloar with a soccered shot at goal but nothing giving as he hits the post. You get the feeling this could have been much worse for Essendon if Collingwood had been more accurate. Q3 07:10 Collingwood 8.12 (59) v Essendon 4.8 (32) Zaharakis has a chance to kick the Bombers’ second since quarter time, but he sprays the snap wide. This time Goddard finds Daniher on the lead – finally – but Zaharakis is visibly unhappy, admonishing Goddard for ignoring his lead. Not sure about that. Daniher meanwhile almost misses everything. Things falling apart for Essendon. Q3 09:20 Collingwood 8.12 (59) v Essendon 4.6 (30) Stephenson lining up for his eighth goal in two games - but it’s wide. Umpire ruled that he was infringed with the spoil, but not sure there was a lot in that. Essendon crowd now very quiet - we may have a rare fizzer of an ANZAC day match. Jake reckons both Melbourne and Essendon have failed on the big stage, but I reckon the Dees were brilliant in the third quarter against the Tigers yesterday. Richmond just played out of their skins (much like finals 2017) from there. Q3 12:10 Collingwood 8.11 (58) v Essendon 4.6 (30) Signs not good for Essendon- on the rebound Pendlebury finds Cox in a heap of space. Hasn’t been the most accurate to date (missed one and passed another off) but he goals this time. Pendlebury has to be in consideration for the medal, I’d say. Q3 13:30 Collingwood 7.11 (52) v Essendon 4.6 (30) Here’s one of Stephenson’s last goal – out in plenty of space. Bombers now have just the one goal in a quarter and a half, and have spent plenty of time chipping the ball around the backline looking for some space. They just can’t get any fluency going forward – need to take the game on more I’d say. A rushed behind for Essendon takes it to 22 points. Q3 16:15 Collingwood 7.11 (52) v Essendon 4.5 (29) That hurts, Collingwood with the quick rebound and Stephenson is all alone in the 50 without an opponent in sight. He kicks the easy goal, and it’s looking like the Pies’ day. Another half a minute later and Mason Cox looks to drill one for 45m out - but hits the post. Let off for the Bombers - have they got anything in response? Q3 17:43 Collingwood 6.10 (45) v Essendon 4.5 (29) News emerges that Josh Green has done a hamstring - which is further bad news for the Bombers with Begley already off with a knee. Stringer has an opportunity from 10m out, directly in front, and sprays it wide. Poor effort from Stringer after two goals in the first quarter. You get the feeling the Dons really needed that, and it was a lovely setup from Daniher after he won the free for hands in the back and then hit Stringer so close to goal. Pies look inspired at the moment - Murray wins the ball in the backline against three. Stephenson then wins the ball on the wing after a fist to the head from Saad, while McDonald-Tipungwuti leaves the ground with a limp. Essendon struggling to find targets, and Collingwood closing space well to force them to kick down the line. This time it ends with a turnover inside 50, and the Pies find all sorts of space on the burst. Varcoe’s snap just misses - but the lack of pressure was evident. That hurts for Collingwood- Heppell gets one against the flow of play after an errant clearance from Cox with just 18 seconds remaining. That’s the final score of the half. I’ll be back with you after a short break. Q2 03:55 Collingwood 6.8 (44) v Essendon 3.4 (22) Brilliant team goal for the Magpies - Adam Treloar’s 50m bomb sails through after four bounces and a nice assist from Jack Crisp (who both stumbled and fumbled the bounce before he found his teammate). Crowd gets involved again - the “Colling-wood” chant has started to resonate around the MCG. Worrying sign for Essendon, with very little pressure put on either Crisp or Treloar. Q2 04:51 Collingwood 5.8 (38) v Essendon 3.4 (22) Apart from Aish, Pendlebury and Sidebottom look dangerous for Collingwood – both former medallists on this day. Pendlebury has 13 at 85% efficiency and Sidebottom 11 with a couple of goals. Just the five disposals for Grundy after dominating the last few weeks. Goddard (18), Zaharakis (17) and Merrett (17) leading the way for the Bombers, but no sign of Stringer so far - who lit up the first quarter. Q2 07:42 Collingwood 5.8 (38) v Essendon 3.4 (22) Goal to the Pies! Hoskin-Elliott looks to take another contested grab inside 50, but it’s adjudged to have hit the ground. A bounce follows and Stephenson gets on the end of a hurried snap forward for a scrappy goal. That’s his first for the day after five last week. Crowd is up and about - danger for the Dons. Q2 08:47 Collingwood 4.8 (32) v Essendon 3.4 (22) Bombers finally get some space, but Tipungwuti drops the incoming pass, and Stewart is caught for a throw. Comedy of errors for both teams at the moment, unable to hit a forward target. On cue, Aish’s 17th disposal finds Hoskin-Elliott on the lead for Collingwood, and he’ll line up from 45m out. He can’t convert. Collingwood in particular missing chances - eight points for four goals. Q2 11:03 Collingwood 4.7 (31) v Essendon 3.4 (22) Daniher hasn’t had the best match so far, this time giving away a free into the back of Scharenberg (the fourth he’s given away for the match!) Reckon he could’ve come further up the ground towards Guelfi. Expected a long kick to his advantage instead of pressing for the ball. Ben Reid has been similar - dropped a few easy marks in the forward line. Either team would benefit from one of those firing. This time Daniher misses Smith, who turns the ball over as a result of defensive pressure. He’s going at just 40% efficiency. By contrast, James Aish looking good for the Pies on the wing. Q2 15:45 Collingwood 4.5 (29) v Essendon 3.4 (22) Hartley tries to pull off an aggressive switch into the middle, but the ball falls short of Smith and is turned over. Mason Cox is on the receiving end of it - 45m out with a nice contested mark, with no angle. Cox, however, chooses to pass it off - this one to Aish about 30m out on a 45 degree angle. He misses to the left - not sure Cox should’ve passed that off. Q2 18:00 Collingwood 4.4 (28) v Essendon 3.4 (22) Essendon confirm Josh Begley won’t be back for the day, while his almost namesake Baguley hasn’t had a possession so far and has been caught one out several times – Sidebottom worrying him. Grundy goes up uncontested in the ruck and the palm down goes straight to the Bombers - Zaharakis ending up with a snap on goal, but it’s off target. Thanks for writing in! Robyn emails: “I reckon the day should be shared around. Apart from anything else it’s a great money spinner. So many clubs would benefit from the injection of dollars, the national exposure and the consequent increased interest of sponsors. No club should own this day.” I think I agree, to be honest. I like Essendon’s involvement, thanks to Sheedy’s initiative, but the fact it’s against Collingwood does seem a little unfair given they’re probably the last club who needs the exposure/money (apart from perhaps Richmond). Then again - Good Friday has so far not taken off in the same way thanks to the form of the teams involved, and the suggestion there was to choose teams based on recent form. Is that fair either though? Seems to only benefit those performing and probably already succeeding aka least needing it. It’s a hard one. On Good Friday, I would’ve liked to see the AFL persist with North v Bulldogs (last year’s Good Friday clash) and see how that went. I think in some ways the repetition makes the rivalry, which makes the occasion. But you want it equitable. Sidebottom off the ground for Collingwood’s third! Mark Baguley looked to infringe as he ran into the square, but he soccered the goal through nonetheless. He follows up with a second in 30 seconds, this time with Baguley careering into the behind post as he attempts to tackle him. Hurley claims it’s touched, and we’ll have a score review. Very hard to tell if it has hit the side of his wrist - I imagine this will be umpire’s call (which is a goal). Decision is umpire’s call – and therefore a goal. Hurley hasn’t heard it and tries to take the kick-out. Reckon he might have touched that one... just judging by how convinced he was! Q1 02:16 Collingwood 2.4 (16) v Essendon 3.2 (20) Stringer is the first since Matthew Lloyd to kick two goals in the first quarter of an ANZAC day clash for Essendon. Looks set for the occasion. Essendon starting to get on top at the conclusion of this quarter - although Begley is icing the knee on the bench and likely (surely?) won’t take any further part. Phillips forces a point for the Pies from a wayward snap. Q1 04:42 Collingwood 2.3 (15) v Essendon 3.2 (20) Merrett tries to match the miracle goal, but his high-flying snap is off target. He’s straight back into the action again, however, this time with this 12th disposal – leading all-comers – and he finds Stringer on the lead for a chance at his second goal. He’ll kick from just outside 50, and nails it. Ominous signs from the Bombers’ star recruit. Q1 05:53 Collingwood 2.3 (15) v Essendon 2.1 (13) Looks like an injury to Josh Begley, who has hobbled off the ground and down into the race. That’s a worry for the Bombers in such a tight, tiring contest. De Goey with a brilliant soccered goal! Daniher had lined up against Grundy in the ruck, who had been dominated by Bellchambers, but he’s off the ground. Grundy won the easy tap and with the ball deep inside 50, de Goey slid forward for a freak goal. Q1 07:51 Collingwood 1.3 (9) v Essendon 2.1 (13) Oh no, Reid drops a sitter from Pendlebury, he had all sorts of space from his defender. He picks up the ball and snaps at goal, but misses. The ball rockets down into the Bombers’ forward line, and Stringer lines up for a Stevie-J style snap. It’s straight through the middle. Q1 09:40 Collingwood 1.2 (8) v Essendon 1.1 (7) Zach Merrett up to nine disposals after his concussion-affected start to the season. Howe caught in a one-on-one with Daniher and wins the contested ball, but then turns it over to Matt Guelfi with a poor kick. Luckly for Howe, he misses with an equally poor kick. Collingwood make them pay, Hoskin-Elliott down the other end picking off another nervy kick in defence. Q1 12:15 Collingwood 0.2 (2) v Essendon 1.0 (6) Collingwood on top in tackles - but largely because Essendon are winning the clearances. However, they’ve looked good and moved the ball fast when they’ve had it. Both teams looking good on the rebound, and both turning it over by foot. Hurley’s intercept marking making a difference for the Dons in the backline. Q1 15:24 Collingwood 0.2 (2) v Essendon 1.0 (6) Back in the side, Jackson Merrett takes a nice chest mark after being hit up by Dyson Heppell. It’s a shocker, off the side of the boot – looks to be heading out of bounds on the full, but Daniher takes the mark between two defenders and snaps the goal before they can get to their feet. Wonderful crowd in as I said, half the ground bathed in sunlight and the other in shade. Q1 17:38 Collingwood 0.2 (2) v Essendon 0.0 (0) Essendon dominating possession early but so far can’t hit the scoreboard, with just an out of bounds (via the point post) from Devon Smith. Collingwood, by contrast run the ball with fluency down the ground to set up Ben Reid with a nice contested grab. Great stuff by Varcoe to keep the ball just inside the boundary on the run. Reid hits the post from about 15m out, little angle. Collingwood win the toss, will kick to Punt Rd end This game is about to get underway, and it looks like the ground is packed. I’ll get an official figure for you when we have one. Essendon’s sash is looking particularly impressive, made up of poppies. There’s a free before the ball is even bounced, against Jake Stringer in his first ever ANZAC clash... The minute’s silence was mostly observed I admit I thought the phone might’ve been ringing in the office, but seems it was at the ‘G. There’s a familiar face at the ‘G today The reaction on Twitter hasn’t exactly been complimentary so far. We’re listening to the New Zealand national anthem currently. Should the game be played between different teams? Enjoyed this article from Richard Hinds during the week, questioning whether the traditional occasion should be extended beyond Collingwood and Essendon. His suggestion is to rotate the clash between all 18 clubs – to ensure that each club plays once every nine years, and perhaps sooner when the game falls on the weekend. One person who wouldn’t love that is my friend Steph, whose birthday happens to fall on ANZAC day and attends every year with her husband-to-be, Ben, who barracks for Collingwood! Happy Birthday Steph! What do you think about sharing the day around? Would love your thoughts! Teams have run through the joint banner Both are now lined up on the MCG for the traditional ANZAC procession and presentation which will culminate in The Last Post. Powell-Pepper suspension released Yes, it’s not about this current game but I’ve just been tied up reading and publishing the latest on the Port Adelaide midfielder’s suspension for “inappropriate contact with a female”. You can read all about it here: Hello everyone and welcome to this edition of the traditional ANZAC day clash between Collingwood and Essendon.

We must reframe it honestly","bodyText":"Internecine sparring over immigration within the Coalition is merely a warm-up for what looms as potentially the biggest electoral risk to a Shorten Labor government. The significance of the contributions of Abbott, Dutton, Morrison et al in the past fortnight is not just about Coalition policy on the appropriate annual permanent migrant intake, it is about landing on a unified story to wedge the ALP. That the lead on the issue is coming from the presumptive candidate to roll Malcolm Turnbull if the leadership finally collapses should come as no surprise. As the minister for home affairs, immigration and border protection overseeing an extended mandate, Peter Dutton has the tools at his disposal to play the immigration card howsoever he sees fit, from crackdowns on migrant cheats to referential treatment to white South Africans. Dutton with the active backing of a murder of rightwing commentators is raising permanent immigration as a political problem to be fixed. Our cities are overcrowded, the argument goes, migrants are a burden when they don’t assimilate quickly, look at what’s going on in Melbourne with the Sudanese, something must be done! While the official government line as articulated by treasurer Scott Morrison remains the economic benefits of immigration outweigh the costs, the government has also been at pains to point out the annual intake of 190,000 is a target only, and the government is actively tightening access. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday This opens the way for symbolic “rejections” of “unworthy” Australian citizens to drive headlines of immigration crackdown while doing nothing to alleviate the underlying problems of cities that aren’t able to keep pace with growing populations. This is dangerous territory for Turnbull. By locking in immigration at 190,000 he is opening himself up to attack from his conservative rump as well as from One Nation on more explicitly racial grounds. But it also provides a significant risk for Labor. If Dutton does replace Turnbull on a wind back immigration platform, Labor will find itself in a three-way wedge between a populist nativist agenda, economic growth principles and an activist/Greens movement that will call out anything perceived as anti-immigrant as a lurch to the right. So where are the Australian public currently placed on the immigration issue? In spite of the protestations of the spirited economic defence of recent days, there is a strong majority who believe immigration levels are too high. The significant numbers are the large increase since October 2016 and the strong consensus between voters of the two major parties. But dig a little deeper and there is a clear driver to attitudes around immigration – and that is that population is growing too fast. It’s worth staying here for a moment. Population growth looms as a more honest and less emotive way of addressing the concerns underlying our attitudes to immigration, because all of a sudden we are focusing on the common experience of a growing population rather than individual immigrants. For example, when we ask people what the big problems with our cities are, immigration emerges as a lower tier issue, behind the mismanagement of the property market and failure to invest in infrastructure. Similarly, extending the debate to population allows for a broader investigation of Australia’s intake system, particularly the classes of short-term visa which dwarf the permanent immigrants by a factor of more than 10. What emerges here is that if you chunk down our intake there are different debates to be had around different classes of population growth. While there is scepticism with increasing intake of all classes, the outlying classifications are predictably refugees but also temporary skill shortage visas (TSS, replacing the 457 visas), which are used to plug perceived holes in the supply of local workers. Student visas are integral to our burgeoning education export industry, holiday visas are integral to the tourism industry, skilled and business visas have expanded as more wealthy individuals have earmarked Australia as a home. The common thread is debates about these programs are all deliberately clouded as permanent immigration numbers become the proxy war. A more detailed series of questions create a more nuanced starting point for an immigration debate. Just take the top three statements as a unifying storyline – immigration has been great for Australia but our cities are struggling to keep pace with growth and we don’t like the way short-term work visas are undermining local jobs. Strip out any race-based rhetoric, and there’s the foundation for a productive discussion about the sort of country we want to have. Take the three lowest rating statements and you can see how a “take your immigration medicine it’s good for you” is counterproductive and probably does more harm than good. This is a complex and emotive issue. Progressives need to be clear about what they are arguing about. A mindless embrace of the economics of growth or the casting of racist aspersions against anyone who argues for lower intakes both play into conservative’s hands. Instead we need to reframe the immigration debate honestly, recognising the widespread concern about rising population levels due to a failure of government investment before calling out the economic short-sightedness of short-term working visas. It goes something like this: In attacking Australia’s permanent migration program a Dutton government is exploiting frustrations with poor government planning to tear at the fabric of our modern, open society. Migrants invest in Australia. They commit to our joint future – they participate fully and make us stronger. Short-term visas are a transaction, and like all transactions they have a cost as well as benefits. If we are concerned about population levels, it is these short-term economic visas that should be a focus, not our long-term commitment to permanent immigration that should continue to enjoy bipartisan support."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/widening-access-and-outreach-award-winner-and-runners-up","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T20:30:32Z","webTitle":"Widening access and outreach: award winner and runners up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/widening-access-and-outreach-award-winner-and-runners-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/widening-access-and-outreach-award-winner-and-runners-up","fields":{"headline":"Widening access and outreach: award winner and runners up","bodyText":"Winner: Birkbeck, University of London Project: The Compass Project In mid-2016, the news agenda was dominated by stories of migrants and refugees making long and dangerous journeys to Europe. Stories of people reaching the UK but facing an uncertain future prompted debate across the higher education sector. At Birkbeck a group of academics and professional staff formed a working group to explore how they could respond to the crisis, and decided to create the compass project. Most mature asylum seekers possess little or no documentation showing their academic readiness, and are ineligible for student financial support. This meant that, even if scholarships were offered, many experienced difficulty in accessing UK universities. The compass project decided to reach out to this community, fund university study for 20 asylum seekers and provide academic and peer mentoring support. A dedicated staff member acts as a case worker for all participants on the project, offering intensive support that deals with specific challenges faced by this community. Birkbeck also hosts workshops and activities to provide people in refugee and asylum seeking communities with the knowledge and skills to start their academic journey. The university has engaged 98 asylum seekers, welcomed 64 onto campus and in October 2017 enrolled 20 onto degree level study. Birkbeck now sits on three working groups - Refugee Activities and Initiatives Forum, Student Action for Refugees and Refugee HE Network - and has advised other universities to develop work in this area. Runner up: Nottingham Trent University Project: NTU progression scheme In the recent Social Mobility Index, Nottingham and the East Midlands were among the poorest performing areas, with young people from deprived neighbourhoods often denied the chance to experience upward social mobility. Nottingham Trent University (NTU) progression scheme aims to tackle this. The scheme offers disadvantaged young people tailored academic support and traditionally unobtainable developmental activities, such as attending and critiquing a theatre production, securing a work placement and participating in challenging outdoor activities such as horse riding and rock climbing. Post-16 participants are granted special access to the university learning rooms and library, so those without a suitable study space at home could use the facilities. The university committed to engaging participants in a sustained programme of activities over a period of several years in advance of university entry. In addition to outreach work, the university designed a further suite of activities to prevent students from dropping out. This included application support for a place on the university’s paid student ambassador scheme, academic support sessions provided by the NTU Library, and additional subject-specific learning opportunities delivered by the academic team. NTU progression has successfully engaged 350 young people from the region, with 96% of participants from underrepresented backgrounds. The programme has boosted their educational outcomes, with 82% of the first cohort enrolling at a UK university. More than a quarter of this first cohort enrolled at NTU. Of the first cohort that enrolled at NTU, 92% successfully progressed to their second year of study at their first attempt. Runner up: University of Sunderland Project: Identifying and supporting estranged students Starting university is an exciting time for most students, but for estranged students, without the support of parents or carers, it can be very daunting. In January 2017 Sunderland joined 14 other universities by signing the stand alone pledge and promising to support students who have become permanently separated and estranged from a support network. Estranged students are young people studying without the support and approval of a family network who often have no contact at all with their family and may have removed themselves from a dysfunctional situation. Many of these isolated and often vulnerable young people do not ask for help, so a major challenge is finding and identifying students as estranged. Sunderland worked with a focus group in February 2017, attended by a number of estranged students and senior staff. A student-led action plan recommended a number of practical steps, such as having a named contact in the accommodation team and an identified place to stay in an emergency. Mental health and wellbeing support were also identified as crucial, while the waiving of deposits and access to accommodation 365 days a year were also recommended. Students are now given a personalised package of support, including guaranteed accommodation for the whole year, secure storage for belongings during vacations or while studying abroad, someone to act as a guarantor if required, as well as a £1,500 scholarship and other forms of pastoral support. The team also support all aspects of the application process for students, including course choices, feedback on a personal statement and interview tips and hints. Sunderland is now working with 27 estranged students - a figure that is continuing to grow. Join the Higher Education Network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Nearly two decades later, Vučić himself is Serbia’s president. Claiming to have shed many of his former nationalist views, and brushing off accusations of authoritarianism, he is now seen by the international community as the man who could sign an agreement that would eventually bring reconciliation over Kosovo. The former province of Serbia pulled away from Belgrade under international supervision after the Nato air campaign, and proclaimed independence in 2008. Serbia still considers the territory its own. In an interview with the Guardian in Belgrade this week, Vučić said he believed there is now a brief window of “six months or a year” in which it might be possible to sign a deal. “We are ready to discuss every single issue, we are ready to take into consideration every single proposal that would mean a compromise solution,” he said, provided Serbia is offered something in return. Kosovo is recognised by more than 100 nations, but there are still five EU countries that do not recognise it, mainly because they fear it could set a precedent for their own domestic territorial disputes. Nor do China, India and Russia. The hope in Brussels is that a deal could be struck that would lead to Belgrade acknowledging if not formally recognising Kosovo’s independence, and would pave the way for Kosovo to take a seat at the UN and for both nations to begin a path towards EU membership. Vučić has been playing up these hopes, but in return wants a package of benefits for Serbia. He is already involved in regular EU-supervised dialogue in Brussels with Kosovo’s president, Hashim Thaçi, which attempts to implement the provisions of an interim agreement signed five years ago. Thaçi also told the Guardian last week that he expected a comprehensive agreement to be reached this year. Vučić has also spent the past months engaged in a whirlwind of meetings with western leaders, trying to convince them that they should offer a compromise solution that brings concrete benefits for Serbia rather than simply acquiesce to the facts on the ground. That Vučić could be the one to sign the deal is remarkable, given that in the 1990s he was part of the Radical party, which sought a Greater Serbia and supported the Serb political and military formations fighting in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Vučić, however, is a man of contradictions. He dominates the country’s political scene, having transformed the presidency from a largely ceremonial role to the centre of power after moving over from prime minister’s seat last year. Unlike other domineering leaders, however, there are no wild gesticulations or frothing oratory. His voice rarely rises above a mumble, and he uses whispered emotional appeals, portraying himself as a tireless martyr for the Serbian cause. “I am squeezed on a daily basis,” he said. “It’s mainly Kosovo to tell you truth. Everything else is peanuts. I have invested at least 400 days so far in the last four years since I became prime minister, only on Kosovo. It takes your energy out, and people don’t see it, they don’t understand it.” After meeting Angela Merkel in Berlin this month, he said he had not been able to sleep the night before and was unable to eat during the meeting because he was so nervous about the fate of Serbia. Vučić’s critics say this is all part of a carefully constructed image of a selfless fighter for Serbia that masks a raw drive to consolidate power. “This is kind of a new style in world politics, creating a public image as the ‘best’ person in Serbia,” said Boban Stojanović, of Belgrade University’s faculty of political science. “But actually we have corruption, little free media and are on the path to a one-party system.” The EU and other institutions have also criticised Vučić for a media crackdown, an accusation he brushes off, saying the media atmosphere is partisan on both sides and complaining of a “campaign 24/7 against me” from independent media. European leaders may be willing to extend credit to Vučić though, both because he is seen as able to deliver a compromise package on Kosovo that a weaker leader would not be able to sell to Serbian public opinion, and because of desires to counter Russian influence in the region. The European council president, Donald Tusk, who was in Belgrade to meet Vučić on Wednesday, said after their talks that he viewed the Serbian president as a soulmate and that Vučić was “living proof that you can be at the same time a strong patriot and a reasonable pragmatist”. At a time when relations between Russia and the west are at a low point, Vučić perhaps more than any other world leader is walking a tightrope between the two, insisting European integration is a top priority for Serbia while maintaining very close links with its traditional ally in Moscow. In a sign that he still performs a careful balancing act between past and present, he declined to say whether he would refer to nationalist Vojislav Šešelj, his former political mentor, as a war criminal, after a UN court in the Hague this month overturned an acquittal for inciting crimes during the 1990s. But he did say he regretted many of his own earlier nationalist outbursts. “Do you know someone in the entire world that is not a sinner? I haven’t met that guy so far. The difference is that I do acknowledge that and I was totally sincere with our people.” Vučić is still only 48, and many say that with his appetite for power and sense of historical mission, he could be planning to stay around for the long haul, perhaps eyeing a decades-long reign of power in the mould of Milo Djukanović in neighbouring Montenegro. “I can guarantee it’s not going to happen,” said Vučić, briefly laughing before transitioning back to his characteristic beleaguered whisper. He said he would “most probably not” stand for the presidency again in 2022: “I don’t have that kind of energy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/24/lieke-martens-barcelona-ronaldinho","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T09:16:52Z","webTitle":"Lieke Martens: ‘Ronaldinho was my idol. Long hair, great dribbles … I loved him’ | Suzanne Wrack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/24/lieke-martens-barcelona-ronaldinho","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/24/lieke-martens-barcelona-ronaldinho","fields":{"headline":"Lieke Martens: ‘Ronaldinho was my idol. Long hair, great dribbles … I loved him’","bodyText":"The girl playing football in the small Dutch town of Bergen in the late 90s did not know there was a women’s game. Instead her idol was Ronaldinho. Why? “Because I was a Barça fan,” says Lieke Martens. “He had long hair like me and great dribbles. I loved him. He was technical, made a lot of goals.” Watch the Netherlands and Barcelona midfielder now and one can tell why she is a fan of the Brazil great. Her Cruyff turn, back to goal, to take out two Belgium players, leaving one on the floor, as she drove forward at Euro 2017, is a taste of the 25-year-old’s ability to trick and turn her way out of the tightest gaps. The European Championship, hosted in her home country, catapulted Martens into the spotlight but in women’s football her talent was well known. With 20 goals in 29 games for Rosengard she could have had her pick of Europe’s top sides but when the Catalan club swooped, the decision was easy. “I played against Barcelona in the quarter-final of the Champions League with my previous club – the way they played I really liked it,” she says. With Barcelona’s investment in their women’s team a new development, the signing of Martens, the English forward Toni Duggan, María Pilar León from Atlético Madrid and Élise Bussaglia from the German champions, Wolfsburg, was a statement of intent. “I signed before the Euros,” Martens says. “For me it was really important to sign before, so I was clear in my head and free for the Euros.” Martens shone from the first whistle and when her flighted pass from the corner of the box found the head of Shanice van de Sanden to hand the Netherlands an opening victory over Norway, it was just the start. She was chosen in the team of the tournament, named player of it, and in the final she squeezed a shot between two Denmark players to give the Oranje Leeuwinnen (Orange Lionesses) a 2-1 lead after they had trailed to a Nadia Nadim penalty. “Playing a final is amazing,” she says. “There’s even more pressure but I really trusted the team. When we went behind to the penalty I think we scored really quick, and then we got the lead, 2-1, then before half-time it was 2-2. I remember at half-time we said to each other, ‘Come on girls, we really believe we’re going to do this’, and then we won 4-2. The trust in the team was so big during the tournament.” At no point did she believe they would fall short: “Even when we conceded in the final, it was the first time we had gone behind, but I had no worries, nothing, that we would lose that game.” The Netherlands were outsiders, ranked 12th in the world. Germany, France and England were the favourites. So at what point did the host country realise they could win it? “We felt good after the group stage – we had nine points, we won all the games. I really felt then that something was possible. When we beat England 3-0 in the semi-final I thought: ‘Right, now we have to win this final.’” The opening match in Utrecht was attended by 21,732 people and as momentum built, a sea of orange would flood the streets before games. “That was amazing, the whole tournament was amazing,” she adds. “The first game was sold out and during the tournament we got more and more people really happy and wanting to see us play. In Utrecht the big celebration day was amazing. We really felt the support [for] the whole tournament.” A remarkable 4.1 million watched the final on Dutch TV and more than 110,000 watched their six sold-out matches at the stadiums. “Players get recognised in the street now,” Martens says. “Some players are famous. We’re role models for a lot of girls now and some boys. A lot of boys are fans of us over the men’s team.” It has not stopped – 30,238 watched the 7-0 win over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier in Eindhoven this month. Martens, who has played for clubs in five countries, won the Best Fifa women’s player award and was Uefa women’s player of the year for 2017, and for the latter she flew to Monaco in a private plane with Lionel Messi before receiving the trophy alongside the men’s winner, Cristiano Ronaldo. Martens is currently focused on getting to France 2019 (the Netherlands are top of their qualifying group) and on catching Atlético, who are one point ahead of Barça with five games to play. “We’re going to do everything to win – that’s all we can do. We are independent of them. I hope they are going to drop some points. It would be great to win the title in my first season in La Liga.” The girl who dreamed of being Ronaldinho is the poster girl for young female players, and it is a role she does not take lightly. Martens will use any platform to show women can play, and is taking part in Uefa’s #PlayAnywhere competition (part of the @WePlayStrong campaign), which ends on 30 April, where girls post videos of themselves playing in unusual places. “When I was young,” she adds, “I had no idea there were women players or what I could achieve and now we are role models. Of course I wanted to be involved.” Talking points • Jacqui Forster, founder of Women at the Game and former Supporters’ Direct worker, has died aged 55, nine years after being diagnosed with breast cancer.

You can read our latest story on the incident here. 10 people have been killed and 15 injured after they were hit by a rental van, driven along the sidewalk in Toronto for more than 2km The incident began at about 1.30pm at a busy intersection in the city’s north The majority of victims are yet to be identified The driver, 25-year-old Alek Manassian, is in custody after being arrested in a dramatic confrontation with a police officer Police said the actions “definitely looked deliberate” but they don’t know what motivation was behind it Police said all lines of inquiry remain open but there is no suggestion based on current information that there is any link to national security Authorities have urged witnesses to contact police with any information The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, expressed sympathy for the victims and their families, and praised first responders. “We are monitoring this situation closely, and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians.” The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has issued the following statement: It was with great sadness that I heard about the tragic and senseless attack that took place in Toronto this afternoon. On behalf of all Canadians, I offer my heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of those who were killed, and my thoughts for a fast and full recovery to those injured. I thank the first responders at the scene who managed this extremely difficult situation with courage and professionalism. They faced danger without hesitation, and their efforts no doubt saved lives and prevented further injuries. We should all feel safe walking in our cities and communities. We are monitoring this situation closely, and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, and former Canadian PM Stephen Harper are among those who have expressed condolences to Canada and the people of Toronto. The Toronto Star has published an editorial, praising the city’s residents and authorities for their responses to the tragic event. Police “stuck to the facts”, and the public “by and large also refused to indulge in finger-pointing or blame-throwing”, it said. There was no over-reaction, in particular by the arresting officer. This confrontation could easily have ended in yet another death, and it must have taken remarkable restraint to avoid shooting in the heat of such a charged moment. The driver is alive to face justice and, just as important for the public good, to give his own explanation of why he inflicted this horror. All this speaks very well of the city we call home. We cannot prevent all violence in our midst; there will always be individuals who lash out for personal or political reasons and take innocent life. But we can do something about how we react collectively when we come under attack. It would have been all too easy for things to have turned very ugly very quickly in the wake of Monday’s attack. Police have set up a web portal for witnesses to share videos and photos of the incident. A quick summary of that press conference, where we heard from the police chief, Mark Saunders, the premier, Kathleen Wynne, the minister of public safety, Ralph Goodale, and the Toronto mayor, John Tory. The death toll has now risen to 10, with 15 people injured after the man - now named as 25-year-old Alek Menassian – drove off the road and into a number of pedestrians over the course of several kilometres at about 1.30pm. The majority of victims have not yet been identified. While the actions “definitely look deliberate” police have not identified any motivation. There is nothing to link the act with any national security situation and the city is safe, they said. Police are calling for witnesses to contact them using a dedicated hotline or web portal. Some further points from the press conference: Authorities are assessing Canada’s threat level, but the city is safe, says Saunders. The majority of victims have not yet been identified. Toronto police are leading the homicide investigations, but they are working in concert with federal and provincial counterparts. Saunders is being asked about a range of possible motivations but will not be drawn on any of them. The investigation is ongoing. Charges have not been laid yet. Saunders praises the training of Canadian police to use as little force as possible, when asked about the peaceful arrest of Alek Minassian. Reporters are asking further questions about national security. The police chief, Mark Saunders, says the minister didn’t dismiss the possibility it was terrorism-related, but that the information currently didn’t find any connection. “We are looking very strongly to what the exact motivation was for this particular incident to take place.” “The actions definitely look deliberate,” he later says. The driver, Alek Minassian, is not known to police. There is no current suggestion of a national security risk because of this incident, says Ralph Goodale, Canada’s minister of public safety and emergency preparedness. “On the basis of all available information at the present time there would appear to be no national security connection to this particular incident,” Goodale says. “The events ... are horrendous but they do not appear to be connected in any way to national security based on the information available at this time.” Kathleen Wynne, premier of Ontario, praises the first responders for a professional and comprehensive response. She says the outreach from across the country has been “outstanding”. “People across the country are thinking about what’s happening here in Toronto, thinking about the families and the victims.” Toronto mayor, John Tory, says he hopes for people who live in Toronto “this tragic incident is not representative of how we live or who we are or anything to do with how we live in this city on a day-to-day basis”. He hoped people would “carry on – with heavy hearts – but carry on”. Tory calls for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact the police. Police a short time ago sent out the following message: Anyone with information is asked to please call the investigative hotline at 416-808-8750. A web portal has been opened for anyone who is able to submit photos and/or videos of the incident, please click here. Police are also asking the public to please refrain from calling 911 unless they are in a life or death emergency. The death toll has risen to 10, according to the police chief, Mark Saunders. Police have named the driver as 25-year-old Alek Minassian from Richmond Hill, Ontario. Social media identifies him as a college student. Police have cordoned off an area stretching close to a kilometre, for the investigation, which involves several levels of law enforcement. “It’s going to take some time to process the scene,” Saunders said. More than six hours after the incident bodies remain in the street, covered in bright orange tarps, reports Leyland Cecco from the scene. An impromptu memorial had already been set up less than 50m from one of the victims. “It could’ve been anybody,” said Konstantin Goulich, who has lived across the street for 15 years. “We live in a unified society. And people’s support and outpouring of grief is evidence of this.” A short time ago a playoffs game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins opened with tributes to victims of the fatal incident. CBC has spoken to a number of eyewitnesses. “I just came out from a subway station and I saw a crazy van, a rental van, hitting people one after one,” said one man. “I saw an old man going up and going down. The people were screaming and going around. He drove really fast.” Taxi driver Nana Agyeman-Badu described one woman being hit at a bus stop. He and another driver stopped. “The two of us were trying to help her, telling her she’s going to be OK.” Citing government officials, CBC says the driver is not associated with any known terrorist organisations. We are working to confirm that. A press conference will be held in about 15 minutes. Toronto councillor John Filion represents the Willowdale neighbourhood in north Toronto, where the attack occurred. He spoke to CBC a littler earlier. “It’s just a shock that it could happen in our city, that it could happen anywhere in our city,” he said. “The area I represent is, you know, very harmonious. We have people from all over the world and everybody gets along very well. You know, you rarely even encounter an angry person in the area. “It’s just, you know, incomprehensible.” Premier of Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, spoke to media a little earlier. “I’ve been briefed by the provincial security advisor and what I want people to know is that all levels of government and police services are working together. The OPP, the RCMP, and the Toronto police service, all levels are working together and the information is flowing among those organisations,” she said. “There is no gap there and I will continue to get updates.” Ten of the victims were taken to Sunnybrook hospital’s trauma centre. A spokesman gave a press conference a little earlier. He said two injured pedestrians who were taken to the hospital had succumbed to their injuries. Another five were in a critical condition, and three were in a serious condition. One of those in a serious condition was previously in a fair condition, but deteriorated. All of the victims were adults, the spokesman said. Authorities were still in the process of identifying the two deceased, he said. We’re expecting to hear another update from Toronto police tonight, local time. There is still no official word on the driver’s motivation. The Toronto police remain the lead agency investigating the attack, but support has been provided by Canada’s Mounted Police Force, the agency usually responsible for national security matters. Toronto’s mayor, John Tory, has issued a statement on what he described as a “cowardly and incomprehensible attack”. “Our city denounces this and all acts of violence and we are united in our grief over this devastating loss of life,” he said. “I encourage the people of Toronto to come together in support of those affected by this tragedy and those working to keep us safe – in particular to help the police by providing information. “I ask everyone to await the result of thee police investigation and avoid speculation. Instead we should show the world that Toronto is a city that will not be cowed, will not be afraid, and will not waver in the values we hold dear.” Vision posted to Twitter shows the stationary van, with extensive front-end damage. The driver confronts police with what appears to be a gun. Police can be heard telling the man to get down on the ground. “Kill me,” he tells officers. An officer responds: “No, get on the ground.” The man says: “I have a gun in my pocket.” Police warn him if he doesn’t not get on the ground, they will shoot. The suspect is then arrested without firing any shots. Ralph Goodale, Canada’s public safety minister, has described the incident as a “horrific attack” and thanked brave local police officers for their response. This map shows the path of the van, according to current information. The first reported collision was near the corner of Finch Avenue and Yonge Street. The van continued along the sidewalk for almost 3km along Yonge Street. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has made a statement about the Toronto incident on Twitter, thanking first responders and expressing his sympathies to those affected. Witnesses have shared horrific first-person accounts of the scene near the Toronto intersection, on the corner of Yonge Street and Finch Avenue East. Christian Ali, who drove down Yonge Street shortly afterwards, said he saw three people lying in the street. “There was a lot of blood flowing,” he told the Guardian. “Everyone was in sheer shock.” The Globe and Mail spoke to Michele Kelman, who was walking back to work after lunch with a friend at the time. Kelman said she heard screams and turned to see the white van heading towards her down the sidewalk. She was unhurt, but could not find her friend. “My friend was gone,” Kelman told the Globe and Mail. “I couldn’t find her body for a while. There were a few around. And there were people trying to bring her back.” Kelman said her friend did not survive. Details about the incident are scant. But this is what we know so far: The van mounted the kerb at a busy intersection in the northern suburbs of Toronto on Monday afternoon, about around 1.30pm local time. It continued almost 3km, striking dozens of pedestrians. Police have so far confirmed nine people are dead, and another 16 are injured. The van was a rental. The driver fled from police but was detained and arrested. Witnesses and video posted on social media suggest the man had aimed what appeared to be a gun at police, before being detained. Local media are reporting the man’s identity, but law enforcement are yet to officially confirm the name. A van has struck pedestrians in Toronto, Canada, killing nine people and injuring 16. The van appeared to mount the curb and continue down the sidewalk, mowing down pedestrians as it went. The driver has been arrested. But questions remain about his motives, and investigators are yet to confirm the act was deliberate. Stay with us. We’ll bring you developments as they happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/social-and-community-impact-award-winner-and-runners-up","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T20:30:29Z","webTitle":"Social and community impact: award winner and runners up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/social-and-community-impact-award-winner-and-runners-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/social-and-community-impact-award-winner-and-runners-up","fields":{"headline":"Social and community impact: award winner and runners up","bodyText":"Winner: Swansea University Project: We won’t keep you hanging on - how the Health and Wellbeing Academy has reduced NHS waiting lists The Health and Wellbeing Academy (HWA) in Swansea University’s College of Human and Health Sciences offers affordable and flexible health services to the local community. Established in 2016, it aims to offer support, advice and information to help people improve their own health and wellbeing through early identification and diagnosis of conditions. The academy offers a wide range of services including osteopathy, audiology, bereavement care, cardiology and pregnancy related services including, breastfeeding support, hypnobirthing, postnatal support and positive parenting. There is also a private GP service and regular health events are held in collaboration with charities including the British Heart Foundation. The project leaders liaise closely with partners in the NHS, allowing the academy to help reduce waiting times for treatment and plug gaps in provision. Many of the services offered are not available through the NHS, or in the region. The academy also runs a further education programme designed to strengthen the local health and life science sector by bringing health sciences to life for the students. So far, the academy has treated 2,659 new patients and delivered 15 different health and wellbeing services. All profit from services is reinvested back into research and education. Runner up: De Montfort University Leicester (DMU) Project: De Montfort University and HMP Leicester partnership, learning together The partnership between De Montfort University Leicester (DMU) and the city’s prison has helped transform the fortunes of the once-troubled jail. The university ran Learning Together teaching workshops where prisoners and criminology students studied side-by-side, while students constructed a memorial garden for prison staff, and revamped the prison visitors’ room. DMU also helped to organise one of the first-ever classical concerts in a prison, through a performance by a 32-piece orchestra, in addition to a two-week arts festival, called Talent Unlocked. A prison research conference was also held inside the prison and at DMU. The latest annual prison rankings has seen HMP Leicester rise from 104th position – just five spots off bottom place – to 47th in the space of one year. The partnership with DMU is one of the reasons why the prison has improved so rapidly. The prison has also experienced a 21% reduction in violence, bucking trends seen elsewhere in the country. DMU funded the majority of the programme, which has involved more than 20 staff and 200 students across 15 projects since 2016-17. For students, the project was an opportunity to gain a unique experience of working in a challenging environment with people from different walks of life. Academics also benefited from the opportunity to adapt their teaching methods to a new environment. Runner up: University of Manchester and University of Sheffield Project: The industrial strategy commission The industrial strategy commission aimed to provide independent, research-based insight to inform national policymaking. Among its recommendations, it urged the government to tackle regional imbalances by committing to universal basic infrastructure, providing every citizen with decent transport, schools, hospitals and digital access. The commission was a joint initiative by Policy@Manchester at the University of Manchester and the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute (SPERI) at the University of Sheffield. It was established with a nine months deadline, so that its final report would be released at a critical time, ahead of the government’s planned industrial strategy white paper in the autumn. The final report launch was attended by over 100 senior figures from policy and industry, including influential political figures Lord Heseltine and Lord Willetts and advisors from the department for business, energy and industrial strategy, the treasury, and the cabinet office. The commission’s work achieved national news coverage and greatly influenced the government’s vision for a new UK industrial strategy in its white paper, which reflects the commissions emphasis on regional inequality. The commission involved a wide range of academics, and held evidence sessions across the country, taking submissions from businesses and think tanks.

The Republican-led Senate panel approved Pompeo’s nomination on Monday in a mostly party-line vote of 11 to 9. All but one of the committee’s 10 Democrats voted against Pompeo, who has served as Trump’s CIA director since January 2017, while all of its 11 Republican members voted in his favor. Leading up to the vote, it looked as though Pompeo might be the first ever secretary of state not to receive a positive recommendation from the panel. But Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the only Republican who had voiced his opposition to the nomination, cleared the way for Pompeo’s approval by switching his position just before the vote. Paul, a libertarian who had cited concerns with Pompeo’s support for the Iraq war and torture tactics, said he made the decision after speaking several times with Trump and meeting with Pompeo. “After calling continuously for weeks for Director Pompeo to support President Trump’s belief that the Iraq war was a mistake, and that it is time to leave Afghanistan, today I received confirmation that Director Pompeo agrees with President Trump,” Paul said in a statement. “President Trump believes that Iraq was a mistake, that regime change has destabilized the region, and that we must end our involvement with Afghanistan. “Having received assurances from President Trump and Director Pompeo that he agrees with the president on these important issues, I have decided to support his nomination to be our next secretary of state,” he added. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware became the lone Democrat to break ranks after a procedural mix-up left the vote in limbo. Coons had recorded a no vote, but switched to help advance Pompeo’s nomination after Republican Senator Johnny Isakson was unexpectedly absent. Although Isakson voted yes by proxy, a senator must be physically present to cast the deciding vote. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, grew visibly emotional while praising Coons for showing “a statesmanship that I’m not accustomed to seeing in the Senate”. Pompeo is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate later this week, albeit with the support of just a handful of Democrats facing tough re-election battles in November. Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, both Democrats from reliably conservative states, announced in separate statements on Monday that they would vote to confirm Pompeo. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, another vulnerable incumbent Democrat, backed Pompeo last week. Trump nominated Pompeo for the role last month after unceremoniously firing his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, in a tweet. Pompeo had forged a close rapport with the president through their daily intelligence briefings. But despite being confirmed last year as CIA director without encountering any significant hurdles, Pompeo’s nomination to lead the state department sparked swift backlash from Democrats, who cited his prior controversial remarks on Muslims and the LGBT community. Pompeo’s support for torture techniques and proclivity for military options also factored into the opposition. During his confirmation hearing earlier this month, human rights groups sounded the alarm over Pompeo’s refusal to unequivocally disavow enhanced interrogation methods. Democrats also chafed at Pompeo’s reluctance to state whether he would resign if the president were to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the federal investigation into Russian interference in the US election and potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, suggested it was unpatriotic of Democrats to oppose Pompeo, telling Fox News on Monday: “Democrats have to decide whether they love this country more than they hate this president.” The transition at the state department comes at a time when Trump is dealing with several complex foreign policy challenges.

Questions also remain over the future of US engagement in Syria and the escalating conflict with North Korea.

Liverpool council is showing its hospitable side too, posting “Benvenuti a Liverpool” signs in Roma colours around the city and hiring a ukulele band to serenade the 1,000 Italians expected through John Lennon Airport on Tuesday morning. A concerted effort is being made to change the European experience outside Anfield following the Manchester City bus incident. Inside, however, Liverpool want more of the same from fans and players alike. The billing as well as the build‑up to this semi-final has altered for Liverpool since City were vanquished in the last eight. Klopp’s team thrived on the ferocity of Anfield and the opportunity to shatter City’s mantle as favourites. Not that anyone associated with Anfield held Pep Guardiola’s team in that regard although now, following Liverpool’s 5-1 aggregate triumph, the greater expectation rests on the unbeaten highest‑scoring team in the Champions League this season. Roma’s reward for an astonishing comeback against Barcelona is a second European Cup semi‑final in their history, their first since beating Dundee United en route to losing against Liverpool in the final at Stadio Olimpico 34 years ago. It is a defeat that still burns. Liverpool are in their 10th semi-final seeking an eighth European Cup final appearance. History does count, even though none of this Liverpool team were born when Roma were beaten in 1984, but Klopp and his players would prefer to be free of the pressure that expectation brings. Jordan Henderson said: “I don’t think we are under extra pressure because I still see us going into this game as the underdog with them beating Barcelona, who were probably favourites before the last round.” The captain was reminded of Liverpool’s 5-1 defeat of a City team labelled by Klopp as the best in Europe before the quarter-finals. “Yes, but that’s just us doing what we are capable of doing,” Henderson responded. “We need to keep doing that again and again and again. “This is a huge challenge, a huge test. Roma are a fantastic side with fantastic players as they have shown throughout the Champions League this season. We have got to keep improving because we need the perfect performance if we are going to get the right result.” Klopp also believes his team’s performance, and the Anfield atmosphere, must step up a level to overcome Eusebio Di Francesco’s men. The Liverpool manager, who will be taking charge of his 150th game with the club on Tuesday, said: “Most people in the football world thought the last four would be Bayern, Barcelona, Real Madrid and City. Barcelona are not here because of Rome and City are not here because of us. We both deserve to be here. Maybe a lot of people think the real final should be Real Madrid v Bayern Munich but that will not happen because they are in the other semi, so one of us will go through. “That is a big chance for both of us but a big job to do. We are both in a good moment. Anyone who watched Roma in the last few weeks can see they are flying with different lineups. They made seven or eight changes in the last game and still won comfortably. “We really feel the opportunity. It is a big thing. We came here with not a lot of expectation. We only came here expecting to win the games. People ask me if I feel pressure. No. I only feel opportunity. I am really happy to be here and to have another big night at Anfield.” Klopp had not congratulated Mohamed Salah on his PFA Player of the Year award in person before the manager met the media at Anfield on Monday. He did have a word of advice for the Egypt international signed for £36.9m from Roma last summer – a player with 41 goals so far this season, 14 in his past nine games at Anfield. Both clubs know so much depends on the forward in this semi-final. “Italian defenders are famous for not having friendly games,” Klopp said. “So I think Mo will feel very early in the game that they are not his team‑mates any more. Then he can strike back in a football way.” Henderson, who voted for Kevin De Bruyne in the PFA award (players are not allowed to vote for their team‑mates), is acutely aware of the part Rome plays in Liverpool’s history. “We definitely take inspiration from Liverpool’s history,” Henderson said. “But our focus is to create our own and for people to be looking back at this team in 20 or 30 years’ time and saying how good we were, how special this year was or the next few years will be. “This is what you play football for, huge games like this against top European sides. As a footballer, these are the moments that you dream about playing in. Everything that has gone before it, every struggle and every test, will put you in good stead for a game like this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/24/tsb-customers-online-banking-chaos-accounts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T23:00:19Z","webTitle":"TSB bank faces large compensation bill and fines over online chaos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/24/tsb-customers-online-banking-chaos-accounts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/24/tsb-customers-online-banking-chaos-accounts","fields":{"headline":"TSB bank faces large compensation bill and fines over online chaos","bodyText":"TSB’s botched IT “upgrade” has snowballed into a full-scale crisis, with up to 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts for a sixth day, MPs demanding action and the bank facing a potential multimillion-pound compensation bill and regulatory fines. In one of the worst IT problems to hit Britain’s banking sector in years, TSB took all its internet and mobile services offline for emergency repair work, after a migration to a new platform over the weekend backfired. TSB’s chief executive, Paul Pester, apologised for the chaos on Tuesday morning, promising that services would resume by the afternoon and that “no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these service issues”. But at the end of the working day, and with TSB branches closed, customers were still unable to access their accounts online. Customers reported waiting for more than an hour to get through to the phone banking service. Owners of small businesses said they were unable to pay salaries or manage transactions, while some account holders found all their direct debits had disappeared. Lee MacDonald, a former actor who starred as Zammo in Grange Hill, was among the small business owners affected. He said his company, Mentor Lock and Safe Company, in Wallington, south London, had “literally stopped”. In TSB branches, some customers were told it could be another 48 hours before they could access their accounts properly, while the bank’s website said some issues, such as one-time passwords and Isa transfers, would be fixed by the end of April. The crisis began on Friday night, when TSB began a long-planned migration of 1.3bn customer records away from former parent company Lloyds Banking Group’s IT systems, on to a platform created by TSB’s new Spanish owners, Sabadell. The job should have been completed by 6pm on Sunday. Pester admitted that, in one glitch, customers were shown entries in other accounts: “402 customers could see some data that we would not normally show them online.” While most TSB account holders had been able to continue using their debit cards to make payments and withdraw cash from ATMs, many alleged the problems were deeper than the bank was admitting. Outside a branch in the City of London, Mac, a retired photographer, said he was appalled by the bank’s problems. “All my direct debits have disappeared,” he said. “They were there yesterday but gone today. And there’s something saying the last payment was in 2099. I’ve also had to change my password to get into the account. “The thing that most infuriates me is the statements coming out of the bank. They are not being honest. They keep saying it’s ‘intermittent’ when it’s not. At first I tried to phone. I was on the line for an hour but then gave up and came down here. They have told me it will be sorted out in 48 hours from today, but I don’t know what to believe.” Alex, who runs a professional consultancy firm, said outside the branch: “I have salaries to pay today. I’ve had to come down here to arrange for a bulk transfer over to HSBC, and we’ll have to pay the salaries from there. “I tried calling the helpline, but after a while the line just goes blank. We’ve had grief with them ever since we were moved from Lloyds. They’re not really a business bank.” Many have called for compensation similar to the £70m RBS paid out after the previous big IT meltdown in banking in 2012. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP and chair of the Treasury committee, has written to Pester to demand answers; he will also contact the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). “This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems,” Morgan said. “It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money. “Warm words and platitudes will not suffice. TSB customers deserve to know what has happened, when normal services will resume, and how they can expect to be compensated.” Multimillion-pound bonuses to Pester and 30 other senior TSB staff, which were dependent on the IT migration, are now under threat. The payouts, which include a £1.6m bonus for Pester, were frozen after TSB was forced to delay the move from Lloyds to Sabadell last year. TSB’s remuneration committee has yet to decide whether to pay the bonuses.The FCA and the Information Commissioner’s Office said they were investigating the problems. They have the power to fine TSB for the botched system upgrade and data breaches."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/24/uncontrollable-grief-of-kim-jong-un-over-north-korea-bus-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T04:05:05Z","webTitle":"'Uncontrollable grief' of Kim Jong-un over North Korea bus disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/uncontrollable-grief-of-kim-jong-un-over-north-korea-bus-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/24/uncontrollable-grief-of-kim-jong-un-over-north-korea-bus-disaster","fields":{"headline":"'Uncontrollable grief' of Kim Jong-un over North Korea bus disaster","bodyText":"Kim Jong-un expressed his “bitter sorrow” over the deaths of dozens of Chinese tourists after their bus plunged off a bridge in North Korea. The state-run KCNA news agency reported on Tuesday that the North Korean leader had visited two Chinese survivors of the crash on Sunday in which 32 Chinese and four North Koreans died. In his first reported visit to the Chinese embassy on Monday, Kim was quoted as saying he felt “uncontrollable grief” over the accident in North Hwanghae province. The display is another sign that Kim is attempting to portray himself as a conventional leader – equally at ease offering sympathy to victims of tragedies as making fiery pronouncements – ahead of Friday’s summit with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, and another planned meeting with Donald Trump in late May or early June. The agency quoted Kim as saying the North Korean people “take the tragic accident as their own misfortune”. North Korean authorities would do all they could “to alleviate the pain of the bereaved families”. Li Jinjun, China’s ambassador to North Korea, thanked Kim and said his visit to the embassy demonstrated the two countries “unbreakable and great friendship”, according to an account of the meeting by Yonhap news agency. Having spent the first six years of his leadership appearing at North Korean factories and military units, as well as making occasional forays to concerts, amusement parks and sports facilities, Kim made a surprise trip to China in March, amid a thaw in relations between Pyongyang and Beijing. While the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was a regular visitor to the Chinese embassy, his son reportedly avoided direct contact with Beijing’s officials in Pyongyang as bilateral ties were tested by the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and China’s support for UN security council sanctions. Last week Kim took another step towards normalising his country’s image ahead of the summits when he gave his wife, Ri Sol-ju, the title of first lady, putting her on a par with Moon’s wife, Kim Jung-sook, and Melania Trump. North Korean media had previously referred to Ri as “comrade”. It is reportedly the first time the title of first lady has been given to the wife of a North Korean leader since 1974, when it was used to refer to Kim Song-ae, the second wife of the regime’s founding leader, Kim Il-sung. The Chinese tour group was travelling from Kaesong, near the border with South Korea, to Pyongyang when the accident occurred, according to NK News. China’s health ministry said it was sending a team of medical experts, equipment and drugs to the hospital, where two Chinese were said to be in a critical condition. While many North Korean roads are poorly maintained, the stretch between Kaesong and Pyongyang is among the best in the country and sees little traffic. Chinese tourists make up about 80 percent of all foreign visitors to North Korea, according to the Korea Maritime Institute think tank. Tourism generates revenues estimated at 44 million USD a year for the country’s economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/24/business-council-says-exempting-banks-from-coalitions-tax-cut-would-punish-customers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T05:56:53Z","webTitle":"Business council says exempting banks from Coalition's tax cut would punish customers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/24/business-council-says-exempting-banks-from-coalitions-tax-cut-would-punish-customers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/24/business-council-says-exempting-banks-from-coalitions-tax-cut-would-punish-customers","fields":{"headline":"Business council says exempting banks from Coalition's tax cut would punish customers","bodyText":"Exempting the big four banks from the Turnbull government’s planned corporate tax cut would “punish” their customers, shareholders, staff and the economy, the Business Council of Australia has claimed. On Tuesday the BCA appeared before a Senate inquiry that was called in response to the council’s non-binding commitment that its members would increase investment if the company tax cut was passed. The inquiry comes as public outrage at revelations of widespread misconduct in the banking royal commission makes the Coalition’s task in advocating for its 10-year company tax plan increasingly difficult. The BCA chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said the evidence heard by the banking royal commission was “deeply concerning”. She said there should be “swift, decisive” action by regulators and banks should repair the harm they had caused their customers. But Westacott said the parliament should not “throw the baby out with the bathwater” by exempting them from company tax cuts, as senator Derryn Hinch has suggested. “To use tax policy to punish a sector of the economy will only punish their customers, shareholders and staff,” she said. “Taking a populist punishment action is not the way to deal with revelations of the royal commission.” Labor senators at the inquiry pursued a document they believe is a draft of the pledge, including an intention to increase tax transparency, but Westacott repeatedly said that was an early draft of a document to address concerns about offshoring and the future of work. She said the issue of tax and the future of work had been separated at a meeting chaired by the BCA executive director and former acting federal director of the Liberal party Andrew Bragg, who may now be called to give evidence on Thursday. The BCA used its evidence to take aim at senator Tim Storer’s justification for opposing the cuts, with its president, Grant King, arguing “the absence of a broad tax reform agenda should not be a reason to delay any tax reform”. In his opening statement, King referred to the need for a “competitive” tax rate – or a variant thereof –11 times. He said he was “confident in treasury modelling that shows over half the benefits from reducing the company tax rate to 25% [would] flow to Australian workers and households”. Executives from companies including JBS Australia, Qantas and Woolworths were not able to tell the inquiry how much more they might invest if the corporate tax cuts go ahead. The Australia Institute’s chief economist, Richard Denniss, rejected claims company tax cuts were needed for Australia’s competitiveness. He cited the fact that countries with lower company tax rates still invested in Australia, and Australian companies also invested in some countries with higher tax rates. Denniss said it was “controversial to say the least” to argue there was a link between company taxes and wages. He noted that would imply the Turnbull government’s $1.5bn a year bank tax may have led to wage cuts. In a heated exchange with Labor senators, the Institute of Public Affairs’ director of policy, Simon Breheny, suggested the Senate inquiry would have a “chilling effect” because contributors to public debate would fear their words could spark an inquiry. When asked about the BCA’s investment commitment, Breheny described it as “neither here nor there” – noting that it could have made an “iron-clad commitment” to increase wages but had chosen not to. On Tuesday Storer said he was still not intending to pass the company tax cut because it was a “narrow change” rather than part of a broader tax reform debate, the rationale he gave for refusing to pass it in March. Storer told Radio National he was concerned about the government’s ability to return the budget to surplus. He ruled out horse-trading his vote for action on another issue, promising to decide in an “evidence-based manner” – including by looking at the results of the first tranche of cuts for companies earning less than $50m. Asked about exempting banks from tax cuts, Storer said the royal commission had made “extremely disturbing findings” but the issues were “distinct and separate”. “That royal commission will continue on, the company tax cut is relevant to all companies and as such I will not be seeking a carve-out for banks as proposed by other senators,” he said. Storer said he was persuaded growth and jobs would increase but the boost would be “modest, relative to its cost”. He suggested increased infrastructure spending instead. Pauline Hanson has qualified One Nation’s support for company tax cuts, suggesting some portion of it should be quarantined to ensure that banks pay to compensation to their customers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/24/falsifying-forms-and-impersonating-clients-among-revelations-at-banking-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T08:47:27Z","webTitle":"Falsifying forms and impersonating clients among revelations at banking inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/24/falsifying-forms-and-impersonating-clients-among-revelations-at-banking-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/24/falsifying-forms-and-impersonating-clients-among-revelations-at-banking-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Falsifying forms and impersonating clients among revelations at banking inquiry","bodyText":"National Australia Bank’s top executives complained about having their bonuses “shaved” after it was discovered hundreds of NAB employees under their charge had been falsifying client documents. One NAB executive argued it would send the wrong message to NAB’s leadership team and encourage them to sweep future scandals under the carpet. It has also been revealed a former ANZ financial adviser advised his clients to invest in a luxury marina apartment for $1.6m through their self-managed super funds, but when it failed to sell he siphoned off $100,000 and ANZ declined to compensate his clients. And the inquiry heard a client would have lost $500,000 in superannuation if she had followed the advice of a celebrity adviser whose staffer impersonated her on phone calls. They were among damning revelations heard at the banking royal commission on Tuesday. As they were being aired, the law firm Slater and Gordon announced it was partnering with global litigation funder Therium to investigate a major investor class action against AMP after more than a billion dollars was wiped from AMP’s market value after it admitted to lying to the regulator. On Tuesday, the banking royal commission heard that a former NAB financial adviser, Bradley Meyn, had lost his job in 2016 after doctoring a client’s documents, but that further investigations led NAB to discover the practice was widespread among NAB staff. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning An internal NAB review in early 2017 found 353 NAB staff had falsely witnessed the signing of client documents, despite not being present during client meetings, to help colleagues who had failed to properly complete financial forms for their clients. The NAB executive Andrew Hagger admitted on Tuesday that a culture had developed in part of NAB whereby document falsification was “common practice”, and said staff likely felt they were helping their clients by speeding up the document signing process. He said more than 2,520 NAB customers were affected, and the bank had written to all customers involved but had had difficulty reaching 30 people. Hagger also revealed that senior NAB executives were upset that their bonuses would be “shaved” after the scandal was discovered, given they were not directly involved. Senior counsel assisting Rowena Orr read an internal note from Tim Steele, the general manager of NAB financial planning, in which Steele expressed concern that the leadership team’s morale would suffer if their bonuses were cut. In the note from Steele to Greg Miller, the head of NAB’s wealth advice, Steele complained: “In terms of the broader leadership team, I am concerned about the cultural impact to both overall engagement and the potential reluctance of team members to raise future issues which could contravene NAB’s whistleblower policy given the likely perceived unfairness of the consequences and corresponding lack of trust in senior leadership to support our people.” Orr asked Hagger: “So this was Mr Steele expressing concern about consequences imposed at the leadership level in response to these incidents?” Hagger replied: “Yes.” Orr asked: “And Mr Miller expressed a similar view in his discussions with you?” Hagger replied: “Yes.” Hagger said he told Miller if bonuses were slightly smaller for one year it wouldn’t matter. Steele’s bonus was shaved by approximately 10%, while Miller received no bonus. The NAB chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, agreed the bonus cuts were sufficient. Hagger said his own bonus was reduced slightly, by $60,000, leaving him with a $960,000 variable bonus last year. Celebrity adviser ‘impersonated client’ The inquiry also heard evidence that a commissioner with Fair Work Australia would have lost $500,000 in superannuation if she followed the advice of a firm whose staffer impersonated her on phone calls. Donna McKenna rejected the advice of the planner Sam Henderson, whose regular media appearances include hosting a TV finance show. A staffer of his advice firm Henderson Maxwell impersonated McKenna on a number of phone calls to gain information from her super fund, with recordings of two calls played to the banking royal commission on Tuesday. McKenna complained to the Financial Planning Association in March 2017 about the advice. The commission heard Henderson described McKenna as an aggressive lawyer and said it was a “storm in a teacup”. He also asked the FPA not to share his response with McKenna as she would find being labelled “nitpicking” inflammatory. Senior counsel assisting the commission, Rowena Orr QC, asked: “Mr Henderson, is it really nitpicking for Ms McKenna to make a complaint after receiving advice that if implemented would have cost her half a million dollars?” Henderson replied no. The Henderson Maxwell chief executive has hosted a TV show on Sky News Business and regularly appears as a finance expert on Network Ten’s The Project and the Nine Network’s Today program. He also regularly writes general financial advice articles for a number of publications including the Australian Financial Review. ‘Commercial interests took precedence’ The royal commission also heard evidence from Kieran Forde, ANZ’s head of wealth solutions and partnerships. He was asked about a financial adviser, working for ANZ’s Millenium3, who convinced clients to invest in property but used their money through his own company to purchase the property. Forde admitted that ANZ failed to conduct any detailed investigation of the financial adviser, despite receiving the formal complaint in 2013 and being in possession of two earlier audits that raised concerns about his behaviour. When asked if the financial adviser’s misconduct should have been identified earlier, Forde said it should have. Orr asked: “So ANZ elected not to take an investigation in 2013 or to contact any of the other customers who were in the same position as the customers who had made the complaint? Forde replied: “It appears so, yes. Orr asked why, and Forde responded: “The only logical reason is that the commercial interests of Millennium3 took [precedence]”. Orr: “Over the interests of the clients?” Forde: “Yeah, I think that’s fair.” With Australian Associated Press"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/24/this-anzac-day-spare-a-thought-for-those-toiling-in-the-culture-wars","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T01:25:34Z","webTitle":"This Anzac Day, spare a thought for those still battling in the culture wars | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/24/this-anzac-day-spare-a-thought-for-those-toiling-in-the-culture-wars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/24/this-anzac-day-spare-a-thought-for-those-toiling-in-the-culture-wars","fields":{"headline":"This Anzac Day, spare a thought for those still battling in the culture wars","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/23/everton-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T22:44:56Z","webTitle":"Theo Walcott clarifies Everton’s superiority over toothless Newcastle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/23/everton-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/23/everton-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Theo Walcott clarifies Everton’s superiority over toothless Newcastle","bodyText":"One banner called for Sam Allardyce to go at Goodison Park but Theo Walcott’s sharp finish shielded the Everton manager from further hostility. Those wishing to register distrust in the former England manager’s style must make do with a club survey for now. Walcott’s third Everton goal since arriving from Arsenal in January lifted an otherwise grim affair and Everton to eighth in the Premier League as Newcastle’s winning streak came to a subdued end. Rafael Benítez and his players have defied expectations to haul themselves clear of relegation danger but a lack of quality in attack was glaring. Newcastle finished on top, preying on Everton’s anxieties, having a handball claim against Phil Jagielka dismissed and almost equalising in the final seconds only for Seamus Coleman to intercept Jacob Murphy’s cross towards Dwight Gayle with a superb header. Benítez claimed Bobby Madley was too lenient with Everton’s physical approach but accepted that, in Walcott and Wayne Rooney, lavish spending at Goodison has at least bought the experience to make a difference in matches as mundane as this. “It might have been different if we had done better with the final pass in the final third,” the Newcastle manager said. “In this kind of game when they are very physical and the referee allows them to do these things, and they are at home and have quality, that is an advantage.” Unsurprisingly, Allardyce took an opposing view, suggesting Everton had been “excellent” for 75 minutes and lost their way only when Morgan Schneiderlin departed injured. Schneiderlin did impress, earning a rousing ovation from fans who had booed him on to the pitch a few months ago, but there was nothing excellent about this display beyond Walcott’s winner. Allardyce had called for clarity over his long-term position before a game attended by Everton’s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri. A glance to his left before the kick-off will have given the Everton manager a reminder of the clarification many supporters are hoping for. “Our survey says … Get out of our club” read a banner draped over the upper Gwladys Street stand. Anti-Allardyce sentiment had been reserved for Everton’s away matches, unsurprisingly given the contrast in results on the road and at Goodison, but the recent PR fiasco of asking fans to rate an unpopular manager on a scale of zero to 10 presented an opportunity that was not missed at home. A solid but unspectacular performance did little to appease the restless natives. “The controversy was caused by an error from one of our employees who recognises it wasn’t the right thing to do,” said Allardyce on what was a wide-ranging survey. “As a manager you have to deal with it and move on. The players did the talking tonight by winning and moving us up to eighth. Let’s hope we finish the season as strong as we can.” Newcastle arrived free of relegation concern after four successive wins and with Jonjo Shelvey seeking to press his claims for a World Cup call from the England manager Gareth Southgate. He was unable to do so as Schneiderlin and Idrissa Gueye controlled the midfield contest while a lack of composure with the final ball cost Newcastle several promising openings. The visitors should have punished a miscued clearance from Jordan Pickford that invited Ayoze Pérez the freedom to play the fit-again Islam Slimani through on goal. Pérez badly overhit his pass, however, and the Everton goalkeeper was spared. Pickford was jeered throughout by the Newcastle support who have not forgotten nor forgiven the former Sunderland keeper for tweeting “Get the rave on” when his rivals were relegated in 2016. He responded with a “shush” gesture in the final seconds. Walcott made an encouraging start to his Everton career but had gone nine games without a goal, and several anonymous performances, when he enlivened the match with a smartly taken breakthrough. Yannick Bolasie was the provider, driving down the right and using Coleman’s overlapping run to create space for a dangerous cross to the back post. The ball rebounded into Walcott’s path via the unwitting DeAndre Yedlin and the winger took an assured touch before driving high into Martin Dubravka’s goal. Benítez, in his 100th game in charge of Newcastle, reacted by replacing Slimani with Gayle and the substitute should have equalised with his first touch. Shelvey’s corner was flicked on by Jamaal Lascelles to the striker, who had space inside the six-yard area, but his first-time shot sailed over Pickford’s crossbar. Pérez and Matt Ritchie also had opportunities before the crucial diving header from Coleman in stoppage time, with Gayle poised to convert, secured an important win for Allardyce."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/23/royal-births-grit-fortitude-and-impressive-fashion-sense","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T21:11:57Z","webTitle":"Royal births – grit, fortitude and impressive fashion sense","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/royal-births-grit-fortitude-and-impressive-fashion-sense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/royal-births-grit-fortitude-and-impressive-fashion-sense","fields":{"headline":"Royal births – grit, fortitude and impressive fashion sense","bodyText":"The pressure of being royal, and living family life on a public stage, is never shown in more stark relief than it is on the steps of the Lindo Wing.

Having had a baby, and probably not much sleep – she was in labour by dawn – she looked just as serene and together as she did on the same steps after the birth of George five years ago and of Charlotte three years ago. She was even wearing earrings. It was, once again, a formidable display of her fortitude. The Lindo fashion formula is simple. For each postpartum photo call, the Duchess has worn a bespoke dress by British designer Jenny Packham. The blue polka dot dress she wore when she brought Prince George out of hospital seemed to echo the dress Princess Diana wore when William was born. This red dress with white Peter Pan collar was widely reported to “channel” Diana, who wore a red coat over a blouse with a white Peter Pan collar after the birth of Prince Harry. For an extra patriotic flourish, the red-and-white combination of the Duchess of Cambridge’s dress nodded to the new prince having arrived, with excellent timing, on St George’s Day. The Duchess wore nude heels by Gianvito Rossi, and drop pearl earrings. Prince William wore a blue shirt, as he probably always does, and as usual nobody noticed. Prince Charlotte, dressed in a perfectly traditional Liberty print dress, chose the perfect moment to show off her royal wave."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/23/how-amber-rudd-let-heartbreaking-windrush-suffering-drag-on","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T20:02:24Z","webTitle":"How Amber Rudd let 'heartbreaking' Windrush suffering drag on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/how-amber-rudd-let-heartbreaking-windrush-suffering-drag-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/how-amber-rudd-let-heartbreaking-windrush-suffering-drag-on","fields":{"headline":"How Amber Rudd let 'heartbreaking' Windrush suffering drag on","bodyText":"“This should never have been allowed to happen” declared Amber Rudd at the start of her extraordinary response to a situation she described as “heartbreaking”. Her statement addresses many issues, but never quite gets around to revealing how she and Theresa May allowed it to happen – and why they were unforgivably slow to respond to numerous detailed, disturbing accounts from those affected by the mistakes of the Home Office. “All members of this House will have seen the recent heartbreaking stories of individuals who have been in this country for decades struggling to navigate an immigration system in a way they never, ever should have been,” she said on Monday. It is remarkable that she finally decided that the victims’ stories were heartbreaking. For six months, the Guardian has been contacting the Home Office almost on a weekly basis to outline the horrendous problems being experienced by Windrush victims – people battling with homelessness, unemployment, the suspension of their benefits, the denial of NHS cancer care. There was no acknowledgement from the department that serious mistakes had been made and there was never the slightest suggestion that anyone there found the accounts heartbreaking. Each call elicited only dry statements for quotation, mostly advising victims to seek legal advice – which they were unable to afford, having been pushed to near-destitution by the department’s actions. In the space of eight days, the government has executed an astonishing reassessment of its relaxed attitude towards the profound suffering of a generation of Windrush citizens. Last Saturday, Downing Street’s position was that this issue was sufficiently trivial that there was no need to agree to a formal request from the 12 Caribbean high commissioners for a meeting with the prime minister to discuss the Home Office’s treatment of its elderly citizens at the Commonwealth heads of government summit which began last Monday in London. Within hours, it became clear that this rebuff had been a terrible miscalculation. Rudd was forced to appear at the Commons dispatch box to make the first of two comprehensive admissions that the Windrush generation had been treated “appallingly”. Theresa May was then forced to make three separate apologies on the issue. The first one, to Caribbean diplomats on Tuesday, was not exactly heartfelt – she said she was “genuinely sorry for any anxiety caused”, which has a ring of an “I’m-sorry-you-are-cross” apology. But, by the time she got to her third apology on Friday night, she was at least edging towards a recognition that lives had been ruined by the policy she created. She was still saying that she wanted to do “whatever it takes” to “resolve anxieties” (as if all the pain caused by the Home Office was merely a bit of needless fretting by those affected) but she did finally concede that there had been “problems”. The mother of Dexter Bristol, who died last month trying to sort out his immigration problems, was unimpressed by the prime minister’s contrition. “This is racism,” she said. Rudd devoted some time to a distasteful buck-passing exercise, listing Labour initiatives aimed at tackling illegal immigration, missing the point that the key injustice of the Windrush tragedy is that people who were here entirely legally have been hit repeatedly by her department’s actions. To audible gasps in chamber, she claimed: “This is a failure by successive governments to ensure these individuals have the documentation they need and this is why we must urgently put it right.” No one believes that. The link between May’s flagship hostile environment policy and this scandal is simply indisputable. Rudd also tried pointing out that the term “hostile environment” had been used by two Labour home secretaries, choosing to glide over the fact that it was May’s explicit vision to create a radically-hardened immigration system that has caused all this misery. But, alongside the politics, some positive initiatives were announced. The 20-strong Windrush taskforce announced last week appears to have doubled in size to a body staffed by 50 experienced immigration workers. Significantly, Rudd stated that the term Windrush meant “everyone that arrived in the UK before 1973 who were given settlement rights and not required to get any specific documentation to prove these rights”. Windrush victims have spent months, sometimes years attempting to gather documentary proof that they were in the UK before 1971, impeded by the fact that documents had been destroyed, primary schools turned into flats and relatives who could help died long ago. Rudd has now acknowledged, almost in passing, that none of this was required. “It is abundantly clear that everyone considers people who came in the Windrush generation to be British. But, under the current rules, this is not the case,” she said. It is worth noting that this has not been abundantly clear in the least to Home Office staff in the new toughened environment; a whistleblower last week described workers having a “gotcha” attitude towards people struggling to get their papers in order. Windrush victims will welcome Rudd’s announcement that she wants “to enable the Windrush generation to acquire the status that they deserve – British citizenship – quickly, at no cost and with proactive assistance through the process”. But some are understandably sceptical about how things will work in practice. There is widespread cynicism about the promises which have been announced so belatedly. One victim who wasted years of her life trying to work out why officials were telling her she was an illegal immigrant – after more than 50 years in the country and decades paying taxes while working for her local council – said the pledges were reminiscent of those made after the Grenfell Tower fire. “The government is making promises which then get forgotten once the interest dies down,” she said. The Guardian has published interviews with more than 20 Windrush victims, each case profoundly disturbing in its own way. Many of these people have contacted the Guardian to express anger at the government’s ongoing handling of the crisis. Rudd appeared to reference some of the cases published here in her statement. But she said nothing that offered clear reassurance for those such as cancer-sufferer Albert Thompson, who arrived in the UK a few months after the cut-off date. The Home Office press team was unable to clarify whether he would be getting the NHS radiotherapy he has been waiting for since last November. Without naming the paper, she appeared to acknowledge the impact of the Guardian’s reporting, recognising the role played by “media outlets who relentlessly exposed the situation that these individuals had been on the receiving end of. It is their extraordinary work that has led to this sea change in terms of the protection of the Windrush cohort”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/apr/24/sean-hannity-real-estate-property-dealer-jeff-brock-fraud-foreclosures","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T11:09:59Z","webTitle":"Sean Hannity's real estate venture linked to fraudulent property dealer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/24/sean-hannity-real-estate-property-dealer-jeff-brock-fraud-foreclosures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/apr/24/sean-hannity-real-estate-property-dealer-jeff-brock-fraud-foreclosures","fields":{"headline":"Sean Hannity's real estate venture linked to fraudulent property dealer","bodyText":"Sean Hannity’s real estate venture bought houses through a property dealer who was involved in a criminal conspiracy to fraudulently obtain foreclosed homes, according to records reviewed by the Guardian. In 2012, a shell company linked to the Fox News host bought 11 homes in Georgia that had been purchased by the dealer, Jeff Brock, following foreclosures. Brock transferred the properties to corporate vehicles that sold them on to the Hannity-linked company at a profit. Brock pleaded guilty in 2016 to federal charges of bank fraud and conspiracy for his role in an operation to rig foreclosure auctions between 2007 and 2012. He was sentenced to six months in prison and had to pay more than $166,000 in fines and restitution. Some of the houses sold on to the Hannity-linked firm in 2012 had been acquired by Brock from banks later named by prosecutors among his victims. But the justice department declined to identify specific properties sold in the rigged auctions. Hannity has not been accused of any wrongdoing and there is no evidence he was aware that Brock was involved in fraud. Christopher Reeves, an attorney for Hannity, said the Fox News host was not involved in choosing the houses bought via Brock and “has no knowledge whether these properties were involved in the fraud”. Reeves said neither Hannity nor the company used to buy the properties “had any knowledge regarding Mr Brock’s wrongdoing” before being informed by the Guardian on Monday. An attorney for Brock, Don Samuel, said in an email: “Jeff has nothing to say.” The company linked to Hannity was one of a group identified by the Guardian on Sunday that spent $90m buying more than 870 homes in seven states over the past decade. Hannity was confirmed as the hidden owner behind some of the companies and has not disputed that he is the owner of all of them. Hannity defended his real estate investments on Monday, stating in a post to his website that he had chosen to invest his personal wealth in “communities that badly need such investment” and that he had limited involvement in the venture’s day-to-day operation. “The fact is, these are investments that I do not individually select, control, or know the details about; except that obviously I believe in putting my money to work in communities that otherwise struggle to receive such support,” Hannity wrote. Hannity-linked company’s purchases In February 2012, the Hannity-linked company spent about $540,000 buying 10 single-family houses in Georgia’s Fulton, Cobb, Clayton and DeKalb counties, according to county records. It bought an additional DeKalb county property later that year for about $60,000. The company was formed in Georgia days before the February purchases by an attorney for Hannity. It was registered to the offices of Henssler Financial, Hannity’s wealth managers. As a limited liability company (LLC), it was not required to report its actual owner to Georgia regulators. Hannity is not mentioned in the company’s publicly available filings. Brock had bought the 11 Georgia houses in foreclosure auctions in 2011 and 2012, after the previous owners defaulted on mortgages. He transferred the properties to five LLCs. Brock was the registered agent for two of the five LLCs and a colleague at Key Property was the agent for another. Then the Hannity-linked company bought the houses from these five LLCs, paying a total of $600,000. Where payment information was clear in the records, it indicated that the sales created significant profits. One four-bedroom home in College Park that Brock bought for $14,000 in January 2012 was sold to the Hannity-linked company for $47,000 the following month. Another in Forest Park, for which Brock paid $19,000 in October 2011, was sold on for $55,000. Brock’s auction-rigging scheme US prosecutors said that, during the period in which he was buying the properties, Brock and two co-defendants were running a scheme to rig foreclosure auctions, where people bid to buy homes that have been repossessed by mortgage lenders. The men agreed not to compete on property sales so one could win the auctions with “artificially low bids”, according to charging documents. The winning bidder would then give payoffs to the others to reward them for not having competed. When asked for details on specific houses bought in the rigged sales, Jeremy Edwards, a spokesman for the justice department, said in an email: “As a matter of policy, DoJ does not disclose that type of information.” Reeves, Hannity’s attorney, said the Fox News host and the company used to buy the houses “ceased doing business with Mr Brock and Key Properties in 2012”. Brock was released from the US penitentiary in Atlanta, a medium-security facility, in June 2017, according to federal records. He remains under the supervision of a probation officer until 2019. As part of Brock’s plea agreement, he has agreed to cooperate with US authorities on related investigations and any new inquiries arising from them. Federal officials said Brock was at the time of his plea one of 20 people who had been charged as part of a major investigation into corruption around property foreclosure sales in the Atlanta region. “These defendants conspired to corrupt foreclosure auctions that should have benefited lenders and homeowners,” the deputy assistant attorney general, Renata Hesse, who is head of the justice department’s antitrust division, said in a statement at the time. Special Agent J Britt Johnson of the FBI’s Atlanta division said: “By the very nature of this criminal act, the bank, and more importantly, the homeowner in financial distress, are the victims that these federal laws were created to protect.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/24/ministers-home-office-staff-windrush-scandal-mark-serwotka","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T09:27:19Z","webTitle":"How dare ministers try to blame the Windrush fiasco on Home Office staff | Mark Serwotka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/24/ministers-home-office-staff-windrush-scandal-mark-serwotka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/24/ministers-home-office-staff-windrush-scandal-mark-serwotka","fields":{"headline":"How dare ministers try to blame the Windrush fiasco on Home Office staff","bodyText":"The escalating Windrush scandal has rightly caused national outrage. Reports of deportations, grandmothers holed up in detention centres and people losing the right to housing, healthcare and a decent living, mark a shameful chapter in this country’s treatment of people who were invited here to live and work. From the inhumane attitude of the government towards Commonwealth citizens, to the revelation yesterday that Home Office staff themselves are subject to racism in their workplace, it is clear there needs to be a massive shift in how the government approaches the issue. My union – the Public and Commercial Services Union – has been clear from the outset: we opposed the Immigration Act 2014, and many of our members were appalled at the “hostile environment” created by then home secretary Theresa May as she sought to make political capital out of the sensitive issue of immigration. The “Go home” vans which stalked our streets showed there were no depths to which the government would not sink to sow division in our communities and demonise the most vulnerable Our members – many of whom work in the Home Office and the wider civil service – are dedicated, caring and conscientious. They have borne the brunt of cuts, pay restraint and increased workloads, due to the constant changes in government immigration policy. And according to the civil service people survey, nearly one in four Border Force staff (24%) say they have suffered some form of discrimination. Other Home Office agencies have a similar problem, with one in five immigration enforcement personnel and 15% of employees at UK Visas and Immigration (which, rather ironically, handles claims for residency and asylum,) all saying they had suffered discrimination. So it is perverse that ministers have repeatedly, since the scandal broke, sought to shift blame on to Home Office staff – people who do a difficult job trying to provide the best service possible, but who are not responsible for government policy. The government thanked all staff for their “hard work and professionalism” in an email last week. But these words will ring hollow for many members when they see ministers seeking to wriggle out of their responsibilities. Politicians have shown themselves to be past masters at shifting blame. First home secretary Amber Rudd then the prime minister both attempted to use the situation as a political football, rather than admit that their immigration policies have failed. Even culture secretary Matt Hancock made a fool of himself on Sky News last week when he mistakenly referred to UK Border Agency (UKBA) as being “independent” in 2010. It was not – it was an “executive agency of the Home Office”. The government was ultimately responsible for all the decisions taken at the UKBA and they are responsible for this current crisis. Ministers now attempting to assemble a hastily agreed taskforce to sort out the problem in just two months will put yet more pressure on an overstretched and underfunded workforce. The public should be in no doubt that my union stands in solidarity with all those caught up in a crisis which was not of their own making. And we will defend resolutely the rights of our members to work in a well-resourced Home Office free from discrimination, while we push, as a union, for a humane immigration policy that respects people who decide to come to this country. • Mark Serwotka is the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/23/europe-gdpr-data-law-employer-employee","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"New Europe law makes it easy to find out what your boss has said about you","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/23/europe-gdpr-data-law-employer-employee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/23/europe-gdpr-data-law-employer-employee","fields":{"headline":"New Europe law makes it easy to find out what your boss has said about you","bodyText":"Have you ever wondered what your boss or co-workers say about you behind your back? If you’re located in Europe, it will soon be extremely easy to find out. Under the General Data Protection Regulation that comes into play on 25 May, any individual located in Europe can ask any company for the data it collects about them – and that includes their employer. If an employee files a “subject access request” – an email, fax or letter asking for their personal data – their employer will have 30 days to collate a cache of all the information stored about that person. This includes any email that refers to the worker, as well as performance reviews, job interviews, payroll records, absence records, disciplinary records, computer access logs, CCTV footage, and recordings of phone calls to, from or about the person. This right has been available to individuals under existing European data protection rules, such as the UK’s Data Protection Act, but GDPR makes it much easier to access by removing the cost (UK companies could charge £10 for such a request before), reducing the turnaround time from 40 days to 30 days and introducing extremely harsh penalties for companies not complying. “It can cost the company tens of thousands of pounds because it’s incredibly resource intensive,” said Jack Carvel, general counsel at Qubit, which provides personalisation software to e-commerce sites. In responding to a subject access request, the company must not include another employee’s personal information. This means that each item must be painstakingly redacted. “Imagine going through every email sent to you or about you,” said Carvel. If a company deletes any of the data to prevent disclosure after the subject access request is made, it can be liable for criminal sanctions. “At the moment it’s a breach of data protection law [in the UK], but not an actual offence,” said Rowenna Fielding, senior data protection lead at Protecture Limited. Subject access requests are typically made by employees in some kind of employment dispute with their employer – it’s a free and quick way of getting “predisclosure” ahead of litigation. However, there’s no reason why an employee, former employee or even someone who only had a job interview with the company can’t make such a request just out of interest. Because of how onerous such requests can be, some data privacy experts warn that they could be exploited by activists to punish a company. A group of unhappy former employees could all file requests at the same time, forcing the company to dedicate resources to respond within the 30-day timeframe. “If you look at it from that angle it seems unfair for companies. But think about the pensioner who was refused a mortgage and doesn’t understand why,” said Carvel, referring to a case for which the regulation was designed. “It’s not intended to be for malicious activists or disgruntled employees.” Subject access requests generally allow an individual to see a copy of the information an organisation holds about them, whether it’s a mortgage lender, social media company or retailer. There are some exceptions to the data that companies must hand over, including information relating to trade secrets, anything relating to current management issues such as restructuring or redundancies, any confidential communications with lawyers, health records, or personal data that is processed for purposes relating to criminal justice and taxation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/24/champions-league-roma-liverpool-daniele-de-rossi-steven-gerrard","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T08:00:14Z","webTitle":"Daniele De Rossi ends his long wait for dream date at Anfield | Paolo Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/24/champions-league-roma-liverpool-daniele-de-rossi-steven-gerrard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/24/champions-league-roma-liverpool-daniele-de-rossi-steven-gerrard","fields":{"headline":"Daniele De Rossi ends his long wait for dream date at Anfield","bodyText":"Daniele De Rossi has waited a whole career to be part of a European night at Anfield. He was 18 the last time Roma played away to Liverpool, back in March 2002, newly promoted from the academy and with a handful of cup games for the senior team under his belt. This was not yet the time for the manager, Fabio Capello, to put his faith in precocious talent. Roma lost 2-0 and exited the Champions League. De Rossi went on to become one of the club’s most beloved stars. Before long fans were calling him Capitan Futuro – the Future Captain – destined to follow in Francesco Totti’s footsteps as the latest homegrown player to wear the armband. They were right, in the end, though few could have guessed that the transition would get pushed back all the way to 2017. It almost did not happen at all. There was a point, as negotiations over a contract renewal stalled last year, when De Rossi thought about seeking new experiences elsewhere. “In my own head I was playing out my last season,” he told the newspaper Corriere dello Sport in September. “The best offer that came in was from an Italian club but that didn’t get my juices flowing: I didn’t want to betray this city and these fans. “If an offer had come in from a European club or an American one – it’s no secret that it’s a dream of mine to have an experience of life and football over there – then probably we would not be here talking today.” Then again, who knows? De Rossi has had opportunities to leave before, and at times came close to accepting, but in the end his team and his city pulled him back in. His desires, like those of most human beings, contradict one another at times. As a boy he would watch tapes of Boca Juniors against River Plate at La Bombonera and fantasise about playing there. Yet he has always found great satisfaction in representing his hometown club. If he had not become a footballer, he remains convinced that he would have spent his weekends driving up and down Italy to watch Roma. Perhaps a night such as the one on Tuesday offers the best of both worlds. You can be sure that the Kop stirs the imagination of a man who named Steven Gerrard as his idol and the player he would select to captain his ideal XI. Not that De Rossi appears uncomfortable in that role. He has played less this season under Eusebio Di Francesco, granted more opportunities to rest in a midfield whose depth was enhanced over the summer by the signing of Maxime Gonalons from Lyon and the return of Lorenzo Pellegrini from Sassuolo. That freshness has served him in the biggest games. He was majestic in the quarter‑final second leg against Barcelona, setting up Edin Dzeko’s sixth-minute opener, converting the penalty for Roma’s second and dictating the terms of engagement. De Rossi played more passes than his midfield team-mates Kevin Strootman and Radja Nainggolan combined, almost always moving the ball forwards, and never losing possession. Before kick-off he had stood in front of his team-mates in the Stadio Olimpico changing room and asked why they should not overturn a three‑goal deficit against La Liga’s runaway leaders. “The fans think we can do it,” he observed. “So why not? Why should we stand here and shit ourselves?” There have been times when De Rossi might have struggled to feel such faith in himself, let alone project it to a whole team. From late 2015 into 2016 he suffered a series of niggling injuries that ate away at him mentally as well as physically. Even when he was on the pitch, his standard of play declined. “I started to lose the conviction that my body could handle the demands of Italian and European football at a certain level,” he confessed during a wide-ranging interview with the magazine Rivista Undici last summer. “I’m not a player like [Lionel] Messi … I’m not one of those who can carry a result home on my own when I’m in form or make the difference even when I’m not. I need to be doing well physically to play my game but I also need a team who support me. I’m a cog [in a machine].” It was the combined coaching prowess of Luciano Spalletti and Antonio Conte, in De Rossi’s opinion, that turned things round. The former returned to Roma in early 2016 and through his past familiarity with the player put him back in the right places and with mechanisms to succeed. The latter did what he has always done best, engaging the midfielder’s competitive spirit with Italy. “He electrified me,” De Rossi said of the man who is now Chelsea manager. “I’ve said it many times over: he really struck me.” The feeling is mutual, Conte speaking in glowing terms about the Roma captain before their teams clashed at Stamford Bridge in October. It was Capello, though, who paid De Rossi what might have been the most eloquent tribute of all, observing during one interview that “you cannot buy personality at the supermarket”. It takes a certain character just to survive for 16 years at Roma, where the media spotlight is never set to anything less than full glare. De Rossi has lived for much of his career in the centre of town, too, hiding in plain sight amid the tourists. Maybe one day he will take their lead, setting off to find somewhere new to explore. For now a Champions League semi-final will have to do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/23/amber-rudd-windrush-caribbean-immigration-home-secretaries","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T18:51:14Z","webTitle":"Amber Rudd takes responsibility – for saving Windrush-era home secretaries | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/23/amber-rudd-windrush-caribbean-immigration-home-secretaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/23/amber-rudd-windrush-caribbean-immigration-home-secretaries","fields":{"headline":"Amber Rudd takes responsibility – for saving Windrush-era home secretaries","bodyText":"Amber Rudd was sorry. More than sorry. Gutted. Devastated. Sad Face. The treatment of the Windrush generation was just one of those things. A joke that successive governments had allowed to get out of hand over the past 30 years or so. It had never been her intention for anyone to get hurt in the process and she was determined to take whatever measures were necessary to make sure she and the prime minister held on to their jobs. “I want the Windrush generation to get British citizenship,” the home secretary said during her Commons statement, inadvertently making a bad situation worse. The idea that people will be thrilled to be given something they already thought they had is deluded at best. Next she will be offering them the right to stay in their own homes. Sad Face then went on to list some of the ways she proposed to save her career. There would be a compensation scheme – normal terms and conditions apply, check small print for exemptions – and a new “customer contact centre” staffed not just by any old civil servant, but by 50 senior case workers who had been trained to be extra friendly on the phone. Computer says maybe. The heart soared. The largesse! Britain at its finest. Rudd pressed on. It was the state who had let the Windrush generation down, not any one person. Especially not her or Theresa May. Or the Home Office. The Home Office was a great office of state. So great that she would like to shake the hand of the person who was running it. Just as soon as she found who that was. While Rudd had been on her feet, her parliamentary private secretary, Rachel Maclean, had been busy handing out a list of tame questions she would like Tory MPs to ask her. It hadn’t taken her long. Apart from four other Home Office ministers who had been instructed to turn up and were sitting miserable and stoney-faced beside her, there were fewer than 20 Conservative backbenchers in the Commons for this latest humiliation. And even they were fairly muted in their support, with only Hugo Swire declaring his undying love. Shares in Rudd as the next prime minister have nosedived in the past week. Just about the only thing keeping her in post is the sense that if she goes, then May might fall with her. Diane Abbott pointed out a few home truths. The problems had all begun with the “hostile environment” Immigration Act of 2014. An act that had been implemented by the prime minister and enforced with enthusiasm by Rudd. Time and again Labour had tried to warn of the effects of the legislation, but the government had ignored them. For the Tories, a few wrongly deported West Indians were a price worth paying for being a party that looked to be tough on immigration. “The policy is not called ‘hostile environment’, Rudd observed. Sad Face became Hurt Face. “It was called ‘compliant environment’.” Shades of the Ministry of Truth. The idea the government had been trying to throw people out of the country was a nonsense. The whole purpose had been to protect people. By throwing them out of the country for their own good. They would be so much happier elsewhere. Somewhere they might be able to get the cancer treatment they were wrongly denied in Britain. Labour backbenchers were understandably less than reassured. They wanted to know more details about the compensation scheme and what the government proposed to do about all those people who had come from Commonwealth countries after 1973 and were likely to fall foul of the same legislation as the Windrush generation. Rudd didn’t really have any clear answers, but she was sure it would be fine. Like it always had been in the past. It wasn’t long before several MPs were calling on Rudd to do the right thing. Either to disown Theresa May’s hostile environment policy or to resign. Hurt Face became a little Hurter. “I do take responsibility,” she insisted. While giving every appearance of trying not to do so. The Ministry of Truth would have approved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/23/nhs-england-legal-challenge-judicial-review-accountable-care-organisations","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T19:06:10Z","webTitle":"NHS England faces first legal challenge to plans for health shake-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/23/nhs-england-legal-challenge-judicial-review-accountable-care-organisations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/23/nhs-england-legal-challenge-judicial-review-accountable-care-organisations","fields":{"headline":"NHS England faces first legal challenge to plans for health shake-up","bodyText":"NHS England faces a legal challenge to its plans to overhaul how the health service operates, which critics say are unlawful and could lead to patients being denied treatment.

If the changes go through then individual hospital trusts and clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) will no longer each receive an annual budget of their own. Instead NHS bosses would give a joint budget to pay for healthcare in whole areas of England to an ACO that would be made up of all the acute, mental health and other providers of NHS care locally.

The group says the new contracts for the first wave of ACOs are unlawful under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and could threaten patient safety by forcing hospitals and doctors to ration patients’ access to treatment. The case, which will be heard by the high court sitting in Leeds, is the first of two judicial reviews which judges have granted to explore the legality of ACOs. The other, which has been brought by a group including the late cosmologist Prof Stephen Hawking, will be heard in London on 23 and 24 May. Joanne Land, of 999 Call for the NHS, said: “As well as being undemocratic, NHS England’s proposed changes to how NHS services are priced and paid for would undermine the NHS as a comprehensive health service for all who have a clinical need for it. “They are about enabling moves to a cut-price, bargain basement NHS that uses the same business model as the USA’s limited state-funded health insurance system that provides a restricted range of healthcare for people who are too poor or too old to pay for private health insurance.” Rowan Smith of Leigh Day, the lawyer firm representing the campaign group, said the fixed pooled budgets of ACOS would end the system of “payment by results”, under which hospitals are paid for episodes, and lead to a “race to the bottom” in prices charged for care, which would hit patients. Asked about the judicial review, an NHS England spokesperson said: “This is a mistaken effort which would frustrate the move to more integrated care between hospitals, mental health and community services. The effect would be to fragment care and drive apart the very people who are now rightly trying to work more closely together on behalf of the patients they jointly serve.”Simon Stevens, its chief executive, said last month: “Our view is that it is possible to fund primary care, health and hospital services in a combined way, in a way that is consistent with the statutory legal framework. If the courts say it is lawful, that clears the issue up once and for all, and if the courts say it isn’t, that’s obviously not an approach we will be doing.” The NHS is also facing a number of other legal actions that seek to block planned changes to local health services. Campaigners fighting Dorset CCG’s plans to move A&amp;E and maternity services from Poole hospital to Bournemouth have secured a judicial review, which will take place on 17 and 18 July. Corby CCG in Lincolnshire is also facing a lawsuit over its plans to downgrade the town’s urgent care centre. Instead of patients being able to walk in and been seen within four hours, in future they would undergo a telephone triage with someone with no medical qualifications and then given an appointment – but the four-hour A&amp;E target would no longer apply. Campaigners called Hands Off Lydney and Dike Hospitals are also taking legal action to try and halt Gloucestershire CCG’s plans to shut two community hospitals and replace them with one, and cut the number of beds available from 47 to 24. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “There is considerable concern and suspicion that because of both the Lansley reforms and Tory underfunding, so called Accountable Care Organisations will lead to privatisation and cuts to local NHS services. “There remain many unanswered questions about how an ACO will be accountable to the public, what the levels of private sector involvement will be, and what the implications will be for NHS staff. “There ought to be a full debate and vote in parliament before any changes are introduced.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/employability-and-entrepreneurship-award-winner-and-runners-up","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T20:30:30Z","webTitle":"Employability and entrepreneurship: award winner and runners up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/employability-and-entrepreneurship-award-winner-and-runners-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/employability-and-entrepreneurship-award-winner-and-runners-up","fields":{"headline":"Employability and entrepreneurship: award winner and runners up","bodyText":"Winner: Falmouth University Project: MAYN Creative, student photography agency MAYN Creative is a photography agency based within Falmouth University. The name “Mayn” is a Cornish word which translates as “mediator”. This is exactly what the agency does: it negotiates professional assignments for a range of clients on behalf of student photographers. Through working with MAYN Creative, photography students can take on real client briefs, increase their portfolio and earn money. The university operates a three tier framework, depending on a student’s level of experience. Clients are able to commission talent at one of three levels, depending on their budget and requirements. Students can progress through the levels as they gain more experience and prove themselves professionally. Students are encouraged to be creative with every assignment they undertake and use both client and agency feedback for critical reflection. The university has begun to form collaborative partnerships with inspiring commissioning organisations such as SONY Music and The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) who are looking to work with up-and-coming photographers. Since MAYN Creative began operation in Dec 2016 the university has facilitated 286 professional assignments for 62 unique students. Collectively the students have earned £14,347 from paid client briefs. Runner up: Sheffield Business School Project: VentureMatrix VentureMatrix has supported thousands of students to put their skills and knowledge into practice by engaging with organisations either locally or abroad. Students work in teams, taking a brief from the client, undertaking site visits and conducting in-depth research into the organisation. After analysing the issues concerned, students produce advice and supporting data in the form of a professional presentation and report for their client’s use. Students often create valuable products or data such as new websites, video content or marketing material. Clients - including public, private and third sector organisations - are involved at all stages and give direct feedback to students. Students are also supervised by academic staff. During the 2016-17 academic year 1,861 students worked on 276 projects for 144 external organisations. Research conducted by the university found that 93% of clients believed VentureMatrix met, exceeded or greatly exceeded expectations. Students have also benefited from the experience, with several graduates creating businesses using the skills, and knowledge they developed. University: The Royal Agricultural University Project name: The RAU enterprise programme The Royal Agricultural University’s enterprise programme provides students with education, hands-on experience and an understanding of community enterprise. Students gain practical business skills through two RAU social enterprises - Muddy Wellies and Cotswold Hills - where students get the opportunity to oversee and project manage key aspects of a beer, cider and wine business. These are directly linked to academic modules. Product testing and sales techniques are developed at farmers’ markets and festivals, supported through the university’s links with local businesses and the local council. The RAU has also launched Farm491 which supports agritech start-ups, allowing students to develop their ideas while studying and after graduation. A brand-new Growth Hub is due to opens its doors on campus imminently, allowing students to network with industry and external partners. The university’s focus on entrepreneurship is demonstrated by the success of its graduates: a recent survey of 22 RAU graduate entrepreneurs associated with the enterprise programme found they collectively employ 56 people and have a combined annual turnover of £4.66 million. One in five of the businesses have a turnover in excess of £400k per year. RAU’s graduate start-ups have a survival rate of 82%.

Noseda earned a guaranteed starting berth for Gronkowski in Louisville on 5 May by winning qualifying events at Kempton Park and Newcastle but he said on Monday that his colt had suffered “a minor setback” and that “we will know where we are in the next 24 hours”. Later Noseda said that Gronkowski is now an “unlikely” runner at Churchill Downs next month and that a further statement would be released in the US in due course. The human Gronkowski – nicknamed Gronk by American sports fans – is one of the NFL’s biggest stars and has twice won the Super Bowl with the New England Patriots. Along with Tom Brady, the Patriots quarterback, he is also a regular spectator at the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May, and the equine Gronkowski’s expected presence in the field this year has attracted considerable media attention in the US. Gronkowski announced his purchase of a share in his namesake on Twitter five days ago, saying: “It’s official, I am part of the Gronkowski team!. Gronk acquires a stake in Gronk – the Kentucky Derby-bound racehorse.” Noseda’s colt, a son of Lonhro, is dirt-bred on his dam’s side and, while he appeared to be a big outsider for America’s biggest race on form, having competed only on British all-weather tracks, public interest had been widely expected to force his starting odds down to 20-1 or below. Gronkowski had been due to fly to Kentucky on Friday, while Europe’s biggest hope for a first winner of the “Run For The Roses”, Aidan O’Brien’s Mendelssohn, is due to arrive in Louisville early next week.The 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket lost a significant contender on Monday when Sir Michael Stoute’s Veracious, who had been due to be ridden by Frankie Dettori, was ruled out of the fillies’ Classic. Veracious, a daughter of Frankel, was as short as 6-1 to win on 6 May, and O’Brien’s Happily, who took the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere at Chantilly on Arc day last year, is now the clear favourite for the Classic at 7-2. Five days that will decide the Irish trainers’ championship begin at Punchestown on Tuesday afternoon when Willie Mullins will run three of his stable stars – Douvan, Un De Sceaux and Min – in the Grade One Champion Chase at 5.30 in an attempt to cut Gordon Elliott’s lead in the title race. Elliott is just over €500,000 ahead of Mullins, who pipped his rival to the championship 12 months ago after starting the Punchestown Festival with plenty of ground to make up.Both trainers have assembled huge squads of runners for this week’s meeting, but Mullins’s three main contenders for the opening day’s feature event occupy the first three places in the betting and would earn more than €200,000 if they do the same in the race itself. Doctor Phoenix is the main hope in the race for Elliott, who is top-priced at 8-11 to win the title for the first time with Mullins available at 5-4."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/23/toronto-van-crash-incident-latest-updates-canada","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T05:39:01Z","webTitle":"Toronto van incident in which 10 pedestrians died appeared deliberate, say police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/toronto-van-crash-incident-latest-updates-canada","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/23/toronto-van-crash-incident-latest-updates-canada","fields":{"headline":"Toronto van incident in which 10 pedestrians died appeared deliberate, say police","bodyText":"Ten people have been killed and 15 injured after a van sped on to a sidewalk in Toronto, ploughing through throngs of pedestrians and leaving a trail of devastation that stretched several city blocks. The incident occurred around lunchtime on one of the Canadian city’s first warm days of the year. Emergency services received several frantic calls about a vehicle that appeared to be striking pedestrians along Yonge Street, one of the city’s main arteries.The incident appeared to be deliberate, Mark Saunders, Toronto’s police chief told reporters. The vehicle weaved onto the sidewalk and into oncoming traffic for about three kilometres, he said. Alek Minassian, a 25-year-old man from the nearby town of Richmond Hill, was arrested after a brief confrontation with police. A LinkedIn profile suggested he was studying computer software at a college in Toronto. Officials refused to comment on a motive, but said the suspect did not represent a threat to national security. “The events that happened on the streets behind us are horrendous,” said Canada’s public safety minister, Ralph Goodale. “But they do not appear to be connected in any way to national security based on the information available at this time.” While Minassian was not known to police, Saunders said the investigation was “far from over”. Asked whether any link to terrorism had been ruled out, he noted: “We don’t rule out anything.” He appealed for witnesses to come forward. “We need to identify if there are more people, if he’s working in concert with anyone, or if this was just a lone act on his own doing.” Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, offered his condolences to the loved ones of those killed in what he described as a “tragic and senseless attack” and wished those injured a fast and full recovery. “We should all feel safe walking in our cities and communities,” he said in a statement. “We are monitoring this situation closely, and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians.” The White House issued a statement saying the US was ready to “provide any support Canada may need”. On Monday evening, Saunders said the majority of the victims had yet to be identified. “Anywhere that this type of event happens, it is shocking. I think we recognise that Toronto is the fourth-largest urban city in North America … and things do happen.” Distraught witnesses described watching in shock as a rented van zigzagged through the crowd of pedestrians. “He just went on the sidewalk,” Ali Shaker, who was driving near the van at the time, told Canadian broadcaster CP24. He watched as the van reached an estimated speed of up to 70km/h (43mph). “He just started hitting everybody, man. He hit every single person on the sidewalk. Anybody in his way he would hit.” Christian Ali, who drove down Yonge Street shortly afterwards, said he saw several people lying in the street. “There was a lot of blood flowing,” he told the Guardian. “Everyone was in sheer shock.” John Flengas of Toronto’s emergency medical services described the incident as surreal. “It’s unprecedented,” he told the Globe and Mail. “We’ve never seen anything like this in Toronto up until now ... we never thought this would happen here.” Police cordoned off several city blocks and suspended services at two nearby subway stations. The incident took place miles north of central Toronto, in a neighbourhood that ranks among the city’s most multicultural. Hours after the incident an impromptu memorial had sprung up. “It could have been anybody,” said Konstantin Goulich, a resident of the area for the past 15 years. Afterwards the area – normally teeming with commuters and pedestrians – was eerily empty as the residents followed police requests to stay off the streets and close any businesses. The van, bearing the Ryder Truck Rental and Leasing logo, sat on a side street, its front crumpled and grill missing. After the driver initially attempted to flee the scene, bystander video captured the tense standoff between police officers and the suspect, showing him waving a dark object in the direction of police. In the footage, a police officer can be heard telling the man to get down on the ground. “Kill me,” he tells the lone officer. “I have a gun in my pocket.” The officer warned him if he does not get on the ground, he will be shot. “Shoot me in the head,” he tells them. The officer then arrested the suspect without firing any shots. Video of the officer’s actions drew praise on social media, with many noting the officer’s calm and restraint as he confronted the suspect. While the city’s police chief said there was nothing to indicate the suspect was armed at the time of his arrest, Saunders commended the officer for doing a “fantastic job”, saying that “officers here are taught to use as little force as possible in any given situation”. The incident took place about 12 miles from the city centre, where foreign ministers from the G7 countries were meeting to discuss international issues before the G7 summit near Quebec City in June. Toronto’s mayor, John Tory, described the incident as a “cowardly and incomprehensible attack” on Monday. “These are not the kinds of things we expect to happen in this city,” he said. “I hope that we will as a city remind ourselves of the fact that we are admired around the world for being inclusive, for being accepting and understanding and considerate.” • This article was amended on 1 May 2018 to correct the distance from the city centre from 18 miles to 12 miles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/24/stabbed-attack-crime-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T12:48:00Z","webTitle":"Stab her, your friend said, and you did.

I survived – but you scarred my life","bodyText":"You couldn’t have been much older than my 14-year-old grandson is now, when you stabbed me in the neck with a screwdriver. That was 10 years ago, and I’ve often wondered what happened to you. The last image I have was of a skinny kid running down the road with my red handbag – which looked faintly ridiculous. You never spoke, but the other boy, the bigger one who was egging you on, urged “Stab her, stab her” almost like a dare. Was it a test to allow you to join his gang? If it was, I wonder where that took you – to more attacks, moving from a screwdriver to a knife, from mugging to murder, to prison? Or to you being the one “blooding” new recruits, or a victim of violence yourself? Perhaps you managed to take a different path to the one your teenage self was heading down and feel regret or remorse. Maybe you’ve simply forgotten what you did that night. I haven’t. While I was being stitched up in intensive care, you or your mates were playing on my phone, had already used my bank cards to steal over £1,000, had my house keys, address, driving licence and other personal effects. The red handbag was found dumped a day or so later but I never used it again. Thanks to the professionalism of paramedics, the kindness of strangers and the skill of the doctors I didn’t die and I have only a small scar that is barely visible. That’s on the outside, but on the inside is something else. The fear inside me takes a lot of patient unravelling, like a piece of rope that inexplicably tangles into a tight knot. It comes when I’m walking along a street in the dark, when I’m in an empty train carriage, when I see a couple of youths hanging about. I avoid alleyways and subways, eye contact and arguments, politely decline evening invitations and have sobbed, a shaking wreck after being startled by an innocent jogger or someone walking behind me. After the attack, I would run the short distance from the bus stop to my home with tears pouring down my face and heart pounding. Eventually I moved away. I am wary of dark places where people like you can hide and pounce, curse myself for not being stronger and braver to fight back, ask myself over and over again what I could have done to avoid being stabbed and always come up with the same answer – nothing. The police were supportive, efficient and kind. Over the course of several days they drove me round in an unmarked car to places where gangs and young offenders were known to hang out. At the police station my injuries were photographed and I was shown ring binders full of page after page of photographs of possible suspects. Young men and youths who could have been in a football club or school photo – but the images just reinforced my sense of vulnerability, knowing that so many people thought capable of such an attack were on the streets. A board at the end of the road where it happened appealed for witnesses, as did the local paper, but no arrests were made. CCTV footage of cash withdrawals made with my stolen cards yielded nothing but images of a person whose face was concealed by a hood. Politicians and police argue over the policies and practices that are to blame for the shocking rise in violent crime that has claimed so many lives this year. Distraught mothers and devastated communities plead for an end to the stabbings and shootings while another slew of initiatives are announced. Newspapers, commentators and experts offer advice, analysis and condemnation, but through a prism that distorts this as a crisis affecting predominantly young, black people in London, and caused at least in part by gang culture. This makes it all too easy to think the problem is restricted to a particular community, culture or area. There is still, albeit unspoken, a view that if gangs are fighting each other, then it’s not anything for the rest of us to worry about. That has disturbing echoes of the bizarre notion that the Krays and their ilk actually kept crime under control and their neighbourhoods safe. Ten years on from my attack, weapons are more deadly and readily available, social media more prevalent and pernicious; and too many people have been killed and maimed, with families and lives destroyed. Tougher sentences for carrying a knife wouldn’t have stopped a boy with a screwdriver. There can hardly be a more painful platitude for victims and their families to hear than that they were “in the wrong place at the wrong time”. I now have a deep-rooted fearfulness that was never apparent before I was stabbed, but the spate of violence on the streets of London helps to breed a collective and wider fear that has terrible implications. It stops people intervening in antisocial behaviour, and instils fear of retribution if you raise concerns about domestic abuse, child neglect or disruptive neighbours, or want to blow the whistle on your employers or colleagues. Fear at a primal level keeps us alive, but it’s also what allows us to avert our eyes from bad stuff. Fear also stops adults challenging children, particularly when those children are bigger and stronger than them, when there is no alternative but to live, go to school and walk the same streets as the bad kids. Fear makes children think they need to be armed, to do what others urge them to do even though they know it’s wrong. Were you frightened when that other boy told you to “Stab her, stab her”? Was your mother too frightened to ask where you were that night, or why you’d suddenly got money or new things? Have you got children of your own now, and do you ask them those questions? When I spoke to the Guardian after my attack, I said I wanted to know why you stabbed me after I’d already handed over my handbag. Ten years on, I still don’t know – do you? • Jo Phillips is a journalist and former political press officer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/may/16/bob-hawke-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-16T13:09:43Z","webTitle":"Bob Hawke obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/16/bob-hawke-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/may/16/bob-hawke-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Bob Hawke obituary","bodyText":"Bob Hawke, who has died aged 89, went from being a popular trade union leader to become the Australian Labor party’s most successful prime minister, winning four election victories from 1983 to 1991. He energised his country and his party by ushering in a decade of significant economic and social reform. By dint of his charismatic personality, powers of persuasion and, for a Labor figure, unusually strong relationships with both business and unions, Hawke forged a powerful consensus that defined his leadership style. With his natural diplomacy, he navigated Australia into a wider world by building alliances, particularly with Asia, and he modernised the economy, integrating it into overseas markets through reducing tariff protection and floating the Australian dollar. His government also oversaw stronger environmental controls, overruling Tasmania’s plans to build a controversial dam in the wilderness. He led the widespread reform of education and training and even advocated a treaty – still unrealised – with Indigenous Australia. Hawke’s success in the polls enabled him to shrug off criticisms from the party grassroots that by moving to the right and embracing competition he had compromised Labor’s traditional ideals. He said: “Socialist is not a word I would use to describe myself.” It was his understanding of what the Australian people wanted that led to his record re-election. He was eventually undone in 1991 when challenged by Paul Keating, Labor treasurer since 1983, after reneging on a deal to step down in the latter’s favour. The legacy of Hawke and Keating was that privatisation and deregulation opened up the economy and set it on a strong course. The reasons for Hawke’s fall from popular grace are still contested. In 2015 he claimed he had been dumped by Labor MPs because he had attacked the “innate prejudice” of some cabinet colleagues in his steps towards reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. But Hawke was not helped by a faltering economy at the end of the 1980s. Restructuring the trade unions and economic reforms had created 2m new jobs but also led to a recession, high interest rates and the highest unemployment since the 1930s. Supremely self-confident, Hawke had a well-known love of drink and women. His second wife and biographer, Blanche d’Alpuget, said in 2015 that the more intrusive media of today would have rendered him unelectable. In his memoirs, Hawke speculated that the world record he had set for downing the equivalent of a yard of ale, while a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, probably endeared him to more voters than any other single act. The convivial Hawke was a great celebrator and sports fan. He oversaw the contentious bicentenary of the arrival of the convict fleet in 1988, the introduction in 1984 of Advance Australia Fair as the Australian national anthem, replacing God Save the Queen, and the opening of the new parliament house in Canberra by the Queen. He was perhaps best loved for a seemingly boozy assertion on television early in his first term, after Australia had won the America’s Cup yachting trophy, that any boss who did not give staff the day off was “a bum”. His style was summed up by one ministerial colleague who found him gregarious, confident and without pretensions as he shared his trade union colleagues’ love of the simple things in life, such as football, horses and beer. “Hawke as prime minister was corporatist and bureaucratic by instinct and presidential in style,” said the former health minister Neal Blewett. “He was a supreme optimist, with an unquenchable faith in his ability to negotiate a way through intractable problems ... He was also a complete pragmatist, with only a few passions and less ideology.” For such a consummate and seasoned performer, Hawke’s entry to federal parliament came comparatively late, at the age of 50. He became prime minister after only two years in Canberra and had never served as a minister. But Hawke had authority with the people as well as their support. Graduating from Oxford with a thesis on wage-fixing in Australia, he joined the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1958 and after a decade as president, 1970-80, decided to enter politics. He was elected as Labor MP in October 1980 for the Melbourne seat of Wills. He had already served as president of the Australian Labor party from 1973 to 1978 and was one of the best-known and most admired public figures in the country. His political views were passionate though not always predictable. He opposed Australia’s entry into the Vietnam war and campaigned for racial equality in South Africa. At the same time he was a strong supporter of both the US-Australian alliance and the state of Israel. In 1979, the strain of his workload and his alcoholism, which he admitted in a TV interview, led to his physical collapse. His honesty and subsequent rehabilitation in his early years as an MP was rewarded with even higher ratings in the opinion polls, overshadowing both the Liberal prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, and the Labor opposition leader, Bill Hayden. Hawke sought to depose Hayden as leader, and succeeded, after a long and bruising fight, in March 1983. The same day, Fraser, who was not yet aware of the change, had called a sudden election, hoping to face Hayden instead of the popular Hawke. It was a spectacular miscalculation. A dejected Hayden described the public feeling against Fraser as such that “a drover’s dog could lead the Labor party to victory”. He might have been right, but Hawke romped home on a landslide – with Labor taking 75 of the 125 seats – to become prime minister, fulfilling an ambition and prediction he had made as a 15-year-old. One of his first moves was to call a summit of politicians, unions and employer groups, to forge a lasting accord around economic policy and deliver the kind of micro-economic reforms that would define his term. He used his authority, at first cautiously, to reverse the traditional party reliance on tariffs to protect industry and jobs from overseas competition. Those working in textiles and motor vehicles were most affected. Despite his background as a union leader, Hawke believed, with Keating, that the only way to make the structural changes necessary to competently manage the ailing economy was to work closely with both business and the workers, and to stress the mutual benefits of consensus. His government started deregulating the financial system by exposing it to competition, as had long been recommended but not implemented. First came the floating of the Australian dollar on the world market, rather than tying its value to any standard, then the removal of foreign exchange-rate controls and the entry of foreign banks into Australia. The process accelerated the integration of the economy into the world and reshaped Australia’s relationships with Asia, Europe and the US. Hawke was instrumental in forming Apec, the Asia-Pacific Economic forum, in 1989. Other reforms with lasting implications were the privatisation of state-run industries, including the airline Qantas, and selling off the state-owned Commonwealth Bank. Hawke also increased funding for schools, saw the introduction of the Medicare public health system and provided more targeted financial help for the most disadvantaged. He was at the helm for Australia’s effective public health campaigns as the response to the Aids epidemic grew into a major political issue. In 1990 he quickly supported the UN with armed forces in the first Iraq war. His close-knit relationship with the ambitious and confrontational Keating made many of these changes possible, but Hawke’s dream run came to an end as the good economic times began to sour. At a 1987 election campaign launch, Hawke’s overconfidence scored an own goal when he mistakenly proclaimed: “We set ourselves this first goal: by 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty.” He should have said “... need live in poverty”, and his departure from the prepared speech cost his credibility deeply. Hawke’s agenda had benefited from the disarray within the divided Liberal party, but he also fought internal battles with Labor’s socialist factions. One of the bitterest was the pilots’ strike in 1989, when the government sided with the airlines to end the damaging industrial action and maintain pay restraint. His close friendship with leading business figures, especially Sir Peter Abeles, who owned one of the airlines involved, hardly endeared him to the left. As the economy deteriorated, the rivalry between Hawke and Keating increased. In 1988, Hawke had agreed, in secret, to stand down after the 1990 election, but he delayed and reneged on the deal after taking umbrage at a typically provocative speech by Keating. History repeated itself and, just as Hawke had challenged Hayden 10 years earlier, Keating now contested the leadership. He lost, and left the frontbench. But the damage was done and Hawke, without his powerful treasurer, was seen as bereft of both energy and ideas, and his popularity declined. After a lacklustre response to the tax-and-spend policies of the new Liberal leader, John Hewson, Hawke was again challenged by Keating in December 1991 and narrowly defeated, in a sure sign that his colleagues had lost faith. In a tearful press conference, Hawke declared he had known the Australian electorate better than anyone and, in retrospect, given the disruption and chaos of the Labor leadership in recent years, few might disagree with him. Two months after losing the premiership, he resigned his parliamentary seat. In a full life after office, he took up a number of board positions and consultancies which, along with various business ventures, made him a wealthy man. He largely stayed away from politics while Keating was in power but later became more prominent at campaign launches and in the media. In 2009 he became only the third person, after the former prime minster Gough Whitlam and Whitlam’s wife, Margaret, to be awarded life membership of his party. At the ceremony, the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, called Hawke “the heart and soul of the Labor party”. He was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia in 1979. Hawke was born in Bordertown in rural South Australia, son of Clem, a Congregationalist minister, and Edith (nee Lee), known as Ellie, a schoolteacher. His uncle was a Labor premier of Western Australia in the 1950s. Hawke’s older brother, Neil, died of meningitis when he was young, and his mother’s belief in her surviving son’s abilities and destiny was said to have stoked his resilience. A serious motorbike crash when he was 17 led him to make the most of his talents. After Perth Modern school, he went to the University of Western Australia, where he gained degrees in law and economics, and then took a BLitt at University College, Oxford (1953-56). In 1956 he married Hazel Masterson, whom he had met as a teenager in the Congregational Youth Fellowship in Perth. She went on to become a popular public figure as the “first lady” and later in her own right as a campaigner for charities and Alzheimer’s research. They divorced in 1995. Hawke subsequently married d’Alpuget, who had written a biography of him in 1982, and in 2010 produced another volume on his years as prime minister. Later in life, he thanked Keating for throwing him out of office and giving him the “opportunity of marrying the woman with whom I’d fallen in love”. He is survived by Blanche and three children from his first marriage, Susan, Stephen and Rosslyn. His son Robert died in infancy. • Robert James Lee Hawke, politician, born 9 December 1929; died 16 May 2019"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/23/museums-imperialist-pasts-uncomfortable-art-tours-slavery-colonialism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T17:26:58Z","webTitle":"Museums are hiding their imperial pasts – which is why my tours are needed | Alice Procter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/museums-imperialist-pasts-uncomfortable-art-tours-slavery-colonialism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/museums-imperialist-pasts-uncomfortable-art-tours-slavery-colonialism","fields":{"headline":"Museums are hiding their imperial pasts – which is why my tours are needed","bodyText":"“Past events exist, after all, only in memory, which is a form of imagination,” wrote Ursula K Le Guin. “The event is real now, but once it’s then, its continuing reality is entirely up to us, dependent on our energy and honesty.” In the past few days I’ve been written about in the Times and splashed across the pages of the Daily Mail. An MP has called my work “sensationalist”. Apparently, applying modern understanding to the past is unscholarly, childish and disrespectful. When I started leading my Uncomfortable Art Tours around London museums last summer, the goal was to give an alternative view of imperialism, and look at the ways the British empire is represented by Tate Britain, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery and others. I am not affiliated to the institutions I guide in, so I’m free to interrogate their histories in a way that staff often can’t. We look at art commissioned by those on both sides of the abolitionist movement, unpack the subtle agendas in portraits, and examine the role of museums in creating hierarchies of “civilised” and “savage”. Most importantly, we talk. Being physically in a gallery, a space that privileges some experiences over others, and critiquing this, is a form of dissent. It’s a way of opening up the debate about whose stories deserve to be told – and whose faces seen – when we talk about Britishness and nationhood. Museums are institutions of memory – they must stop pretending there’s only one version of events, and be willing to own up to their role in shaping the way we see the past. There is no such thing as neutrality or objectivity. Every label in a gallery was written by a person. Every object was placed, every room was designed. Those people are reflecting their backgrounds in the choices they make, consciously or not. I make “Display It Like You Stole It” badges for people to wear on the tours. It’s a slogan designed to push museums and visitors to rethink the politics of presentation in galleries. On most text panels there’s little or no mention of how objects came to be there. Euphemistic language of “acquisition” obscures the truth. I don’t believe most visitors to the British Museum’s Benin and South Pacific collections, for example, or the V&amp;A’s Indian collections, come away understanding that these are largely the spoils of war. Short of actually repatriating these objects – which I believe museums should do – they must at least be open about their histories. You can look at the Gweagal shield in the British Museum and have no idea that it is considered crucial to the story of Indigenous and settler relations in Australia, that its position in the museum is extremely controversial, and it’s sought by Gweagal people today. The display and potential long-term loan to Ethiopia of the Maqdala treasures by the V&amp;A hints at an overdue shift towards self-awareness, and a willingness to sit with the enduring shame and pain of empire. But it’s just a hint. My tours, and projects like them, will continue until museums engage fully with their imperial legacies without needing to be prompted. I don’t know when that will happen, but it must. • Alice Procter is an independent tour guide, art historian and student at UCL"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/23/theresa-may-fantasists-brexit-compromise","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T17:19:49Z","webTitle":"May is chasing a fantasists’ Brexit.

She must change course now","bodyText":"Who can say, hand on heart, that the customs union was uppermost in their mind in the polling booth on referendum day? Each vote contained a multitude of motives, and the subtleties of the EU’s common external tariff were in the mix somewhere, but as obscure chemical elements in a complex electoral compound. The only certain description we have of that substance, sometimes called the will of the people, is that it is made up of 52 parts leave to 48 remain. Views on what Brexit means beyond that express preferences, not facts. Theresa May wants it to mean no customs union, although that might not even be her personal preference. It is borrowed from Tory MPs who believe total autonomy, when striking future trade deals, is the supreme goal to which all other economic considerations – not disrupting existing trade, for example – are subordinate. That faction was incensed by reports that the prime minister was amenable to compromise. Following the usual pattern, Downing Street quickly nursed their distemper with reassurance that the old red lines are unmoved. This skirmish has flared up for two reasons. First, the Lords last week amended the Brexit withdrawal bill with a clause advocating a customs union. Then reports emerged of a demolition job by European commission negotiators on solutions offered by UK officials to the problem of maintaining an invisible border in Northern Ireland without a customs union. What Downing Street thought to be an ingenious technical workaround looked in Brussels about as feasible as deploying herds of unicorns to check rules of origin and stop smugglers. May has been sent back to the drawing board with little time to spare. Meanwhile, MPs are sketching out the fall-back option. On Thursday the Commons will vote on a nonbinding resolution backing a customs union. There will then be a more consequential vote on the Lords’ amendment next month. This is all part of the longer struggle between May and parliament for control over Brexit. A crucial battle will be fought next week over another withdrawal bill amendment, introduced in the Lords with cross-party support, but brokered by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. The proposal addresses a scenario whereby May’s final Brexit package is rejected by parliament. As things stand, the default would be a tumble towards the exit with no deal. That proposition is too horrendous for most MPs to contemplate, which is why the government wants it to be the only alternative to its offer. The amendment would weave a safety net, forcing ministers to take instruction from MPs on what to do next if May’s deal is defeated. How that would work in practice is mysterious but, in theory, it removes some of the jeopardy from the autumn showdown. And May needs maximum jeopardy to impose discipline on her party. In particular, she needs the Tories to dread a sequence of events that somehow triggers a general election and propels Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. (There are Labour MPs who aren’t much less alarmed by that prospect.) This is partly why soft Brexiteers are seeding controversial amendments in the Lords. It is easier for Conservative MPs to vote for something handed down to them from the upper chamber than for something that their whips could decry as a frontbench Labour hit job on the prime minister. In an effort to ramp up the stakes, Downing Street hinted that votes on the customs union might be escalated to matters of confidence in the government, although it isn’t clear how that fits into the strictures of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The implied threat to put the government’s survival in the balance has receded but the underlying tension isn’t going away. The parliamentary timetable resembles a densely embroiled chess game. It is one of those brain-aching situations where multiple pieces are all threatening and protecting each other – pawns on knights on bishops on more pawns on rooks. No one in Westminster can see enough moves ahead to know where the advantage will lie in the endgame, after the frenzy of capture and counter-capture has thinned out the board. May is no grandmaster. The customs union trap was not hard to spot. To the EU she promised an invisible Irish border, and to Tory backbenchers she pledged freedom to diverge from European regulation. Those two things contradict one another. But May’s big blunder was earlier, when she became prime minister, in her Brexit-means-Brexit phase. She chose not to engage with the hidden complexities of a project made to look easy by the binary referendum question. She did not accept that there were ways to leave the EU other than the hardest, steepest path. She might have considered staying in the single market, the European Economic Area or the European Free Trade Association. Those are bona fide Brexits, but better calibrated to the 52:48 people’s ratio. Instead May was persuaded that democracy demanded a formula closer to 100:0. That is the least stable compound of all. It wouldn’t have been easy to sell a 52:48 Brexit. Some leavers would feel it sullied the ideal of immaculate separation. Hardcore remainers would pine for full integration. But disappointment is built into any Brexit model because the technocratic grind of ending EU membership cannot satisfy the heroic promises of national renewal made by the leave campaign. And those Tories with an appetite for 100% pure Brexit are the least satiable people in politics. They gobble concessions and ask for more. May could storm out of Brussels tomorrow and they would complain that she hadn’t slammed the door hard enough. May faced a choice between a fantasy Brexit, designed only to gratify a minority who are immune to gratification, and real Brexits that require compromise on every side. It wasn’t an appealing decision, but nor was it a hard one. Still she chose poorly. It wouldn’t be easy for her to change course now. But nor is it too late. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/24/food-banks-norm-trussell-trust-emma-revie","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T05:00:12Z","webTitle":"Emma Revie: Why food banks must never become the norm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/24/food-banks-norm-trussell-trust-emma-revie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/24/food-banks-norm-trussell-trust-emma-revie","fields":{"headline":"Emma Revie: Why food banks must never become the norm","bodyText":"The Trussell Trust is arguably one of the charity “success” stories of the austerity years. Against a backdrop of escalating poverty, an obscure outfit giving out bags of food to a handful of hungry people in Wiltshire has grown, in less than a decade, into a highly visible campaigning voice overseeing a national network of more than 1,200 food bank outlets, staffed, largely, by thousands of volunteers, giving out more than a million food parcels each year. Its rapid rise is both impressive and alarming, and Trussell itself realises it has reached a watershed moment: at what point does endless growth represent mission failure for an anti‑poverty charity? “You get up each day trying to put yourself out of business,” says Trussell’s new chief executive, Emma Revie. But, as she recognises, it’s not quite that easy. The demand for charity food parcels from people with no money to buy food shows little sign of abating. Indeed, as Trussell’s latest research, published on Tuesday, shows, recent months have seen referrals turbo-boosted by the rollout of universal credit. In the year to the end of March 2018 it distributed 1,332,952 three-day emergency food parcels in the UK, a 13% increase on the previous year. Demand for charity food bags grew by 52% in areas where universal credit was fully rolled out. The seemingly unstoppable rise in demand has created the logistical headache of how to ensure enough food is available in food banks to cope with this new wave of hunger and destitution. But it also raises more profound questions: should Trussell continue to try to run even faster to catch the increasing numbers of people falling through the gaping cracks in the welfare state safety net? Is it in danger of becoming an informal part of a dysfunctional social security system? And, even if it wants to reverse the expansion of recent years, how can it possibly do that without abandoning its core, faith‑driven mission of feeding the poor? “What I love about the Trussell Trust approach is that there is not an acceptance that we are a safety net that will always be there,” says Revie, who joined the trust this year after a career in youth and overseas aid charities. “We have to be there because the statutory safety net has too many holes in it. We will catch as many as we can, but we want to not be here.” Trussell, she says, will never become “a pseudo-safety net that lets the state off the hook”. In practice, she accepts the trust cannot unilaterally walk away from its emergency role. Countless studies – and Trussell’s own data – have shown food bank activity broadly follows the dynamic of government welfare cuts. For Trussell to do less ultimately means a more generous social security policy. “What system-wide change needs to take place so that I’m not talking about a 13% increase in the need for emergency food, I’m talking about a 20% decrease? That’s where we are at the moment. I can’t get away from the fact there is still a crisis. But we can’t accept the premise ‘It just is’. How do we stop this?” Trussell was for some years ostentatiously ignored by Department for Work and Pensions ministers for whom food banks were a political embarrassment; now, says Revie, “very effective communications channels” are in place. Although for years the government has doggedly resisted changing course on welfare, Revie points to Trussell’s recent success – alongside many other organisations – in demonstrating how the flawed design and implementation of universal credit was driving debt, hunger, ill-health and eviction among the poorest claimants. That forced the government to introduce a few relatively minor tweaks to the system. It is too early to tell whether these have had any effect on food bank use. Revie – who says universal credit is “not fit for purpose” as a safety net – is clear that further changes are crucial. Trussell’s approach is three-pronged: to support its food bank outlets to provide emergency food; to expand its food bank-based More Than Food services to provide debt, benefits and health advice to tackle some of the underlying issues that create food bank reliance; and, in the form of its forthcoming three-year State of Hunger research project, to build a powerful evidence base to demonstrate what policy changes need to take place to end the need for food banks. For some campaigners, however, Trussell’s exit strategy looks less credible following its decision earlier this year to accept £9m over three years from the supermarket giant Asda. At a stroke this grows Trussell’s annual income by roughly 50% – not obviously a sign of a charity wishing to abolish itself. The danger, say critics, is that such funding helps prop up food banks – and offers corporate funders an opportunity to “whitewash” their own shortcomings; for example, on paying poor wages. “Experience from the US and Canada has shown that funding from the corporate food industry tends only to further institutionalise charitable food aid [and] does little to address food insecurity,” said the Independent Food Aid Network, which represents some of the hundreds of non-Trussell food banks in the UK. Revie admits it was a “hard decision” to partner with Asda. But ultimately, she argues, it brings in “transformational” levels of resources, with no strings attached. “The nature of our relationship is that they have asked us what things would really make a difference and they have agreed to fund that. And obviously there is a benefit to Asda from that relationship but we have not signed up to stop speaking truth to power – we will continue to.” One of the concerns of poverty campaigners is that food banks, five years ago such an appalling novelty, are now becoming grimly accepted as a “normal” part of the austerity scenery. Revie believes that the British public are still discomfited by the idea of food banks, and wants Trussell to ensure this remains so. “It’s really important to continue to be affronted by the fact people are having to go to food banks because they don’t have enough money to buy food,” she says. “We will keep telling that story.” Curriculum vitae Age: 42.

Michael Billington notes in his review of the Rose Theatre’s production (20 April) that Benedick reacts with a line that is said as if written: “Love me? Why? It must be requited.” Benedick is asking “why?” in bewilderment: “Why on earth should she love me?” is the sense. The line is bound to raise a laugh. The Rose Theatre production is certainly not the first to interpret the line in this way. Two 2011 productions do the same: David Tennant’s Benedick at the Wyndham Theatre, and Charles Edwards at The Globe (though the latter delivered the line rather hesitantly). But the line as written is: “Love me? Why it must be requited.” The sense is “She loves me? Well then, it must be requited.” This use of “why” to mean “well then” is very common in Shakespeare. There is no doubt at all that this is what the line means; the “why on earth” interpretation is funny, but wrong. Yes, it’s all good fun of course, and no reason for indignation. But it does raise the question why, with so much humour there in the drama, it should be found necessary to play with the text to add in jokes that aren’t there.

In less than a week, a story that was for too long begging for attention became front-page news and in the process won the hearts of a nation and engaged the mind of a government. I want to recognise this seminal work by Amelia in almost singlehandedly leading the charge. The Caribbean owes her an immeasurable debt of gratitude, and I commend her for an immense dedication to her craft and outstanding service to the people of the Caribbean. While we are not there yet, I am now optimistic that soon, in large part because of Amelia’s work, those elderly West Indians who lived in fear will be able to embrace their loved ones and join hands and sing, in the words of the old Negro spiritual, “Free at last, Free at last, Thank God almighty, We are free at last.” Guy Hewitt High commissioner for Barbados to the United Kingdom • Congratulations to the Guardian – and to David Lammy MP – for the brilliant exposure of the gut-wrenching Windrush scandal. But among the rightful condemnation of the “hostile environment” brought in by Theresa May and reinforced by Amber Rudd, we must not overlook the responsibility of those who have implemented the policy. The destruction of the lives of a generation of hard-working British citizens would not have happened without the active collusion of a range of bodies who should be profoundly ashamed of their actions as a mindless immigration police force. Why did they target a selective group of longstanding employees, NHS patients, tenants, service users? Proactively complying with the law in such an obviously discriminatory manner has resulted in these heartless actions that are central to one of the most graphic examples of institutionalised racism since the Stephen Lawrence case. As history has taught us, “simply obeying orders” is a profoundly slippery slope. The 2014 Immigration Act enshrining the “hostile environment” must certainly be repealed. Until then, leaders and managers of mainstream institutions must use common sense, decency and judgment, and refuse to be collaborators in this system of appalling racial and social injustice. Gideon Ben-Tovim Senior fellow in sociology, University of Liverpool • Can we please stop demanding apologies, or resignations, or, worse still, independent inquiries, into the harm done by the “hostile environment” (Government knew of risk to Windrush generation, 23 April). What is needed is a prompt decision by the government to suspend the operation of the “hostile environment” measures introduced in the Immigration Acts 2014 and 2016, a reduction in immigration application fees, and a decision by the Home Office to prioritise careful decision-making in accordance with the law, and cut delays for applicants. I write as an immigration solicitor at Kent Law Clinic. Following the 2012 loss of legal aid, I have been the only solicitor in Kent providing a free service for non-asylum immigration clients. The clinic acts for many non-“Windrush” clients also facing loss of accommodation, work, benefits and family life because of the “hostile environment”. To me and many other immigration practitioners, it was clear as soon as Theresa May made her announcement in 2013 that, although directed against “illegal immigrants”, people here lawfully would be affected. It has been clear since the 2006 and 2013 declarations by two different home secretaries (John Reid and Theresa May) that the Home Office immigration department was “not fit for purpose” and that concentrating on rooting out “illegal migrants” has for many years been a losing as well as a spiteful strategy. It should be clear now that the “hostile environment” is itself creating illegality among ordinary individuals and families, and should be abandoned forthwith. Sheona York Kent Law Clinic, University of Kent • Today I read yet another account of the human cost of the hostile environment policy on the Windrush generation (Left destitute: ‘I had to beg for money to pay for electricity’, 23 April). In 2014 Trevor Johnson was told wrongly by the Home Office that he was in the UK illegally, and not allowed to work or claim benefits. The predictable consequences were that he was threatened with deportation, his benefits were stopped and he and his family faced destitution and eviction. Just the year before, in April 2013, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo) came into force. Laspo removed from the scope of legal aid each of those areas of law: immigration, welfare benefits, debt and early housing advice. Laspo did not just mean that private practice solicitors could not advise on certain legal problems but also slashed the capacity of Law Centres, Citizens Advice Bureaux and Shelter housing aid centres to provide specialist help to people facing the harsh, and unlawful, decisions of public bodies. The government is currently undertaking a post-implementation review of Laspo. Let us hope that, like Amelia Gentleman’s superb journalism, the focus of the review is the effect the Laspo has had on the lives of people like Trevor Johnson.

By siding with the conservative forces who bloodily suppressed the students’ call for democracy and reform, Jiang secured his succession to the presidency four years later. By the time he retired in 2002, China had been transformed. Shopping centres rose along the Avenue of Everlasting Peace, where tanks and armoured cars had killed protesters. Young families ate in McDonald’s and KFC instead of buying pancakes from street vendors, and a new metro ran under the square, carrying the tens of thousands who once had cycled to work. And in the year before Jiang stepped down, China “entered the world” – the phrase used by the Chinese media for joining the World Trade Organization. In spite of some shaky episodes, Jiang also succeeded in building a stable relationship with the US. In his parting speech, at the 16th party congress in November 2002, Jiang completed the dismantling of Maoist China begun by his patron Deng Xiaoping, when he formally invited China’s “new social strata” – private entrepreneurs, employees of foreign firms and the self-employed – to join the party. There was no more talk of the “ultimate goal of communism”: the guiding ideology instead was Jiang’s much vaunted and awkwardly phrased doctrine of the Three Represents. These urged the party to pursue the goal of national prosperity through advancing the “productive forces”, promoting national culture and defending the “fundamental interests” of the Chinese people. Jiang had another virtue for the ageing leaders headed by Deng who chose him in 1989 when the Communist party seemed to have forfeited all public trust: he was no closet reformer and would ensure that the party stayed in power. He could be ruthless and vindictive in this pursuit – notoriously so when he suppressed the Falun Gong spiritual cult after its members had demonstrated peacefully outside his Beijing office in 1999. A shrewd political manipulator, Jiang would plant some of his people in positions of power to complicate life for his successor as president, Hu Jintao, until Jiang’s influence faded at the next party congress in 2007. While not greatly liked, Jiang had a quirky personality that raised him above the generally less colourful figures of the post-Mao party apparatus. Jiang belonged to the “third generation” consisting of those leaders who had “joined the revolution” in the 1940s after the Long March and during or soon after the defeat of Japan. His own background was barely revolutionary. Yangzhou on the Yangtze River, where he was born, is described by his non-official western biographer Bruce Gilley (in Tiger on the Brink, 1998) as the equivalent – at that time – of Bath in the UK or New Haven, Connecticut, in the US. Several of Jiang’s family were scholars, although not from the landed gentry. Jiang’s father forced him to learn classical Chinese texts by rote before he went to school. Later he recalled developing a love of western classical music – Schubert’s Ave Maria and Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony were favourites. At Yangzhou’s progressive secondary school, Jiang was taught to recite the Gettysburg address in English. As an engineering student in Nanjing during the Japanese occupation, Jiang was not politically active, although he claimed later to have been a secret communist supporter. He joined the party in postwar Shanghai in 1946, when repression by Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist (Kuomintang) government and the approach of civil war forced many young Chinese to choose sides. He played a minor role in student protests, painting cartoons and playing the two-stringed fiddle in anti-government dramatic productions. As a factory engineer in Shanghai, Jiang belonged to a technical elite of which the new people’s government needed to make full use when it took power in 1949. By 1954 he was in Beijing, helping to draw up a plan for the First Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry, before transferring to Changchun in the north-east, China’s industrial heartland. He was then sent for a year’s training at the Stalin auto works in Moscow – this was at the time when China sought to learn from its Russian “big brother”. The experience gave him a smattering of Russian vocabulary and lyrics to add to his stock of English. In later life he would show off as a somewhat tedious party trick what he remembered of both languages. Jiang spent six years at the Changchun car factory, in charge of the crucial power plant, where he had to cope with the extravagant demands for increased production during the Great Leap Forward of 1958-61. He appears to have delivered the goods whenever possible, earning the reputation of someone who got results and did not step out of line. Transferred to a research institute in Shanghai – soon to be the centre of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) – he continued to keep his head down. During the upheaval he was suspended from work for three years but not treated badly. By 1970 he was back in Beijing, working on plans to import machinery plant from eastern Europe. When China embarked on economic reform after Mao’s death in 1976, Jiang seemed a natural choice to solicit foreign trade and investment for the new special economic zones along the southern coast. By 1982 he was minister of electronics, and oversaw the launching of China’s first communications satellite. Three years later he was mayor of Shanghai, charming foreign businessmen with his snatches of English. Shanghai gave Jiang a test of his political as well as technological skills. He kept the student protests of winter 1986 under control and handled the more turbulent protests of 1989 without resorting to military force. He had been promoted to the politburo in 1987, part of an intake of new provincial faces being prepared to succeed the party elders. In May 1989, as the political centre unravelled in Beijing while the pro-democracy movement filled Tiananmen Square, Jiang was summoned secretly by Deng and told to prepare for the top party job of general secretary. He would replace Zhao Ziyang, who had brought about his own downfall by opposing the imposition of martial law. In the years after the Beijing massacre, Jiang personified the economic reforms launched by Deng in order to restore a measure of public confidence in the party. Jiang was never short of self-confidence – another essential as the Chinese leadership became more exposed to the outside world. Sometimes this led him to embarrassing displays of vanity: in 1996 he startled King Juan Carlos of Spain by combing his hair during a welcome ceremony. But it also enabled him to put on a convincing performance in his famous double act with Bill Clinton in Beijing two years later, swapping thoughts in public on everything from democracy to Tibet. “He’s a man of extraordinary intellect, very high energy, a lot of vigour for his age, or indeed for any age,” the US president enthused. “He has vision; he can visualise; he can imagine a future that is different from the present.” The members of the minuscule China Democracy party, who took this at face value and announced their intention of organising politically, soon learned their mistake, earning savage prison sentences of up to 15 years. In February 1997 Jiang wept as he gave the funeral oration for Deng: the tears may have been genuine. Deng had survived long enough for Jiang to establish himself, disproving conventional wisdom that a party general secretary without any power base in the armed forces would be vulnerable. In Deng’s last enfeebled years, Jiang was already beginning to claim ideological territory in which he had previously shown no interest. This was partly in response to the tidal wave of corruption that threatened to undermine the party, while the public became more alienated and turned to new religions. It was also the ritual prop for a supreme leader. As state president, party leader and head of the military commission, Jiang’s ambition grew as his position strengthened. His admirers now claimed that “the thought of Jiang Zemin” would guide China into the new millennium. By the year 2000, a team of theorists was hard at work packaging his speeches for publication. A more practical achievement was Jiang’s success in riding out an uneasy period in relations with the new US administration of George W Bush. Upon his inauguration in January 2001, Bush made it clear that he regarded the relationship with China as one of “strategic competition” rather than of co-operation. A chance event three months later, when a US spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter and made a forced landing on Hainan Island, raised tension further. However Jiang resisted the protests of Chinese chauvinists and was convinced by his foreign policy advisers that maintaining stable relations with the US should remain China’s long-term goal. In the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September 2001, Jiang moved quickly to assure Bush that China stood by his side in the “war on terror” and Chinese commentators noted with relief that China had a new value for Washington. Within the next year, Jiang and Bush met three times on friendly terms. Though Jiang stepped down from party leadership in 2002, and from the state presidency at the national people’s congress in 2003, he stubbornly hung on to his other state position as head of the central military commission. More than 7% of the normally docile congress delegates showed their disquiet by abstaining or voting against this appointment. Jiang surrendered this last post in September 2004. This date also marked the cut-off point for the three volumes of his selected works published two years later, which Hu loyally called “a major event in the political life of the party and the state”. At the 17th party congress in 2007, Jiang still sat next to Hu at the podium and heard more praise for his “important thoughts”, but no one doubted that Jiang had “stepped down from the stage” – the Chinese expression (xiatai) for political retirement. He had one consolation: just a month before, he had stood on a different stage, at Beijing’s new National Grand theatre, and sung snatches of arias from both western and Peking opera. Although regarded as one of the “party elders”, thereafter Jiang rarely appeared in public because of ill health. Jiang’s more consensual approach to internal political life now seems very distant from the assertive and increasingly repressive rule of the current leader, Xi Jinping. The stable relationship that Jiang achieved with the US, already weakened, was further weakened by President Donald Trump’s trade war, and more recently by growing mistrust on both sides over a host of issues including Taiwan, the South China Sea and human rights, with both powers framing the relationship in more antagonistic terms. Jiang is survived by his wife, Wang Yeping, whom he married in 1949, and their sons, Mianheng and Miankang. • Jiang Zemin, politician, born 17 August 1926; died 30 November 2022"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/24/brexit-weekly-briefing-customs-union-fast-becoming-the-big-issue","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"Brexit weekly briefing: customs union fast becoming the big issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/24/brexit-weekly-briefing-customs-union-fast-becoming-the-big-issue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/24/brexit-weekly-briefing-customs-union-fast-becoming-the-big-issue","fields":{"headline":"Brexit weekly briefing: customs union fast becoming the big issue","bodyText":"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing.

If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian Supporter. Thank you. Top news To stay or not to stay in the customs union? (And if you’re not sure what the it is and why it matters, here’s a handy guide.) That’s fast becoming the question after the government suffered humiliating defeats in the Lords. Most notably, and with the support of 24 Tories including three ex-ministers, peers convincingly backed an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill that would force the government to explain what it had done to pursue remaining in a union. Theresa May came under heavy pressure to reopen the question of Britain’s membership of a customs union, which has been one of the government’s red lines since her Lancaster House speech in January last year. Ministers braced themselves for a crunch early Commons vote on the same issue this week after 10 select committee chairs – including Conservatives – tabled a motion urging the government to “include as an objective in negotiations … the establishment of an effective customs union”. Amid rumours that the prime minister was ready to agree to staying in , pro-Brexiters lined up to warn darkly against a betrayal that they said would precipitate a political crisis, Downing Street was forced to rule out any U-turn. Unfortunately, business would like a customs union. So would Labour, the Irish government (because it would help solve that pesky border problem) and the EU, which again rejected the UK’s Irish border proposals – and added that Brexit talks could still fail. So, Theresa: no pressure. In other news, the government on Monday suffered its third Brexit defeat in the Lords in less than a week (on excluding EU rights from national law), and talks on the future relationship between the EU and UK finally got under way, somewhat unspectacularly. Best of the rest EU officials dismiss City minister’s notion of UK sweetheart deal. Home secretary says online registration for EU citizens will be “as easy as shopping at [upmarket fashion retailer] LK Bennett”. Japanese ambassador warns there’s no deal better than the single market. Price comparison site data may have been used by Leave.EU. Chancellor says Brexit transition deal has averted City job losses. Brexit divorce bill could exceed £39bn, Whitehall watchdog warns. UK urged to launch EU citizen registration drive in pubs and schools. May woos Indian PM Modi in search of free-trade deal. Arron Banks’ call centre staff worked on Brexit campaign, MPs told. Top comment In the Guardian, Rafael Behr argues that May is chasing a fantasist’s Brexit and must change course now to seek a sensible compromise – no one will be totally happy, but a brave prime minister would do what was right: May is no grandmaster. The customs union trap was not hard to spot. To the EU she promised an invisible Irish border, and to Tory backbenchers she pledged freedom to diverge from European regulation. Those two things contradict one another. But May’s blunder was earlier, when she chose not to engage with the hidden complexities of a project made to look easy by the binary referendum question. She did not accept that there were ways to leave the EU other than the hardest. She might have considered staying in the single market, the European Economic Area or the European Free Trade Association. Those are bona fide Brexits, but better calibrated to the 52:48 people’s ratio. Instead May was persuaded that democracy demanded a formula closer to 100:0. That is the least stable compound of all … May faced a choice between a fantasy Brexit, designed only to gratify a minority who are immune to gratification, and real Brexits that require compromise on every side. It wasn’t an appealing decision, but nor was it a hard one. Still she chose poorly. It wouldn’t be easy for her to change course now. But nor is it too late. In the FT (paywall), Gideon Rachman wonders whether Brexit could yet be stopped over the customs union question, which is so critical because it marks the frontier between a “hard” and a “soft” deal: Some British officials surmise that the prime minister may even secretly want the Commons to vote for a customs union. Their argument is that Mrs May knows that a customs union makes sense, but that she cannot currently argue for this option for fear of provoking a rebellion by Tory Leavers. On the other hand, if the prime minister’s hand were forced by a parliamentary vote, she could “reluctantly” embrace a customs union. The danger with this Machiavellian strategy, however, is that it could backfire. Losing British sovereignty over trade policy might be a concession too far for Tory Leavers. Leading ministers such as Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Liam Fox, the trade secretary, are thought to be ready to resign over the issue. That could trigger a leadership challenge to Mrs May, and the fall of the government. It is this situation that led one leading British political analyst to predict to me recently that Brexit will not happen because “there is no version of Brexit that can get a parliamentary majority”. My own conclusion is that nobody really knows. There are just too many uncertainties.

The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Monday he was “minded to” issue a public interest intervention notice for an in-depth inquiry and would come to a final decision “shortly”. The move follows the decision by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) this month to open an initial investigation into the deal. Hancock said: “The first public interest ground is the need for free expression of opinion, and concerns the potential impact the transfer of newspapers would have on editorial decision making.” The minister said he was also considering whether the deal raised potential completion concerns. “The second ground is the need for a sufficient plurality of views in newspapers, to the extent that it is reasonable or practicable,” said Hancock. “The merged entity would own the largest share of national titles within the UK newspaper market, owning nine out of 20 national newspaper titles.” In February, Trinity Mirror’s shareholders voted to approve the deal to buy the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday newspapers, as well as magazines including celebrity title OK!. They will join its national titles the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. However, the CMA issued an order forcing Trinity Mirror to leave Express Newspapers as a standalone business until plurality and competition concerns can be fully investigated. Hancock and the CMA, which will decide on whether to launch a full investigation by 7 June, have the powers to block or amend the deal. If Hancock orders an investigation into the impact on media plurality, it will be carried out by the media regulator, Ofcom. Days after the shareholder vote, the editors of the Daily Express and Daily Star resigned. Trinity Mirror immediately announced the appointment of two of its own executives – the Sunday Mirror and Sunday People editor, Gary Jones, and the Daily Mirror associate editor, Jon Clark – as replacements. Simon Fox, the Trinity Mirror chief executive, has repeatedly pledged that his Labour-supporting Daily and Sunday Mirror will keep Desmond’s Brexit-supporting titles editorially independent. Reacting to the announcement of an investigation he said: “This is a part of the process that we were aware was possible following our acquisition of the Northern &amp; Shell publishing assets. We continue to believe there are no plurality or competition issues. “We would expect any review by Ofcom arising from this DCMS statement would happen in parallel with the CMA review, which we expect to conclude by June 7 2018.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/23/if-only-the-wests-motives-for-syria-strikes-were-more-principled","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T17:03:07Z","webTitle":"If only the west’s motives for Syria strikes were more principled | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/if-only-the-wests-motives-for-syria-strikes-were-more-principled","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/23/if-only-the-wests-motives-for-syria-strikes-were-more-principled","fields":{"headline":"If only the west’s motives for Syria strikes were more principled","bodyText":"Peter Beaumont says of chemical weapons that “the idea that other weapons are equally deadly misses the point, which is that we have decided that this class of killing – like the wanton murder of civilians and shooting prisoners – is beyond the pale” (Poison gas has been taboo for a century. It must remain so, 19 April). However, he misses a wider context himself – that the world order is one in which stronger nations use their military and economic power to subdue weaker ones with impunity. As long as this is the case, less strong countries will use whatever means come to hand to try to level the playing field; much like a resistance movement does to a foreign occupier. We don’t, for instance, condemn the Maquis their second world war excesses in murdering captured German soldiers. The obvious answer to stopping the use of chemical weapons is to strengthen global multilateral bodies like the UN, and give them greater powers to regulate and conciliate international disputes. Donald Trump wants to degrade the UN and starve it of funds. The US will no doubt have much greater “success” in its anti-UN endeavour than its token strikes against supposed chemical weapons facilities in Syria will have in stopping the proliferation and further use of chemical weapons. Joe McCarthy Dublin, Ireland • Why are three of the world’s biggest exporters of arms so obsessed with the taboo on chemical weapons? They invoke the inhumanity of chemical weapons to justify intervention in Syria. Yet they have no compunction about other horrible materials that they continue to develop and produce, including the worst of them all, nuclear weapons. Recent amendments to the Rome statute of the international criminal court reinforce prohibitions on various inhumane weapons when used in internal conflicts. It seems ironic that neither Britain nor France have ratified these amendments. Could it be that among the “humanitarian” motives of Donald Trump and his myrmidons in Britain and France in enforcing the taboo on chemical weapons is a desire to prevent proliferation of the “poor man’s weapons of mass destruction” so as to better preserve the monopoly of a few states over nuclear weapons, the rich man’s weapon of mass destruction? William Schabas Professor of international law, Middlesex University London • One of your correspondents (Letters, 19 April) argued that “if in 2011 we had sided with Russia and supported the legitimate and stable government of Syria”, it would have saved the immense loss of life and destruction of the country. He blames us all as “willing accessories” to this destruction. His description of the regime gives the game away: legitimate and stable. Certainly it was internationally recognised and until 2011 stable. But it was a dictatorship based on the subjection of the great majority of Syrians to a small minority. Its stability had come from “a peace of the dead” following the brutal suppression of the majority Sunnis by Hafez al-Assad at Hama in 1982. This majority had a legitimate right to demonstrate for freedom and democracy. Sadly, the Assad regime replied with brutal repression and not surprisingly some Syrians reacted with violence. The destruction of Syria was caused by the persistent refusal of the Assad regime, backed by Russia, to negotiate a settlement and its cynical fostering of extreme jihadist groups in order to discredit the opposition. Keith Morris London • Peter Beaumont writes that the use of chemical weapons has been “taboo” since the second world war, until Bashar al-Assad allegedly used them against his own people during the current Syrian conflict. How quickly the tragic story of the Kurds is forgotten. During the Iran-Iraq war, Saddam Hussein savagely gassed several Kurdish villages, using chemical weapons given to him by the United States. This war crime elicited no humanitarian intervention from the west, as at the time Hussein was a close ally of the US in his war against the Islamic Republic of Iran. History unfortunately repeated itself earlier this year when the Kurds, former allies of the west in their fight against Islamic State, were savagely attacked by the Turkish army and a mercenary force made up of various Islamist groups. The western powers, as well as western commentators, saw no need to argue for an intervention to help the Kurds, who were once again left to suffer their fate. Beaumont also ignores the murderous use of various chemical agents by the US military in Vietnam. Napalm and Agent Orange were both key elements of American strategy during the Vietnam war. Vietnamese people continue to suffer the deadly consequences of the use of chemical defoliants in the form of rare cancers and birth complications.

The new institute would be set up for similar reasons as Cern, the particle physics lab near Geneva, which was created after the second world war to rebuild European physics and reverse the brain drain of the brightest and best scientists to the US. Named the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems, or Ellis, the proposed AI institute would have major centres in a handful of countries, the UK included, with each employing hundreds of computer engineers, mathematicians and other scientists with the express aim of keeping Europe at the forefront of AI research. In an open letter that urges governments to act, the scientists describe how Europe has not kept up with the US and China, where the vast majority of leading AI firms and universities are based. The letter adds that while a few “research hotspots” still exist in Europe, “virtually all of the top people in those places are continuously being pursued for recruitment by US companies.” The extent of the hiring frenzy and the damaging impact it is having on British universities was revealed in a Guardian investigation last year. It found that PhD students had left their studies for six-figure salaries at US tech firms. Meanwhile, some universities had been hit so hard that they had lost an entire generation of talented young researchers. The letter, signed by scientists in the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Israel and the Netherlands, calls for work on the new institute to start this year. Under the proposal, participating countries would fund the institute as an intergovernmental organisation. The same approach is used to fund the European Molecular Biology Lab, which has a major centre in Cambridge. “Something needs to be done and it needs to be done now,” said Zoubin Ghahramani, professor of information engineering at Cambridge University and chief scientist at Uber. “It would provide Europe with centres of mass where we would have not 10 researchers but hundreds with expertise from different countries.” Ghahramani, one of the most influential AI researchers in Britain, joined Uber after the San Francisco-based firm bought Geometric Intelligence, an AI startup he co-founded with a New York University psychologist some years ago. Despite the move, which exemplifies the problems Europe now faces, he has driven the UK’s involvement in the proposal for the new lab. “This is of such importance to Europe it would be a terrible mistake not to do something major,” he said. “If we don’t act in this area, both European universities and European industry will start to drift downwards.” The institute’s stated mission is to ensure that the best AI research is performed in Europe, a goal that would drive jobs and economies and also give the region’s scientists a voice in shaping how AI changes the world, the scientists believe. Those who work at the institute would have the freedom to work with industry and launch startup companies based on the breakthroughs they make. Private and public investment in AI have soared on the back of breakthroughs in the field over the past few decades, but the US and China have firmly taken the lead. The technology has such potential that its impact on society is widely expected to be as profound as the industrial revolution. The first steps in building the institute are expected to begin with a collaboration between France and Germany with other nations joining later. Ultimately, each local lab would become a $100m facility with an annual budget of $30m. The potential for AI to have a dramatic impact on lives, by taking decisions in areas from healthcare and policing to defence and transport, has led to serious questions over who writes the rules on how AI is used. If Europe steps back and watches AI research from the sidelines, it will have little say in shaping its future, Ghahramani said. “The regulatory environment for technology is often led by the people who control the technology,” he said. Another major supporter of the institute, Bernard Schölkopf, director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany, said: “Europe has a unique academic research tradition, so we have managed to keep up for a number of years. But the US and China have recognised the strategic importance of this field and no single European country is a match for this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/23/mark-pulisic-father-christian-usa-soccer","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"'Coaching is something I love': Christian Pulisic's father follows his passion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/23/mark-pulisic-father-christian-usa-soccer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/23/mark-pulisic-father-christian-usa-soccer","fields":{"headline":"'Coaching is something I love': Christian Pulisic's father follows his passion","bodyText":"Blending into the background doesn’t seem to bother Mark Pulisic one bit. It was true last year while tucked away on the southern shores of Lake Ontario in Rochester, upstate New York. And it’s equally the case this year further south on the banks of the Monongahela River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Where it counts most, Mark has been the ultimate background figure for some time: as father to 19-year-old US soccer phenom and Borussia Dortmund attacker Christian Pulisic. Omnipresent as his young teen navigated the brisk transition from ordinary schoolboy to an entire country’s next great hope of world-classdom, in this theater he was simply: Mark, Christian Pulisic’s dad-cum-youth coach. The family name has cache these days. There to be exploited. “I could have already cashed in on his name,” comes the terse response to the mere notion. Pulisic senior is speaking from his current home base with the Pittsburgh Riverhounds, down in the United Soccer League, US soccer’s second tier, where he’s an assistant. “That’s not what I’m about. That’s not in my fiber or my belief.” Now ensconced back home after a quiet, unheralded return stateside a year ago, Mark Pulisic is in no mood for pretense. He’d been in Germany primarily as a parent. But he’s nevertheless a man determined to succeed on his own merits, more than a regent with a coaching badge. Or as put by Jochen Graf, the Tampa Bay Rowdies striker who was there in Rochester last year as Mark slipped back into the United States and his old career, almost unnoticed: “He’s not just all about his son. He doesn’t even want to be known as, ‘Oh, this is just Christian Pulisic’s father.’” Mark is a minted professional in his own right, the Pulisic name first forged in the early 1990s wasteland of US soccer as Mark turned pro in the popular indoor game of the time – first as a player, then as an aspirant young coach. Soccer had been a given for the New York native as the son of a Hajduk Split-supporting man from a small island in Croatia. Mark had even retraced his father’s footsteps to the former Yugoslavia, then at war, in pursuit of his soccer dream only to be chased home amid the din of military choppers and fighter jets overhead. So he carved out a successful career with the Harrisburg Heat as a prolific penalty box poacher, with a coaching inclination quickly following. He earned his coaching licenses, putting them to work at a low-level college while still a player. Years later, a child prodigy on his hands, his own ambitions took a backseat. By the start of 2017, as Christian came of age in Dortmund, where Mark had been living as dutiful dad for his boy’s first two and a half years with the Bundesliga giants, the Pulisic family decided the time had come for the now young man to fly solo. So Mark would be able to return under his own weight to the pro game he’d parked some years before. That he did – though far off the radar of soccer’s chattering classes. To the surprise of some who thought he might reach higher, he quietly took an assistant coach’s role in the USL with the Rochester Rhinos. A year on, he remains down there with the Riverhounds. Still an assistant, still in the background, still seemingly content to occupy that space. “I wanted to get back into coaching, 100%,” says the 49-year-old. “I knew that once Christian was ready to be there [in Germany] alone that I would have the opportunity to get back into coaching, something I love. In any capacity.” That apparently low bar he set himself might be slightly misleading. Bob Lilley, Mark’s boss in Pittsburgh and prior in Rochester, remembers when the Pulisic family returned from a short period living in England a little over 10 years ago. They’d been there at the behest of Mark’s wife, Kelley, as she pursued a teaching opportunity. On their return, explains Lilley, Mark laid down an almost instant marker of his capabilities. “When they came back he took a job in Detroit with an indoor team and he won immediately. Because he had ideas.” That included a coach of the year gong. Lilley speaks as someone who’s known Mark for 32 years, since their days together playing on the same college team. They’re close friends. Then again, Lilley himself boasts a concerted record of success as a head coach at the sub-MLS level. Ask Mark what his coaching ceiling might be, and he hedges. “Right now, I’m happy being an assistant because I have a little more time to follow other things, things I love, and my whole mindset isn’t going to be engulfed in a team, although I put a lot of time in,” he says. “Maybe a year or two down the road I’ll want my own team and I’ll want to head on to a head coach role, but like I said right now it’s nothing I think about. I’m just enjoying my role in Pittsburgh.” Within that list of passions remains his son. Mark thinks a lot about what it takes to produce a player like the one Christian is fast becoming. Some of that was planted during the family’s stint in England. It’s well documented how this wove into a seven-year-old Christian a deep sense of the game as a way of life. The immersive soccer culture also impacted Mark. He spent time on a coaching license course at England’s vaunted Lilleshall. He also trawled stadiums and training pitches, particularly around London, absorbing a place where a football could be a ubiquitous accoutrement for British kids. Mark took his experiences with him to the youth coaching role he inhabited at the academy in Pennsylvania where Christian developed prior to signing with Dortmund. His ideas were reinforced in Germany where he coached in Dortmund’s academy system. He sees the deficits at home, but, back in the pro game, there is another picture. “US soccer right now is in a lot of trouble,” Mark says. “MLS is difficult to break into. I don’t want to fight those battles I don’t feel I can win.” Still, after Lilley left his head coach role in Rochester and took the reins in Pittsburgh, he wasn’t certain his preferred number two would be beside him on the touchline come the beginning of the season. “I just feel fortunate to have him,” Lilley says. “Even this year, I was waiting a long time because he wanted to explore other opportunities first before he made a final decision.” The pair put together a Rochester team that made a play-off run last year. It’s very early days this year, but so far they’ve improved the lot of a previously struggling Pittsburgh. Lilley describes Mark’s role as key, someone who helps him avoid tunnel vision and who pushes back hard. “I’ve played for a lot of head coaches who are commanders, and assistant trainers can tend to get lost in that mix,” says Graf of life under the duo last year. “And they turn into yes men. You know, right when that happens, that that assistant doesn’t get the respect from the players. Mark’s not that guy. He’s not afraid to tell Bob or anybody else what he thinks or feels – and that’s important.” There was an absence of pretense, recalls a mirthful Graf: except, perhaps, his new Nike numbers to replace the set of Puma shoes worn out pounding the training pitches in Dortmund. The abiding image of a no-nonsense, lighthearted meritocrat emerges. He wanted his son to earn his reputation based on what he put ins, what he shows. “And that’s what I want for myself,” Mark says. “I’m not going to use anything other than what I’m comfortable using and what my strengths are.

I ended up going to a technical college, just to keep my mum and dad happy. Then the college asked me to leave. A child psychologist diagnosed me with Asperger’s, I must have been about 14. I don’t remember much about it, I just found it quite annoying. My mum seemed to take it badly, as if it was a slight on her. Neither of us really understood. I was an aeroplane pilot, but everyone I knew got killed. I’ve had four aeroplanes, and bought one for my brother too. I sold my last one when I moved to America. I ducked out of it when my children arrived. Eye contact is something I find incredibly difficult. I count all the time when I’m talking to someone to make sure I do it right. Anything less than two seconds is considered rude, more than five seconds is too intense, so I have to look away. I worked that out myself. I find conversations incredibly stressful. Being under house arrest in India on suspicion of smuggling and spying was unexpected. Another air-display pilot and I were flying around the world in a little aeroplane. We landed in a small village on the coast of India and got arrested on suspicion of smuggling and spying. It was madness. The policeman asked if we were taking photographs of the Russian submarine base. I said I wasn’t, but asked where it was. He told me it was 20 miles south! I voted for Thatcher. It was the only time I voted. She won her election by a landslide, I wasn’t the only one that got sucked in. I’m not a socialist, but it’s absolutely all right, if you’re doing well, to give some of that back. What you don’t want to be doing is giving your money to lazy people who don’t do anything. There’s nothing good about getting old. Crossing 50 was where it all started. I got to the point where I couldn’t even look at older people in the street without crying. I would think to myself: “How can you live with death so close and walk around as if everything is fine?” Next thing you know I’d be on the floor. It got so bad that I went to the doctors. I was on antidepressants for too long, my wife said I turned into a Forrest Gump-like character. I lost all ambition, all my drive. I was just bumbling. She forced me to come out and face the world. I nearly stabbed someone once. I was in a bar in Mexico. He and someone sat in a booth next to us and tried to impress people by opening his jacket and showing me a snake. I had a penknife. It wouldn’t have killed him, but all I remember is I jumped on the table and yelled: “Come near me and I’ll kill you.” My mum died over a year ago. She’d had cancer for a long time, about 25 years. Mum never let any of us know how bad it was, but we knew. She made us think she was invincible, and she was stronger than I’ll ever be. If I get a cold, I want the whole world to know about it. Being a good parent is the thing that makes me most nervous. I look at what I do and I’m haunted by every mistake I make. If effort counts for anything, then I’m a good dad, because I really try. I have a series of weird tapping systems. There’s one where I tap every finger 12 times – three lots of five. One other lot of five, then a middle finger, then a three, twice. Then five, 10, 11, 12, then five, six, seven. Like that. Gary Numan’s album ‘Savage’ is out now.

After spending most of the 00s riding high on the success and profits of its DS and Wii consoles, the current decade has seen the Japanese company struggle to adapt to the changes that its rivals and smartphones have wrought upon the video game world. The death of company president Satoru Iwata in 2015, who presided over a creatively and financially brilliant period in Nintendo’s history, left many wondering how the company would find its way again. In March 2017, Nintendo’s fortunes turned around again with the launch of the Switch, a smart portable games console that can also be docked next to a TV and played at home. It has proven extremely popular, and its flagship games Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2 and Zelda: Breath of the Wild hoovered up awards last year, including three Baftas at this month’s ceremony. One of the minds behind this joyful little machine is Shinya Takahashi, Nintendo’s GM of development, who started at the company as an artist in 1989 and is now in charge of Switch. He has been called Nintendo’s conductor. “People always ask us whether we take risks on purpose. But to us, we don’t really take risks – we just keep trying new things,” said Takahashi last week. Although he has enormous responsibility at Nintendo, he is not a stereotypically stern Japanese executive. His face is warm and affable, his hair slightly scruffy; he is quick to chuckle over both our questions and his own answers. “The thinking that guides us is: what can we do to pleasantly surprise players? It’s not that we’re consciously trying to innovate; we’re trying to find ways to make people happy. The result is that we come up with things other people have not done.” Takahashi paints innovation as a side-product of Nintendo’s working culture – something about which the company has always been notoriously secretive. In the last few years it has started to open up just a little; its regular Nintendo Direct broadcasts show the faces behind games such as Mario, Zelda, Animal Crossing and Splatoon. In the company’s creative process, explains Takahashi, the ideas come first. “In many cases, we begin by assigning a small group to a project; not necessarily senior staff, but developers, to try and come up with ideas. Those lead to the end product. Super Mario Odyssey is a good example to explain this: we actually had several small groups and as a result we had many different ideas, which we then put together to make a single product. Naturally during the course of early development, we find the right mission for each project. I believe every game has a different mission. With [Nintendo Switch launch game] 1-2 Switch, for example, the mission was to make a party game where players would not have to look at the screen – where people would face each other.” A constant flow of new talent is extremely important to this approach. For a long time, the creative face of Nintendo was Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Mario – but now there is a newer generation of game creators in the limelight, including Splatoon’s director Tsubasa Sakaguchi, who joined the company in 2004. Nintendo does not prioritise experience in its hiring, says Takahashi – instead it looks for focus. “The Japanese hiring system is different from western companies. Typically in Japan, we hire people straight out of college,” Takahashi explains. “We have many candidates applying to Nintendo, and in many cases, the ones we hire are the ones who really understand what they have accomplished through their college years. If we see an artist who was very focused and determined about creating a single large-scale project, and they accomplished this over many years, or if we see a person who worked on a single movie from the beginning to the end of their course – that type of person needs a lot of determination and knowledge to accomplish such a thing. That’s what we’re looking for. “The bottom line is, the quality of the end product that those students created doesn’t really matter to me. How they kept their focus, what they thought throughout those years … that’s what important to me. We like our staff members to be as creative as possible – and creative people should not just listen to their bosses saying ‘Yes sir’, or ‘Yes ma’am’. I want them to always ask themselves, ‘Is this direction correct?’” The history of Nintendo is one of eccentric ideas. It has pioneered touchscreens, virtual reality, analogue control sticks, motion control, portable games consoles, second screens and wireless controllers – sometimes successfully, sometimes not. Unusual features of Nintendo’s consoles are often what inspire and enable unusual innovations in its games. Often, technology feels strangely distant from the creative things that it enables; the language of technology, of CPUs, GPUs and 4K resolution, is nothing like the language of imagination. At Nintendo, console and game design are intertwined. “We have the software team and the hardware team working very closely together,” elaborates Takahashi. “From the hardware perspective, they will sometimes come to the software group and say, ‘We have this particular chipset that we’re thinking about using in our next system, can you take advantage of this?’ But sometimes, the software team goes to hardware team and says, ‘We’re working with this theme, can you look into the technical possibilities, and see if you can come up with hardware features to accommodate it?’ “This is the advantage we have at Nintendo as a software/hardware integrated organisation – when we do research for our new hardware systems, our software developers, our artists, our programmers and our hardware engineers all get together and decide what we should aim for. We’ve been doing that for many years.” Nintendo Labo – the company’s most recent big idea, which uses the Switch console to turn cardboard models into interactive toys - is emblematic of Nintendo’s preference for finding new ways to use old or cheap technology, rather than rushing to keep up with cutting edge. (This idiosyncracy has hindered Nintendo as well as helped it; being underpowered compared to its rivals didn’t knock the Wii, but it did harm its successor the Wii U, which could not compete against the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.) Instead of spending millions researching new graphics technology, Nintendo’s R&amp;D department has spent two years figuring out how to make working toys out of cardboard. “We want to make new and surprising things, so we always keep an eye on new technology,” claims Takahashi. “That said, in order for us to create surprising things, we also look at older technologies to see if we can leverage them in new ways. New technologies tend to be a bit too advanced – we try to find ways to make technology more approachable.” The remark recalls a philosophy ascribed to legendary Nintendo engineer Gunpei Yokoi who referred to his great achievements – the Game &amp; Watch and Game Boy – as “lateral thinking with withered technology”. Takahashi’s adherence to this approach shows us that although there will always be changes at Nintendo, and there always will be missteps and departures, its philosophy is consistent. This is a company where surprising players is never considered a risky approach; it is the only approach. • This article was amended on 22 January 2019.

Judah Adunbi, a former member of an independent advisory group to Avon and Somerset police, was allegedly shot by an officer with a stun gun in Bristol last year. A video of the incident was widely shared on social media and made headlines around the world. PC Claire Boddie, of Avon and Somerset police, has denied common assault and her trial is due to be heard by the deputy senior district judge Tan Ikram next month in either Salisbury, which is 60 miles from Bristol, or Chippenham, 30 miles away. A case management hearing is to be held in London, 120 miles away. Supporters of Adunbi say confidence in the legal system would be undermined if the case is not heard in Bristol. Cleo Lake, a Green party councillor, said: “We’re getting the run around. It’s confusing, it’s not transparent, it’s bewildering really. It doesn’t give us any confidence as a community.” On Monday about 30 supporters packed into a magistrates courtroom in Bristol for what was due to be a case management hearing. Richard Shepherd, for the defence, initially asked to make an application in private. Ikram, who was presiding via video link from Westminster, agreed to have the court cleared, despite members of the media raising concerns. When the press and pubic were allowed back in, Ikram said no application had been made. The judge said he did not know where the trial would be held. “I go where I’m told,” he said. The case has so far been listed in courtrooms including Taunton, Somerset, and Southampton, Hampshire. Desmond Brown, a spokesperson for the Justice 4 Judah campaign, said he was horrified by how the case was being handled. He said: “Moving the case to Westminster makes it hard for us to be there but we will go. This needs to be done in public. It doesn’t make any sense.” Another supporter, Bianca Durrant, who won a racial discrimination case against Avon and Somerset police after being left to urinate on a cell floor in front of male officers, said: “How can we have faith in our system in Bristol if things aren’t done out front so we can all see what is going on? This is what causes people to lose faith in the whole system.” In a further twist, Adunbi, 64, also known as Ras, has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence after an alleged incident at a betting shop in Bristol on 29 March. He is due to appear before Bristol magistrates next month. His solicitor, Tony Murphy, of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, said he would be challenging the charge. “Ras Judah has a long history of challenging racism in all its forms and he shall be resisting this prosecution,” Murphy said. Adunbi sat on Bristol’s independent advisory group, which forges links between the police and the community, and has worked with the Crown Prosecution Service’s local community involvement panel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/retention-support-and-student-outcomes-award-winner-and-runners-up","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T20:30:29Z","webTitle":"Retention, support and student outcomes: award winner and runners up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/retention-support-and-student-outcomes-award-winner-and-runners-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/apr/24/retention-support-and-student-outcomes-award-winner-and-runners-up","fields":{"headline":"Retention, support and student outcomes: award winner and runners up","bodyText":"Category supported by Studiosity Winner: University of Strathclyde Project: Strathclyde cares Only a tiny proportion - 3% - of looked-after young people in Scotland go to university after finishing school. This contrasts with 37% of all school leavers. The Strathclyde cares project was set up to reduce this gap. It is one of the first programmes in the UK to help students who have experience of the care system throughout their higher education career, and supports students from the pre-application stage through to graduation and beyond. Strathclyde conducts a range of outreach activities to reach potential students who have experience of the care system. This includes providing care leaver information in marketing materials that are distributed in school and colleges and recruiting care-leavers to work as student ambassadors. A care adviser is also allocated to every care experienced applicant who has applied to the university, offering one-to-one support. Pre-entry access courses for mature students are also open to all applicants who have experience of the care system. While studying, students have access to mentoring services, scholarship awards, and a specially designed internship programme. Between 2011 and 2017, there has been a 168% increase in applicants to Strathclyde declaring a care background and a 305% increase in the number of offers to those declaring care experience. In 2016, Strathclyde became the first educational institution to become an official friend of the charity Who Cares? Scotland, which advocates for people with experience of the care system. The university has also signed the Scottish care leavers covenant, a cross-sector initiative that aims to improve the support and opportunities for young people who have experience of the care system. Runner up: York St John University Project: Using data to support students and improve outcomes York St John University’s employability mapping project was set up to help ensure all students, regardless of background, succeed in finding work after graduation. Students were given the chance to take part in an employability programme facilitated by Gradcore, a four-month scheme that provided support with job searching, applications, interviews and assessment centres. A suite of graduate internships was also offered, as well as 2-week Grad2Director programme supporting graduates to develop a start-up. This included individual coaching sessions and support with registering as a business. The initiatives were open to all, but specifically targeted at groups of students that traditionally find it harder to pursue their chosen career. To identify which students would benefit most from the targeted support, the university analysed students’ socio-economic background, Ucas entry point and disability status. It then contacted 500 graduates by phone to discuss the support available. Participation in the initiative has had a big impact on graduates’ employability: official data shows that the number of target students who found employment was 115% higher for those who took part in the scheme. Of those employed, 66% were in professional or managerial roles. Runner up: Solent University Project name: Retain and achieve Solent University established a student achievement team to reduce the number of students dropping out, and ensure all undergraduates reach their potential. The team uses data to identify students at risk of underachieving, and developed targeted support programmes to help them to succeed at university. Programmes are tailored to student need: for example, students repeating a year, receive phone calls during the summer, an induction seminar, one-to-one meetings, and sessions with both the course leader and an achievement officer. The university also promotes success through initiatives such as achievement scholarships, offered to students who perform exceptionally well. The work is underpinned by a suite of live reports showing three-year trends in retention and achievement. This allows the identification of the profile of students most at risk to withdraw, when and why. Each school has a retention and achievement action plan that is monitored and supported by a university-wide retention working group. Impact is measured against baseline data, by percentage improvement in retention, progression and/or achievement depending on the targeted group. Student and staff evaluation surveys are also completed for each initiative and outcomes inform plans for the next academic year. During the year 2016-17, the university saw a 9% improvement in the achievement of students who returned having suspended their studies and saw a 14% drop in the number of withdrawals from students who had repeated a year of their students. There was also an overall increase in the number of students graduating with a first-class degree.

I don’t mean that there are any arch, meta-textual tricks, more that the comedy inherent in the play is amplified, the “woe-is-me” mopery is kept to a minimum, and the woodland grounds and its samovar-laden patios are gorgeous. While this is not director Michael Mayer’s first film, he is far better known for his work on Broadway and in the West End (he won a Tony award in 2007 for Spring Awakening). Despite his background and The Seagull’s old war horse status on the boards, Mayer takes pains to ensure everything is as cinematic as possible. At first one might fear he has overcorrected, but after a prologue (the beginning of Act IV appears first before we flip back to page one) the rhythm settles in. The editing is brisk, the camera placement is creative (especially during a conversation on a rowboat) and each actor gets their closeup. Luckily, every performer is either good or great. It will surprise few that Annette Bening is outstanding as Irina, the vain actor fussing about as the centre of attention. Is Irina really devoid of self-awareness, or is she putting on an act even for herself? It’s hard to tell. What is clear is her cruelty to her sensitive son Konstantin (Billy Howle), who yearns to be a bold new artist but lacks the spark. Howle has the tough task of being a likable wuss, and gets the job done. The romantic entanglements in The Seagull are less a love triangle than a many-sided polygon, but what matters is that everyone is varying degrees of miserable. Brian Dennehy’s Sorin (Irina’s brother) could, under other circumstances, be an unattached bon vivant, but with his failing health and his feeding on everyone else’s malaise, he’s got the blues, too. Corey Stoll is lively as Boris, the successful writer on Irina’s arm whose attentions turn to Nina (Saoirse Ronan), a country girl thinking of becoming an actor who is, at the start of the film, dating Konstantin. The outdoor light loves her hair and blue eyes, and every smile she gives is luminous. Masha (Moss) stomps into each scene like an ur-Russian goth chick, and is absolutely hilarious, except for the few moments she’s breaking your heart. She is the daughter of the caretakers and desperately in love with Konstantin, who barely even knows she exists. “Go away!” he barks from behind a door when she musters the courage to speak to him. In turn, she hurls “Go away!” at Mikhail the schoolteacher, who is in love with her. Michael Zegen, Glenn Fleshler and Mare Winningham round out the cast, and everyone is terrific. There’s also a nice cameo from the proverbial Chekhovian gun. In truth, some audience members may want to blow their brains out after 30 minutes of all this sniping and scurrying about. However, Mayer’s energetic shooting style and the sharp performances provide enough kick to keep this out of the period-picture doldrums. There is no agreed-upon great cinematic adaptation of a Chekhov play. Louis Malle’s Vanya on 42nd Street might come closest, but it’s essentially a staged reading. Woody Allen has cribbed concepts many times, but always reinterpreted. Mayer’s The Seagull is not a masterpiece, but it is impressive, and for those who agree that it is important to check back in with the classics, the whole company deserves its huzzahs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/live/2018/apr/24/experience-fathers-and-sons","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T08:14:36Z","webTitle":"Experience: fathers and sons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/live/2018/apr/24/experience-fathers-and-sons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/live/2018/apr/24/experience-fathers-and-sons","fields":{"headline":"Experience: fathers and sons","bodyText":"I donated half my liver to my father When one adult donates to another, they have to give a larger portion of their liver than if donating to a child, so the risks are greater.

When the second series of Dennis Kelly’s dark comedy – about a group of unlikely characters who stumbled upon the key to an international conspiracy – debuted for a second season, it sent the Daily Mail into meltdown. In a searing no-star review, which mostly took issue with the fact one of Kelly’s storylines suggested that Margaret Thatcher’s government was backed by “deranged MI5 agents with swastikas carved into their stomachs,” it declared the show “beneath contempt.” But many loved it, including the Emmys voters who gave it an international award for best drama in 2014. Via Cristobal Tapia de Veer’s soundtrack and the bravura cinematography of Ole Bratt Birkeland and Lol Crawley to its artistic (or sadistic) use of violence, it won an army of loyal, often young fans. But it wasn’t to last. “Utopia is truly channel-defining: strikingly original, powered by Dennis Kelly’s extraordinary voice,” read the Channel 4 statement explaining why they were dropping Kelly’s drama in 2014. It did beg the question: if it’s so brilliant and ground-breaking then why was it being cancelled? Neil Maskell, who played laconic Frankenstein-like hitman Arby in the series put it down to two factors: low-viewing figures (it slumped to 650,000 per episode) and the show being too London-centric. “People didn’t watch it and past two series you can’t keep asking for the money,” Maskell told the Radio Times. “I think maybe it was London-centric or something. It’s like that series Nathan Barley by Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris; someone said to me no one watched that because it was so ‘in’.” In or not, popular or not, Nathan Barley or not, arguably, Channel 4 haven’t managed to match the uniqueness of Utopia’s pitch-black comedy and intrigue since. Immediately after its cancellation there was a reprieve of sorts for fans, as David Fincher announced he would be in charge of a remake for HBO. The cast was rumoured to include Rooney Mara as Jessica Hyde, Colm Feore, Eric McCormack, Jason Ritter and Agyness Deyn. It would be a big, meaty Americanised version of Channel 4’s surprise package. The problem was that HBO and Fincher fell out over the budget. It looked doomed to – like Freaks and Geeks, Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace and Deadwood – become a show you’d learn to hate just because of the amount of times TV bores would bang on about how tragic its cancelation was. Now Amazon have stepped in – as they often do – to breathe new life into it, with a nine episode remake. Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, who worked with Fincher on the Gone Girl film adaptation, will be executive producer and showrunner. There’s always some trepidation when it comes to US remakes of British TV. Often with very good reason. Some are non-starters (Only Fools and Horses, Luther), while others swim around in development hell (The IT Crowd, Bad Education), but the rare few not only succeed but improve on the original. The Office is the obvious example, where Ricky Gervais’s original tight two series effort was understood, unpacked and translated into a comedy that transcended the scope of its source material. Fans of Utopia can hang on to this. If the show does move beyond its first nine episodes, which will presumably see Flynn either bring the story up to the end of seasons one or two (the UK original was six episodes per series), there is more story to go at. Kelly hinted that he has enough material for four seasons of the show before it was cancelled. Richard Vine, who recapped the series for The Guardian, said the larger scope of the second series, which time hopped to the 70s, kept him “wondering what else Rose Leslie’s version of Milner had got up to – what did she look like in the 80s? What was she doing in the 90s?”. Flynn could answer some of those questions and take the show in a new decade-spanning direction. At the time of its cancellation Alistair Petrie (who plays Dugdale’s ruthless boss Geoff) said on Twitter that the cancellation is a “huge shame but it will have a legacy in how bold drama can be”. That proved to be prophetic. The show’s legacy can be seen all over our screens. The acrid and saturated colour palate and mega violence used in Preacher; the paranoia and self doubt that runs through Mr Rabbit, I mean, Mr Robot; while Kelly’s unflinching use of coarse language and matter-of-fact delivery lives on in Black Mirror, The City and the City and even Agatha Christie adaptations. You could even argue that Stranger Things’ Eleven storyline bears a striking resemblance to that of Jessica Hyde, with the holy trinity of terrible parenting, shadowy experimentation and powerful unintended consequences all on display. In a way Utopia never really left, but now it will be back where it belongs: on our screens, making people squirm all over again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/27/rohingya-refugees-cyclone-monsoon-season-bangladesh-myanmar","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T04:00:36Z","webTitle":"'Lives will be lost': 700,000 Rohingya face cyclone season under tarpaulin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/rohingya-refugees-cyclone-monsoon-season-bangladesh-myanmar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/27/rohingya-refugees-cyclone-monsoon-season-bangladesh-myanmar","fields":{"headline":"'Lives will be lost': 700,000 Rohingya face cyclone season under tarpaulin","bodyText":"For 14 terrifying days, Nabil Alam, his wife and nine children trudged through the jungles of northern Myanmar to reach the border with Bangladesh. The entire way, Alam looked over his shoulder for soldiers or local militia groups armed with clubs and knives. That was eight months ago. Now, in the refugee camps of south-east Bangladesh, he is anxiously watching the sky, awaiting the dark clouds that will soon drench the area in months of monsoon rain. Cox’s Bazar is one of the most frequently flooded regions of one of the most flood-prone countries on Earth. Bangladesh’s southern tip is fewer than three metres above sea level, with a triangular coast that funnels the ocean together. It makes high tides higher, and puts even major cities such as Chittagong within the water’s grasp. As well as heightening the risk of floods, Bangladesh’s geography also makes for extraordinarily deadly storms. A cyclone in 1970 killed 300,000 people. Another in the same area in 1991 left an estimated 10 million people homeless. Cyclone Sidr, a decade ago, killed as many as 10,000 people. Should cyclones bear down on the region again, as they have in the past two years, they could collide with nearly 700,000 new residents sleeping in tents of bamboo and tarpaulin. Aid agencies fear a second catastrophe is about to strike the Rohingya. “Lives will be lost,” says Daphnée Cook, Save the Children’s communications manager. “It’s just a question of how many.” As many as 200,000 refugees are estimated to be at direct risk from landslides or floods and require urgent evacuation, separate assessments by the Bangladesh government and aid groups have concluded. Most have nowhere to go. ‘I lost everything I had’ The first intense bursts of rainfall were recorded last week. As a test run for the monsoon, it has left aid agencies worried. Makeshift drains in parts of the vast camp quickly became blocked. Stretches of new dirt roads that serve as arteries for food and fuel turned to mud. The home of Sohina Khatum, 70, is already gone. “It was raining in our area and my house was destroyed,” she says, waiting at a station where aid agencies are distributing bamboo stalks, tools and extra sheets of tarpaulin. “I lost everything I had. Even today I could not have any breakfast. I came straight here.” Alam, 46, says his house has already flooded, spoiling the fortnightly supply of rice he receives as rations. “I had to take a loan from my neighbours to buy more,” he says. Monsoons have battered Khatun’s village, Rasidong, in northern Myanmar, his entire life. When he was 18, he helped his father erect the family home on stilts but water would still get in. When he crossed the Naf river in September, contending with the rainy season had been the furthest thing from his mind. “I didn’t even dare hope that we would cross the river, or find food and shelter,” he says. “It’s by the blessing of Allah that we even have a place to sleep and three meals.” The sudden influx of so many new arrivals on the shores of Cox’s Bazar has fundamentally altered its geography. Rohingya settlements have so far chewed through 1,900 hectares of undeveloped forest given up by the Bangladesh government. Root systems that once held the clay soil together, reducing landslides, have vanished. Major waterways are being dredged. Heavy machinery deployed by the government is levelling whole hillsides, heap by heap. ‘Only so much you can do with tarpaulin’ Bitter experience has taught Bangladesh how to manage cyclones and floods. The government has detailed procedures for warning the public and reducing the loss of life. But two responses are key: moving to higher ground and hunkering down in sturdy shelters. Neither are available to the Rohingya. Cox’s Bazar is a safe haven from Burmese government persecution, but it is also an enormous detention centre. At least 27 military checkpoints around the camps restrict the refugees from leaving. Humanitarian agencies have moved at least 15,000 families living in the path of floods or landslides so far, but concede that there is not enough suitable land to relocate all those at risk. Assisting the Rohingya to build strong homes is also out of the question. Bangladeshi public sentiment is starting to tire of the burden of more than a million displaced people, and it is an election year. Bricks roads and cement drains have been allowed, but not concrete homes. Like the presence of schools, they might suggest the refugees are in Cox’s Bazar to stay. Instead, the Rohingya fortify their tents in any way they can, with sandbags, stronger rope and plastic bottles filled with dirt and hurled on the roofs of shelters. “The devastation we were anticipating is likely to happen,” says Cook. “There’s only so much you can do with tarpaulin and bamboo. And only so much earth you can move to stop natural rivers from forming.” Sitting on a mat inside his two-room shelter, Ramsol Hossain points out the corrugated iron roof he recently bought as fortification. “I used to prepare for the monsoon ever year, but this is totally different,” he says. “There aren’t enough materials. We’re trying to manage with what we have.” As his children play outside, he mulls his dilemma. “If it floods, we would move to another part of the camp,” he says. “But we can’t do that without government permission.” Once the rain arrives, some among a community that has been persecuted in Burma for generations could face a familiar choice. Stay and risk death, or run."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/23/pbs-the-great-american-read-favourite-us-novel-documentaries","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T18:05:02Z","webTitle":"EL James v Margaret Atwood?

The search for America's best-loved novel is on","bodyText":"EL James and Dan Brown have been pitted against some of the greatest names in literature, including Joseph Conrad and Fyodor Dostoevsky, in a search to find America’s most loved novel. The two are among those vying for attention on a list arrived at after a public vote by US public service broadcaster PBS. Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell’s vision of totalitarianism, is pitched alongside Brown’s less taxing conspiracy bestseller The Da Vinci Code, in a list of 100 novels to feature in The Great American Read, an eight-part TV series that will conclude in the autumn with a second poll to find the nation’s favourite book. Celebrities, authors and notable Americans will champion their favourite books on the list in a series of two-hour documentaries exploring concepts common to some of the titles. Whether this will mean Big Brother’s penchant for torture in Orwell’s masterpiece shares an episode with EL James’s bondage bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey, rather than Margaret Atwood’s attack on institutionalised misogyny The Handmaid’s Tale, remains to be seen. British authors make a strong showing on the list, which features children’s books as well as adult classics and contemporary bestsellers. Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels and Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations are all included. Among the more contemporary authors are Douglas Adams with The Hitch-Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Zadie Smith with White Teeth and Ken Follett with The Pillars of the Earth. How many of the books were chosen for their film adaptations rather than the original novel is a moot point, judging by the number attached to blockbuster film franchises. Into this category fit Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight Saga, JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series, JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings and The Godfather by Mario Puzo. America’s fundamentalists will be less pleased to see books they campaign to have banned from schools in the top 100. JD Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye, Toni Morrison’s Beloved and Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird are all regulars on annual lists of banned books. The Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis should act as a sop to their sensibilities. The guru of free market economics Ayn Rand has been voted for inclusion in the list, with Atlas Shrugged. Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist will please those of a more spiritual bent, though how the likes of James Baldwin (Another Country) and John Irving (A Prayer for Owen Meany) would feel about being judged alongside an author described as “a purveyor of ‘inspirational’ schlock” is an amusing thought. The series has been positioned as a nationwide summer reading initiative. The producers of the series, which airs from 22 May, claim it will be “the most expansive national celebration of books and reading aimed at engaging multi-generational readers across platforms ever created”. Announcing the top 100 PBS’ president and CEO Paula Kerger said: “With The Great American Read, we will leverage our combined broadcast and digital presence, along with the strong local connections of PBS member stations, to inspire a national conversation about beloved books and the power of reading.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/30/looking-back-ufos","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-30T11:01:10Z","webTitle":"Looking back: UFOs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/30/looking-back-ufos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/30/looking-back-ufos","fields":{"headline":"Looking back: UFOs","bodyText":"9 July 1947 The Guardian reports on probably the most famous UFO incident of all time: Roswell in New Mexico. 14 November 1979 UFOs force Spanish pilot to land. “The objects followed me down, 12,000ft in 30 seconds.

The idea is to draw on a rarely used route first established in the cold war to transfer responsibility for aspects of the crisis to the 193-member general assembly. Russia has used its security council veto powers 11 times to block action targeting its ally Syria. A UN mechanism to attribute responsibility for chemical weapons use came to an end in November after Russia vetoed a resolution to extend its mandate, complaining that the mechanism was prejudiced against the Syrian government. Ian Martin, a former UN official and Amnesty International chief, said: “The Russian veto need not be the end of efforts for collective action by the UN. The responsibility of asserting accountability for the use of chemical weapons, and for bringing an end to the horrors of the Syrian conflict, rests with the world community as a whole.” The proposal is known to have support among western officials. The impasse was raised at an annual weekend closed-door retreat attended by security council ambassadors in Sweden, and is now likely to be discussed further at a series of meetings this week. Western powers fear the absence of an attribution mechanism not only gives Syria free range to continue to use chemical weapons, but also to deliver a severe blow to the international world order. The US, France and the UK launched a missile attack on Syria’s alleged chemical weapons sites 10 days ago in response to allegations that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack on the town of Douma on 7 April. Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are in Douma. But regardless of what they find, the OPCW does not have powers to attribute responsibility. Since that strike there have been renewed diplomatic efforts, largely brokered by Sweden, to agree a UN resolution on a new investigatory mechanism, but so far they have been fruitless. Western governments, worried that the impasse is weakening the wider authority of the security council, want to pick up a rarely used route, first set up in the 1950 Korean crisis. Called “uniting for peace”, it would enable nine members of the 15-strong security council to bypass a Russian veto and refer the matter to a full vote at the general assembly. It would then require a two-thirds majority by the general assembly for an attribution mechanism to be agreed. The 1950 “uniting for peace” route was explicitly designed to be used when the security council could not meet its responsibilities over maintenance of peace. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said at the weekend that the world had entered a new cold war era where the threat of instability was greater than the previous cold war. In objecting to an attribution mechanism, Russia has opposed the mix of nationalities on the OPCW and the absence of routine on-site inspections. It also insists that final decisions on attribution must be made by the security council, where it can wield its veto. The western powers have made concessions to secure a compromise UN resolution on attribution, but will not concede the principle that Russian could veto the inspection team findings. A separate proposal for Guterres to set up special panel on Syria, as has happened in the past over Sri Lanka, has been greeted with scepticism because it would be easy for Russia to dismiss such an ad hoc body set up on the sole authority of the secretary general. The western missile strikes appears to have had little impact on either side, making concessions in the Syrian peace talks. A meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Canada agreed that Russia needed to do more to contribute to a political settlement in Syria, but the UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, met Russian officials over the weekend in Moscow, and little evidence emerged that Russia was willing to force the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to negotiate with opposition groups on a future constitution. An EU humanitarian conference in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday is likely to focus on how to prepare for an expected Syrian regime attack on Idlib, in north-west Syria, one of the last remaining rebel held areas in the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/23/salah-de-bruyne-pfa-award-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T13:08:29Z","webTitle":"Deciding if Salah deserved PFA award ahead of De Bruyne is nigh impossible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/23/salah-de-bruyne-pfa-award-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/23/salah-de-bruyne-pfa-award-champions-league","fields":{"headline":"Deciding if Salah deserved PFA award ahead of De Bruyne is nigh impossible","bodyText":"When it came to choosing between Mohamed Salah and Kevin De Bruyne, perhaps it was the element of surprise that convinced the Egyptian’s fellow professionals to vote for him. Even though his potential shone brightly during his early years with Basel, particularly when he ripped Chelsea and Tottenham to shreds in Europe, few people could have anticipated Salah hitting these extraordinary heights when he joined Liverpool last summer. For all his speed and skill, the former Roma winger had a reputation for being a little rash and selfish in the final third when he arrived in England. He had struggled during his brief spell with Chelsea – not that he was given much of a chance to impress by José Mourinho – and in the era of mega fees at the highest level, it was a reflection of Salah’s rough edges that Liverpool got him for £36.9m. Alexandre Lacazette, for instance, joined Arsenal for £52.7m. Neymar went to Paris Saint-Germain for €222m, Ousmane Dembélé to Barcelona for £97m, Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United for £75m and Álvaro Morata to Chelsea for £60m. Salah cost less than Gylfi Sigurdsson, a £45m signing for Everton from Swansea. True, some of those figures sum up how the transfer market has spiralled out of control. Yet Salah’s fee also hinted at the slight air of uncertainty that hung over him when he returned to England. He had not won anything since helping Basel to secure the Swiss title in 2013 and there were some who feared that he would blow hot and cold for Liverpool, for whom the past 20 years is littered with expensive signings who did not possess the elite talent to bring the glory days back to Anfield. In that context Salah probably would have been seen as a hit if he had enjoyed a promising debut season, scoring 15 goals, say, or simply helping Liverpool challenge for the top four. Instead, he has surpassed even the most optimistic predictions. He has been the talismanic figure in Jürgen Klopp’s freewheeling side, earning comparisons to Lionel Messi because of the way he cuts in from the right flank to use his left foot to devastating effect and ensuring that Liverpool have not suffered because of Philippe Coutinho’s move to Barcelona in January. Salah has 31 goals in the Premier League – equalling the record set by Cristiano Ronaldo, Alan Shearer and Luis Suárez – and 41 overall. His finishing has been imaginative, ruthless and varied, he has scored home and away against Liverpool’s rivals and he produced when Klopp needed him most in the Champions League quarter-final victory against City. He is a deserving recipient of the Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year award. But as is the way with these individual prizes, not everyone is in agreement. For while giving the gong to Salah is not quite as controversial as the time Tottenham’s David Ginola picked up more votes than any of Manchester United’s treble winners in 1999, there are many who believe that De Bruyne has been unfairly overlooked. The Belgian, after all, has been the finest player in the league’s best team. Would City have won the title without De Bruyne? Probably. But would they have won it by such a huge margin and with such an attractive style of football? Would the new champions be on course to break the points record set by Chelsea in 2005? Probably not. Nobody has been as beautiful to watch as De Bruyne, who looked like he had a point to prove during City’s 5-0 win against Swansea on Sunday, and it is worth remembering that the 26-year-old has regularly stepped up in the big matches, scoring the winner at Stamford Bridge, playing a key role in the 5-0 victory against Liverpool in September, dominating at Old Trafford in December and starring in the League Cup final. He has produced an array of sublime assists, none better than the eerily good no-look pass in the 7-2 win against Stoke, and his ability to run games from central midfield has drawn comparisons to Andrés Iniesta and Paul Scholes. He would have been the choice for the purists and there is also an argument that the award should always go to a league champion. Yet that has happened only 13 times in the Premier League era and it is De Bruyne’s misfortune that midfield excellence tends to get left in the shade by staggering goal hauls, which probably says more about us than him. Ultimately, however, trying to choose between these two extraordinary players is a thankless task. Salah’s achievement has been unique and as someone with a weakness for jinking left-footed wingers, I am biased towards him. But De Bruyne’s masterclass against Swansea was accompanied by a realisation that I will remain on the fence unless Salah scores the winner in the Champions League final. In a world of tribalism and furious debate, it isn’t a bad place to be. Let’s put the rivalry to one side and enjoy what both have to offer. And chuckle at the thought of Mourinho letting them leave Chelsea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/25/passages-from-the-bible-discovered-behind-quran-manuscript-christies","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T09:30:44Z","webTitle":"Passages from the Bible discovered behind Qur'an manuscript","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/25/passages-from-the-bible-discovered-behind-quran-manuscript-christies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/25/passages-from-the-bible-discovered-behind-quran-manuscript-christies","fields":{"headline":"Passages from the Bible discovered behind Qur'an manuscript","bodyText":"An “extraordinary” discovery by an eagle-eyed scholar has identified the shadowy outlines of passages from the Bible behind an eighth-century manuscript of the Qur’an – the only recorded palimpsest in which a Christian text has been effaced to make way for the Islamic holy text. French scholar Dr Eléonore Cellard was looking for images of a palimpsest page sold a decade earlier by Christie’s when she came across the auction house’s latest catalogue, which included fragments from a manuscript of the Qur’an which Christie’s had dated to the eighth century AD, or the second century of Islam. Scrutinising the image, she noticed that, appearing faintly behind the Arabic script, were Coptic letters. She contacted Christie’s, and they managed to identify the Coptic text as coming from the Old Testament’s Book of Deuteronomy – part of the Torah and the Christian Old Testament. “This is a very important discovery for the history of the Qur’an and early Islam. We have here a witness of cultural interactions between different religious communities,” said Cellard, who is attached to the College de France. “It’s quite extraordinary,” said Christie’s specialist Romain Pingannaud. “Once you know it’s there, you can only see it, it becomes so obvious. We missed it at the beginning. It’s fascinating, particularly because it’s the only example where you have an Arabic text on top of a non-Arabic text. And what’s even more fascinating is it is on top of passages from the Old Testament … It shows the contact between communities in the first centuries of Islam; it’s very relevant.” Christie’s, which is offering the fragments for auction with a guide price of £80,000-£120,000 on Thursday, believes that the manuscript is likely to have been produced in Egypt, which was home to the Coptic community, at the time of the Arab conquest. It said that the fragments “resonate with the historical reality of religious communities in the Near East and as such are an invaluable survival from the earliest centuries of Islam”. While the writing style of the Qur’an scribe dates it to around the eighth century or early ninth century, it is not possible to identify how much older the ghostly Coptic writing is, although the formation of the letters means it is unlikely to have been written earlier than the seventh century, according to Pingannaud. “Carbon 14 testing would date only the material, not the writing, but it’s quite destructive and these folios are too thin,” he said. Qur’anic palimpsests are “extremely rare”, according to Christie’s, with only a handful having been previously recorded, none of which were copied above a Christian text. Other examples of Qur’anic palimpsests include two leaves from a seventh-century Hijazi Qur’an, which is copied above an earlier version of the Qur’an. “We think this is because the Qur’an is such an important text and although vellum was very expensive, the Qur’an was always written on new material. It’s highly revered and so they would use brand new material,” said Pingannaud. It was, however, “quite common in the Byzantine and Greek worlds to have palimpsests”, he added. “Parchment is very strong, it doesn’t suffer too much – it’s sensitive to humidity but very solid,” he said. “At the time it was erased the parchment was probably like new and it’s only with centuries passing that the ink which sank into the parchment provides this ghost image we see.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/24/mental-health-labels-diagnosis-study-psychiatrists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T10:00:16Z","webTitle":"Mental health labels can help save people's  lives.

But they can also destroy them","bodyText":"An important Lancet Psychiatry paper has just come out. It is the largest review looking at service user, carer and clinician experiences of mental health diagnosis. For some people, psychiatric diagnosis was helpful, and the problem was that it was not given early enough. For others, a diagnosis was deeply oppressive. The tensions between these camps frequently threaten to ignite social media. This dynamic, which causes significant distress, is only likely to increase as social media gives a platform to those who have negative experiences of diagnosis at the same time as more and more people identify as having a mental illness as a consequence of changing public ideas around mental health. To drain something of the charge in these inflaming dynamics, it is important to confute the idea that psychiatric diagnosis is a single thing. Some diagnoses are more useful than others. Diagnoses such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, for example, are more likely to be experienced positively, validating suffering and giving people a platform from which to speak about distress and access help. Yes, there is stigma, but not the rampant sticky, staining discrimination one gets with diagnoses associated with serious mental illness. With the latter, diagnosis can produce what the philosopher Miranda Fricker has called “testimonial injustice” – an inbuilt prejudice that gives less credibility to the diagnosis. The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, for example, is experienced commonly as a character slur, a “dustbin” diagnosis that makes many clinicians turn away from people in pain and take communications such as that someone wants to kill themselves less seriously, to often deadly cost. The diagnosis of schizophrenia can confer with it a clinical gaze that situates those with the disorder as lacking insight and being delusional. This set of ascriptions has meant psychiatry is only now beginning to hear the devastating experiences of trauma so often core to experiences such as voice-hearing and dissociation. It is difficult to say anything pro or against psychiatric diagnosis per se when different diagnoses have such wildly different effects on one’s capacity to be taken seriously as a speaker. Second, even within diagnostic categories, some people find diagnosis more useful than others. As the Lancet paper makes clear, the context in which a diagnosis is given is crucial. If a diagnosis is offered carefully, with time for discussion, clear information and hope, it is more likely to be experienced positively. How a psychiatric diagnosis is experienced is also mediated by an individual’s life experience and their cultural identities. For example, someone who identifies as LGBTQ might have good cause for suspicion of diagnosis, given that homosexuality was diagnosed as a mental disorder until the 1970s. Diagnosis is also taken up and put down as an idea depending on the goals of conversations we are in. For example, in family therapy, patients who generally reject their diagnosis often take up this idea as a discursive move if relatives start to attribute cause to their poor parenting skills. Third, it is difficult to make definitive statements about the scientific worth of diagnostic categories. Classifications often bleed into one another and lack the laboratory-type objective tests one generally finds in other branches of medicine. However, with some diagnoses, there is more evidence that pathological processes are at play than with others. For example, there is good evidence for neurobiological underpinnings to bipolar conditions. Elsewhere, the difficulties lie with the point at which we start to view experiences that lie on a spectrum as problematic. Here, it is important to critique the pernicious, shaping influence of psychiatric expansionism and big pharma on how we view our inner worlds. Given diagnosis can be both a structural violence and a life-saving explanatory tool, what to do? A frequent response is that patients should be free to choose. However, it is questionable whether one can make an informed choice about having, say, one’s entire personality invalidated. Or if it is possible to choose freely when diagnosis can be like an overbearing partner, taking up all the discursive space, limiting the possibility of thinking differently, and gaslighting understandable reactions to painful events in a life. Instead, we need to create space for new ways of speaking about distress that foreground the effects of trauma and the socio-political context on the psyche and body, and that recognises that difference becomes disability at the point that society tries to squeeze people into one-size-fits-all boxes. We must place the power to dictate the thrust of speech firmly with the person of most importance – the person in need. This can only occur if we hold a more tentative relationship to the diagnostic system, binning ways of diagnosing that slur the speaking credibility of certain patient populations, and ensuring access to resources such as benefits are dependent on severity of illness rather than acceptance of diagnosis. In an era where speech is more and more polarised and combative, with devastating effects on our mental health, open dialogue is key. Far from being an “everybody has won and all must have prizes” response to the diagnosis wars that have plagued psychiatry since its inception, such an approach demands a radical rethink of power relations in psychiatry to place patients’ voices where they belong – centre stage.

The changes due to be brought in by the data protection bill will deprive applicants of a reliable means of obtaining files about themselves from the department through what are known as subject access requests. Challenging the Home Office’s notoriously poor decision-making in immigration cases will become far more difficult and result in miscarriages of justice, civil rights groups, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), lawyers and political opponents allege. The legislation will also lower data protection standards for the Home Office, according to campaigners, so it no longer needs to handle data ‘lawfully, fairly and in a transaparent way”. It would not prevent the destruction of vital records such as Windrush-generation landing cards, for example. Data will be able to be shared secretly between public services, such as the NHS, and the Home Office, more easily under the bill, it has been claimed. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: “[The] latest data protection bill shows that the Windrush scandal is not a mistake. The bill exempts immigration matters from data protection. This can be for anyone who is a migrant, or suspected of being one, as in the Windrush cases. “They should amend this bill. It is unacceptable that the government should be pressing ahead with legislation that allows agencies to breach data protection rights for anyone who is suspected of being a migrant. Otherwise they will show they have learned nothing, and are determined to maintain the hostile environment at whatever human cost.” The Labour MP David Lammy added: “The heart-breaking stories of people unjustly and unlawfully stripped of their right and held prisoner in their own country show that granting the Home Office these powers would be a significant mistake.” Gracie Bradley, the advocacy officer for the human rights organisation Liberty, said:“If the data protection bill’s ‘immigration exemption’ becomes law, it will be near-impossible to challenge poor decision-making in immigration cases, or prevent the Home Office destroying evidence that could help people prove their right to be here. “And immigration enforcement teams will find it even easier to secretly access confidential information collected by trusted public services like schools and hospitals.” Both main legal professional bodies, the Law Society, which represents solicitors across England and Wales, as well as the Bar Council, which represents barristers, have backed the warnings. Joe Egan, the president of the Law Society, said: “Recent events have shown how important it is to be able to scrutinise Home Office decision-making. “The [EU’s General Data Protection Regulation] GDPR and data protection bill are based on accountability and transparency and the proposed [Home Office] exemption completely flies in the face of these principles. “Anyone seeking their own personal data from the Home Office could be denied access without justification and with no avenue to appeal. “With serious flaws in the immigration system being exposed on a daily basis, there is deep concern about the potential for miscarriages of justice if the proposed exemptions were to be included in the final bill.” Andrew Walker QC, the chair of the Bar Council, said: “It seems that the government is determined to press ahead with changes in the law that could make it even more difficult for people, including those of the Windrush generation, to demonstrate that they have the right to live in the UK. “If the new law is brought into force in the form the government wants, then those Commonwealth citizens – and many others – who are lawfully living and working in the UK will be denied the right to know what information the Home Office holds about them, which could make the difference between success and failure in a legal challenge to their wrongful detention or removal. “The Home Office has a notoriously bad track record for unlawful decision-making, which can have catastrophic consequences for people who are detained indefinitely in removal centres or wrongfully deported.” The Law Society and Bar Council are calling for the Home Office’s proposed exemptions to be removed. The JCWI has highlighted the case of Michael Braithwaite, a special needs teaching assistant who lost his job after being wrongly classified as an illegal immigrant. The only way his lawyer was able to prove his status was to ask for his case file to be handed over by the Home Office through a subject access request – a common practice in challenging immigration decisions. The3million group, which campaigns for EU citizens rights post Brexit, and the Open Rights Group have already threatened legal action, through the law firm Leigh Day, if the Home Office exemptions become law. If the department make a mistake in an application for settled status, the organisations say, individuals will be unable to obtain the data to see how the rejection decision was arrived at, leaving them unable to fight to have their legitimate right to be in the country reinstated. The Home Office has established a team to help obtain documentation for Windrush generation applicants seeking to prove their legal status. A Home Office spokesperson said: “It is wrong to say that the proposed narrow exemption in the Data Protection bill is an attempt to deny people access to their data. People will still be able to request data as they can now and will be met in all cases except where we to do so could undermine our immigration control. “They will have the right to complain to the information commissioner if they disagree with any use of the immigration exemption and we would always want to assist those whose claims are in question.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/23/want-to-know-how-far-you-have-run-you-might-need-to-ditch-your-fitness-tracker","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T15:24:00Z","webTitle":"Are fitness trackers ever an accurate measure of running distance?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/23/want-to-know-how-far-you-have-run-you-might-need-to-ditch-your-fitness-tracker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/23/want-to-know-how-far-you-have-run-you-might-need-to-ditch-your-fitness-tracker","fields":{"headline":"Want to know how far you have run?

So how can you measure how far you have really run? Don’t extrapolate The Which? team used data from a short treadmill run (and some daily chores such as washing up), then extrapolated from this to 26.2 miles. This really isn’t a particularly helpful test – GPS doesn’t work indoors on a treadmill and most people don’t stop running a marathon to wash the dishes. Besides, there’s a really good way to know exactly where you are on the London marathon course: the giant signs and banners that mark every mile. These have been measured using the most accurate method, a special counter on a bike along the shortest possible route. Of course, runners rarely take this “racing line” – they weave through other runners and water stations, adding distance – and that’s before factoring in any app inaccuracies. Why are they so inaccurate? Trackers that are based solely on your step-count are, at best, a rough guide. Wrist-based ones extrapolate from your arm movements, which can also be inaccurate. As a rough rule of thumb to encourage daily activity, such metrics are fine, but as an accurate distance measure they can be pretty useless. In fairness, though, given how novel wearable tech is, they’ve come a long way in a short time in terms of accuracy. Watches v apps GPS watches are usually more accurate than apps, and don’t kill your phone’s battery. GPS – global positioning satellites – work by trilateration: your receiver picks up signals from a number of satellites to work out your exact position. However, they too are fallible, and can be foxed by atmospheric conditions or tall buildings and tunnels. One study found the error was about 6% – fine for a rough guide but not enough to distinguish between a nine- and a 10-minute mile. When running a race, people should always treat their phone or watch as a simple stopwatch, and trust the distance markers for accuracy. Of course, human error can creep in, but this is still more likely to produce an accurate distance than your phone app."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/23/sometimes-its-hard-to-be-a-woman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T17:00:35Z","webTitle":"Sometimes it’s hard to be a woman… | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/23/sometimes-its-hard-to-be-a-woman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/23/sometimes-its-hard-to-be-a-woman","fields":{"headline":"Sometimes it’s hard to be a woman…","bodyText":"Re “like” (Letters, 23 April), when and why did women almost universally become “ladies”?

The Ramadan economy in the UK is worth at least £200m, with supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons increasingly gearing products, displays and special offers on popular food items to Ramadan in areas with significant Muslim populations. This year, for example, Morrisons is selling a Ramadan countdown calendar, similar to an Advent calendar, aimed at children. The month-long Muslim religious observance starts in mid-May and its ending is marked with the Eid al-Fitr holiday. MAC cosmetics, the Body Shop and Godiva chocolates are some of the brands specifically packaging goods as Eid gifts. Despite the trend, more than three-quarters of British Muslims want retailers to pay even more attention to Ramadan, according to the Great British Ramadan, a study by an Islamic marketing consultancy Ogilvy Noor. “Muslims feel that Ramadan and Eid are ignored, the report says. “They see the nation proudly gravitate towards cultural and religious holidays such as Chinese New Year and Diwali. They are saying it’s also time to embrace Ramadan and Eid.” In an indication of growing awareness of the lucrative opportunities of the Muslim market, Westfield London, Europe’s largest shopping centre, is hosting its first Eid festival in June. It will include live catwalk shows, pop-up food stalls, special offers and performances. “The Muslim pound is seen as a valuable and largely untapped opportunity in the UK economy,” says festival promotional material. The global Islamic economy is forecast to be worth more than £3 trillion by 2021, according to the State of the Global Islamic Economy report, and is growing at nearly double the rate of the general worldwide economy. The sector includes halal food, Islamic finance, halal travel, modest fashion, halal media and recreation, and halal pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Shelina Janmohamed, vice-president of Ogilvy Noor and author of a 2016 book, Generation M: Young Muslims Changing the World, says: “The Ramadan season is one of complete life transformation, which brings with it an economic surge. “We conservatively estimate this to be upwards of £200m each year, covering everything from financial planning to food, eating out, clothes, toys and gifting. Following only Christmas and Easter in scale and size, this is surely Britain’s biggest untapped business opportunity.” Many of the UK’s four million Muslims begin to prepare for Ramadan two weeks before its start date, which is determined by the lunar calendar. The month is characterised by sunrise-to-sunset fasting. Although in some countries the working day is adjusted to accommodate the season, for many British Muslims the fasting requirement is complicated by the need to continue working or studying. For the second year running, Ramadan falls within the six-week summer exam season, which means hundreds of thousands of school and university students have to take exams when their concentration may be impaired by lack of sleep, food and water. The absence of official recognition in the UK of the three-day Eid holiday immediately following the end of Ramadan means traditional visits to family and friends end up being spread over two weekends. “In the UK, you don’t have three days of shutdown over Eid like you do in the Middle East,” says Janmohamed. “Only about half of people take time off work, so Eid visits and celebrations are spread out.” She said brands and retailers should wake up to the opportunities of the Ramadan season. “If brands can play a useful role in Muslims’ experience of Ramadan, if they can help with planning or freeing up time for spiritual or social activities, that is very welcome.” Almost two-thirds of Muslims plan financially for Ramadan and Eid, the study found. More than half are concerned about their concentration during the month-long daylight fast and two-thirds worry about dehydration. Young men in particular are concerned about maintaining fitness and some gyms in areas with big Muslim populations adjust opening times to allow exercise between iftar, the sunset meal that breaks the fast, and suhoor, the pre-dawn meal. The majority of British Muslims eat a range of food over the two meals, with chicken and chips a favourite for 18-to-24-year-olds. Despite the long hours of fasting, four in 10 married women say putting on weight during Ramadan is a worry. Gift-giving, buying new clothes, eating out and family gatherings are key features of the Eid holiday. Charitable donations also increase markedly during Ramadan, particularly among 25-to-34-year-olds. Donations to Muslim charities through the JustGiving website increased by almost 500% over Ramadan last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/27/roy-bentley-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T16:19:46Z","webTitle":"Roy Bentley obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/27/roy-bentley-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/27/roy-bentley-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Roy Bentley obituary","bodyText":"Roy Bentley, who has died aged 93, became the first deep-lying centre-forward in English football, in the style of the Hungarian Nándor Hidegkuti. His inspired wanderings – now dropping back, now moving to the wings – combined with sharp opportunism with head and foot, were a crucial factor in Chelsea’s first league championship win in 1954-55, when he was captain. He scored 21 goals in 41 games that season and altogether amassed 150 goals from 367 appearances for Chelsea, the joint-fifth highest total in the club’s history. Bentley spent eight years at Stamford Bridge after signing in 1948, finishing top scorer in seven consecutive seasons, and was appointed captain in 1951. His exploits for Chelsea earned him a dozen appearances for England between 1949 and 1955, including two matches in the 1950 World Cup finals in Brazil. Born in Bristol, into a family with eight children, Bentley played initially as a young amateur for Bristol Rovers before, in 1941, joining Bristol City as a professional, initially as an inside-forward. But he spent much of the second world war in the Royal Navy on board destroyers that escorted Atlantic convoys. In 1946 he was transferred to Newcastle United, then bent on getting out of the Second Division, for an £8,000 fee. Although in his first season at St James’ Park he scored 18 times in 36 matches – including in the 13-0 demolition of Newport County, the biggest ever win in the football league – his 18 months at the club were ill-starred, as he was afflicted by a mysterious illness that caused him to lose 13kg (two stone) in weight. He made only a dozen appearances for Newcastle in his second season there, scoring just three goals, so when Chelsea brought him to London in 1948 there were fears that they might have made a mistake. Chelsea, however, got abundant value for their £12,500 transfer fee. Moving to centre-forward, fast in both thought and movement, Bentley proved an inspiration. As his health improved so did his form, and in his first six months at Chelsea he regained 7kg. His first cap for England came in 1949 against Sweden in Stockholm. England lost that match 3-1, but Bentley consolidated his role at centre-forward the following season, scoring the only goal of the game against Scotland at Hampden Park in April 1950. That goal meant England won the British International Championship, which doubled as a qualifying group for the 1950 World Cup finals in Brazil. In Brazil, Bentley played for England against Chile in Rio de Janeiro, then in the horrifying 1-0 defeat by a scratch US team in Belo Horizonte, during which he hit the post three times. He lost his place after that World Cup, returning to the national side in 1952, against Wales, but was not chosen for the 1954 World Cup, although he had been in the provisional squad. Early in the following season, however, he was recalled to the colours at Wembley against the World Cup holders, West Germany, who were much diminished by illness. For once England picked a team full of gifted ball players, and they won in style, 3-1. Bentley won four caps that season, but they would be his last. In his 12 appearances for England he scored nine goals. At Chelsea, under the management of Ted Drake, Bentley as captain had helped to foster camaraderie and discipline among the players as they were eighth in the 1953-54 season, and in 1954-55 they finished four points ahead of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Portsmouth and Sunderland to win their first championship title – also their first major honour. However, the effort of getting there had taken its toll, and before the 1956-57 season Chelsea had a clear out of the championship winning side, selling Bentley to their neighbours, Fulham, where he found a new lease of life. Moving back successfully to right-half in 1957-58, he then went to centre-half the following season, where his technical aplomb marked him out as that rarity then: a footballing centre-back. He stayed at Craven Cottage until 1962, when Fulham gave him a free transfer to Queens Park Rangers. After severe problems with his stomach muscles, he defied the advice of four doctors who had told him he should no longer play, and successfully captained Rangers’ Third Division side. Football down at that level, he opined, was if anything harder, since you could never be sure what an opponent was going to do. Later, at QPR, Bentley became involved in coaching and administration. Early in 1963 the club reluctantly let him go to become manager of Reading, where he stayed for six years. But like so many managers before him, he failed to get the club out of the Third Division. When he was eventually sacked, he admitted to being “shocked and saddened” but conceded: “I have had a free hand, the board never interfered, and therefore I am not going to make excuses.” In 1969, at the age of 45, he was given the managerial job at Swansea, then in the Fourth Division. There he encouraged local schoolboys to join in the training and one of them, a grateful Robbie James, then 12 years old, would later play for Wales. Bentley won Swansea promotion to the Third Division, but his time at the club came to an end in 1972. Unable to find another managerial post, he turned his back on the game, subsequently taking up journalism. For a while he also had some success playing semi-professional poker in conjunction with his wife, Violet (nee Upton), whom he had married in 1946 and with whom he had two daughters. However, he returned to Reading in 1977 as club secretary and stayed there until 1984, when he took up a similar post with Aldershot. In retirement in Berkshire he remained a regular and popular visitor to Chelsea home games. When Chelsea won the league championship for a second time in 2005 he received a huge ovation as he carried the trophy on to the Stamford Bridge pitch before it was handed to over to the then captain, John Terry. • Thomas Frank Roy Bentley, footballer, born 17 May 1924; died 20 April 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/28/labour-antisemitism-talks-six-key-sticking-points","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Labour antisemitism talks: six key sticking points","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/28/labour-antisemitism-talks-six-key-sticking-points","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/28/labour-antisemitism-talks-six-key-sticking-points","fields":{"headline":"Labour antisemitism talks: six key sticking points","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn met senior figures from the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council this week to try to address concerns over antisemitism in the Labour party. Jewish leaders have said they want to see improvements in six key areas. Leadership The Jewish leaders at the meeting said they wanted to see Corbyn take a proactive approach in the fight against antisemitism, calling out supporters who used his name to defend their anti-Jewish remarks. Corbyn countered that he had already done so, pointing to op-eds in which he had acknowledged the scale of the problem. The Jewish leaders said they hoped now to see Corbyn fight antisemitism with the same passion as other issues. Disciplinary cases Labour said it expected to resolve two key outstanding cases of alleged antisemitism – involving Ken Livingstone, the former London mayor, and Jackie Walker, former vice-chair of Momentum – by July. A key sticking point is the Jewish groups’ call for an “independent, mutually agreed ombudsman” to oversee performance in tackling antisemitism. They argued such a move would not be unusual, pointing to examples such as the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Labour has said it cannot agree to appointing a figure who is responsible to an outside body, but sources said it accepted the principle that additional expertise and independent opinion were needed and the party intended to hire an in-house general counsel. Relations with suspended members The JLC and BoD said no MPs or party member should share platforms with people who have been suspended or expelled for antisemitism. Labour is understood to be uncomfortable with no-platforming members suspended pending an investigation, when the cases have not yet been proved. Corbyn is said to have argued he cannot dictate who his MPs deal with, but community leaders believe he has sufficient influence to do so. The definition of antisemitism Jewish leaders argued Labour should adopt the full definition of antisemitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) – the working definition had already been agreed by Labour’s national executive committee. But sticking point at the meeting was a example given in the IHRA definition referring to “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour”. Concerns were raised that this example could preclude criticism of Israel’s creation or discussing whether ethnic cleansing had occurred. It was counter-argued that the example is meant to highlight that the concept of a Jewish homeland is not in itself racist. The definition also specifically says comments must be put in context and says the “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic”. Corbyn’s team said the they would consider that point but also argued a report for the party by Shami Chakrabarti went further than the IHRA definition by banning the use of “Zio” as a term of abuse. Engagement The BoD and JLC wanted Corbyn to confirm he would seek dialogue with the Jewish community through its “main representative groups and not through fringe organisations who wish to obstruct the party’s efforts to tackle antisemitism”. Implicit in that demand is that Corbyn should not interact with Jewish Voice for Labour, a pro-Corbyn and anti-Israel group.

But new research suggests that the way people think, in apparently unemotional ways, is also a reliable predictor of political attitudes, and in particular, of nationalism and enthusiasm for Brexit. Leor Zmigrod, a Cambridge University psychologist, set out to investigate whether a preference for clear categories in thought mapped on to a preference for clear national boundaries and precise, exclusionary definitions of citizenship. Instead of relying on self-reported habits of thought, as previous surveys have done, she had participants (who were not students) take part in some standard psychological tests. One of them tested how easy it is for participants to adapt to changes in the rules of the game they are playing; the other is a test of the ability to associate words and ideas across different contexts, so that it works as a measurement of cognitive flexibility, or woolly-mindedness, as the more rigid would no doubt say. Even with a reasonably small sample of about 330, the differences that appeared were large and startling. In particular, her team found that less cognitive flexibility correlated strongly with “positive feelings toward Brexit and negative feelings toward immigration, the European Union, and free movement of labour”. This not to say that there is anything abnormal about people on either side of the question. There is a lot of normal variation in temperament and imagination among perfectly healthy and sane people, even those who disagree with us. But it is still extraordinary to think that some political differences can quite reliably be traced to cognitive ones which seem to have no connection with politics at all. One of the strongest links was between cognitive flexibility, as measured by these two tests, and disagreement with Theresa May’s statement that “a citizen of the world is a citizen of nowhere”. These cognitive styles do not work directly on attitudes to Brexit, says Zmigrod. They predispose people to wider ideological attitudes, and those in turn determine the attitudes people took to the referendum. And the test results she found work differently to each other: in particular, nationalism and authoritarianism were very strongly predicted by a preference for fixed rules and categories, whereas political conservatism (as self-reported) was influenced by an inability to take words out of familiar contexts and make fresh connections between them (which the second test measures). Nonetheless, the correlation between the style in which people think and the way that they voted was very much stronger than any of the other factors in the sample: controlling for class, age and sex only changed the results by 4%, although there was a strong, and possibly related, correlation with the length of time in education. “The way the brain constructs internal boundaries between conceptual representations and adapts to changes in environmental contingencies has been shown here to be linked to individuals’ desire for external boundaries to be imposed on national entities and for greater homogeneity in their cultural environment. Information-processing styles in relation to perceptual and linguistic stimuli may also be drawn upon when dealing with political and ideological information,” she writes. What this suggests to me is that some kinds of political argument are going to be literally interminable. Obviously this isn’t true of any particular issue. Even the question of our relations with Europe will be settled some time before the heat death of the universe. But it may be replaced by something else which arouses the same passions and splits the population in the same way, because the cognitive traits she is analysing are all part of the normal variation of humanity. Despite what you learn on the internet, the people who disagree with you about Brexit do not all have something terrible wrong with their brains. Progress is not necessarily on our side. Nor is it even on the other side. One of the underlying tendencies of political argument at the moment is that both left and right expect the other side to be proved conclusively wrong by history – either to be swept away by progress or to be destroyed by the return of traditional reality. But if ideologies arise in part from differences in cognitive style which are evenly distributed through the population, the war between progress and reaction will continue for as long as humanity does. • Andrew Brown is a Guardian leader writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/29/housing-provocatuer-patrik-schumacher-ever-lived-in-a-studio","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Has housing provocateur Patrik Schumacher ever lived in a studio? | Rebecca Nicholson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/housing-provocatuer-patrik-schumacher-ever-lived-in-a-studio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/housing-provocatuer-patrik-schumacher-ever-lived-in-a-studio","fields":{"headline":"Has housing provocateur Patrik Schumacher ever lived in a studio?","bodyText":"‘Let’s discuss,” tweeted Patrik Schumacher, with a link to his new, exhaustive essay for the Adam Smith Institute called “Only Capitalism Can Solve the Housing Crisis”. Schumacher has form for controversial statements about housing. When he took over Zaha Hadid Architects in 2016, the architect gave a speech at the World Architecture festival in Berlin, in which he proposed privatising all public spaces and eliminating social housing, which turned him into a kind of bogeyman for activists who object to things like, say, multimillion-pound properties being bought by investors and remaining empty while the evidence of rising homelessness is plain for anyone walking the streets to see. It seems as if he’s now embracing the role of provocateur. In the piece, Schumacher pokes at a few easy targets and pre-empts the response. He suggests that for busy young professionals, a city centre studio space, its size unregulated, is all that’s needed and then imagines a linguistically loaded backlash of complaints that young people are being “forced” to live in “rabbit hutches”. I have written before about the frustrations of feeling trapped in a private rental market where property is capital and not a home. I have no idea if Schumacher has ever lived in a studio, but it strikes me that few people who do or have done would really consider a living room, for example, to be an unnecessary luxury. The novelty of being able to microwave your dinner without getting out of bed soon wears thin. But what strikes me as a point more worthy of discussion is the hellish vision of an economically thriving city centre full of young professionals emerging from their pods only to work all of the time. “For many young professionals who are out and about networking 24/7, a small, clean, private hotel-room-sized central patch serves their needs perfectly well,” he writes. Elsewhere: “In a free market, workers would compete for locations. More productive workers that contribute more to the total social product will be able to out-compete less productive workers.” Perhaps it’s my “outmoded educated elites’ left-liberal consensus” talking – Schumacher is not averse to emotive language himself – but I wonder which jobs would count as economically viable. I’m sure the city-centre-bots are too busy in the boardroom to have children, so in this near future we won’t need teachers or carers, but if we need a nurse to patch us up when we slip on a spilled coffee while networking 24/7, will this “productivity” count towards being worthy of a home in the area, too? • Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/may/06/martin-speake-intention-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-06T07:00:14Z","webTitle":"Martin Speake: Intention review – bracing and eloquent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/06/martin-speake-intention-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/06/martin-speake-intention-review","fields":{"headline":"Martin Speake: Intention review – bracing and eloquent","bodyText":"There was a time, not all that long ago, when the sound of Martin Speake’s alto saxophone – smooth, round and well modulated – tended to be judged insufficiently forceful or gritty.

This album’s 11 tracks cover a lot of ground, from almost free improvisation to Dancing in the Dark by way of Charlie Parker. It’s hard to imagine a more resourceful or eloquently played set. A fair share of the credit must go to pianist Ethan Iverson (late of the Bad Plus) for coming up with a stream of ideas, often counterintuitive, that help to keep the whole thing airborne. With bassist Fred Thomas and drummer James Maddren completing the quartet, it’s a superb example of team togetherness.

That is because we are facing a fundamental inequity of rights in this country. In Scotland, the franchise was extended for the independence referendum in 2014 and now applies for all elections locally and to the Scottish parliament. The results have been overwhelmingly positive, so much so that the Welsh parliament will introduce similar reforms as part of their electoral reform review. However, 16- and 17-year-olds in England and Northern Ireland are not afforded these same rights. Opponents of reform have argued that 16 is an arbitrary age. However, in many crucial areas, such as in taxation, we already treat our 16-year-olds as responsible contributors to society. We grant economic rights without the correlating political rights. This should concern any democrat. And this is just one example. The experience from Scotland is that 16- and 17-year-olds are both capable and responsible enough to meaningfully engage with, and improve the vitality of, our democracy.

Instead of adding tools for people creating media, as the previous two updates have, the latest version of Windows 10 is focused on time and task management. “We want to give you back some of your greatest currency, your time. Our hope is that you’ll have more time to do what matters most to you – create, play, work or simply do what you love,” said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group. Wasn’t it called Spring Creators update? That’s what was reported earlier in the year, but Microsoft has made the wise choice to simplify the name this time round. Instead of trying to work out which year the Fall or Spring might be in, now we’ve got month and year, which makes a lot more sense. April 2018 update – bit late isn’t it? It’s true. The update has only just squeaked in at the last minute to make it into April. It was scheduled to be released a couple of weeks ago, but a bug found at the last minute by testers had to be fixed before it was released beyond the early adopter “Windows Insider” community. Most people will probably get the update after April as it gradually rolls out. How do I get it? The easiest way is to wait for the notification from Windows Update, which lets the user know a feature update is ready to install, but you can also manually check for updates from the Settings app. Failing that you can manually download the latest version of Windows 10 direct from Microsoft and upgrade from that. Will it be forced on Windows 10 users? In a word, yes. While there are ways to stop Windows 10 from downloading it, Microsoft only supports older versions of Windows 10 for two years or less from release. That means that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which was released in August 2016 is no longer supported and will not receive further bug fixes and security updates. The Creators Update, released in April 2017 will no longer be supported from 9 October this year, so the only way to keep using a supported version of Windows 10 is to keep upgrading. Timeline The biggest and most obvious change is the addition of a timeline feature to the task view. Essentially a history of the apps and files you had open earlier that day or week, Timeline allows you to see what you were doing on the PC you’re currently using and other devices, and resume from where you left off. As Microsoft’s apps on other platforms gain Timeline support their activities will show up on your PC. One of the first is Microsoft Edge for Android and iOS. Focus Assist Focus Assist is a beefed-up version of Do Not Disturb. You can turn it on manually or set it up on a schedule, and it’ll block notifications and other distractions until you’re done. At the end it’ll provide a summary of what happened while you were doing whatever it was you were doing. Like a DND mode you can whitelist certain people so that their emails and messages get through, even when you’re trying to concentrate. Dictation Microsoft is pushing improved dictation as a feature of the April 2018 update. In any text box you can now hit the Windows Key + H and start talking. Cortana improvements Microsoft’s virtual assistant gets some new powers with the April 2018 update. It will now suggest tasks you might want to resume from previous devices, tapping into the Timeline feature. Support for some smart home appliances has also been rolled out, including Google’s Nest thermostat, and natural language voice control for third-party apps such as Spotify is also being added. Microsoft Edge Still seeking to convince people to use it over Chrome, Microsoft’s Edge browser gains the ability to strip out clutter when you print from a website, and the ability to mute audio from specific tabs. Some new Grammar Tools will also help break down complex words into syllables and highlight nouns, verbs and adjectives. That adds to several other ebook, design and gesture support improvements. Nearby sharing Microsoft has implemented its own version of Apple’s AirDrop, sending files over Bluetooth and wifi without having to mess about with cables. You can limit it to just your devices or any Windows 10 device. How useful the feature turns out to be depends on how many Windows 10 devices you have around you.

Woodpeckers peck wood, bee-eaters feed on bees, and whitethroats are indeed white around the neck. Other names seem almost wilfully obscure: what on Earth does the name puffin mean? Or hobby? Why are turtle doves named after reptiles? And don’t get me started on some of the more bizarre bird names found around the world – from oleaginous hemispingus to zitting cisticola, leaflove to hardhead, and bananaquit to bearded mountaineer. Yet, as I discovered when I was researching my new book on the origins of bird names, if you dig deep enough, you unearth all sorts of fascinating stories about what the names mean, where they came from and, especially, the men and women who created them. The origin of some names may, at first, seem obvious, yet are not quite as straightforward as they appear. Take the simplest of all English bird names: blackbird. It’s a bird, and it’s black. Isn’t that all we need to know? But what about the crow, rook, raven and jackdaw? All of these would have been very familiar to our ancestors, and all appear – at least from a distance – to be black in colour. So why was just one species singled out as the “blackbird”? The reason for this apparent anomaly is that, until the late medieval period, birds were not called “birds” at all, but fowls – as in Chaucer’s poem The Parliament of Fowls. The word bird (originally the Anglo-Saxon brid), referred only to young fowls, or chicks. Then, sometime around the time Chaucer was writing, this meaning began to shift. From then on, although “fowl” was still used for larger birds such as members of the crow family, “bird” became the norm for all smaller birds, including the blackbird. So, at the time it was named, this really was the only truly “black bird”. Many of our oldest bird names – including raven, rook and crow – are onomatopoeic: they imitate the sound made by the bird itself. Cuckoo, chiffchaff and kittiwake are other well-known examples. Far less obvious ones include nightjar (from the “churring” sound made by this nocturnal bird), bittern (from its deep, booming call), and the aforementioned turtle dove. “Turtle” is a corruption of the bird’s soft “tur-tur” call, so has nothing to do with the aquatic reptile. Other ancient bird names relate to a bird’s appearance: its size, colour, shape or distinctive markings. Again, some are obvious: such as great spotted woodpecker, blackcap, long-tailed tit and collared dove. But with others it takes some linguistic detective work to uncover their true meaning. Take three familiar birds: the yellowhammer, redstart and wheatear. All three names superficially make sense, yet as soon as you look more closely, they become problematic. After all, the yellowhammer doesn’t have an especially loud or percussive song, redstarts are not noticeably jumpy, and I’ve certainly never seen a wheatear in a field of wheat. The reason these names appear puzzling is down to one of the most important events in British history: the Norman Conquest. Perhaps the greatest change that resulted from this invasion was in our everyday language: within a century or so, Anglo-Saxon had merged with Norman French to create a new, hybrid tongue known as Middle English – the precursor to the way we speak today. But as the old language fell into disuse, some of its words no longer made any sense. So, by a process called false etymology, people made up new versions, which sounded plausible, even if their original meaning had been lost. One famous non-avian example, the name “dandelion”, is in fact a corruption of the French dent de lion (meaning lion’s tooth, referring to the shape of the plant’s leaves). The same happened with bird names. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon “yellow ammer” (from the German word for a bunting) became yellowhammer; “red steort” (meaning red tail) turned into redstart; and “wheteres” – literally white arse, changed into wheatear. Norman French also had a major influence on the names of ducks (mallard and wigeon), game birds (pheasant and partridge), and raptors (peregrine and hobby). What these all have in common is that they were important to the Norman nobility – either as food, or for hunting and sport – so their French names took precedence over the older, English ones. Hobby, for example, comes from the Old French verb hober – meaning to jump about – and refers to this falcon’s dashing, acrobatic flight. The name hobby also played a role in the naming of the table-top football game Subbuteo. The story goes that when the game’s inventor, Peter Adolph, tried to register his idea at the patent office, he wanted to call it Hobby. When a jobsworth official objected, he cleverly substituted the Latin name of his favourite bird, Falco subbuteo, instead. From the 18th century onwards, existing names were codified by professional ornithologists who also coined new ones, such as black-tailed godwit or white-fronted goose. A trend also arose for naming birds after people: sometimes those who had discovered the species, such as George Montagu (Montagu’s harrier). But birds were also named after polar explorers James Clark Ross and Sir John Franklin (Ross’s and Franklin’s gulls), the political radical Thomas Bewick (Bewick’s swan), and the vicar of Selborne, Gilbert White (White’s thrush). As is to be expected, given the patriarchal nature of society at the time, only a handful are named after women. One notable exception is the woman who gave her name to my book: Winifred Moreau, who during the 1930s studied the endemic birds of Tanzania’s Uluguru mountains, with her ornithologist husband, Reg, and after whom one of the world’s rarest birds – Mrs Moreau’s warbler – is named. The naming of birds is ultimately a purely human impulse: the birds themselves are, of course, completely unaware of what we choose to call them. Yet, without the wondrous variety of ornithological names, I believe that our world would be a far poorer place. Ultimately, the names we have bestowed on birds down the ages reflect key aspects of our own lives: our primitive superstitions, myths and legends, invasions and conquests, changes in language, rigorous scientific observation, our love of sound, colour and pattern, and a sense of place. Last, but certainly not least, some reflect the extraordinary achievements of the men and women after whom they were called – including, of course, Winifred Moreau.

The post by Alfie’s father, Thomas Evans, explained that his 13-month-old son had a degenerative neurological condition and that doctors wanted to switch off his life-support. The case of Alfie, who died on Saturday at Alder Hey children’s hopsital in Liverpool, five days after his life support was switched off, was little known outside Liverpool. That soon changed. Christine Broesamle, an American “pro-life” activist based in Italy, got in touch with Evans. Her friends were advising Charlie’s parents about flying him to Italy for treatment, she said, and the same could be done for Alfie. Unsurprisingly, Evans took up her offer of help. After a month of working on the case from Rome, Broesamle answered what she described as a call from God and moved to Liverpool. Since last September she has lived in Merseyside and played a key role behind the scenes, advising Alfie’s parents. This week in an interview with a Christian fundamentalist radio station in the US, she said there should be riots in Britain over Alfie’s treatment by doctors at Alder Hey hospital, whom she accused of being “hellbent” on killing him “to cover something up”. A source close to the case has told the Guardian that Broesamle arranged for doctors to fly in from overseas to pose as family friends and medically examine Alfie. A paediatric oncologist, Dr Katarzyna Jakowska, and a colleague allegedly assessed both Alfie Evans and Isaiah Haastrup, a one-year-old child at the centre of a similar life-support battle, on the same day at different hospitals under the guise of being family friends. Broesamle’s role, and that of a Russian law student, can be revealed after a fraught week of unsuccessful appeals to courts, protests by hundreds of supporters and “unprecedented” personal abuse of medical staff on social media. While the arguments raged, Alfie has defied the bleakest forecasts and lived without life support from Monday until 2.30am on Saturday. Evans and Kate James, Alfie’s mother, who spends hours cuddling her boy in his hospital bed, had wanted to take the terminally ill child home for the first time in 16 months. On Wednesday appeal court judges called for a wider investigation into concerns that the parents’ legal representation “may have been infiltrated or compromised”. The Guardian has learned that an international network of Catholic fundamentalists has played a growing role in advising Alfie’s parents, including organising Evans’ audience with the pope last week, arranging a string of medical experts to assess Alfie, and replacing the family’s Liverpool-based legal team with the anti-LGBT Christian Legal Centre this month. Broesamle, who was named in court this week after six months of keeping out of the spotlight in Britain, is connected to the Italian “pro-lifer” network Giuristi per la Vita (Lawyers for Life), whose president has spoken about “secretly” advising Charlie Gard’s parents before his death on 28 July last year. The group works closely with the Italian lawyer Bruno Quintavalle, who has acted for the families of both Alfie Evans and Isaiah Haastrup. Another source says Broesamle had access to a “seemingly endless pit of money and contacts”, and her network arranged for air ambulances to be ready at a moment’s notice to whisk Alfie from Alder Hey to the Vatican-approved Bambino Gesù hospital in Italy. Broesamle arranged for Alfie’s assessment by Dr Matthias Hübner, a medical director of the paediatric air ambulance in Munich, Germany, which the high court heard had taken place “in a clandestine manner, [Hübner] posing as a friend of the family”. Hübner was said by the judge to have fallen “so far below the standards expected of his profession”. Evans has credited Broesamle with organising the audience with the pope, but sources close to her say the meeting was arranged by two journalists from La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana, a Catholic newspaper whose coverage has been critical of the hospital and courts. When contacted by the Guardian, Broesamle declined to speak on the record about the case, saying “one wrong move and it goes nuts and the hospital really hates me because I’ve worked so hard for Alfie’s defence”. Those close to her have been angered by the UK media’s coverage of the case, and they directed the Guardian to the Catholic fundamentalist website Church Militant, which on Thursday published an article about the high court judge in Alfie’s case, Mr Justice Hayden, pointing out that he was “a pro-gay advocate and member of the Bar Lesbian and Gay Group (BLAGG), a network of gay lawyers in the United Kingdom”. In court, Pavel Stroilov, the Christian Legal Centre law student representing Alfie’s parents, came in for the most searing criticism this week. He was described by Hayden as a “fanatical and deluded young man” whose submissions to the court were “littered with vituperation and bile” that was “inconsistent with the real interests of the parents’ case”. A Russian exile who has worked as a researcher for the current Ukip leader, Gerard Batten, since 2011, Stroilov was behind the attempt by Alfie’s parents to pursue a private prosecution for murder against three Alder Hey doctors. It is understood that Alder Hey’s legal team is considering pursuing a contempt of court case against Stroilov unless he provides details of his legal qualifications. “There are grave concerns about the wholly misleading advice that was provided by Mr Stroilov,” said a source close to Alder Hey’s legal team. Stroilov did not respond to a request for comment. The Christian Legal Centre described the media and judicial criticism of its role in the case as “unfair and detrimental”. It said it rejected the “prejudicial and inflammatory” comments by Hayden and it did not support the criminal prosecution of doctors involved in Alfie’s care. On Thursday night, Evans struck a more conciliatory tone when he appeared outside Alder Hey and praised the “dignity and professionalism” of Alfie’s doctors, with whom he said he wanted to “build bridges” so his son could be brought home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/28/huddersfield-v-everton-southampton-v-bournemouth-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T16:23:43Z","webTitle":"Southampton 2-1 Bournemouth, Crystal Palace 5-0 Leicester and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/28/huddersfield-v-everton-southampton-v-bournemouth-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/28/huddersfield-v-everton-southampton-v-bournemouth-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Southampton 2-1 Bournemouth, Crystal Palace 5-0 Leicester and more – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all from me. It’s been a delight. Bye! This just in from Ben Fisher at St Mary’s: Burton’s 2-0 win over Bolton can’t go unnoticed. They are now a point ahead of Bolton, level on points with Barnsley (though their goal difference is the worst in the league) and two behind Reading and Birmingham. On the last day it’s Bolton v Nottingham Forest, Preston v Burton; Derby v Barnsley; Birmingham v Fulham and Cardiff v Reading. Of those opponents only Forest aren’t in the top seven. Happiness: Dominic Fifield enjoyed the Selhurst Park goal glut: Dusan Tadic has spoken of his match-winning turn for Southampton: I think this is one of the most important wins in history, because we are fighting for our lives. I think we showed great character and we showed we are able to win our matches when we play together like a team. I think we know we needed to win this game, doesn’t matter how, doesn’t matter how we play. We showed we are able to do that and I hope we will do that more often in these last three games. A report of Burnley v Brighton for your delectation: “The one glimmer of home for Northampton is that their last game is against Oldham, so all goals count double and they ‘only’ need to win by a clear 9 (and have Charlton beat Rochdale) to stay up,” notes Julian Borrill. So not totally impossible then, just very, very unlikely. Here’s a match report from Paul Doyle at Huddersfield: A big result from League Two: Barnet won 1-0 away at Morecambe, which means that they could still catch Morecambe and in so doing save themselves from relegation on the final day of the season. Barnet play Chesterfield – bottom of the table, and long since relegated – at home, while Morecambe head to sixth-placed Coventry. A draw would be enough to keep Morecambe safe, unless Barnet win by seven. Walsall’s winner – scored, incidentally, in the last minute of normal time – takes them to 18th, three points clear of Rochdale (though with worse goal difference), and they now seem likely to survive. In League One, MK Dons have lost and are down, and Northampton have lost 1-0 at Walsall which leaves them needing to win their final game, and for Oldham and Rochdale to lose their final game, and to overturn a goal differential of 17. So, in short, they are also going down, and it’s Oldham v Rochdale for the final spot. Accrington have beaten Lincoln 1-0, and have won the League Two title! Wycombe have beaten Chesterfield 2-1, and fans stream onto the pitch – they have been promoted to League One! Burnley and Brighton have drawn 0-0. With 37 points, Huddersfield are surely safe. Crystal Palace, on 38 points, are home and hosed. The final whistle goes at Southampton, who have beaten Bournemouth 2-1! There is a lot of hugging going on down there! Crystal Palace have beaten a hapless Leicester 5-0, and Huddersfield have lost 2-0 to Everton. McCarthy dives to his left to make a fingertip save and keep Southampton’s lead intact! Bournemouth have a corner, and the goalkeeper is coming up! West Brom have beaten Newcastle 1-0, with much of the post-match talk likely to revolve around an apparently fantastic save by Foster. Bournemouth have three forwards running into the area and only one defender is in their way. Cedic, though, takes one of them out and they end up with only a free kick, which leads to nothing. Southampton could have scored a few more, but find themselves clinging on to a 2-1 lead with two of five added minutes played. Christian Benteke slams the ball down the middle, Hamer dives obligingly out of the way, and it is five! Crystal Palace win a penalty, and have a chance to go five up! Lewis Grabban has scored for Aston Villa, who are now drawing with Derby – good news for the other play-off chasers. And Cardiff are now 2-0 up at Hull, and will go into the final day knowing a win would take them up. It’s a rout! Schlupp is played in this time, by Zaha, against his former club, and though his shot is saved the ball rebounds back to Van Aanholt on the edge of the area, and he curls it precisely inside the far post! It’s Sakho with a delicious through-ball, and Loftus-Cheek runs clean through on goal, jinks his way past the keeper and slides into the empty net! So Huddersfield are three points ahead of Southampton, with significantly worse goal difference, and must still play Manchester City (a), Chelsea (a) and Arsenal (h). Southampton meanwhile have Everton (a), Swansea (a) and Manchester City (h). One win from those three games could do it for them. Wycombe have taken the lead over Chesterfield, and as it stands will seal promotion today. The ball is crossed from the right wing and runs through to Baines, on the left-hand corner of the penalty area. He taps it inside to Gueye, who has nobody anywhere near him and sends his shot arrowing inside the far post! The players go to celebrate with Niasse, whose fine work on the right wing led to the goal. Here are the teams for the late kick-off in the Premier League: Swansea: Fabianski, Naughton, van der Hoorn, Roberts, Mawson, Olsson, Andre Ayew, King, Ki, Clucas, Jordan Ayew. Subs: Britton, Dyer, Nordfeldt, Carroll, Routledge, Rangel, Sanches. Chelsea: Courtois, Azpilicueta, Cahill, Rudiger, Moses, Fabregas, Kante, Emerson, Bakayoko, Hazard, Giroud. Subs: Caballero, Barkley, Morata, Pedro, Zappacosta, Willian, Christensen. Referee: Jonathan Moss. Southampton are passing up fabulous goalscoring opportunities ever 35 seconds. Lemina steals the ball on the edge of the Bournemouth area and pokes it to Long, who instead of shooting tries to pass back to Lemina. A first-time shot might have gone in, but Lemina took a touch and the chance was lost. “Absolute scenes at the bottom of the table clash at the Kassam Stadium, where relegation-threatened Rochdale took the lead in the 59th minute only for Oxford to equalise with a penalty a two minutes later,” writes Richard Adams. “Rochdale’s fate depends on the results for Walsall and Oldham.” It is horribly close at the bottom of League One, where as I type there are three teams tied on 49 points, one of them in the relegation zone. Southampton nearly score a third! Austin’s shot was on its way wide but it fell to a team-mate who turned it goalwards, but Begovic saves! Moments later Bertrand is played in, and his shot is saved too! The back-pass would probably have found its way back to Hamer, and I don’t think there was an awful lot of contact. But for a moment Albrighton definitely clutched at Zaha’s shirt, and Leicester can’t really quibble with the decision. Albrighton tries to turn an awkwardly bouncing ball back to his goalkeeper with Zaha on his shoulder. He mishits it, falls over and touches Zaha on his way, and the Palace forward tumbles! The referee doesn’t give anything, but his assistant does – and Albrighton is sent off! It’s a long clearance from the goalkeeper, which is chested down by a defender on the edge of the centre circle. But Tadic steals it off him and runs towards the box, with runners to his left and right. He ignores them both and pokes it into the far corner with his left foot from 18 yards! “Oh the joy of being a west ham fan this weekend,” writes Ian Sargeant. “Scores today going against us. A chilled out man city sticking six past us tomorrow. Back to Wigan next season.” It’s a pessimistic reading of the situation though the Hammers may need to get something from the visit to Leicester, who haven’t won at home for three months. Nope, wrong again. Leicester have brought on both Diabate and Silva, and taken off Gray and Choudhury. The games are all back under way. So far as I can see all top-flight sides are unchanged. Another oversight that needs to be righted. It is indeed his final game for the club, and his 320th appearance for them in the league. Norwich are drawing 1-1 with Leeds, and Hoolahan scored just before half-time. Sorry, it was a cheap shot and undeserved. He’s a fabulous player. I missed the goal when it happened and have only just seen it – smashing, in more ways than one. 3.48pm: the half-time whistles have now been blown in all the Premier League games. Now Bournemouth do score! It’s a corner on the right, which is sent into the area, nodded on to the back post and then turned in from three yards by the entirely unmarked King! Oooh! Bournemouth toss a free-kick into the area and then keep up the pressure as it’s headed half-clear. It’s eventually passed to Aké, who beats two defenders and then shoots from six yards straight into McCarthy’s foot – had it been even six inches off the ground, it was in! The one-sidiest game of the day is at Cheltenham, where Coventry are now 4-0 up. Marc McNulty has scored the latest. It seems nobody wants that final promotion spot from League Two – now Wycombe are also losing, Michael Harriman’s own-goal giving Chesterfield the lead. Sent scurrying by Theo Walcott’s through-ball, from the edge of the area, towards the right-hand corner, Tosun shoots low towards goal. It’s not tremendously powerful, but it is exceptionally accurate and Lössl can’t keep it out! And an assist now for Zaha, who collects the ball in the area, slides it to McArthur and he turns and shoots low, back across goal and in at the far post! Questions to ask of the defenders, there. Burton are now 2-0 up against Bolton, and look set to take their fight against relegation to the final day. There’s been another big goal in the Championship, where Cardiff are 1-0 up at Hull and, as things stand, one point ahead of Fulham in the race for the second promotion spot. Newcastle hit the post! It was Kenedy’s effort, who presented with a good chance after good work from Pérez curls it onto the outside of the woodwork. A long way to go yet, but with Grimsby 1-0 up at home to Notts County and Exeter 2-0 down at Stevenage, Wycombe would go up if those scores remain the same and they win at already-relegated Chester. That game is still goalless, though. Burton have scored to go 1-0 up at home to Bolton, in a massively important game at the bottom of the Championship. Crikey, that was easy. A long goal kick is headed down and from the centre circle one first-time pass over the Newcastle defence puts Phillips in, with the nearest defender facing the wrong direction and completely flat-footed. Phillips takes a touch, runs into the area and thrashes the ball in! There’s also been an almighty goalmouth scramble at Burnley, where Tarkowski’s backheel across goal caused panic but the ball somehow refused to cross the line. Bournemouth win a corner, from which Southampton break, Lemina and Tadic run into the Bournemouth half with only one defender back to deal with them, Lemina draws him and plays in his team-mate, who finishes with admirable calm! “Matthew Farrall, a Reading supporter, died suddenly last Friday 20th, at 49 years old,” writes John Howard. “He was a wonderful bloke who really cared about the club, town and community he was actively involved in. Friends and family have hopefully arranged a minutes applause at 49 minutes into the match at the Madejski today. We’d all be grateful if you could give Matt a mention please and for anyone out there with a glass in their hand to raise it for a truly lovely guy.” It would be my pleasure. You can read a bit more here. “As someone who has watched every West Brom game, judging by the volume of the booing Newcastle fans win the award for hating James McClean the most for not wearing a poppy during Remembrance Day Season,” writes JR. “Well done Newcastle fans! Congratulations!” I think there are a number of reasons for disliking James McClean, including – if you’re a Newcastle fan – the fact he previously played for Sunderland. Crystal Palace take the lead, as Wilfried Zaha reaches the edge of the penalty area without flinging himself to the ground and powers in a low shot! Another goalline clearance at Palace, where Ward has stopped Vardy from scoring. Southampton have got into Bournemouth’s penalty area in threatening style a couple of times. On the last occasion Redmond’s shot was well blocked by a desperately lunging defender. At Crawley the minimally-named Perry Ng, winner of April’s League Two goal of the month award, has put Crewe a goal up. He’s unlikely to get any prizes for this one, turning in a deflected shot from six yards. At Crystal Palace, Tomkins’ header has been cleared off the line by Iheanacho. I’ll be keeping a particularly close eye on the relegation-haunted teams. At Newcastle West Brom must win, but haven’t really shown any sign as yet of knowing how to achieve that; Southampton meanwhile host Bournemouth and with only Manchester City still to play at home – plus visits to Everton and Swansea – are also in quite desperate need of victory. Bournemouth however seem to have started a little brighter. 3pm: Kick-off! Here’s Paul Wilson’s report on today’s Anfield thriller: Wolves are playing their final home game of the season today. Looks like their players got quite the welcome: Dover have beaten Woking 2-1, and the Cards are down. Liverpool and Stoke have drawn 0-0. Logically Stoke must win both remaining games to give themselves a fighting chance of survival. Dover have scored in stoppage time and lead 2-1, which looks very much like curtains for Woking. In the National League it’s Barrow 1-2 Chester, and Woking 1-1 Dover. As it stands, Woking need a single goal in the last 10 minutes to save themselves at Barrow’s expense. Crystal Palace v Leicester Crystal Palace: Hennessey, Ward, Tomkins, Sakho, Van Aanholt, McArthur, Milivojevic, Cabaye, Loftus-Cheek, Townsend, Zaha.

New face alert! I believe this is David Coote’s first Premier League game as referee. Southampton v Bournemouth Southampton: McCarthy, Cedric, Yoshida, Hoedt, Bertrand, Tadic, Romeu, Lemina, Bednarek, Austin, Redmond. Subs: Ward-Prowse, Gabbiadini, Sims, Forster, Stephens, Long, Hojbjerg. Bournemouth: Begovic, Francis, Steve Cook, Ake, Daniels, Mousset, Gosling, Lewis Cook, Fraser, Callum Wilson, King. Subs: Boruc, Surman, Pugh, Brad Smith, Mings, Ibe, Defoe. Referee: Anthony Taylor. Team news is starting to drip in. Hold on to your hats … Hello world! So, another Saturday dawns. This one, though, could be decisive for several teams across the divisions. Here, then, are today’s fixtures, and a league-by-league guide to what could be decided: Premier League Burnley v Brighton Crystal Palace v Leicester Huddersfield v Everton Liverpool v Stoke (12.30pm) Newcastle v West Brom Southampton v AFC Bournemouth Swansea v Chelsea (5.30pm) This could be the week West Brom’s brave but belated fight against relegation comes to an end. They will be condemned to the Championship unless they beat Newcastle and Swansea drop points against Chelsea. Stoke could also be relegated this weekend, but it would take defeat to Liverpool, a Swansea win and at least a point apiece for Crystal Palace (against Leicester), Huddersfield (against Everton) and then West Ham, who face Manchester City on Sunday. With Manchester City confirmed as champions, the focus at the top end is on the Champions League places. The top four finishers all go directly into next season’s group stage and Manchester United and Liverpool can secure their places this weekend. Victory in Saturday’s early kick-off will be enough for Liverpool if fifth-placed Chelsea then drop points. United, three points better off than the Reds in second, will be in if they beat Arsenal on Sunday or Chelsea fail to win. Championship Aston Villa v Derby Barnsley v Brentford Burton Albion v Bolton Hull v Cardiff Middlesbrough v Millwall (5.30pm) Norwich v Leeds Nottm Forest v Bristol City QPR v Birmingham Reading v Ipswich Sheff Utd v Preston North End Wolverhampton v Sheff Wed. Middlesbrough will seal a place in the play-offs if they beat seventh-placed Millwall, while Derby could also seal their place with victory over Villa combined with Millwall and Brentford dropping points. With Sunderland already relegated, Burton will follow if they lose to Bolton – a result which would also leave Barnsley needing to beat Brentford to have any hope of survival. Sky Bet League One Blackpool v Shrewsbury Bradford v Southend Bristol Rovers v Gillingham Bury v Portsmouth Charlton v Blackburn Milton Keynes Dons v Scunthorpe Oldham v Doncaster Oxford Utd v Rochdale Peterborough v Fleetwood Town Plymouth v Rotherham Walsall v Northampton Wigan v AFC Wimbledon. Wigan and Blackburn have wrapped up the two automatic promotion places. Wigan can clinch the title if they beat AFC Wimbledon and Rovers lose to Charlton. Bury are already relegated and MK Dons’ fate will be sealed unless they beat Scunthorpe and Oldham and Rochdale both lose, to Doncaster and Oxford respectively. If Northampton lose to Walsall, the Cobblers would also be relegated by a win for either Dale or Oldham. Sky Bet League Two Accrington Stanley v Lincoln City Cheltenham v Coventry Chesterfield v Wycombe Colchester v Swindon Crawley Town v Crewe Grimsby v Notts County Luton v Forest Green Morecambe v Barnet Newport County v Cambridge Utd Port Vale v Carlisle Stevenage v Exeter Yeovil v Mansfield. Accrington will be confirmed as champions unless they lose to Lincoln and also-promoted Luton beat Forest Green. Wycombe can clinch the third promotion place if they beat relegated Chesterfield, Exeter lose and Notts County drop points. The latter pair are secure in the play-offs. Lincoln will join them with a point, or if Mansfield fail to beat Yeovil. Coventry, who face Cheltenham, can clinch the final place if they better Mansfield’s result. Barnet must win at Morecambe to avoid joining Chesterfield in the National League, and would still need Grimsby to drop points against Notts County. Also, in the National League Woking will go down unless they beat Dover and Barrow drop points to Chester. In Scotland Brechin City host Queen of the South in their final game of a miserable league season (P35 W0 D4 L31), still in search of that elusive first victory. I’ve scoured Europe in search of other meaningful 3pm GMT kick-offs, and have found little. But Rovaniemen Palloseura, AKA RoPS, the runaway early leaders of the Finnish Veikkausliiga, take their five-point lead and 100% record (after five games) to TPS (AKA Turun Palloseura), while in Belarus BATE Borisov have their own 100% record (after four games) tested by the visiting Slutsk, who are themselves unbeaten. Try to control your excitement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/27/jurgen-klopp-calls-for-responsibility-from-everyone-ahead-of-return-to-rome-liverpool-roma","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T21:32:00Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp calls for ‘responsibility from everyone’ before Roma trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/27/jurgen-klopp-calls-for-responsibility-from-everyone-ahead-of-return-to-rome-liverpool-roma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/27/jurgen-klopp-calls-for-responsibility-from-everyone-ahead-of-return-to-rome-liverpool-roma","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp calls for ‘responsibility from everyone’ before Roma trip","bodyText":"Jürgen Klopp has appealed for “responsibility from everyone” at Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final in Rome amid concerns over security and the attack that critically injured a Liverpool supporter outside Anfield. A Liverpool delegation met officials from Uefa, Roma and the Italian authorities in Rome on Friday and said important progress had been made on a range of security and safety issues for the 5,000 travelling fans. The club had several concerns and these were heightened by the assault on 53-year-old Sean Cox before the first leg on Tuesday. Two Roma fans are due to appear at crown court on 24 May in connection with the attack. The Liverpool manager said he was at a loss to comprehend the violence that, along with the season-ending injury to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, had tarnished his team’s superb 5-2 victory at Anfield. He urged everyone involved in the second leg – Liverpool’s supporters, Roma fans and the authorities – to ensure the return leg makes headlines for the right reasons. “It is only football, only football,” said Klopp. “I never understood people who did not understand that fact. I never my whole life thought it is nice that they have a fight next to a stadium or whatever. I am pretty sure everyone who is involved in keeping all people there safe that they do their best and in a modern world it will be possible. I am not too concerned about that but I really ask for responsibility from everyone.” Merseyside police has confirmed fans will be refused entry to the Stadio Olimpico if the name on their ticket does not correspond with that on their passport. Klopp wore an Irish tricolour Liverbird at his press conference on Friday in tribute to Mr Cox, who is from Dunboyne in County Meath. The father of three remains in an induced coma following brain surgery. Klopp added: “Tuesday showed the beauty of the game during the game and showed its most ugly face before the game. I cannot describe my emotions in English still. It should never have happened and we all have to do everything to make sure things like that will not happen any more. “I obviously don’t have the solution for it, probably no one has that, but it is unbelievable that something like this can happen. As you can imagine, all our thoughts and prayers at this moment are with Sean and his family.” Klopp made a striking vow to Oxlade-Chamberlain as the Liverpool midfielder begins a lengthy recovery from serious ligament damage. “I cannot believe that this wonderful player and person in such a positive situation helping the team, making such a clear challenge, had this happen to him,” Klopp said. “It’s not fair but that’s how life is sometimes. They say you get a lemon, make lemonade out of it and that’s what we have to do. I’ve told him we will wait for him like a good wife when a man is in prison.” The manager has said Adam Lallana and Emre Can may be fit to alleviate his central midfield injury crisis before long. Both players have been sidelined since last month but Klopp said: “There is still a possibility to play. There is no chance for Wednesday and then maybe possible for Brighton for Adam.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/27/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/27/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• An article said there were 6 million Jews in Europe today.

In the case of DExEu’s David Davis, however, he doesn’t even text it in. The secretary of state’s performance in front of the Brexit select committee this week basically amounted to a series of emoticons. He can’t do you an explanation of how in the name of magical thinking the government can square its promises on the Irish border with promises on leaving the customs union – but he can do you the shrug. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Did you miss it? Don’t worry. Just ask him another question and he’ll do it again. At such a late stage of the game, it is unclear quite how many civil service lectures on the problem Davis has failed to pay attention to. But on this evidence, he urgently needs to be bored harder over the hard border. Or perhaps the looming crisis point is what he wants. Perhaps Britain has had enough of exports. Since before the referendum was even a twinkle in David Cameron’s eye, leavers have been immeasurably helped by the fact that many of us – most of us? – don’t understand the simplicities of Brexit, let alone its complexities. I recently watched an ITV news dispatch from Norway’s border with Sweden during which I discovered that either Davis did not know what the word “frictionless” meant, or was hoping no one else did. On this basis, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis had a frictionless relationship. As for the rest of us, a ComRes survey just before the 2016 vote found 61% of voters declaring themselves willing to accept a short-term economic slowdown to tighten immigration controls, but 68% unwilling to see their personal annual income negatively affected at all to achieve the same. What has the economy to do with the public, much of the public wonders. I can only recall one hard lesson from Theresa May in the past year, when she said to the nation: “If we don’t get the negotiation right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk and the opportunities you seek for your families will simply not happen. If we do not stand up and get this negotiation right, we risk the secure and well-paid jobs we want for our children and our children’s children too.” And yet, in context, even this is not the moment of brutal candour it appears. May made these comments outside Downing Street in the course of a ludicrously aggressive diatribe against the EU, immediately after returning from Buckingham Palace to call her Darwin award-winning election. Last August, it emerged that some on the EU side of negotiations thought it impossible that the UK side should be as under-prepared and aimless as they seemed, and that it must all be a clever ploy. Pretty sure no one’s floating that theory any more. What’s somehow more unsettling, though, is the look on the faces of Brexiteers outside the inner circle as they realise we really are winging this. This week even such allies appeared concerned by Davis’s shallows. Elsewhere in the government of all the talentless, Amber Rudd’s eye-catching decision to make her terrible week worse is drawing conspiracy theories of its own. On Thursday, the home secretary popped to the Commons to apologise for misleading them over Windrush again, then told journalists she “was not going to be drawn” as to whether Britain would stay in the customs union, despite May saying it wouldn’t. It’s a mark of the government’s baroque dysfunction that the embattled Rudd’s gaffe was regarded by some as a cunning ruse. “I think a lot of people in government are willing us on,” judged one Tory customs union rebel. Underpinning all this is the government’s own structural problem – namely, the impossibility of even the sympathetic half of the audience being able to suspend their disbelief. These people might back them, but do they really believe them? We all know what they did two summers ago. The cabinet is now cobbled together from two sides of the referendum divide, each of whom accused the other of the most despicable lies during the campaign. Ever since, preposterously, they have expected the public to accept they are telling the truth when they act together. How is this supposed to work? It is difficult to overstate the absurdity of the home secretary presenting any sort of united front with the foreign secretary, for instance, given that she explained to a TV audience of millions: “Boris? Well, he’s the life and soul of the party but he’s not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening.” This is a date-rape joke with a drink-drive cover story – a memorable attempt by Amber to cast herself as the Iceman to Boris’s Maverick. I’m not precisely sure where that metaphor leaves us after the past fortnight, but it’s fair to say that if world war three does threaten to break out, you don’t want Amber within two continents of a fighter jet cockpit. It feels more as if we’ve reached the point in a movie where Theresa May is using Rudd’s political corpse as a bullet shield. Or have we? In the sort of masterstroke of comic timing many have come to expect from this outfit, we learned on Thursday of the “war chests” that have been built up this year by cabinet ministers thought to be eyeing leadership bids. As the Sun revealed, those big beasts are: Gavin Williamson (who no longer sells fireplaces), Michael Gove and Amber Rudd. But of course. Reflecting on her abject and shameful Windrush failures this week, Rudd said: “I look back with hindsight and I’m surprised I did not see the shape of it sooner.” The same might be said of the government’s quarter-arsed handling of negotiations with the EU. What will eventually unite many leave and remain voters, one suspects, is the enraged conviction that the politicians should have known what they were doing with Brexit, and rather sooner than this. • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/27/lesbian-family-values-ruth-davidson-scottish-tory-gay-lgbt-prejudices-rethink","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T14:16:47Z","webTitle":"A lesbian with family values: why Tories love Ruth Davidson | Katy Balls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/lesbian-family-values-ruth-davidson-scottish-tory-gay-lgbt-prejudices-rethink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/lesbian-family-values-ruth-davidson-scottish-tory-gay-lgbt-prejudices-rethink","fields":{"headline":"A lesbian with family values: why Tories love Ruth Davidson","bodyText":"If a decade ago anyone had told you that the leader of the Scottish Conservatives was the bookies’ favourite to be the next first minister of Scotland, you’d have given them a funny look. If they’d then told you that this same person had announced, to widespread jubilation from the Tory party, that she was having a baby with her lesbian partner through IVF, you’d be forgiven for laughing in their face. But this is the new normal thanks to Ruth Davidson. The Scottish Conservative leader’s announcement yesterday that she is expecting her first child was notable not for its controversy, but the lack of it. The news was welcomed by all and sundry in the Conservative ranks. This is a far cry from the Tory party that under Margaret Thatcher introduced section 28 banning councils from “intentionally” promoting homosexuality – and under Iain Duncan Smith tried to force its MPs to vote against proposals allowing gay and unmarried couples to adopt. The current leader doesn’t have a spotless record either when it comes to supporting gay rights. While Theresa May is commended by her colleagues for her work as home secretary, passing the same-sex marriage act in 2013, her voting record over the years has included opposing reducing the age of consent for gay people, the repeal of section 28, and civil partnership. Even Nicky Morgan – the former education minister who is nowadays widely regarded as a liberal light in a provincial party – is not unscathed in all this: she voted against gay marriage. However, just as both May and Morgan have since personally apologised for their voting record on these issues, the Conservative party as a whole has had to rethink its approach to gay rights. Beginning with Michael Howard and spearheaded by David Cameron, the Tories have been on a journey of discovery over the past two decades. The sea-change is down to several factors. First, in the 80s there were three main schools of thought when it came to opposition to gay rights. There was the most obvious form of bigotry; there were those who opposed it on religious grounds; and then there was a so-called intellectual argument that saw gay culture as something disorderly and hedonistic, which should not be encouraged. For many traditional Tories the lifestyle they associated with homosexuality was incompatible with a life based on family values and monogamy. Cameron understood these concerns when he pitched same-sex marriage to his colleagues in a speech at party conference in 2011. The Tory moderniser didn’t use his speech just to talk about equality – instead he gave as much if not more focus to the word “commitment”. He said it shouldn’t matter whether this commitment was “between a man and a woman, a woman and a woman, or a man and another man … And to anyone who has reservations, I say: yes, it’s about equality, but it’s also about something else: commitment. Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I don’t support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I’m a Conservative.” A natural salesman, he also gave them an offer – he would recognise marriage in the tax system so long as gay people could get married too. As the record shows, this pitch worked. But the Conservative membership base is still behind the country at large when it comes to social attitudes. Earlier this year research at Queen Mary University of London found that almost six in 10 Tory members are still not supportive of marriage equality, despite the move being introduced by a Conservative prime minister. This is where Ruth Davidson’s appeal comes in. For all the work of Tory modernisers over the years, a large chunk of the credit must go to Davidson herself for managing to challenge prejudices simply by being herself. As a politician, Davidson’s great political strength is that she has authentically been many different things at the same time: a BBC hack who also spent time in the territorial army, a lesbian who is a member of the Church of Scotland and now a mother-to-be. Yet despite the party membership’s socially conservative values, Davidson remains one of the grassroots’ favourite politicians – one that many would like to see in No 10 one day. A ConservativeHome poll of party members after the snap election found that Ruth Davidson had the highest satisfaction rating among party members of any senior Conservative figure. What’s more, Davidson’s decision to have a family – seen as a sign of stability and commitment – will most likely further endear her to Tory members. People are often scared of the unknown. Ruth Davidson’s personality, politics and natural ability have given even the most socially conservative Conservatives reason to think twice about views they have held for years. • Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/29/ruth-wilson-surrey-schoolgirl-vanished-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Ruth Wilson, the schoolgirl who caught a cab to oblivion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/29/ruth-wilson-surrey-schoolgirl-vanished-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/29/ruth-wilson-surrey-schoolgirl-vanished-documentary","fields":{"headline":"Ruth Wilson, the schoolgirl who caught a cab to oblivion","bodyText":"Two years ago I was contacted out of the blue by a retired police officer who asked if I remembered the case of Ruth Wilson, a 16-year-old girl who had gone missing from Dorking, Surrey, in November 1995. I told him that of course I remembered – it was one of the most peculiar stories I had covered as a journalist. Ruth had left home as usual on a miserable winter morning, but instead of going to school, had taken a cab in the pouring rain to the top of bleak but beautiful Box Hill, where she vanished off the face of the earth. A good girl from a good family, Ruth has never been heard of since and no body has been found. I first wrote about the case in the Observer more than 15 years ago and it has haunted me ever since. In 2002 I concluded that the circumstances of the Ruth Wilson case were perhaps just too odd to become the focus of a media campaign. There had been some attempts to use her family to draw attention to the case, but they were not keen on publicity. Over the years there was a series of further appeals, but even in Surrey the Ruth Wilson story just faded away. And it would have remained in obscurity were it not for Liam McAuley, a 58-year-old retired police officer from Northern Ireland, who came across the story in a local paper when he moved to Dorking in the mid-1990s. “Nobody can actually just vanish,” he told me. “I think something terrible has happened to her. Somebody knows where she is.” McAuley made a freedom of information request to the police to ask for details of the interviews carried out after the disappearance. He was told the case was still ongoing and he could not have the documents he had requested. He wrote to Ruth’s parents, Ian and Karen, who still lived in the village of Betchworth, near Dorking, but received no reply. In his frustration he contacted me as the last journalist to write extensively about her. His tenacity has led to the making of a documentary, The Vanished, released this weekend. The circumstances of Ruth Wilson’s disappearance had always left me uneasy. Why had this studious, church-going, bell-ringing, choir-singing, organ-playing young woman suddenly decided to make a new life for herself? In the intervening years, I had discovered something about the Wilson family they had chosen to hide from me at the time. Karen Wilson, introduced to me as Ruth and her sister Jenny’s mother, was in fact their stepmother. Their birth mother, Nesta, had died in tragic circumstances when Ruth was a toddler and Jenny still a baby. Why hadn’t they told me this? Was this really such a happy family? And did the death of her mother have anything to do with Ruth running away? When we started making the documentary Ian Wilson got back to me saying he and the family didn’t want to participate, although he trusted us to do “a professional job”. With the family refusing to speak, we decided to contact Ruth’s friends. We knew she had recently split up with her boyfriend, Will, and I managed to track him down to the south coast. Will, who does not want to be identified, explained that Ruth was a troubled teenager. She was unhappy at home. Will confirmed that her mother had died. The story he had heard was that she had fallen downstairs and broken her neck. Following an appeal in the local newspaper, other friends came forward. Roxy Birch, a schoolfriend who played Ruth in an early reconstruction of the disappearance, told me: “She couldn’t drive, as far as I am aware, she didn’t have a passport... So, you have to ask yourself the question, where could she have disappeared to for 22 years?” Kay Blenard, another schoolfriend, said: “My belief is that she had planned to do something. I don’t know whether that would be permanent or temporary. I’d also like to believe that someone knows what happened.” Nesta Wilson’s death certificate showed that the story of the accident on the stairs was not correct. The awful truth is that Ruth’s mother committed suicide: she hanged herself just before Christmas in 1982, when Ruth was four and her sister a few months old. Just after receiving this grim information, I was contacted by another of Ruth’s friends. Catherine Mair grew up close to her in the sixth form of The Ashcombe School. Crucially, Catherine revealed that Ruth had found out about her mother’s suicide just before she disappeared. She was devastated. “Ruth was really troubled,” she said. “She had so much going on in her head that she was desperately trying to find out who she was. ” We put this to the Wilsons and they issued a response. “Her family are extremely hurt by this statement and do not recognise this view of Ruth’s childhood,” they said. “Ruth always knew about her biological mother’s death, but not the exact cause. Sadly, we now know that before her disappearance, Ruth had discovered the tragic circumstances of her mother’s death, but equally sadly, she chose not to discuss or question this with any family members.” Jon Savell, the chief superintendent, public protection, at Surrey police, carried out the latest review. “There are five explanations for Ruth Wilson’s disappearance,” he said. “A tragic accident, abduction, suicide, murder, or that she had absented herself to start a new life.” I asked him whether the police had known about Ruth’s unsettled home life and her birth mother’s suicide. He confirmed that they had indeed known about the family background, but chose not to make it public in case it coloured the testimony of any witnesses who came forward. So it was that the narrative developed of the perfect middle-class home and an inexplicable disappearance. There are so many unanswered questions. Why did Ruth send her stepmother flowers to arrive two days after her disappearance? Where is her mother’s family and why did they not come forward? And why, if she ran away, has she never made contact with her family and friends? Someone knows what happened to Ruth. And secrets have a tendency to come out in the end.

This is , exemplified by the latest turn of events: Len McCluskey apparently insistent on reiterating that the raising of voices about antisemitism constitutes a “smear”, while Kier Starmer correctly rejects this by suggesting that denial of antisemitism is “part of the problem” (Report, 27 April). It is clear that Jeremy Corbyn and the leadership now recognise this is a problem of both considerable vintage and intractability. In the meantime we await the outcome of efforts by the recently appointed general secretary, who will hopefully recognise how the articulation of current concerns about this form of racism in the party is not an attempt to destabilise progressive socialism, but the result of real and legitimate apprehensions that go to the heart of individual and collective identities and, significantly, that these are identities that progressive socialists have always fought to protect and cherish. The problem is the interregnum: we have an effective leader, but no clear timeline for when convincing leadership to deal with antisemitism will be forthcoming. In this hiatus, CLPs reflect and rehearse the McCluskey/Starmer dichotomy, often with pain and angst. Criticism of the leadership is seen as an inevitable erosion of Corbyn’s post-general election hagiography, while to say nothing results in personal and political entropy. For those of us who are desperate to see a Labour government in power, the party now has to act with speed and clarity on antisemitism so that we can move on.

Starship Technologies, an autonomous delivery startup created in 2014 by two Skype co-founders, has been in public testing mode in 20 countries around the world since 2015. Now the company says it is ready for its first “major commercial rollout”. Employees of finance developer Intuit in Mountain View, California, will be able to order breakfast, lunch and coffee from their staff cafeteria and have it delivered to any point in the company’s Silicon Valley campus by one of Starship’s 10kg six-wheeled autonomous robots. “You place your order, it’s one click, then you drop a pin where you want the robot to meet you,” says Starship co-founder Janus Friis. “We’ve seen huge demand for breakfast. For some reason people just don’t want to wait – they want to go straight to work and avoid the queue in the early hours of the day.” Starship is proposing campus expansion as a middle ground between its tests in urban areas, where the company’s robots have generally been accompanied by human handlers, and a full rollout across a city or suburb. “A campus is just like a residential neighbourhood,” Friis says. “It’s pretty good for the early stages of the rollout, because they’re well laid out and well planned, so they work well for driving, and that’s why we’ve decided to launch and scale now.” Starship is now on the lookout for other campuses across western Europe and the US where it can deploy the robots. “We’ve reached the level of scale where we can deploy this widely,” says Ahti Heinla, says the company’s CEO and co-founder. “This is not just robots, there’s all sort of infrastructure around it that comes with it, you know: the service, the tools, the housing for the robots. We deliver them in pods that integrate them into the environment. So basically there’s a whole system with corporate and academic campuses that we’re starting to deploy.” Separately, Friis says, Starship is trialling its city deployments in a suburb of Milton Keynes – the site of most of its activity in the UK – and will be launching another trial in San Jose, California, in a few weeks. In the little over a year since the company made its world-first delivery – of lamb and falafel from a Turkish restaurant in London – it has amassed a global fleet of 150 robots carrying out daily drop-offs in eight cities in the US, UK, Estonia and Germany. Thus far its deliveries have been mostly of food and parcels through corporate partnerships such as Just Eat, Domino’s Pizza, Hermes and Postmates in the US, though it launched a trial “plug and play” service for small businesses in Milton Keynes earlier this month. The new commercial rollout in Silicon Valley will bring its delivery robots into contact with more people, and the company hopes these continued interactions will quell some concerns voiced about the rise of automation. Friis says most of the response from the public has been positive, contrasting Starship’s offering – squat, wheeled robots rolling along the pavements and co-existing with pedestrians – with “dystopian” efforts from companies such as Amazon and Google to introduce flying delivery drones. “It would be a rather dystopian future to imagine thousands – tens of thousands – of buzzing drones delivering things to people in an urban environment: that’s not a nice future. “But these quiet robots that just gently navigate the streets, and cause no inconvenience to people and deliver a great new service, it is – from the reception we get from people – it is a very positive thing.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/07/all-gates-open-story-of-can-rob-young-irmin-schmidt-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T06:00:42Z","webTitle":"All Gates Open: The Story of Can by Rob Young and Irmin Schmidt – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/07/all-gates-open-story-of-can-rob-young-irmin-schmidt-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/07/all-gates-open-story-of-can-rob-young-irmin-schmidt-review","fields":{"headline":"All Gates Open: The Story of Can by Rob Young and Irmin Schmidt – review","bodyText":"It all begins, and ends, with Irmin Schmidt. A classical musician under the tutelage of Karlheinz Stockhausen, the young Schmidt travelled to New York in 1966 and immersed himself in the brave new music of Terry Riley and Steve Reich. His open mind was blown out even further by the possibilities of rock’n’roll. The group he formed on his return to Germany became Can, one of the most influential experimental bands of all time: their sinuous creations went on to warp generations of sound-makers. Brian Eno became a fellow traveller; John Lydon begged to be their singer before forming Public Image Ltd. Happy Mondays’ song Hallelujah bows to Can’s Halleluwah. The Jesus and Mary Chain and Radiohead covered them, the late Mark E Smith of the Fall and LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy worshipped them, and modern electronica owes a debt to Can’s early machine music, just as hip-hop later ran with the baton of their early sampling. For their part, Can sometimes thought they were a dub reggae band; they certainly used their studio, Inner Space, as an instrument. They often made their money scoring films, allowing the group a staggering amount of creative autonomy. Can benefited, too, from the astute management of Hildegard Schmidt, Irmin’s partner, whose role in Can’s success is laid bare here as never before. Tragically, Schmidt is the only surviving core member of this extraordinary band. Michael Karoli, formerly Holger Czukay’s pupil before giving up a law career to become Can’s guitarist, died in 2001. Both the melodic drummer, Jaki Liebezeit, and Czukay, bassist, keyboard player and sound engineer, died in 2017. The band’s two surviving vocalists – an American draft dodger called Malcolm Mooney (now a visual artist) and the Japanese busker Damo Suzuki (who has colon cancer but is still making music) – contribute to this definitive history, and quotes from latter-day members, the late Reebop Kwaku Baah and Rosko Gee, are part of the extensive research. Still, it falls to the last Can standing – Schmidt – and former Wire editor Rob Young, whose previous book, Electric Eden, focused on the visionary seam of British folk music, to tell the story of a group who defied categorisation. Alongside Kraftwerk, Neu! and a handful of other German outfits – cringe-makingly lumped together as “krautrock” – Can became a nexus of Teutonic cool in the early 70s. This two-part book is a portrait of a fiercely intellectual, but hugely sensuous, band who improvised and jammed, but sneered at those terms, preferring “intuitive music” and “collage” to describe the spacy, evolving compositions the collective co-authored in a kind of mutual trance-state. They were virtuosos who hated virtuosity, or anything that smacked overtly of American forms. As Young attests in his (greater) part of the book, all the main Can players came from classical backgrounds and enthusiastically unlearned their craft. Schmidt was into modern art and inspired by Fluxus; the very name Can was a nod to Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup lietmotif. Liebezeit, who emerges from this account as one of the most unyielding defenders of Can’s groove, was a renegade jazz drummer who erupted any time Czukay spliced the band’s tapes insensitively – this was all painstakingly done by hand, often with tape reels liberated from Stockhausen’s studio. Can’s tale is clearly Schmidt’s to tell. But Young’s scholarly doorstop suffers slightly from its heavy reliance on one perspective. The final third of the book is clearly Schmidt’s wily attempt to remix anything so dull and formal as “a book”, just as Can thumbed their noses at structure in their music. Schmidt’s notebooks include cut-up, sampled conversations with notable fans– Portishead’s Geoff Barrow, some of Primal Scream, Mute Records boss Daniel Miller, NME’s infamous Nick Kent, no women – on some illuminating topics and some waffle. Schmidt’s recent diaries, tacked on at the end, contain far too many accounts of his dreams and conversations with neighbours in Provence (although, in mitigation, one of them is John Malkovich). Young, meanwhile, is a phenomenal scholar whose understanding of Can runs deep. He sets up this immersive story with accounts of the German postwar period, the swirling art and music scenes of the 50s and 60s, and the impact the war had on its children: Schmidt’s parents were Nazi supporters, a fact with which he struggled profoundly. Politics was never far away in those heady times. Karoli and his then girlfriend, Eveline Grunwald, were often stopped by roadside police who mistook them for Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof from the Baader-Meinhof gang. Young is very good indeed at laying bare the fascinating workings of Inner Space (the studio survives in a museum in Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia, presumably minus its help-yourself lump of hash). He is impeccably informed on every note of Can-related work, from their many porn film soundtracks to their world music Ethnological Forgery Series. But he can occasionally wax a little too eloquent on the music itself. One track, Yoo Doo Right, brings forth from Young “a squadron of mechanical deities manoeuvring through a ravine” to be “extruded” and “fractalised into an ever-shifting array of byways”. You can see what he means – Can tend to invite this sort of prose – but still: it sometimes feels as though a deservedly long book is unnecessarily extended by these authorial fugue states. And while Young and Schmidt handle the departure of Mooney very sensitively (he had a breakdown), you do wish for a better sense of these highly individualistic musicians as people; only the impish Suzuki manages to fly off the page. Inner Space was full of artistic tension; each member refused to show off or solo, but would argue vociferously for their vision of “the Can”. All Gates Open is a cerebral book about a cerebral band; that is as it should be. But it would have benefited from an even greater emphasis on the idiosyncratic personalities involved. It would be wrong to give away one major contributory factor – hitherto unknown – to Can’s unravelling in the mid-70s. But the episode is one of the occasions in Young’s account where the members of Can are presented as flesh, blood and emotions, rather than lofty intellectuals of sound. • All Gates Open: The Story of Can by Rob Young and Irmin Schmidt is published by Faber Social (£25).

One is a continuing crisis of the economic system: previous growth levels have never recovered, particularly in Europe, while wages have stagnated and living standards fallen. Home ownership is declining in both Britain and the United States, with labour markets everywhere increasingly precarious. Another factor is the reemergence of political polarisation. In 2011, Time magazine’s Person of the Year was “The Protester”. While dissent was primarily limited to the streets for several years – including the Arab spring and the Occupy movement – it would ultimately underpin the rise of politicians whose radicalism and popular appeal were previously unimaginable. Step forward Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders. In the background was a revolution in technology and media consumption. Over the last decade, more than 1bn iPhones have been sold, while a project started in a Harvard dorm – Facebook – is now the world’s most successful media company. Those changes, fused with a transformed political environment, have signalled the return of big ideas – and in unexpected ways. While on the right we’ve seen the rise of the online “manosphere” and the “alt-right”, on the left there has been the unexpected revival of a thinker whose legacy endures even after 150 years: Karl Marx. For a generation of activists and academics their first real engagement with Capital, was via the freely available video lectures of David Harvey’s course at City University of New York. As an additional primer, Harvey wrote his Companion to Marx’s Capital in 2010. A touchstone text for newcomers to Marxist thought, it is the intellectual basis for the more radical elements of left movements in the UK and US. If Harvey is a good way to become acquainted with Marxist economics, Francis Wheen’s Karl Marx allows the reader to situate his output within the context of 19th-century Europe. While far from politically sympathetic, the biography is informative and light, humanising a figure diminished for much of the last 100 years. The Condition of the Working Class in England, written by Friedrich Engels in the early 1840s, is based on personal observations in Manchester, where he was a successful industrialist. It would influence Marx when they finally met in 1844. For a glimpse of the city that would shape Marx’s mental landscape like no other, and which last year erected a statue to his friend and patron, it remains a vital point of reference. Even when his political conclusions were ignored, or viewed as confounded by events, Marx’s contribution to history remained widely recognised. The German Ideology, at more than 700 pages, is the definitive text. Fortunately, a much shorter version, published by Lawrence &amp; Wishart, will suffice. It was because of his historical method that Louis Althusser once wrote of Marx’s similarity to Thales and Galileo. Like them, he had “discovered” a new continent for intellectual exploration. Just as Thales unearthed mathematics and Galileo astronomy, he viewed Marx as responsible for revealing history not as the result of fortune, providence or the deeds of great individuals, but the unfolding of a material process that shapes our actions and is, in turn, shaped by human agency. Much modern historical analysis rests on such conclusions, from the “archeology” of Foucault to the world-systems theory of Immanuel Wallerstein. It is the work of Silvia Federici, particularly her Caliban and the Witch, that is perhaps most rewarding. Examining the witch trials prevalent across much of early modern Europe, her Marxist-feminist approach allows us to better understand the intimate relationship between modern patriarchy, the rise of the nation state and the transition from feudalism to capitalism. In a world increasingly defined by political chaos, economic volatility and which is short on answers – Marx’s work always implores us to challenge our own assumptions while thinking, and acting, big. He may have been born 200 years ago, but his key insights – a materialist view of history and a grasp of capitalism as an inherently limited system – remain invaluable. And dangerous. • Aaron Bastani’s Fully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto will be published by Verso."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/28/bank-raise-interest-rates-time-long-since-come-gone","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T16:00:18Z","webTitle":"The time for the Bank to raise interest rates has long since come and gone | Phillip Inman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/28/bank-raise-interest-rates-time-long-since-come-gone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/28/bank-raise-interest-rates-time-long-since-come-gone","fields":{"headline":"The time for the Bank to raise interest rates has long since come and gone","bodyText":"With little more than a week to go before the Bank of England considers its next interest rate move, it has become clear that the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has missed the boat. Its governor, Mark Carney, hinted as much in comments earlier this month when he spoke about the weakening of the economy since the start of the year. “I don’t want to get too focused on the precise timing – it is more about the general path,” Carney told the BBC. In particular, he said the turmoil on Britain’s high streets, which has seen a worrying number of businesses go to the wall, was a matter of interest to the bank’s interest-rate-setting committee. He could see what was coming in the latest GDP figures, which came out on Friday and revealed a miserable 0.1% increase in the first quarter of the year. Carney’s gloomy stance is in sharp contrast with his bullish comments in February. Back then, he was keen to follow the US Federal Reserve and signal several increases to head off what he saw as a booming economy that was feeding rapidly into higher wages. In the simplest of monetary policy calculations, higher wages mean demand outstripping supply for goods and services, which in turn leads to rising prices. Carney said that with wages set to soar and inflation to remain stubbornly high, calm could only be restored by jacking up interest rates. But persistently high inflation perpetuated by strong wage rises was always a mirage shimmering on the horizon. It was never going to happen – at least not in the sustained fashion that might worry a central bank. A report last week by the labour market economists David Bell and David Blanchflower explains how the long-term trend for wage rises is no more than 2%, and that this is not going to be enough to put pressure on prices. The inflation rise seen in Britain was always a temporary blip driven by the fall in the pound, which provided a one-off rise in import prices. It was prolonged by an unexpected rise in the oil price to $70 a barrel. So the question must be, why did Carney and his rate-setting committee make such a big deal of the need to raise rates when the case was always weak? There are several reasons, and they link together. The first is that they want to have some ammunition when the next recession hits. Building up an armoury involves raising interest rates, in order to cut them in the future, and winding down the quantitative easing (QE) programme to afford officials the opportunity to give it a boost at a later date. At the moment, with rates at 0.5% and the total spent on buying government debt under QE standing at £435bn, there is little room to add any extra fizz should the economy start to slide. There is also the problem of how to justify tighter monetary policy during a long and modest recovery. Three years ago, when the UK economy appeared to be bouncing back from the crash, several Bank officials said the time was right to raise rates. The departed Kristin Forbes was one. Ian McCafferty, who is still in place, was another. Judging by the standards of today, they were right. The money supply was expanding at its fastest rate since the crash, GDP growth was hitting 2% and unemployment was low and falling. Carney was one of the chief naysayers, arguing that the economy remained weak by historical standards and, crucially, that low productivity was restricting the possibility of high and sustained wage rises. Looking back, 2014 and 2015 were high points in a long struggle for recovery. Is Carney kicking himself for inaction now that there is an even weaker case for re-arming monetary policy? He shouldn’t be. The responsibility for acting always lay with the government, and particularly George Osborne’s Treasury. All the time Osborne was promising more austerity, the Bank’s hands were tied. While the Treasury was withdrawing money from the economy by spending less – and businesses, nervous about the future, were doing the same – it was a suicide mission for the Bank to pursue a similar goal. It was only the Bank that stood between the UK and a full-blown, 1930s-style depression. It is still possible the Bank of England will raise rates in a bloody-minded show of strength. Yet by its own standards, the case for it could only have been made three years ago. Now it’s much too late. Austerity remains firmly in place. The current chancellor, Philip Hammond, worries about Brexit and business follows suit – limiting investment and wages growth, and leaving hard-pressed households to survive as best they can."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/25/sports-quiz-week-real-madrid-liverpool-emery-harry-kane","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T11:09:11Z","webTitle":"Sports quiz of the week: Unai Emery, Liverpool and a dirty mouth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/25/sports-quiz-week-real-madrid-liverpool-emery-harry-kane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/25/sports-quiz-week-real-madrid-liverpool-emery-harry-kane","fields":{"headline":"Sports quiz of the week: Unai Emery, Liverpool and a dirty mouth","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/27/emmanuel-macron-donald-trump-visit-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T23:47:35Z","webTitle":"Macron went mano a mano with Trump, but will he have anything to show for it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/emmanuel-macron-donald-trump-visit-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/27/emmanuel-macron-donald-trump-visit-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Macron went mano a mano with Trump, but will he have anything to show for it?","bodyText":"One of Donald Trump’s contributions to international diplomacy has been to make it more of a contact sport. Planning how to deal with his aggressive handshakes has become as much a part of preparing for a Trump summit as memorising the talking points. Emmanuel Macron – who was Trump’s guest in Washington this week in the first state visit of the administration – decided to be proactive, gripping the US president’s palm with white-knuckle ferocity and leaving his left arm free for pats and hugs. The French president can point to some benefits of his approach. Trump reserves most of his admiration for autocrats like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Mohammed bin Salman. Macron is the only democratically elected head of state Trump seems to genuinely admire, having convinced the touchy US president that he genuinely likes him – and that he, too, is a man of power. That impression was conveyed last July in Paris where Trump was Macron’s guest at the grand Bastille Day ceremonies. Despite deep unease in the Pentagon, Trump is now insisting on holding his own military parade this Veterans Day. The personal connection has allowed Macron to claim France to be the real bridge between Europe and the US. Both men used the words “special relationship” to describe their friendship – a stake in the heart of the central aspiration of British diplomacy. But plunging into Trump’s embrace is a gamble in which the risk of humiliation is never far away. Inside the West Wing, Trump brushed what he claimed to be dandruff off Macron’s shoulder, in a supposedly solicitous and affectionate gesture that managed to be domineering and demeaning instead. The traveling French press was aghast. If Tony Blair had been George Bush’s poodle, perhaps Macron was becoming Trump’s bichon frisé, muttered a veteran diplomatic correspondent who had flown in from Paris. In the US press meanwhile, there was much talk of “bromance” and the traditional admiration for French style. The French ambassador to Washington, Gérard Araud, was dismissive of such trivia. “Very Washingtonian to spend hours commenting insignificant and superficial details,” Araud complained in a tweet. “I can assure you that the bilateral talks at the [White House] were substantial and consequential.” By the time Macron flew off on Wednesday evening, the substantive outcome of the trip was still hanging in the balance. The three issues at the top of the French president’s agenda all involved trying to coax Trump into changing his mind on gut decisions: withdrawal from Syria, steel tariffs on foreign producers including the EU, and most importantly, Trump’s vow to abrogate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. French officials claimed that Macron was winning the argument on Syria, having warned Trump that a hasty withdrawal could allow Isis to regroup and leave a swath of the Middle East under Iranian hegemony. On steel tariffs, the friendly ambience of the visit left some hope that – once Angela Merkel has bolstered Macron’s message with her own visit to Washington on Friday – Trump might rethink his position. On Iran, however, Macron was downbeat. He and Trump had discussed the fate of the 2015 nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA) for a full hour. The French president had come up with the idea of a “new deal” that would address some of Trump’s complaints, such as the fact that some of the limitations the JCPOA put on Iran’s nuclear activities expire by 2025, and that it did not address ballistic missile development and Iran’s role in conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. In fact, the “new deal” did not really exist, but was rather a Macronian rebranding of previous European assurances that they would be tougher on Iran’s missiles and regional role, and would work to make nuclear restrictions on Iran more permanent – if only he would continue to abide by the JCPOA. A US withdrawal, they fear, would lead to the agreement’s collapse and ultimately a new war in the Middle East. Macron’s gambit was based on the hope that the “new deal” would provide a face-saving means for Trump to stick to the old deal. By the end of the talks, the French president was not confident of success, telling reporters the US president “will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons”. Macron even claimed that, despite all appearances to the contrary, he had not even tried all that hard. “My commitment, my action is not to try to convince President Trump to walk away from his campaign’s commitments or to change his mind. I’m not a masochist,” he said. Many European diplomats, including some in the French foreign ministry, believed that Macron went too far to pander to Trump’s whims, and that the suggestion that sunset clauses in the JCPOA could be renegotiated called into question French commitment to the deal. “He left himself exposed by acknowledging that there is something fundamentally flawed in the deal,” said Célia Belin, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. “The optics suggested Macron took a step towards Trump that validated him and his approach.” While the diplomatic benefits are yet to be seen, there is no mistaking the political benefits of the trip for Macron. He left behind train strikes in France, knowing that his high-profile international diplomacy is one of his strongest points with the French electorate. Polls have shown that two-thirds of French voters approve his action on the world stage. Washington provided a grandiose canvas on which to paint his image as a young global leader. Macron’s speech to Congress on Wednesday – in fluent though heavily accented English – eloquently put the case for the international liberal order that Trump appears determined to take an axe to. The address received standing ovations from Republicans and Democrats alike – a rare phenomenon in recent years. Back in France, Le Figaro praised him for “reinforcing his standing on the international scene”. If French commentators warned that Macron was at risk of flattering Trump for little immediate gain, the consensus was that it was a risk worth taking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/27/man-jailed-for-sexually-assaulting-girl-10-by-manchester-canal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T15:50:14Z","webTitle":"Man jailed for sexually assaulting girl, 10, by Manchester canal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/man-jailed-for-sexually-assaulting-girl-10-by-manchester-canal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/27/man-jailed-for-sexually-assaulting-girl-10-by-manchester-canal","fields":{"headline":"Man jailed for sexually assaulting girl, 10, by Manchester canal","bodyText":"A man who sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl as she was walking home along a canal towpath in Manchester has been jailed. Artus Kozlovskis, 23, was sentenced to five years in prison in Manchester crown court on Friday after pleading guilty to attacking the girl on 10 February. The court heard the child had been walking along the canal in the Openshaw area when Kozlovskis dragged her to a nearby patch of wasteland, covered her mouth to stop her crying out and sexually assaulted her. Kozlovskis, from Latvia, claimed to have been on the drug spice at the time of the attack and to have no recollection of what he had done. He said the incident had “opened his eyes” to the dangers of using the drug. The child ran away when Kozlovskis started to roll a cigarette and she stopped a dog walker to ask for help. CCTV showed her attacker chasing her and walking past a nearby corner shop. Kozlovskis was caught hours after his image was released by police. Justice William Davis, sentencing, told the defendant: “This is the nightmare of every parent. You brought that nightmare to the parents of this little girl. As a result of what you did, she suffered badly and I have no doubt will continue to suffer. “At the time you did what you did, you had a stable background, you had a family, you had a job. There was nothing in your life that should have put you off the rails, apart from the fact you were on drugs, and yet you behaved in this grave way towards this young girl.” DI Claire McGuire of Greater Manchester police said: “Every person that heard about this appalling case was genuinely shocked. I hope this awful case will send a clear message that we are prepared to work relentlessly to bring sexual predators like Kozlovskis to justice.” Kozlovskis will remain on licence for an additional three years and has been issued with a sexual harm prevention order."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/27/mauricio-pochettino-labels-fa-an-embarrassment-over-harry-kane-tweet-tottenham-hotspur","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T21:29:00Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino labels FA an embarrassment over Harry Kane tweet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/27/mauricio-pochettino-labels-fa-an-embarrassment-over-harry-kane-tweet-tottenham-hotspur","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/27/mauricio-pochettino-labels-fa-an-embarrassment-over-harry-kane-tweet-tottenham-hotspur","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino labels FA an embarrassment over Harry Kane tweet","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino has branded the Football Association an embarrassment for its tweet that mocked the performance of Harry Kane in last Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final. The Tottenham Hotspur striker was well marshalled by United’s Chris Smalling at Wembley and after the game, which United won 2-1, the official FA Cup account tweeted: “What’s that in your pocket, Chris?” and linked to an unrelated video of the defender saying: “Harry Kane.” The tweet was deleted and the FA apologised to both Tottenham and United “for any offence caused”. But Pochettino has now laid bare the depth of the surprise and ill-feeling at Spurs. The manager was incredulous that the FA should have goaded a player who will be a key component of Gareth Southgate’s England squad at the World Cup finals in Russia. Kane is expected to captain the team. “It was embarrassing, no?” Pochettino said of the tweet. “It was a shame, because the FA is English football and Harry is a potential captain at the World Cup. It is difficult to understand, very difficult, and they have apologised about that. “The situation disappointed me. The fact it happened and then they apologised after a few days. But move on. That is the reality. We need to protect our assets, our English players, our young players.” Kane has endured a testing period. He was also ribbed after he fought to be credited with a goal that brushed in off him at Stoke City on 7 April. The PFA’s chairman, Ben Purkiss, joked at the Player of the Year awards dinner last Sunday: “Kane is so prolific, he is able to score without touching the ball.” Pochettino said: “Harry was very sad [about the FA’s tweet]. But he’s strong in his mind. He’s moved on. We are helping him to move on. It was a mistake and he needs to move on quick.” There is the strong feeling at Tottenham that Kane has not been afforded the respect he deserves and Pochettino described it as “strange” that people in England did not always get behind England’s best players. Dele Alli, another of Tottenham’s England contingent, is routinely booed at Premier League grounds. “These types of situation – like the tweet after the game – don’t help to create a good atmosphere,” Pochettino said. “I’m sure that Harry is not happy. When we talk about passion, about feeling, you are proud to defend your country – we need to be careful in the way we send out messages.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2018/may/07/rock-the-boat-which-shoes-to-wear-this-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T07:00:43Z","webTitle":"Rock the boat: which shoes to wear this summer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/may/07/rock-the-boat-which-shoes-to-wear-this-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/may/07/rock-the-boat-which-shoes-to-wear-this-summer","fields":{"headline":"Rock the boat: which shoes to wear this summer","bodyText":"On my way to buy some boat shoes the other day, I made the mistake of asking the internet what it thought of them. You can’t buy shoes without knowing what Twitter thinks. Not in 2018. There’s no worse feeling than getting home and discovering your new kicks are racist or haven’t seen Game of Thrones or something. The responses were varied, in that they were various shades of negative: “Nigel Farage has several pairs.” “Not OK with socks.” “Fine on a boat.” This newspaper’s restaurant critic, Grace Dent, had the final word, inviting me to consider whether or not I was Simon Le Bon in Duran Duran’s Rio video. If I was, boat shoes were acceptable. If not, neither were they. After a moment’s thought I concluded that, on balance, I wasn’t Simon Le Bon in the Rio video. The boat shoes were off, but what could I buy instead? Another summer, another shoe crisis. As a man, you do not have to be especially fashion conscious to worry about what goes on the end of your legs between September and May. Owning a mirror is enough. But when the sun’s out, the rules change. The problem is not the shoes themselves, which are often blameless, except in the case of sandals, but the shoes being worn in conjunction with shorts. Shorts: why do we do it? As with tattoos, the most we can say about shorts is that those who already looked good look no worse. For the overwhelming majority of men, however, shorts are difficult. Personally, I try not to wear them unless I’m actually swimming. You cannot wear boots in summer without looking like a summer-camp counsellor. Attempt brogues with shorts and you look like you’re on your way to a Just William cosplay party. Models might galumph up the Riviera in ugly and deliberately dirty Balenciaga Triple S trainers, but, for the rest of us, small, comfortable trainers are the order of the day: white trainers, either canvas ones such as Superga or Converse, or classic Stan Smiths, or their £300 imitators, like those by Common Projects, CQP Gallery and the countless other brands emerging daily. To wear trainers, however, you need socks, which leads us back to the SSC, or summer sock conundrum. “I’m afraid little socks are the only option,” says Matt Hambly, style editor of Men’s Health. “The alternative is either socks poking out of the top, which is gross, or smelly feet, which are even more gross.” However, he disagrees on the no-shorts rule. “British men are terminally scared of shorts and not wearing socks because they think they’ll look silly,” he says. “But wearing trousers in a heatwave for fear of looking daft is surely more silly. Penny loafers with micro-socks – shoe liners from Falke, invisible to the naked eye – work, although if you’re on the beach it’s a low point to remove them. Otherwise, try a structured espadrille if your ambition is to go straight to dinner from the beach.” What of boat shoes, my first love? “Boat shoes are fine.” Are they? Was the internet wrong, for once? The boat shoe appeals because in theory it can do any event without fuss. You could wear it to a dress-down day at the office, to a party, to a restaurant or the beach. On a boat, even. Aside from its Duran Duran associations, however, it also seems like the kind of thing your dad, or your frat-boy nephew, might wear. It hasn’t had some kind of haute-couture overhaul. “The boat shoe/docksider/deck shoe, is, forgive the pun, adrift in contemporary men’s shoe trends,” explains Tom Chamberlin, editor of The Rake. “Most footwear, from espadrilles to boots, have gone through some sort of renaissance over the past five years. Boat shoes, however, have never been reinvented, upgraded or injected with any sort of street cred. Even use on a boat has been superseded by sneakers, such as the collaboration between Santoni and Wider yachts. “Now, could this mean it is perfect and therefore upgrades are unnecessary? Perhaps,” continues Chamberlin. “But to me a shoe’s popularity, or a concerted attempt to make it relevant to the modern buyer, is extremely important. In this category, the boat shoe has failed above any of its contemporaries.” I still think trousers are the solution, but I’m afraid I bought the boat shoes. The shoe liners from Falke, invisible to the naked eye, will have to wait."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2018/apr/27/will-choose-your-own-adventure-work-on-the-big-screen","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T15:13:09Z","webTitle":"Will Choose Your Own Adventure work on the big screen?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/27/will-choose-your-own-adventure-work-on-the-big-screen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/apr/27/will-choose-your-own-adventure-work-on-the-big-screen","fields":{"headline":"Will Choose Your Own Adventure work on the big screen?","bodyText":"The future is here, and it is awful. It has just been announced that 20th Century Fox is working on a movie based on the 1980s book series Choose Your Own Adventure. “But wait”, you’re saying. “Movies are definitive statements by a collection of creatively and technically gifted people. The very medium of film itself simply does not lend itself to storytelling as open-ended and audience-informed as a Choose Your Own Adventure book.” Well, think again. The big selling point of the Choose Your Own Adventure movie is that you really will be able to choose your own adventure. While the film is screening, movie audiences will be invited to use an app called CtrlMovie at certain junctures, letting them control the outcome thanks to a link-up with the cinema’s digital projector. Depending on audience preferences, the film will have different plots, endings and runtimes every time it’s shown. Picture this: our hero is cornered. To the left, his arch enemies, closing in fast. To his right, a squadron of police officers, guns trained on his head. Above him, a rickety fire escape. Below him, an open manhole. The tension couldn’t be higher. But, hang on, here’s a big flashing sign onscreen telling you to pull out your phone, unlock it, open an app, press a button and hope that the majority of the audience feels the same way you do. The moment is broken, the outcome unsatisfactory and now everyone’s dicking around on their phones in the cinema. This is literally the worst moviegoing experience of your life. That said, as objectively hideous as Choose Your Own Adventure sounds in a communal setting, it might just find a life on home entertainment. Because at home, you don’t have to rely on finding consensus with a roomful of the sort of mouthbreathers who’d willing pay to watch a Choose Your Own Adventure film on opening weekend. You get to be in charge of the experience. You can experiment with different choices at different times, just as you did with the Choose Your Own Adventure books all those years ago. Plus it’s your house, so playing on your phone isn’t the most hideous act of rudeness that anyone could imagine. In fact, it wouldn’t even be the first time that something like this had been attempted. Twenty years ago, Aftermath Media released a movie called Tender Loving Care. The film itself was a terrible psychological thriller about a berserk nurse, but at certain points John Hurt would appear onscreen and psychologically profile you. You’d answer a set of questions and, depending on your answers, you’d be shown different scenes. Some of them – and it’s not ideal that this was the film’s biggest selling point – had nudity. Nobody remembers Tender Loving Care now. And that’s not just because it was an objectively terrible film, or because John Hurt’s psychoanalysis was much clunkier than a swipe of an app. It was because literally nobody wants an interactive film. If you want to be in control of your destiny, fine, go and play Grand Theft Auto. But when you see a film, you want to see the results of thousands of painstaking decisions presented in exactly the way its creator intended. To see a film is to put your faith in writers, directors and performers; not the gurgling, 14-year-old dipstick sitting two rows behind you who threw his popcorn in the air at a Transformers trailer.

Don’t come back till St Leger day.” The theory is that with the Test matches, Wimbledon, Royal Ascot and Henley – and maybe even a family holiday – the City gets deserted over the summer. Trading volumes therefore dwindle and any falls in the stock market are exaggerated. The line is so old that even some of the City’s ripest pros can’t recall when they first started trotting it out, with one academic study even claiming it can be traced all the way back to 1694 (although presumably only the first bit, as the St Leger began in 1776). Anyway, the expression represents a throwback to the time when the gentleman stockbroker would grab the billycock and umbrella, nip out of the office for a spring luncheon, and only consider returning to work once the summer’s sport had been concluded with the classic race in Doncaster, which is typically run on the second Saturday in September. All most agreeable. But the “sell in May” line is a rare thing in the crowded field of City platitudes, in that while it is clearly self-serving (an obvious excuse for bunking off work, dressed up as investment advice) there might also be something in it for the client. First, it throws up the pleasing idea that investors can replace their broker with a calendar. And second, if stockbrokers are out of the office, the damage they can inflict on portfolios should be reduced, thereby allowing punters to enjoy their own summers. Third, unlike a lot of the City’s advice, it is not guaranteed to lose you money. Granted, betting that the FTSE will fall between May and September tends to fail more often than it succeeds. While “sell in May” supporters would argue that the winnings from the years in which the punt has come off have outpaced the losses from the summers when it went wrong over the past decade, those figures are skewed: in 2008, the stock market slumped by around 800 points. Still, there are slightly more technical-sounding reasons why “sell in May” might sometimes work. Some reckon it relates to when dividends are paid, while others have argued it is all to do with the times of the year at which companies tend to raise money and issue shares. For this they need to announce either a profit forecast or a profit figure, so the natural timing for an issue is at the time of the company’s results – which, companies’ accounting years being what they are, congregate between March and May. But the most likely explanation for stock market moves during the summer seems to be more prosaic: that is, events. And, this year, some reckon the stars are aligned for a fall. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at financial spread betting group City Index, says: “While the FTSE’s average returns over the past 30 years for the five-and-a-half months to St Leger day are rather uninspiring, this year could see the ‘sell in May’ adage ring true. The Bank of England is looking increasingly less likely to hike rates in May, but a rise prior to mid-September is a high probability. This, combined with increased clarity over Brexit through the summer, could see the pound rally: and given the FTSE’s inverse relationship with sterling, Britain’s top share index could well be in for a tough couple of months. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions could also flare up again.” All of which sounds like bad news for the City workers this summer: they may have to show up for work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/27/five-inmates-die-in-seven-weeks-at-hmp-birmingham-run-by-g4s","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T14:35:04Z","webTitle":"Five inmates die in seven weeks at HMP Birmingham run by G4S","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/27/five-inmates-die-in-seven-weeks-at-hmp-birmingham-run-by-g4s","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/27/five-inmates-die-in-seven-weeks-at-hmp-birmingham-run-by-g4s","fields":{"headline":"Five inmates die in seven weeks at HMP Birmingham run by G4S","bodyText":"Five inmates have died in the space of seven weeks at Birmingham’s outsourced prison, the latest of them allegedly killing himself in a week in which the Prison Officers Association and the Howard League for Penal Reform have warned of a prison system in crisis. Marcus McGuire, 35, was found dead in his cell on HMP Birmingham’s D-wing at aabout 9am on Tuesday, the Birmingham Mail reported. The prison, run by G4S, is reportedly facing two improvement orders from the Ministry of Justice, addressing its levels of violence, hygiene standards and inmate care and treatment, including reducing self-harm. The prison’s director, Rob Kellett, said investigations into the deaths were under way and declined to comment on the specific cases except to say they were unrelated. While it has the highest number of deaths in absolute terms, HMP Birmingham is one of the country’s biggest prisons. It does not appear to have been the scene of an unusual spate of self-inflicted deaths, such as happened last year at HMP Nottingham or HMP Wood Hill. On Thursday, POA warned of a “crisis that has been created in the prison service”, citing a big fall in the number of officers since 2010 and soaring rates of self-harm, assaults and hospital attendances by inmates. Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said figures released on Thursday showing a record high number of assaults in prisons were a “symptom of a prison system in crisis”. Four inmates were found dead at HMP Birmingham in March. John Delahaye was found dead in his cell on 5 March in a suspected suicide, days before he was due to stand trial for allegedly stabbing churchgoers in Aston, Birmingham. Ricardo Holgate, 35, a convicted rapist, was found dead on 26 March, reportedly from a suspected overdose of a synthetic cannabinoid. Andrew Carr, 23, was found dead on 29 or 30 March after reportedly taking drugs smuggled via the toilet into his cell in the prison’s segregation unit, where there is supposed to be heightened security. Neil Black, 34, died on 31 March, apparently from natural causes. Inquest, a charity that investigates deaths in custody, reported a further death at Birmingham earlier in the year, bringing the total so far in 2018 to six. It is understood the first death was from natural causes. Birmingham has the highest number of deaths of any prison in the year to date, followed by Manchester and Durham with four each and Lindholme with three, according to research by Inquest. Kellett said: “Every death in custody is a tragedy and is always thoroughly investigated by the prisons and probation ombudsman. While the recent deaths at HMP Birmingham are believed to be unrelated events, investigations are ongoing and it would not be appropriate to comment further. “We are absolutely committed to providing a good standard of accommodation and purposeful activity, and the safety of our staff, partners and those in our custody is our first priority. Where room for improvement is identified we work closely with the Ministry of Justice to agree appropriate steps.” The MoJ improvement notices were issued in March, before the recent spate of deaths. A Prison Service spokesperson said: “We are clear that prisons should be places of safety and reform, and are working closely with G4S to improve conditions for prisoners at HMP Birmingham.” On Thursday Steve Gillan, general secretary of the POA, sent an open letter to David Gauke, the justice secretary, accusing him of misleading the public by hailing the recruitment of 2,500 new prison officers. The letter pointed out that even with the latest increase, the Prison Service remained 3,789 officers down since 2010. “So the increase since October 2016 does not reflect the destruction to the service caused by austerity measures,” he wrote. Gillan referred to safety in custody data, published by the MoJ the same day, that showed incidents of self-harm had increased by 11.2% in the year to December 2017, compared with the previous 12 months, from 40,160 to 44,651, and by 65.6% since 2010. Assault incidents had more than doubled in the past eight years and serious assaults had nearly trebled in the same period, the letter pointed out. “These latest figures are nothing short of a scandal and ministers and employers must take responsibility instead of burying their heads in the sand and pretending a recruitment campaign is going to resolve this clear crisis that has been created by poor policy decisions,” Gillan said. Kellett said every death in custody was a tragedy, adding: “While the recent deaths at HMP Birmingham are believed to be unrelated events, investigations are ongoing and it would not be appropriate to comment further.” Kellett, who took charge of the prison in February, praised the work of the staff and added that they “work tirelessly to detect, intercept and confiscate contraband.” “Since taking charge of HMP Birmingham in February, I have seen at firsthand the great job that our dedicated staff and partners do every day in challenging circumstances,” he said. “The safety of our staff, partners and those in our custody is our first priority. Where room for improvement is identified we work closely with the Ministry of Justice to agree appropriate steps.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/27/kinship-carer-benefits-policy-scrapped-after-court-ruling","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T14:59:27Z","webTitle":"Kinship carer benefits policy scrapped after court ruling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/27/kinship-carer-benefits-policy-scrapped-after-court-ruling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/27/kinship-carer-benefits-policy-scrapped-after-court-ruling","fields":{"headline":"Kinship carer benefits policy scrapped after court ruling","bodyText":"The government has scrapped its policy of withholding benefits from kinship carers who fall foul of the two-child limit after having a child of their own. The U-turn by the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, on Friday comes a week after a high court judge ruled that the policy as it applied to carers who look after younger siblings to prevent them from being taken into care was “perverse and unlawful”. The decision was welcomed by campaigners, who said ministers had “seen sense” after resisting for more than two years calls to exempt kinship carers from the two-child limit. Ministers promised in 2016, after a defeat in the House of Lords, that kinship carers would not be penalised by the two-child limit. However, in practice it emerged that the exemption was only for carers who had children first and then became guardian to a third child, not the other way around. Since the two-child limit came into force in April 2017, growing numbers of low-income carers – who have been praised in the past by ministers as “unsung heroes” – have lost more than £3,000 in tax credits and maternity grant entitlements as a result of the policy. Cathy Ashley, the chief executive of Family Rights Group, said: “This is extremely welcome news. Kinship carers and adopters should never have been affected by the two-child limit on child tax credit and it’s a great shame that the government wasted money fighting this in the courts. I’m very pleased that they have now seen sense.” McVey said she had decided to extend support to all kinship carers after “reviewing the issue carefully” for several months. “Adoptive parents and non-parental carers, known as ‘kinship carers’, have often stepped in to help a family member or close friend in times of need. They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need. “The role these parents play in helping to bring up these children is invaluable, and I want to reassure such parents that this change ensures support will be made available to you, and this government is backing you.” The Labour MP Melanie Onn said: “The government has been brought kicking and screaming to act in accordance with its own legislation by last Friday’s ruling from the high court. Despite eight months of my campaigning in parliament, the government had deaf ears and McVey had to be forced to this U-turn. She had no intention of doing the right thing.” Despite the change, the same partial exemption rules remain in place for women who had a first or second child as a result of rape. They will be deemed to have breached the two-child limit and be denied benefits if they have a third child. Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, welcomed the kinship care decision, but said she hoped it would be followed by a decision to exempt all children conceived as a result of non-consensual sex. Last week’s ruling by Mr Justice Ouseley said the way the exemption was applied differentially to kinship carer households defeated its purpose, which was “to encourage, or at least avoid discouraging, a family from looking after a child who would otherwise be in local authority care”. Making the exemption available only if the cared-for child was not the first or second child was, he said, “not rationally connected with the purposes of the legislation, and indeed it is in conflict with them”. Kinship carers continue to fall foul of other welfare reforms, including the benefit cap and the bedroom tax, and do not receive the same rights and allowances due to foster carers and adoptive parents, including paid employment leave while the child is settling in. Children move into kinship care for a variety of reasons, including parents’ death or illness, addiction and imprisonment. An estimated 200,000 children in the UK are raised by kinship carers, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds that would otherwise be spent on care home or fostering fees. Last year the Guardian highlighted the case of Alyssa Vessey, then 22, of Grimsby, who was 18 when she agreed with social services to give up college to formally raise her three younger siblings after the sudden death of their mother. Vessey was denied child tax credits worth £2,750 a year and a £500 SureStart maternity grant when she conceived a child of her own last year because the DWP ruled that her siblings counted towards the household two-child limit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/27/southampton-bournemouth-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T12:38:38Z","webTitle":"Southampton v Bournemouth: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/27/southampton-bournemouth-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/27/southampton-bournemouth-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Southampton v Bournemouth: match preview","bodyText":"Southampton’s situation remains dire but there is still a potential escape route open to Mark Hughes’s side.

Labour needs radical local councillors","bodyText":"Paul Dennett was elected mayor of Salford in May 2016. Dennett, a former councillor whose political hero is the Jewish socialist stalwart and housing crusader Frank Allaun, campaigned for Jeremy Corbyn in both leadership elections, believing a change of direction was not only desirable but necessary for Labour. Overseeing a budget of £200m, Dennett’s administrative philosophy is that free market capitalism is failing people from all walks of life – but particularly in his poverty-stricken city – and if the government won’t help people then Labour local authorities will step in. Under his leadership, Salford council has been something of a local government inspiration, giving its care workers a 10.7% pay rise, building new libraries, and tackling the housing crisis head-on by building the first council houses in Salford in over 30 years. With less than a week to go before local elections in cities across England give Labour the chance to take power from Conservatives on councils such as Trafford in Greater Manchester and Wandsworth in London, this is exactly the kind of inspiration Labour campaigners need. While critics of Labour’s current leadership sometimes take a strange sort of comfort in the notion that once those advocating bold change in Britain take power, they will suddenly become “realistic”, understanding that “pragmatism” and stodgy governance is the only navigable way forward, the opposite is true. Candidates including Paul Dennett lose none of their radicalism when they are elected. Take another example: Preston. Since 2011, Preston city council’s grant has been virtually halved. An austerity budget of £18m has destroyed the city’s social infrastructure, with community work, park maintenance and local community centres falling under the axe. Preston was struggling – and fell into the bottom 20% of the multiple deprivation index. But under cabinet member Matthew Brown’s cautious but radical economic guidance, the council made good use of a 2013 act that allows public institutions in England to consider the social, economic and environmental impact of their contracting and commissioning. Lucrative contracts, often reserved for multinational firms, were given to local businesses, co-operatives and farmers, with the justification that the social value is greater if produced locally. The results were positive. Local investment doubled. The local constabulary, small businesses, sixth-form colleges and housing associations all signed up to help reorganise their supply chains to benefit local businesses. This has allowed everything from farmers, family building trades and artists’ co-operatives to thrive in Preston, and in 2016 the city was named as the best place in north-west England to live and work. You could name hundreds of people up and down the country like Dennett and Brown. From the grafting socialist Mo Hitchcock in Portsmouth to community activist Catherine Donovan in Newcastle, there are scores of prospective Labour councillors dedicated to not merely sitting in a council chamber, but coming up with innovative, radical measures to tackle the fractures in British society. These are the kinds of activists that we in Momentum intend to train, encourage and develop – not only before they become elected representatives, but after. By doing so, we aim to make sure they do not slip into the demoralisation too easily brought about by the ravages of Tory budget cuts. Participants in training sessions explore the idea of power, where it lies within our communities and councils. They map their local communities and the issues affecting local residents and explore how to run winnable, community-based campaigns. Our network will also teach councillors how to organise – from supporting tenants unions to take on unscrupulous landlords to setting up food co-ops to tackle food poverty. Councillors can be the pillars of their communities, and the focal organising point for protest against the harm this government is doing. If we are truly going to transform Britain for the many, and not the few, we need a whole new layer of Labour councillors embedded in communities and committed to an overhaul. In the past few years, we have seen that the old politics is increasingly unacceptable to millions of people. Our work is all about ensuring that Labour councillors aren’t waiting for change to arrive from on high, but building socialism from below. • Beth Foster-Ogg is Momentum’s national training organiser"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/29/lidl-will-bring-wee-jag-of-reality-to-giffnock","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T05:00:35Z","webTitle":"Lidl will bring a wee jag of reality to the good burghers of Giffnock | Kevin McKenna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/lidl-will-bring-wee-jag-of-reality-to-giffnock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/29/lidl-will-bring-wee-jag-of-reality-to-giffnock","fields":{"headline":"Lidl will bring a wee jag of reality to the good burghers of Giffnock","bodyText":"If the great American soul poet Gil Scott-Heron had cared to update one of his classic works he might have changed it to: “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised… But It Might Start In The Lidl Store At Giffnock.” This sanctimonious wee neighbourhood lies a few miles south of Glasgow and has always had a good opinion of itself. Yet it too has encountered challenges. One of these occurred last year, with the news that the Whole Foods shop was to shut. I’ve only once shopped in Whole Foods, a dispiriting and intimidating experience that I vowed never to repeat. The first rule on entering a branch is to estimate your normal weekly shopping bill and then add 50%. In exchange, shoppers experience an initial warm glow that arises from the knowledge that they are about to embark on a search for comestibles previously unheard of in the then known Greater Glasgow area. The shop, before its untimely demise, described itself as an “eco-minded chain” purveying “natural and organic grocery items”. It’s not that the shop itself was particularly unpleasant or off-putting (the staff were delightful and all that) – it’s just that, well, I felt that I didn’t really belong there, or that I might have done if I’d first participated in a two-year training course. I’d never heard of the existence of a naturally gluten-free pancake and waffle almond flour mix or of a Kashi Organic Honey Toasted Cereal and Nature’s Path Kamut Puffs. I was actually tempted to put them in my basket and then take a selfie with them. I’m sure they could have named this The Kim Kardashian section. And nine quid for a bag of nuts – I know places in Glasgow where you can buy a monkey for less than that. The esteemed Scottish lifestyle journalist Anna Burnside once did shifts with me on the sports desk of Scotland on Sunday and introduced me to the ethereal wonder of the alfalfa and cashew crepe. Halfway round my Whole Foods odyssey, I was tempted to call her to solicit her tactical advice. When Whole Foods shut, there was widespread consternation in Giffnock, which was understandable for this also marked the disappearance of its distinctive shopping bags that conferred a distinctive social status. The sadness that greeted Whole Foods’ closure turned into outright panic when it was revealed last week that it was to be replaced by Lidl, the kenspeckle German discount specialists. Judging by the reaction of some in this South Side community, you’d have thought that planning permission had been granted for a public lavatory in their back gardens. Social media was awash with contumely and resentment. “We Giffnock residents that truly believe in our community should petition this injustice to our local MSPs. If you want to keep Giffnock’s reputation of prosperity then we need action to stop this. If I wanted cut-price, poor-quality goods I would travel to a poor-quality neighbourhood to find them.” Others spoke of their fear that the presence of Lidl would attract “vermin”. Giffnock isn’t a very attractive place. It’s a featureless and unremarkable stretch of real estate dominated by bungalows and red sandstone domiciles. It boasts of having Pollok Park nearby, but that doesn’t really belong to them. It has very few pubs and will never feature on anyone’s list of top 10,000 places containing anything remotely interesting. What it does have is two very high-achieving state secondary schools that attract those Glaswegians whose social aspirations outstrip their financial ability to pay for a private education. It is surrounded by golf clubs. I love the prospect of future captains of these places being the sort of people they think might shop at Lidl. There is a reason why the swinging lifestyle is reportedly thriving in places such as this: the cost of maintaining the appearance of affluence leaves very little for any paid entertainment at the end of the week. Of course, many normal people live in Giffnock and send their children to these schools and won’t be seeking counselling at the prospect of a Lidl opening. My former colleague Ms Burnside is now also the Daily Record’s restaurant critic and I rarely venture into any supermarket without consulting her latest wisdom in matters pertaining to food. This is what she had to say about Lidl: “I love food – reading about it, writing about it, cooking it, eating it. And I buy about 80% of what I eat from Lidl. They sell just about everything I buy on a regular basis: avocados; big bags of spinach; halloumi; pink grapefruit; fantastic steaks; all 40% cheaper than the mainstream supermarkets.” The avocados, halloumi and pink grapefruit are probably still a little too exotic for my untutored palate but, well… you get the gist. Giffnock will not be diminished by the presence of Lidl but thoroughly enriched. A neighbourhood so lacking in colour and drama could do with a wee jag of reality and vibrancy. In time, I hope to see some tanning salons and 24-hour car-wash emporiums and perhaps some outlets of the Betfred and Paddy Power. In the meantime, a special helpline is available to Giffnock residents who are having trouble coming to terms with the presence of their new neighbours. The operators promise to speak nicely and inquire about your Japanese bobtail kitten and your bonsai. • Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/27/andres-iniesta-barcelona-leave-end-of-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T12:12:11Z","webTitle":"Andrés Iniesta in tears as he confirms Barcelona exit at end of season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/27/andres-iniesta-barcelona-leave-end-of-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/27/andres-iniesta-barcelona-leave-end-of-season","fields":{"headline":"Andrés Iniesta in tears as he confirms Barcelona exit at end of season","bodyText":"Andrés Iniesta has announced he will leave Barcelona at the end of the season.

As broadcaster, producer, journalist, author, curator and moderator, it’s what you do. But this is different. For starters, I have to get dressed first. Until now, I’ve read mostly in bed, in the morning, my brain fresh and rested, instead of the way most people do: exhausted, at the end of the day, for barely 15 minutes before the book falls from their hand. Now I have a reason to get up – as the inaugural reader-in-residence at the state library of New South Wales, that imposing set of buildings in Sydney facing on to both Macquarie Street and the Domain, via the Mitchell wing, whose massive doors feature remarkable scenes of Aboriginal life and deserve closer scrutiny. (I make a mental note to find out more about them from the Indigenous services team.) • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon I’ve been given the keys (actually a swipe card that prompts a cheery tune) to a kingdom and invited to play, explore and discover. Access all areas. Well, almost. But first, I have to try not to get lost – the library is a veritable labyrinth, a maze of corridors beneath Macquarie Street. I am tempted to leave crumbs from the Fellows room, where I sit, so I can find my way back. A quick first browse – guided by the encyclopedically knowledgable Maggie Patton, manager of research and discovery – yields instant, serendipitous treasure: the Robbins collection of stage magic. It comprises 900 books, catalogues and pamphlets full of trade secrets, intended exclusively for the eyes of professional illusionists and conjurers. The collection includes 15 years’ worth of issues of Abracadabra, (“the only magical weekly in the world”), manuals on hypnotism, tricks using doves and – I kid you not – one featuring “magic with livestock”. I select a book from the shelves only to discover it had been signed, with a flourish, by none other than Harry Houdini. Moments like these make my scalp tingle. Randomly exploring the stack, as the miles of book shelving storage are known, I come across a 19th-century cookbook with endpapers that show exactly where on a formal dining table each dish should be placed, their positions as formally choreographed as those of the guests: roast pheasant at the head, then “crow fish in savery [sic] jelly”, “pickled smelts” and “stewed cardoons”, and in the centre, something called “transparent pudding covered with a silver web”, followed by “collard pig”. There are surprising objects here too. “Oh that’s Patrick White’s nanny’s trunk,” says Patton offhandedly. With its barrel-shaped lid, it looks like the kind of thing you would expect a coachman in a TV adaptation of a Dickens novel to hoist on to a horse-drawn carriage for an orphan or governess. “We also have hair,” says Patton, promising to show me locks and curls belonging to Henry Lawson, Eleanor Dark and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. For now I am still trying to absorb the vocabulary of this unfamiliar universe: square archive boxes for the storage of newspapers are known as “pizza boxes”; objects, as opposed to works on paper, are called “realia”. In the bowels of the library’s conservation department, they make glue every Monday morning and forensically repair books that have been damaged by time, moisture and pests. Extractors keep the air as free of dust as possible. The silence is one of intense focus and concentration. Along the hallway, there is a massive machine from Switzerland called Gunnar, equipped with special software that makes archival boxes for precious items being loaned to other institutions. It sits in a room with a giant guillotine that slices card for mounts. Upstairs is another secret world: the DX (short for digital experience) Lab, where brilliant innovators and visiting artists come up with cool interactive ways of seeing the library’s collection of artefacts. Meridian shows us how fragile 17th and 18th-century maps normally kept under lock and key would have looked to cartographers back then; the project brings them to life as gorgeous 3D globes, gently spinning on screen. Here too there are new words, as well as worlds, to discover: these precious items are made up of “gores” and “calottes” – technical terms for the materials from which the spheres were originally cut. In the foyer near Cafe Trim (named after Matthew Flinders’ cat and not intended as a dietary recommendation) the DX team have installed a vending library (a play on the term “lending library”) that uses a Twitter bot to suggest a personalised item from the collection to users. Not surprisingly, children adore watching it dispense cards. This and other multisensory projects being developed by the DX Lab make my brain fizz with possibility. And what am I doing here? Part catalyst, part ambassador, I am truffling through the archives, finding fresh ways to extract the marrow of the collection and share it with wider audiences via a blog, events and collaborations with the incredible team of curators here, who perhaps don’t always remember that they are the essential human component that makes this a mind-expanding hub for the whole city and the state. For too many people, the library is just a bunch of archives. They may not realise that it is not just preserving the past and the present but creating the future. Last week I met a smart young lawyer who works just around the corner. She had plenty of curiosity and was a keen reader, but confessed that she had never set foot inside the building. Making her want to is my challenge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/03/pre-eclampsia-blood-test-melbourne-hospital-helps-develop-world-first","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T05:21:44Z","webTitle":"Pre-eclampsia blood test: Melbourne hospital helps develop world-first","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/pre-eclampsia-blood-test-melbourne-hospital-helps-develop-world-first","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/pre-eclampsia-blood-test-melbourne-hospital-helps-develop-world-first","fields":{"headline":"Pre-eclampsia blood test: Melbourne hospital helps develop world-first","bodyText":"A world-first blood test that can help predict the potentially deadly pregnancy condition pre-eclampsia is being introduced at Melbourne’s Royal Women’s hospital. The hospital helped develop the blood test, which predicts the likelihood of pregnant women developing the condition. About one in 20 pregnant women experience pre-eclampsia, which leads to dangerously high blood pressure in a pregnant woman and can involve kidneys, liver, brain and other organ systems. It accounts for about 15% of the maternal morbidity rate. There is no cure for pre-eclampsia, the hospital’s director of pregnancy research, Prof Shaun Brennecke, said. “Currently, the only way to cure pre-eclampsia is to end the pregnancy by delivering the baby, even if the pregnancy is still many weeks from full term, in which case such prematurity can have significant implications for the long-term health of the baby,” he said. Under trial conditions, the blood test allowed doctors to test women who showed symptoms that could suggest pre-eclampsia, including high blood pressure, headaches and nausea, and distinguish which were at high risk of contracting the condition and which were not. The trial results found that a negative result on the test meant a woman would have a 99% chance of not developing pre-eclampsia over the next week and a 95% chance of not developing it over the next four weeks. The results of the trial were published in 2017. Brennecke said the test would give doctors the ability to understand the severity of the pre-eclampsia and the best time to deliver the baby. “This new test is a long-awaited and very important step forward,” he said. Hannah Torres developed pre-eclampsia in the late stages of her pregnancy with her son Mateo and had to spend a week in critical care after his birth. “I didn’t realise until afterwards just how serious it was and what complications it can cause,” she said. “Knowing that for future pregnancies I can have a test to tell me if I’m at risk of developing it again, I think that’s wonderful.” The cause of pre-eclampsia is unknown. Women at higher risk include those having their first baby, those with a history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, women under 20 and over 40 and those having twins or multiple babies. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have a higher risk of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders, including pre-eclampsia, because of an increased prevalence of chronic high blood pressure, kidney disease, diabetes and other risk factors. If left untreated, it can cause the mother to develop liver or kidney failure, seizures, stroke and death. In the baby it can lead to slower growth in the womb, a low birth weight, premature birth and, in some cases, death.

Ever since 17 March 2018, when Carole Cadwalladr broke Christopher Wylie’s whistleblower story at the Observer and in the New York Times, there have been continuous revelations about Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, and their brazen use – or misuse – of Facebook data and dirty tricks. But given the complex business structure of SCL and Cambridge Analytica’s UK and US affiliates, there are reasons to question precisely what Wednesday’s announcement means. Already there are some suggestions that those associated with Cambridge Analytica may re-emerge in another form. Are Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group attempting to evade recent negative coverage, only to re-form and continue their work as part of a new entity? Damian Collins, the British MP who chairs the digital, culture, media and sport Committee that is investigating SCL and Cambridge Analytica, tweeted some words of caution on Wednesday after the news broke, noting that CA and SCL “cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing”. Certainly the news presents as many questions as answers. Cambridge Analytica and SCL have at least 18 active companies, branches, and affiliates with similar names, based in the UK and the US. The complex relationship among these companies makes it very difficult to understand how revenues, employment, and data are shared. It almost seems as though the business structure was created to make it impossible to track decision-making and funding. On Wednesday afternoon Cambridge Analytica issued a press release stating: “SCL Elections Ltd., as well as certain of its and Cambridge Analytica LLC’s U.K. affiliates (collectively, the ‘Company’ or ‘Cambridge Analytica’) filed applications to commence insolvency proceedings in the U.K.” It also stated that “parallel bankruptcy proceedings will soon be commenced on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC and certain of the Company’s U.S. affiliates in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.” It is notable that Cambridge Analytica’s press release does not mention SCL Group Limited, SCL Social Ltd, or SCL Insight Ltd. Is it closing only some affiliates and leaving others open? Shortly after the whistleblower story on Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook data broke in March, the Cambridge Analytica CEO, Alexander Nix, was suspended and three US states opened investigations into Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. In the following weeks, current and past employees of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified in the UK, the US, Canada and other countries, and a US and UK class action lawsuit was filed against both companies in early April. However, reporting on Cambridge Analytica – from Cadwalladr and others – had begun to appear in 2015 and 2016 and intensified throughout 2017. While Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group began to be the focus of more media scrutiny, in the background, company executives were quietly setting up a new company. Emerdata Limited was incorporated in August 2017 with SCL Group’s chairman, Julian Wheatland, and SCL’s chief data officer, Alexander Tayler, as original owners, but the company suddenly expanded with new directors and funding this year. On 23 January 2018, four new directors were appointed to Emerdata, including Johnson Chun Shun Ko, who happens to be deputy chairman of Frontier Services Group. On the same day that Ko joined the board of Emerdata, shares were issued valued at £1,912,502. On 7 March 2018, Firecrest Technologies Limited was incorporated, with Alexander Nix listed briefly as director and then replaced by Alexander Tayler, and Emerdata listed as the owner. And on 16 March, a few days before the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower story broke, two more directors joined Emerdata, Jennifer and Rebekah Mercer. There has been much reporting on how Robert and Rebekah Mercer have funded US political action committees (Pacs) that have paid Cambridge Analytica, but there had been little public evidence showing a current legal or business connection from the Mercers to Cambridge Analytica. The business purpose of Emerdata is not known, beyond the general description of “data processing, hosting and related activities”. However, in a Channel 4 News report, the SCL Group founder, Nigel Oakes, said it was his understanding that Emerdata was set up to acquire all of Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Emerdata did not respond to multiple requests for comment sent to several company directors. The news Wednesday about the closure of Cambridge Analytica does not mention Emerdata or its subsidiary Firecrest Technologies. And just one day earlier, on Tuesday, the UK Companies House website posted an update on Emerdata, noting two pending filings, for “Resolution of removal of pre-emption rights” and “Resolution of allotment of securities”. The documents are being processed and will be available in five days. Perhaps these filings will show that the company is dissolving, or perhaps they will be the standard filings of an active company. All of the other UK SCL-related companies are still listed as active and have no pending filings. The beleaguered Nix is still listed as an active director and shareholder of SCL Group and many of the related companies. Wednesday’s news is big, but it is not clear yet what it means, and whether SCL, Cambridge Analytica, Emerdata and the same executives who ran these companies during the Brexit campaign and US election will re-emerge in a new entity to continue their work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/03/flashing-lights-seven-point-tries-and-rolling-subs-its-world-series-rugby","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T09:03:09Z","webTitle":"Flashing lights, seven-point tries and rolling subs – it’s World Series Rugby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/03/flashing-lights-seven-point-tries-and-rolling-subs-its-world-series-rugby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/03/flashing-lights-seven-point-tries-and-rolling-subs-its-world-series-rugby","fields":{"headline":"Flashing lights, seven-point tries and rolling subs – it’s World Series Rugby","bodyText":"A new tournament starts in Australia on Friday. Called World Series Rugby, it will involve matches played by Western Force in Perth, which was dropped as one of the country’s super rugby sides at the end of last season, against the three Pacific islands, Hong Kong, the Rebels and the Crusaders. It was devised by Andrew Forrest, the Force’s billionaire backer, who anticipates that next year the series will largely include sides from Asia. World Rugby has given its approval for a series of law changes to be adopted with the aim of speeding up the game. The changes include rolling substitutions, up to 12 for each side; one minute for a scrum to be completed otherwise the team considered responsible for holding up play will be penalised; lineouts taken when the throwing team is ready, regardless of whether a line has been formed; and a power try worth seven points, with another potential two from the conversion, will be awarded if the continuous move starts in the scoring team’s 22. A green light on the goal posts will flash if a power try is on. The aim is to stimulate the game in Australia where grounds for Super Rugby matches are often only one-quarter full and the club scene is flat. Rugby union facing an extinction crisis in Sydney ran a headline this week and if Perth is hardly a union city, it is far from alone. The belief is that non-rugby followers could be enticed if games contain more action and fewer of the game’s arcane rituals, like scrummaging and competing for the ball in a lineout. The more tries the better, although how many points will a side score if a move starts outside its 22, from a scrum or a line-out say, but the ball is passed backwards into it before the decisive break is made? The vast majority of the law changes in recent years have had two central themes: to increase the time the ball is in play and to promote player welfare, but the first has compromised the second. A Rugby Football Union review a few weeks into this season showed the rate of injuries in the Premiership had increased on the previous year because the increased time the ball was in play meant an increase in the number of tackles being made, the area responsible for the majority of injuries. “The attacking side is getting more of the ball because the contact area is virtually not being challenged but facing a greater number of defenders, and we are therefore seeing more tackles,” said the RFU’s director of professional rugby, Nigel Melville. “The increase in tackles is significant as it involves ‘double tackles’ and with greater line speed. And we found last year that it was not the tackled player that predominantly was injured but the tackler.” With the aim of the Perth series to keep the ball in play for longer, expect there to be more tackles and more injuries. The game will move further away from being a contest for possession to one where players smash into each other, no longer a refuge for all shapes and sizes. Australia are not known for placing a premium on scrummaging, but the maximum 60-second affair runs the danger of turning it into a rugby league set-piece, put the ball in and away. Similarly with the line-out: throw in when the opposition are not ready and there is no tussle for possession, nor time for players to get a breather. They will have to wait for a pause in play for injury, although no doubt there will be calls for a rolling substitute to be brought on when a player is down so play can continue and not count as one of the 12. Forrest says that next year’s series will see 10-point tries and set a time-limit on lineouts as well as scrums. How long before both set-pieces are canned and the game moves almost as far away from its roots as the new 100-ball cricket tournament planned in England and Wales? Rugby by name rather than nature, a dumbing down. It is far easier to look at ways of promoting “entertainment” by squeezing features that make union distinct rather than trying to address the central problem of how to create space on the field so that players are not continually clattering into each other from the first minute to last. Not a word about player safety in Perth, but the way the sport is going with each round of league and cup matches scarred by long-term injuries, it could face a class action down the line from players who reach middle age and find that they are unable to work because various parts of their bodies have broken down. Concussion is not the only issue. World Rugby had little choice to approve the law changes with countries like Australia and Scotland, who from 2019-20 will be launching a Super 6 competition to help bridge the gap between club and professional rugby, looking for a stimulus; but it needs to tread warily and not be blindly led by commercial interests. • This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

The grisly discovery was made earlier this week after a worker at the Core Shopping Centre in Calgary was called in to fix a toilet that wouldn’t flush. After removing the wall panel behind the toilet, he found a body belonging to an adult male. On Wednesday Calgary police did not name the victim, identifying him only as a male in his 20s. He had entered the women’s washroom on Friday evening – some three days before his body was found – and was believed to have been alone at the time, police said. They said the man likely climbed on top of a pony wall – a short two-metre wall used to hide utilities – which sat directly behind the toilets. The man then removed a vent cover on top of the pony wall, police believe. “Based on evidence at the scene, officers believe the victim then climbed inside the pony wall through the vent opening where he became stuck and later died,” police said in a statement. “The victim’s motivation for crawling inside the wall is unknown at this time.” Police said they had ruled out the possibility of foul play. As the victim’s death is considered accidental, they added that they would not be releasing any further details regarding the incident. After the body was discovered earlier this week, fire crews and police arrived at the shopping centre to investigate, taping off sections of the food court as mall-goers dined metres away. Provincial medical examiners removed the body from the scene hours later and an autopsy was scheduled for Tuesday. Speaking to the Calgary Herald, the shopping centre said the employee who found the body had been offered counselling services and time off in order “to deal with whatever he may be going through”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/03/nra-convention-dallas-parkland-victim-guns","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T17:43:54Z","webTitle":"Parkland victim's father to join weekend protest against NRA in Dallas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/03/nra-convention-dallas-parkland-victim-guns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/03/nra-convention-dallas-parkland-victim-guns","fields":{"headline":"Parkland victim's father to join weekend protest against NRA in Dallas","bodyText":"A year ago, Manuel Oliver thought his family had achieved the American dream. His daughter had graduated from high school in Florida. His son was close to graduating, full of plans for the great things he wanted to do. More than a decade after emigrating from Venezuela, the Olivers had become American citizens. Then, on Valentine’s Day this year, his son, 17-year-old Joaquin, was murdered in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida. This weekend, as an estimated 80,000 National Rifle Association supporters gather in Dallas for their annual meeting celebrating gun rights, Oliver and other survivors of gun violence will be gathering too. Local Dallas students are organizing a counter-protest one street away from the convention center where NRA members will listen to Donald Trump again pledge his loyalty to gun rights’ advocates. Oliver will be painting a new protest mural in Dallas to honor his son, one in a series of what he is calling “Walls of Demand” that he has assembled in different cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Springfield, Massachusetts, near headquarters of Smith &amp; Wesson, the gun company that manufactured the military-style rifle used in the Parkland shooting. Gun control advocates are protesting in front of city hall, rather than at the convention center where NRA members gather, because “we’re not against NRA members – we’re against the leadership of the NRA,” said Waed Alhayek, 19, a senior at University of Texas Arlington, and the executive director of StudentsMarch.org, which is organizing the rally. “We’re not going after every single NRA member.” Alhayek was only seven when she was held at gunpoint in a neighborhood store in Detroit, Michigan, and then watched police officers confront the robber in the store and shoot him to make him drop his gun. “My whole life, I’ve watched tragedy after tragedy happen, and I’ve waited for politicians to do something to create change,” she said. “The city of Dallas is for the people, not for the gun lobby. Having the NRA convention here was really disappointing at first, but then we realized we could use it as a platform.” Oliver believes the NRA, with its pro-gun lobbying, is partially responsible for the circumstances that led to his son’s murder. By coming to Dallas, and speaking at Saturday’s rally, he is trying to give his son a voice and push for gun control laws, rather than a government that responds to violence by telling citizens they need to be able to defend themselves. “Joaquin’s presence in Dallas is more than necessary. It’s mandatory,” Oliver said. “Joaquin was my best friend, and of course he’s my son and we have that father and son relationship, but most of all, we were buddies,” Oliver said. “I know exactly what he wants to fight for, and I also know it’s totally unfair that he’s not able to be here fighting for his rights. “There’s one thing that is for sure in America – there’s an easy access to assault weapons. We all know that, and no one seems to be fighting in that direction,” he said. Like Alhayek, Oliver said he distinguished between the NRA’s leadership and NRA members and other gun rights advocates. “I rather think that they’re confused than saying that they’re wrong,” Oliver said. “There’s a lot of people thinking that they’re defending the second amendment, but actually they are empowering the NRA and the business behind selling guns.” Making a public art project in tribute to his son is an emotional effort, Oliver said, but he has seen from past experience that it is a powerful way to communicate his grief and his demand for change. “Trust me, it’s not an easy thing to do,” he said. But “It’s also like therapy for me. It’s a relief. I have a chance to share it with my son.” Saturday’s rally in Dallas is co-sponsored by Everytown for Gun Safety, a leading gun violence prevention group that has been staged protests at the NRA’s annual meetings each year since the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary School shooting. The media spokesperson for March for Our Lives, the organization created by high school students from Parkland, did not respond to requests for comment about whether those young activists would be participating in any protests during the NRA annual meeting in Dallas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/03/cambridge-analytica-closing-what-happened-trump-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T15:39:47Z","webTitle":"The six weeks that brought Cambridge Analytica down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/03/cambridge-analytica-closing-what-happened-trump-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/03/cambridge-analytica-closing-what-happened-trump-brexit","fields":{"headline":"The six weeks that brought Cambridge Analytica down","bodyText":"In December 2015, the Guardian revealed that Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign was using psychological profiles based on data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users. The organisation that assembled the data was at the time described as a “little-known data company” called Cambridge Analytica, a name now synonymous with efforts to use Facebook data to try and influence election outcomes worldwide. This week, Cambridge Analytica announced that it, along with SCL Elections, the UK entity owned by the former CEO Alexander Nix, was shutting down over mounting legal fees and what it described as a “siege of media coverage” that drove away “virtually all of the company’s customers and suppliers”. The company – which was created with an initial $15m investment from the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer – maintains it has done nothing wrong and has been killed by negative PR. No announcement has been made about the fate of the parent company, SCL Group, a UK defence contractor which has been in business for 30 years. The beginning of the end for the data analytics firm was on Saturday 17 March, when the Observer and the New York Times published interviews with the whistleblower Christopher Wylie. This followed more than a year’s worth of reporting on the company by the Observer. The first piece, in February last year, triggered two legal investigations, both of which are continuing: one by the Electoral Commission into what work the company did for Nigel Farage’s Leave.EU campaign and whether it had been properly declared, and the other by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which also announced a wider inquiry into the use of data in politics. Wylie detailed how the software program at the heart of Cambridge Analytica was created, and how the company collected the data of tens of millions of Facebook users for commercial use, in violation of the social media giant’s own rules. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on,” he said. By late 2015, Facebook found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale, but at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Cambridge Analytica went on to work for Donald Trump’s campaign, and its executives would later claim to undercover reporters that the company played a pivotal role in his victory. Facebook attempted to dampen the impact of Wylie’s whistleblowing interviews by publishing its own mea culpa and banning Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group from its platform, hours before publication but two years after the data breach was first reported. It argued it had asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the Facebook data after the Guardian’s 2015 article and had taken the company’s word when it said it had done this. When the stories came out they prompted international outrage, and made Cambridge Analytica an unlikely household name. And so started six weeks of pain for the firm. The day after Wylie’s bombshell revelations, US congressional investigators from the house intelligence committee asked Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Nix, to testify before Congress. They also summoned Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to explain the data breach. On Monday 19 March, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK’s data watchdog, requested a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s servers and ordered Facebook’s “digital forensics team”, which had gone to its offices to secure evidence, to stand down, arguing that a Facebook audit could potentially compromise a regulatory investigation. That evening the UK’s Channel 4 News broadcast secret recordings in which Nix boasted of using honey traps, fake news campaigns and operations with former spies to swing election campaigns around the world. The following day, Nix was suspended from the company. A second undercover report showed Cambridge Analytica executives boasted of playing a key role in bringing Trump to power, and claiming they used “unattributable and untrackable” advertising to support their clients in elections. “We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,” Nix told an undercover reporter when asked about Trump’s campaign. On Friday 23 March, after a wait for the warrant, 18 investigators from the ICO spent seven hours searching Cambridge Analytica’s London offices. A second former Cambridge Analytica employee, Brittany Kaiser, also went on the record to reveal further details of the company’s inner workings to the Guardian. On Sunday 25 March, Wylie spoke about Cambridge Analytica connections to AggregateIQ, a Canadian firm that worked with different leave campaigns in the European referendum. Soon afterwards, US watchdogs filed a legal complaint against Cambridge Analytica with the Federal Election Commission. They accused the company of potentially violating US election law, by employing non-American citizens to work on American election campaigns, despite receiving a legal warning about the risks. With anger mounting about Facebook’s silence, and 10 days after the initial reports were published, Zuckerberg agreed to testify to the US Congress about the data breach. He has refused repeated requests from the UK’s parliament to answer questions, and MPs are now threatening him with summons if he does not come voluntarily to testify. Meanwhile, Wylie began hours of testimony to a UK parliamentary select committee, in which he claimed Cambridge Analytica sought to disrupt elections around the world, including distributing violent videos in Nigeria. He also alleged there was coordination in the Brexit campaign between Vote Leave and BeLeave, bringing into question the legitimacy of a £625,000 donation which was received by AggregateIQ. Vote Leave has repeatedly denied coordination between the campaigns and said the donation was legitimate under election law. Facebook suspended AggregateIQ, a data firm with which the Vote Leave campaign spent 40% of its budget, on 6 April, following reports that it was connected to SCL. AggregateIQ has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. It maintains it is 100% Canadian owned and operated, and not a direct part or branch of Cambridge Analytica. Jeff Silvester, founder of AggregateIQ, said that Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with the company during the referendum campaign. “AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign,” he said. “Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.” By 10 April, British and US lawyers had launched a joint class action against Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and SCL for allegedly misusing the personal data of more than 71 million people. The lawsuit claims the firms obtained users’ private information from the social network to develop “political propaganda campaigns” in the UK and the US. That same week, Zuckerberg faced 10 hours of questioning by members of Congress. He remained calm and composed, showing remorse and deference and highlighting the changes Facebook had already made. He pledged to do more to protect privacy and prevent foreign interference in elections. Nix was summoned to appear before a British parliamentary committee on fake news the following week for questioning over “inconsistencies” in evidence he had given the committee in February, when he claimed: “We do not work with Facebook data, and we do not have Facebook data.” However, on 17 April he cancelled his appearance, citing the ICO’s ongoing investigation into his company. Damian Collins, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee said: “We do not accept Mr Nix’s reason for not appearing in a public session before the committee. “There is … no legal reason why Mr Nix cannot appear.” Cambridge Analytica held a press conference on Tuesday 24 April, in which it stated that the data it licensed from the academic Aleksandr Kogan’s company Global Science Research was “ineffectual” and therefore it did not use it in Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Spokesman Clarence Mitchell said the company tested to see if Kogan’s personality types could improve the performance of advertising campaigns but that that they “underperformed when compared to more traditional ways of grouping people by demographics”. The damage was already done. Cambridge Analytica’s clients and suppliers had, the company said, jumped ship after the firm was “vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas”. On 2 May, the same day that Cambridge Analytica announced it was going into liquidation, Chris Vickery of the data security firm Upguard gave evidence to the digital, culture, media and sport committee that the Trump campaign had access to psychological profiles derived from Facebook data, that AIQ and Cambridge Analytica were technologically entwined and that illegal co-ordination of data by leave campaigns was “indisputable”. Although Cambridge Analytica might be dead, the team behind it has already set up a new company called Emerdata.

For the past four years, the 40-year-old campesino leader has been hunted by gunmen terrorising the Bajo Aguán region of Honduras – a territory controlled by drug traffickers, African palm conglomerates, mining companies and elite military units. So far, Rivas has survived several assassination attempts but many have not been so fortunate. Thousands have fled and more than 150 campesinos opposing land grabs have been murdered in the Aguán since the country’s 2009 military coup against the populist president Manuel Zelaya. The victims include two of Rivas’s close colleagues who were shot dead in front of dozens of people leaving a meeting in 2016. The killers – believed to have links to military officers and a local drug cartel – were so confident that they removed their hoods after the double murder. This toxic mix of violence and impunity has forced hundreds of thousands of Hondurans to abandon home in recent years. Some of them have found refuge in the US under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) visa, which allows them to live and work legally in the country. But this Friday, the Trump administration will announce whether it will extend TPS for Hondurans – or cancel the programme, as it already has for people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, Liberia and Nepal. TPS was created in 1990 to protect migrants from 10 nations from deportation while their homelands recover from armed conflict or natural disaster. This includes 57,000 Hondurans who sought refuge after Central America was devastated in 1998 by Hurricane Mitch which killed at least 11,000 and left thousands more without homes, crops or jobs. Since then, however, climate change has increased Honduras’s vulnerability to natural disasters such as a recent two-year drought which seriously dented food and water supplies for more than 2 million people. Jeanne Atkinson, executive director of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc (Clinic), is one of hundreds of religious groups calling for TPS to be extended. “Honduras continues to face a lack of adequate housing, vital public and private infrastructure, food and water security. Under law, these factors, as well as the pervasive and shocking homicide rate and gang violence that plagues the country, must all be carefully weighed.” Honduras is the one of the world’s most violent countries – it is also one of the poorest and most unequal in the Americas. 68% of the population – more than 6 million people – live in poverty, according to National Institute of Statistics (INE) figures. Unemployment stands at 56%, and three-quarters of those with jobs don’t earn enough to make ends meet. As a result, many families depend on remittances from the US where about 1 million Hondurans currently live. Last year, just over $4.4bn was sent to Honduras – a 12.7% rise on 2016 – contributing 18% to the GDP, according to the central bank. Honduras has ranked as one of the most dangerous countries in the world since the 2009 coup ushered in the pro-business, authoritarian National party. At least 36 people were killed and hundreds detained during nationwide protests prompted by general elections mired by fraud allegations. A UN investigation found evidence of extrajudicial killings Extortion and gang violence in the country’s biggest cities – Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba – have forced tens of thousands of entire families to flee north and seek refuge in the US and Mexico. At least 190,000 have been internally displaced by violence in recent years, according to the UNHCR. In rural areas, communities resisting the imposition of megaprojects such as mines, dams and model cities which threaten increasingly scarce land and water resources face harassment, repression and jail on trumped-up charges. “The rural displaced have two choices, moving to the urban misery belt, or migrating to the US. If you want to stop migration give people back their land and rivers,” said Donald Hernández from environment and human rights group Cehprodec (Honduran Centre for the Promotion of Community Development). Jonny Rivas, a spokesman for the Agrarian Platform, told the Guardian: “Cancelling TPS and forcing people back to a repressive country where there are no jobs, no land and no future would condemn them to total misery.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/02/arsene-wenger-arsenal-atletico-madrid-europa-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T19:49:16Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger channels spirit of 2006 as Arsenal bid to outgun Atlético","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/02/arsene-wenger-arsenal-atletico-madrid-europa-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/02/arsene-wenger-arsenal-atletico-madrid-europa-league","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger channels spirit of 2006 as Arsenal bid to outgun Atlético","bodyText":"Arsène Wenger went back to Madrid – in his own mind – when he was asked last week to reveal his most memorable European result with Arsenal. It came in February 2006, the manager said, in the Champions League last‑16 first leg, when his team outplayed a Real Madrid line-up that featured Zinedine Zidane, Roberto Carlos and the Brazilian Ronaldo to win 1-0. Thierry Henry scored the goal and it was the first time that an English side had beaten Real on their own ground. Arsenal completed the job with a 0-0 draw at Highbury and they advanced to the final, where they lost 2-1 to Barcelona – the greatest regret of Wenger’s near 22-year tenure. The Frenchman’s critics will note that it says a good deal about him that he has to retreat so far to find an authentic moment of greatness. It is one of the reasons why his time at the club is almost up. But what the Arsenal manager would give for a repeat of the scoreline on Thursday nightin a different part of the Spanish capital; the delight of upsetting the odds. Before the second leg of the Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid – the first match finished 1‑1 – it is clear that Wenger will need a similarly thrusting performance and if his team do prevail, the result would be comparable with the one against Real. It would also stand the test of time because Diego Simeone’s Atlético side are such a fiendish proposition, even if the manager is banned from the touchline after his sending-off in the first leg. Arsenal have to score but their opponents have conceded only nine in 26 matches in all competitions at the Wanda Metropolitano, where they moved this season. They have also kept clean sheets in the previous 11 home games. At the other end Antoine Griezmann and the fit-again Diego Costa, who has previous for tormenting Arsenal, will be licking their lips in anticipation of getting at Wenger’s error-prone defence. “In history Costa has shown he can make differences,” Wenger said, with one of those rueful half-smiles. Arsenal’s fragility has been a talking point and it has been exemplified by their away form in 2018. They have lost seven and drawn one of their eight domestic away games, including an FA Cup third-round tie at Nottingham Forest, although they have roused themselves on their Europa League travels. They have to show overdue steel here. Wenger wants no more regrets and it will be a defining occasion on several levels. The 68-year-old’s desire to bow out from Arsenal with the first European trophy of his career is a compelling storyline and he offered the juiciest soundbite when he warmed to the theme. “I want to finish this love story well,” he said. Yet the club, who do actually pre-date Wenger, are hardly well-stocked with European honours. They have only two – the 1970 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the 1994 Cup Winners’ Cup. Above all, it is a huge opportunity for them and that is before a potential Champions League qualification place is considered. “The next game is always the most important in life and this one influences the future of my club,” Wenger said. “The future of Arsenal is not exactly the same if we qualify for the Champions League or not. That’s why it’s a very, very big game for us.” Wenger has made it plain that he is not yet ready to retire; he will seek another job in management next season and it sounded a little pointed when he insisted, “I don’t feel too much my age”. One of the sub-plots puts him in the managerial shop window, not to mention the desire this fighter has to prove that, perhaps, Arsenal would have been better off to keep him. What of the players? Some of them, surely, are playing for their futures at the club. Wenger admitted to a mixture of nerves and excitement. There was still the same buzz, he said, that had accompanied the first games of his long Arsenal tenure. “There is uncertainly [about the result] and that creates a tension,” he added. “You can always discover new things in football. Every game is a new adventure. That’s why the excitement is the same.” How his players balance the requirements of the tie will be fundamental. “We know exactly what we need to do and that is an advantage,” he added. “We need to score and to have a clear approach in our heads. The only thing we don’t know is will Atlético do the same or have a more cautious approach and try to catch us on the break? Atlético’s history [of clean sheets at home] has to stop somewhere. We created chances in the first leg and we have to recreate those situations.” What Wenger most wants is to recreate is the feeling from Madrid 2006. This is his first return to the city with Arsenal for what will be his 250th European match; he sits second on the all-time list behind Sir Alex Ferguson. “We come to a place with a good history for us,” the Frenchman added. “We came here with a very young team and beat Real Madrid, who had fantastic names. I will try to repeat that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/may/07/liz-garbus-a-dangerous-son-documentary-mental-health-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-07T09:00:45Z","webTitle":"'The stigma is overwhelming': documentary investigates America's mental health crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/07/liz-garbus-a-dangerous-son-documentary-mental-health-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/07/liz-garbus-a-dangerous-son-documentary-mental-health-crisis","fields":{"headline":"'The stigma is overwhelming': documentary investigates America's mental health crisis","bodyText":"In 1955, the number of mentally ill Americans in public psychiatric hospitals peaked at 560,000. Since then, that number has been in sharp decline: as a result of deinstitutionalization and the broad transfer of mental health funding from the federal government to states, people – especially children – living with psychiatric disorders and emotional disturbances have fallen through the cracks. Liz Garbus’s new HBO documentary, A Dangerous Son, puts this crisis and the country’s inadequate response in sharp focus. Through the lens of three mothers whose sons suffer from mental illness, the documentary chronicles in intimate, often painful detail the roadblocks families face in securing treatment, as well as the effects of a dismantled and under-resourced apparatus for psychiatric care in the US. From 2009 to 2012, states slashed funding for mental health services by $5bn while the country got rid of almost 10% of its public psychiatric hospital beds. As the author Andrew Solomon says in the film: “There is the sense that rehabilitation is a luxury.” Garbus, the prolific documentary film-maker behind Ghosts of Abu Ghraib and What Happened, Miss Simone?, took interest in the subject after the 2012 Newtown shooting, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed 27 people. Though she’d previously examined institutional hurdles and the criminal justice system in documentaries like The Farm and The Execution of Wanda Jean, her hope, this time, was to empathize with the mothers who apply what she calls “herculean efforts” in order to care for their children. “There was chatter all over the internet and in water coolers: how could a mother not have gotten that son more help? How could she have let him live like that?” Garbus explains. “A woman named Liza Long wrote a blogpost that became very controversial called I Am Adam Lanza’s Mother and she talked about how desperate she had been to get help for her son, how impossible it was to get the care she needed, and how broken the system was.” In that essay, Long, who appears in the film, wrote: “I live with a son who is mentally ill. I love my son. But he terrifies me.” The mothers featured in A Dangerous Son, Stacy, Edie and Cora, feel similarly. For the film, they granted Garbus unfettered access to their home lives as they perform the grinding task of caring for their children while jumping through a number of bureaucratic hoops to get them proper treatment. At one point Edie must call the cops on her son, William, 15, after they meet with his social worker; in another scene, Stacy’s 10-year-old son, Ethan, is shown punching his younger sister in the backseat of the car. Later, filming is halted so the camera crew can intervene when Ethan is physically violent toward his mother. “One wrong word sends me into a psychotic rage,” says Long’s son, Eric. “It’s like watching myself do things I didn’t want to do.” The specter of mass shootings like the ones in Newtown and Aurora loom large over the film, with one mother expressing fear that she’ll one day see her own son’s face on the news as an example of a child who didn’t get enough help. But Garbus emphasizes the fact that adolescents with mental illness are more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators of violence. “This is not a film about these mass shooters,” she says, underscoring the fact that, while focus on mental health is often used as a crutch in media coverage of gun violence, stigmas about mental illness frequently come at the expense of families like the ones featured in the film. “People have allowed films to be made about their children suffering from leukemia, and an enormous amount of empathy comes out and donations to childhood leukemia foundations,” Garbus notes. “But when you open your home to somebody whose child is suffering from mental illness, the stigma and the blowback can feel overwhelming.” As noted in the film, 17 million children in the US have or have had a psychiatric disorder, but there are currently fewer than 60,000 beds to accommodate them. In Virginia and elsewhere, such insufficiencies have had fatal consequences: Austin “Gus” Deeds, the son of the Virginia state senator Creigh Deeds, stabbed his father and killed himself just 13 hours after efforts to secure him a hospital bed fell through. Deeds, who spoke to Garbus for the film, later sued the state of Virginia for medical malpractice and criminal negligence, claiming that his son’s mental health evaluator failed to contact local hospitals that were later revealed to have available beds. Edie has had similar experiences. “Many times a case worker has no experience with mental illness or autism, and so you have to deal with somebody whose job it is to not give money for the institutionalization of the child,” she tells the Guardian. “Even when the case worker is talking to this child’s therapist who says, ‘Yes, this kid needs intensive, 24/7 care,’ they’re very, very reluctant to do so.” In remarks made in the aftermath of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed, Donald Trump said the White House was “committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health”. But in his budget proposal for 2019, funding for the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) was decreased by 30%, from $1.6bn to $1.1bn. “There are very limited funds,” Edie says. “To be honest, the battle starts from the moment they start seeing the dollar signs.” Garbus, whose Trump-themed documentary series The Fourth Estate is being released later this month, says that, despite budget cuts to Medicaid and the NIMH, there are reasons for cautious optimism: last month, a group of three teenagers from Albermarle County, Virginia, successfully lobbied for the state to include $160,000 in its 2019 budget proposal to add a mental health professional to the school system. “These are the kinds of movements that have to happen on a local level for there to be a larger shift in our attention,” she says. Until that shift takes place, the mothers hope that the documentary will go a long way toward building empathy and understanding for their plight. “Since he [William] was three years old, I thought I wasn’t parenting the way a good parent would,” says Edie, who co-parents and remains friends with her ex-husband. “That has followed me throughout my journey with him, even though we were a loving family. Even kids from very good homes are susceptible to mental illness and autism and other issues. And that’s a judgment people are quick to go to.” A Dangerous Son premieres on HBO on 7 May with a UK date yet to be confirmed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/03/morning-mail-commbank-loses-data-cambridge-analytica-shuts-abbott-under-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T21:15:02Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Commonwealth Bank loses data for 20m accounts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/morning-mail-commbank-loses-data-cambridge-analytica-shuts-abbott-under-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/morning-mail-commbank-loses-data-cambridge-analytica-shuts-abbott-under-fire","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Commonwealth Bank loses data for 20m accounts","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 3 May. Top stories The Commonwealth Bank has admitted losing backup data on more than 15 years of customer statements, affecting almost 20 million accounts. The statements, stored on magnetic tapes, contained customers’ names, addresses, account numbers and transaction details from 2000 to 2016. The CBA’s acting group executive for retail banking services, Angus Sullivan, has assured customers their information has not been compromised and no action was required. “The tapes did not contain PINs, passwords or other data that could enable account fraud,” he said. The bank said it had confirmed there was no evidence of suspicious activity involving the 19.8m accounts affected following the incident. CBA said it had been unable to confirm the destruction of two magnetic tapes containing historical customer statements. “We take the protection of customer data very seriously and incidents like this are not acceptable,” Sullivan said. The political consultancy group Cambridge Analytica is shutting down, after becoming enmeshed in the Facebook data scandal. The company has been plagued by scandal since the Observer reported that the personal data of about 50 million Americans and at least a million Britons had been harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, which is now closing and starting insolvency proceedings. Cambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing, but says that the negative media coverage has left it with no clients and mounting legal fees. Tony Abbott’s political future could be under threat from a group of environmental activists who are recruiting like-minded people to join Liberal party branches in the former prime minister’s northern Sydney seat of Warringah, in an effort to have him deselected. Billing themselves as “the counterweight” to the pro-coal power Monash Forum, the North Shore Environment Stewards have held at least two recruitment functions asking people to tap up friends to join the party in the Sydney northern beaches electorate. Meanwhile, Abbott has said he isn’t demanding an apology from the ABC over the Andrew Probyn affair, but the “least they could do” is make one. Former Melbourne school principal Malka Leifer will face extradition charges in Israel later this month, a court in Jerusalem has ruled. She is wanted on 74 counts of child abuse by police in Australia but fled to Israel in 2008 before the case could be heard. An Israeli police undercover investigation found “indications” that Leifer, who was head of the Adass Israel school, was “pretending to be suffering from a mental illness to avoid the extradition process”. The prosecution was ordered on Wednesday to hand over evidence it claims shows Leifer is mentally fit to be extradited. Police in Sydney are trying to piece together the last hours of a Brazilian mining executive, Cecilia Hadda, whose body was found floating in water by kayakers on Sunday a few kilometres upstream from the Harbour Bridge. The 38-year-old left her red Fiat car at West Ryde on Saturday but failed to meet up with friends later in the day. Detectives are scouring CCTV footage for clues and have several “persons of interest” they are speaking to, but how the logistics worker met her fate remains a mystery for now.

Serena Williams should be seeded at Wimbledon for the good of the game, writes Kevin Mitchell. Making a comeback after a difficult childbirth, Williams has won Wimbledon seven times, and the All England Club must do the right thing or risk being seen to punish a player for having a baby, Mitchell argues. Thinking time Documentary Border Politics charts the plight of refugees seeking a new life in Australia and around the globe, and provides a devastating and heartbreaking insight into the issue that has come to resonate throughout politics worldwide. Refugee advocate and prominent lawyer Julian Burnside is particularly troubled by Australia’s stance: “If you gradually make it acceptable to behave monstrously to other human beings, then you are on a very dangerous path.” This personal essay by Indigenous academic Sana Nakata is an affecting meditation on how children are central to Australia’s struggles, and none more so than Indigenous children. “As an adult, when I’ve seen deeply controversial political moments take hold, I’ve always noticed the children at the heart of them: the children not thrown overboard, the children of the Northern Territory intervention, the kids of same-sex parents during the recent marriage equality plebiscite. Because though they are rarely seen and rarely heard, children are never far from the political struggles of a nation.” Peter Hutton is the former principal of Templestowe College, or TC, a government secondary school in Melbourne’s suburbs with individualised learning plans for students but no year levels, bells, compulsory uniforms or detention. According to Hutton, David Gonski got almost everything right in his second report – except one thing: “You made an effective case that the current system is based on an industrial model and then set an industrial, one size fits all, production target. It simply doesn’t match the neuroscience, David. Learning is not linear.” What’s he done now?

It is as cynical as the previous attempts, and should prove similarly unsuccessful. At first, the prime minister hoped that ignoring the problem would make it go away. Then, as the outrage grew, she promised a taskforce to help those affected. Next, Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary after struggling to account for her role in the injustice. Her replacement, Sajid Javid, struck a more emollient note on immigration by disowning the “hostile environment” phrase and promising a “fair and humane policy”. Finally, faced with Labour’s demand for government documents on the issue to be passed to the home affairs committee, Mrs May on Wednesday announced a lessons-learned review with “independent oversight”. This very minimal offer was expected to make it easier for Tory MPs to obey the three-line whip in an evening vote. But it falls far short of what is needed. The numbers affected, and the far wider repercussions of the policy which spawned these cases, demand a full, independent public inquiry into what went wrong. That inquiry would quickly lead to the prime minister’s door. Though toxic rhetoric on immigration developed under Labour, the system became vastly more punitive with Mrs May at the Home Office – hence her reluctance to acknowledge the issue, and enduring refusal to face it head-on. Her insistence on setting an arbitrary, unrealistic net migration target led inexorably to her creation of the hostile environment, with official targets for removals and ordinary, largely untrained citizens such as landlords and health staff turned into border guards. It was Mrs May who adopted the principle “deport first and hear appeals later”: a “gotcha” culture has treated people as guilty until proven innocent. Legal aid has been all but eradicated for non-asylum immigration cases. Even on Wednesday, Mrs May repeatedly contrasted the Windrush generation with those who “break rules [and] try to play the system”. Members of the Windrush generation are still suffering. Despite the assurances given to them, their experiences mean they will not feel secure until they have British passports in their hands. Their lives have been torn apart. Some have lost forever the chance to spend time with a dying mother or sibling. Promises of a compensation scheme are welcome, but many are struggling now: one, owed two years of wrongly withheld benefits, is being pursued by bailiffs. And the effects of the hostile environment have spread far wider. Careers have been derailed, homes lost and families separated or broken both by harsh rules and their punitive – and frequently incorrect – implementation. Women’s groups warn that abusive men are using the spectre of potential deportation to threaten and control their partners. Worse still, “right to rent” checks by landlords in England could be rolled out to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The ill-effects have extended to those born here, too: for many, a non-white face or an evidently Asian or African name may be enough to raise suspicion. As David Lammy spelled out in the House of Commons, Mr Javid’s promise is an empty one: “It is not possible to have a fair and humane immigration policy alongside the hostile environment.” The injustice and inhumanity will persist as long as this cruel immigration regime does. An inquiry would help us to understand the full extent of its pernicious effects, and how they may be addressed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/04/impassioned-rallying-cry-strikes-chord-with-netball-followers","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"Impassioned rallying cry strikes chord with netball followers | Erin Delahunty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/04/impassioned-rallying-cry-strikes-chord-with-netball-followers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/04/impassioned-rallying-cry-strikes-chord-with-netball-followers","fields":{"headline":"Impassioned rallying cry strikes chord with netball followers","bodyText":"Sue Gaudion has a memo for the netball lovers of Australia: “Turn the bloody TV on and watch it.” Gaudion, one of the most respected names in netball, last week launched a grassroots movement – dubbed #wakeupnetball on social media – with a feisty 15-minute Facebook video streamed from her Perth home, responding to the “almighty backlash” to changes to the game at the elite level. In the video, which has nearly 90,000 views and 1,500 shares, and in another clip posted on Wednesday night, Gaudion calls on the game’s traditional base to stop whingeing about tweaks to Super Netball and instead support the league to influence the game’s future. She equates “more eyeballs” watching on TV with the chance to retain netball in its current form – without major changes, such as the long-mooted two-point shot. Gaudion, who has worked as a coach and broadcaster for more than 20 years and calls Super Netball for Channel Nine, told Guardian Australia she decided “completely off her own bat” to respond to the interminable negativity she saw online, mainly about new TV timeslots. Some fans argue new times – 3pm on Saturday and 1pm on Sunday – present a conflict for those playing at local level and claim Nine wants to “change the game” in the pursuit of ratings. Last season, Super Netball matches attracted an average 106,000 viewers nationally, making it a niche sport at best for a commercial station. Criticism of the scheduling has reverberated through fan forums and social media channels since governing body Netball Australia announced the changes, along with a new ladder points system, a fortnight ago. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories Gaudion speaks directly to fans in her videos, labelling the 1.2 million Australians registered to play across Australia a “sleeping giant” with “genuine power” to shape the game. But she also highlights a problem. “The reality of the situation is this and listen very, very, very carefully; 1.2 million people play netball in our country, annually. Here’s the problem, 10% watch it on TV, only 10%. On an annual basis, 10% of our 1.2 million people that go out and play the bloody game of netball, that love the bloody game of netball, they’re the only people that turn on and watch it. So, we’ve got a problem netball, we’ve got a serious problem. “Here’s the wake-up call, netball people. You have to support the game. If you don’t turn the bloody TV on and watch it, we are going to end up with a product that looks nothing like the game,” she says. Gaudion says changes are only contemplated and made to drive viewership – and the rusted-on fan base is the most obvious place to find more eyeballs. She pleads with fans to channel their energy into supporting Super Netball – watching on TV or on the Netball Live app, watching replays and talking about it on social media – and bringing “their families, friends and extended circle along”. “Go out to your local netball association, your local netball clubs, your family, your friends, absolutely anybody that you know that loves netball and tell them that they have a responsibility to engage in our game and watch,” she says. She wants #wakeupnetball to act as a rallying cry for “netball people” across the country in the second round of Super Netball this weekend. If the 10% cent grows to 20%, netball won’t need to change, Gaudion says. “Netball needs to get harsher with itself. If we honestly want Channel Nine to put netball, and every single game of it, at the correct time, the 5pm and 6pm timeslots, then more people have to watch the game. It’s simple.” Gaudion says she expected her first video to reach “200 or 300 people and maybe slowly spread”, but the response has been “absolutely overwhelming.” She has worked virtually non-stop since last Thursday, spending nearly five hours after posting the video answering hundreds of questions on her Facebook page and fielding emails, calls and texts. “I haven’t had time to count up all the social media shares and tags, but the response has been mind-blowing.” But it’s not the “Gaudy show”. “Already, I am seeing a sort of community building. I’m so bloody passionate about this game, but it’s not about me. I just want netball people to wake up and embrace the power we have, to add those numbers and make a difference,” she says. Netball Australia chief executive Marne Fechner says the governing body didn’t know about or sanction Gaudion’s stance. “But, I think it’s fabulous,” she says. “To see the reaction, the passion, the conversation it’s sparked, is great and we’re watching with interest. “In terms of market segmentation, we do see the netball-playing population, which has a natural affinity for the game, as key. We do want to engage them, of course,” Fechner adds, while acknowledging frustration around timeslots. On the back of #wakeupnetball, Netball Australia has heard of local associations “pulling out TVs at courts”, so games can be watched, Fechner says. It’s exactly the kind of grassroots movement Gaudion seeks. Melbourne Vixens and Diamonds defender Jo Weston describes the movement as “phenomenal”, agreeing that for too long, sky-high participation levels have failed to translate into big commercial success for netball. “As Sue has indicated, if we could increase the percentage of those people who play into attending games, watching on TV and supporting the league, netball would be in such a great place,” she says. “If you care passionately about something, that will turn into action.”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/may/02/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-champions-league-roma-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"Liverpool's Jürgen Klopp warns Real Madrid: ‘We will be on fire in final’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/02/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-champions-league-roma-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/02/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-champions-league-roma-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool's Jürgen Klopp warns Real Madrid: ‘We will be on fire in final’","bodyText":"A beaming Jürgen Klopp told his Liverpool side they must go and finish the job in Kiev by winning the Champions League after surviving their Roma scare. Liverpool were beaten 4-2 at Stadio Olimpico, their first defeat in Rome, but advanced 7-6 on aggregate to the final where they will face Real Madrid. And the Liverpool manager warned the holders that his team will be “on fire” in Ukraine having weathered another Roma recovery in the second leg of the semi-final. Klopp, who re-emerged from the tunnel to celebrate with the 5,000 delirious away fans half an hour after the final whistle, admitted his team had suffered and under-performed in the Italian capital. Not that he cared. Having guided Liverpool from the Champions League qualifiers to their eighth European Cup final appearance Klopp insisted his only focus was on ending a run of near-misses in finals and Real’s hold on the trophy on 26 May. “We were in a League Cup final and didn’t win it,” the Liverpool manager said. “People don’t tell me in the street since then: ‘Thank you for bringing us to the final.’ We were in the Europa League final too. Nobody tells me thank you. I see no trophies after these games. They don’t hang silver medals at Melwood. That’s a pity, but that’s the game. There’s still a job to do. “Going to a final is really nice but winning is even nicer. We will be ready but it is Real Madrid. You cannot be more experienced in this competition than Real Madrid. I think 80% of their team played all these finals. They are four times in the last five years and still together. They are experienced, we are not, but we will be really on fire.” Klopp joined his players in prolonged celebrations with the Liverpool supporters at the Stadio Olimpico. He later came back out to continue the revelry alone. He explained: “Seeing all these happy faces is the best thing that football can do. These people followed us all over Europe, come to Anfield, create an exceptional atmosphere, and we all know how big the desire is to come back on the winning track. They had such a big part in the season so far so if they want to see me, they can see me, no problem.” The Liverpool manager said his team were made to suffer by Roma because they did not capitalise on several counterattacks. “A big compliment for Roma,” added Klopp. “What a performance, what a comeback, what a great football game. In the high-intense moments we had brilliant counterattacks but not enough to finish them. There was a few penalty situations but I didn’t see them back so far. It was first time we were not as good as we can be. “We needed luck, that’s what we had, and over the whole campaign it’s deserved. It would have been deserved for Roma too. For both teams it would have been crazy to play extra time. So it was 7-6 on aggregate, which sounds crazy because it is crazy. “We came as a qualifier and are now in a final. I’m really happy for the boys, the club, the fans. It’s been a fantastic ride so far; now we go to Kiev, which sounds crazy but it’s the truth. We will go to Kiev.” The Roma president, James Pallotta, was livid with the Slovenian referee Damir Skomina, insisting his refusal to award a penalty for handball by Trent Alexander-Arnold or dismiss Loris Karius for a foul on Edin Dzeko made the introduction of VAR an imperative in the Champions League. Pallotta said: “It is very clear VAR is needed in the Champions League because you just can’t let stuff like this happen. El Shaarawy potentially [in]the 49th minute wasn’t offside and he [Dzeko] gets taken down by the goalie, the 63rd minute was a handball that was obvious to everyone probably in the world except people on the pitch, the 67th minute [Patrik] Schick gets taken down in the box. “I know it is difficult to ref but it is really embarrassing that we lose on aggregate like that. By the way, it should have been a red card which would have been 10 men in the 63rd minute. Liverpool are a great team, congratulations going forward, but if they don’t get VAR in the Champions League, stuff like this is an absolute joke,” Pallotta said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/03/new-cameras-catch-drivers-mobile-phones","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T02:04:12Z","webTitle":"New cameras will catch drivers using mobile phones on NSW roads","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/new-cameras-catch-drivers-mobile-phones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/new-cameras-catch-drivers-mobile-phones","fields":{"headline":"New cameras will catch drivers using mobile phones on NSW roads","bodyText":"New South Wales will allow the use of world-leading camera technology to detect drivers using their phones. Several Australian jurisdictions, including Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria, have considered using automated camera technology to stamp out phone use behind the wheel. But NSW is the first to take concrete steps to legislate, passing new powers as part of a broader suite of road safety reforms this week. The legislation allows new, specialised cameras to be used to detect phone use, but will also allow the use from existing infrastructure – speed cameras, for example. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The technology will first undergo a trial period, but is expected to become a permanent fixture on NSW roads. “NSW is the first jurisdiction in Australia to introduce legislation like the Road Safety Bill, showing this government’s ongoing commitment to road safety as technology and societal trends change,” the state’s roads minister, Melinda Pavey, said. The dangers of phone use by drivers were brought into sharp relief earlier this year, when two police officers, Jonathan Wright and Matthew Foley, were critically injured after a car ploughed into them in Sydney’s southwest. The driver had taken his eyes off the road for 20 seconds to look at his phone. In total, drivers illegally using mobile phones have been involved in 184 crashes between 2012 and 2017, resulting in seven deaths and 105 injuries. The technology is in use elsewhere in the world, including Saudi Arabia. In Australia, it is being pushed by private companies like Sydney-based firm One Task. One Task demonstrated the cameras to WA’s Road Safety Commission earlier this year. The company also pitched it to Victorian authorities late last year, but the state government said it had no plans to use such technology. The reforms also extend powers to authorities for roadside oral testing of cocaine, increase penalties for driving under the influence and introduce red light-style cameras capable of detecting mobile phones used by drivers. Speaking in NSW parliament on Wednesday, Nationals MP Ben Franklin said the technology would aid the efforts of police to stamp out phone use. “While more than 40,000 infringements were issued by police for illegal mobile phone use in the 2016-17 financial year, emerging automated camera and software technology presents an opportunity to supplement police enforcement and further deter motorists from illegally using a mobile phone,” he said. The legislation, he said, has been designed to ensure “technology developers are not limited in their design”. The technology would also allow the use of existing infrastructure and technology. “For example, this may allow existing traffic enforcement devices, such as speed cameras, to be used if they are deemed appropriate,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/03/we-met-cambridge-analytica-but-didnt-use-them-business-council-of-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T00:49:21Z","webTitle":"We met Cambridge Analytica but didn't use them – Business Council of Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/we-met-cambridge-analytica-but-didnt-use-them-business-council-of-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/03/we-met-cambridge-analytica-but-didnt-use-them-business-council-of-australia","fields":{"headline":"We met Cambridge Analytica but didn't use them – Business Council of Australia","bodyText":"The Business Council of Australia has defended its decision to meet representatives from the controversial research firm Cambridge Analytica, saying there was only one meeting and nothing came of it. But it says it wants to know why nobody questions the political left about campaigning methods, saying whenever the “centre” ran a campaign it was ascribed sinister motives. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The BCA’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, has admitted that after Donald Trump won the US presidential election its executives travelled to Washington DC to meet a range of people to discuss modern campaigning and polling methods. She said she had met executives from Cambridge Analytica – which has now announced it is closing down – but nothing had come of it. “They were not our cup of tea,” she told ABC radio. “We decided that we didn’t want to use them, and we’re not using them.” The BCA says its new advocacy body, Centre Ground – which is running the For the Common Good campaign – is a non-partisan, policy-driven unit that aims to tackle what it calls “anti-business forces”. The body has been the subject of scrutiny after company records showed the former Liberal party acting federal director Andrew Bragg, who has been engaged by the BCA, is a director. The idea of establishing an advocacy group to act as a foil to progressive groups such as GetUp has been discussed within conservative circles for some time but has been stymied by competing interests. The BCA’s new campaign is being viewed as the business community going it alone, although the BCA, which now is the sole funder, has not ruled out joining forces with other groups to square off against progressive activism. Last week in Senate hearings Westacott was unable to answer when asked whether Bragg had had dealings with Cambridge Analytica and, after tweets from the Labor senator Kristina Keneally, the BCA was unable to confirm that Cambridge Analytica was not involved in the advocacy group. But on Thursday Westacott said the BCA had chosen not to work with Cambridge Analytica. “We went to Washington to do a whole lot of things,” Westacott said. “The idea that you wouldn’t go to Washington after a very unexpected – although I always thought Donald Trump would win – election result, and go and talk to a whole range of people about campaigning, about modern polling; I mean, people have been on our backs for years about getting with modern campaigning – people can’t have it both ways. “I mean, this is one of these things that people, you know, it’s so interesting that nobody ever questions the left side. No one ever questions that the ACTU is campaigning. “When the centre pushes back and says, ‘We actually want to play in the same field as these organisations but we’re not going to tell lies, we’re not going to give people misinformation, we’re not going to misrepresent data, ours will be a campaign of policy and integrity,’ people want to conflate things.” Westacott was also asked about company tax cuts. Elizabeth Proust, the Australian Institute of Company Directors chair, said on Wednesday that the public did not support the push for large company tax cuts. The BCA chief said the Coalition’s plan to lower the corporate tax cut to 25% was a long-term goal, to be ushered in over a decade, and company taxes were the biggest impediment to investment and productivity growth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/02/roma-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final-marks-from-10","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T21:33:42Z","webTitle":"Roma 4-2 Liverpool (agg: 6-7): player ratings for semi-final second leg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/02/roma-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final-marks-from-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/02/roma-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final-marks-from-10","fields":{"headline":"Roma 4-2 Liverpool (agg: 6-7): player ratings for semi-final second leg","bodyText":"Roma Alisson Could not be faulted for Liverpool’s goals although less convincing than Karius with his handling and command. 6 Alessandro Florenzi Deserves credit for providing an outlet down the right while dealing with the dual threat of Mane and Robertson. 7 Kostas Manolas Alert to several dangerous situations but often exposed by his team’s wayward passing and understandable adventure. 8 Federico Fazio Sharp in the tackle and intelligently restricted Salah’s chance to cut in on his left foot.

The incidents occured during the NFL team’s trip to Costa Rica in 2013. While some cheerleaders were required to wear just body paint others were told to go topless for a calendar shoot. Although the women would not appear unclothed in the pictures, team sponsors and other guests – all of whom the women say were male – attended the shoot were granted full access to the shoot. “At one of my friend’s shoots, we were basically standing around her like a human barricade because she was basically naked, so we could keep the guys from seeing her,” said one of the nine cheerleaders interviewed by the Times. “I was getting so angry that the guys on the trip were skeezing around in the background.” The Times story also alleges nine of the cheerleaders were then told they had been picked by some of the sponsors as personal escorts to a nightclub. The relationships did not involve sex but some of the women felt the team was “pimping us out”. “It’s just not right to send cheerleaders out with strange men when some of the girls clearly don’t want to go,” one of the cheerleaders on the trip told the Times, adding that the orders left some of them in tears. “But unfortunately, I feel like it won’t change until something terrible happens, like a girl is assaulted in some way, or raped. I think teams will start paying attention to this only when it’s too late.” Stephanie Jojokian, the director of Washington’s cheerleaders, disputed the women’s version of events. “I was not forcing anyone to go at all,” Jojokian said. “I’m the mama bear, and I really look out for everybody, not just the cheerleaders. It’s a big family. We respect each other and our craft. It’s such a supportive environment for these ladies.” On Wednesday, Washington put forward two cheerleaders who were on the 2013 trip to speak to the Times. They both said that Jojokian was a good leader and the evening in question had been “a night of relaxation and [a chance] to be away from it all.” It is not only NFL cheerleaders who have spoken about poor working conditions.

Cambridge Analytica, the company at the heart of the data scandal which has engulfed Facebook, announced it was shutting down on Wednesday evening. In a statement the company said recent media coverage of its use of Facebook data had “driven away virtually all of the company’s customers and suppliers”, leaving it unable to continue trading and forcing the directors to put the company in administration. Cambridge Analytica was founded in 2013 as a tech-focused subsidiary of the consultancy SCL Group, a long-established business which worked on political campaigns around the world. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election it claimed responsibility for his success The parent company, established in 1990, has also announced that it is closing down as a result of the scandal. Why have the companies been forced to close? Cambridge Analytica’s attempts to use data obtained through a Facebook personality quiz for the purposes of targeted political advertising spiralled into an international crisis for Facebook following months of reporting by the Guardian and Observer, which culminated in whistleblower Christopher Wylie breaking his silence in March. Soon afterwards Channel 4 News released undercover footage of Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix boasting he could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and Ukrainian sex workers, prompting his resignation. The story attracted attention from politicians around the world, causing reputational damage to Facebook and resulting in chief executive Mark Zuckerberg facing questions from US senators. The scandal has left the social network facing the prospect of extra regulation – although this has yet to hit the company’s profits. Have Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group admitted any wrongdoing? Cambridge Analytica continues to say that it did no wrong, and that the company has been the victim of “unfairly negative media coverage” which left it “vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising”. Alongside the announcement that the business has been placed in administration, Cambridge Analytica also released a report it commissioned from Julian Malins QC which concluded that the allegations of wrongdoing were not “borne out by the facts”. “My findings entirely reflect the amazement of the staff, on watching the television programmes and reading the sensationalistic reporting, that any of these media outlets could have been talking about the company for which they worked,” the lawyer said. What will happen to Cambridge Analytica now it has been placed in administration? The company has said it will meet its obligations to its employees, respecting their notice periods and severance terms, and ensuring that they receive redundancy payments. However, questions remain over what happens to the company’s intellectual property and whether there will be any interest in purchasing what remains of the businesses. Will this stop the scandal? Politicians around the world continue to demand answers about the activities of Cambridge Analytica and the broader issue of using Facebook data for targeted advertising. Damian Collins, the chair of the House of Commons committee which has been looking into the company’s activities, has said the investigations into their work remain vital and warned that “Cambridge Analytica and SCL group cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing”. Meanwhile, several of the individuals involved in Cambridge Analytica, including Alexander Nix, have registered a new company named Emerdata - although it is unclear what plans they have for the business."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/may/03/off-the-map-the-secret-cities-behind-the-atom-bomb-manhattan-project","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T14:31:51Z","webTitle":"Off the map: the secret cities behind the atom bomb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/off-the-map-the-secret-cities-behind-the-atom-bomb-manhattan-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/may/03/off-the-map-the-secret-cities-behind-the-atom-bomb-manhattan-project","fields":{"headline":"Off the map: the secret cities behind the atom bomb","bodyText":"Something strange happened in the US state of Tennessee in 1943. Thousands of young workers poured into a 59,000-acre site about 25 miles west of Knoxville. Vast quantities of materials followed, never to re-emerge. Houses and other facilities were built with record speed. Yet officially Oak Ridge did not exist during the war and could not be found on any map. What was going on there? Very few people knew at the time, even among the residents. The answer was that this was the starting block in a race against Adolf Hitler to build the atom bomb. Oak Ridge was one of three “secret cities” of the Manhattan Project, along with Los Alamos in New Mexico and Hanford/Richland in Washington state. Clockwise from top: The control room of the K-25 plant, Oak Ridge, 1945; the K-25 plant itself; Hanford Construction Camp, Washington. Photographs: National Archives and Records Administration/US Department of Energy, Hanford Collection More than 125,000 scientists, technicians and support staff occupied the three cities by the end of the war. There is a photo of a Santa Claus being frisked at the gates of Oak Ridge and a local newsletter stamped “restricted”. Anyone aged 12 or over had to wear an ID badge. The use of words such as “atomic” or “uranium” was taboo lest it tip off the enemy. Yet some social aspects were all too familiar: even these planned communities, which tried to offer residents an idyllic lifestyle and would influence postwar urban construction and design in America, replicated the racial segregation of the era. The Cityscape: get the best of Guardian Cities delivered to you every week, with just-released data, features and on-the-ground reports from all over the world “At first glance they seem like very normal American communities,” says Martin Moeller, senior curator of the Secret Cities: The Architecture and Planning of the Manhattan Project exhibition, which opens on Thursday at the National Building Museum in Washington. “But then before long you start to see things that are strange in a variety of ways, sometimes humorous.” He offers examples: “Driving by the main hotel in Oak Ridge and seeing that the bar and lounge there is called the reactor room. Starting to see these nuclear symbols on seemingly random buildings around the place but also coming to understand that these were not just typical communities that grew up in a haphazard fashion, that there was a hand of design there even at the beginning of their existence.” A culture of secrecy prevailed, with strict security measures in place. Photograph: Courtesy of the US Department of Energy and the Oak Ridge Public Library It was late 1942, less than a year after the US had entered the second world war, when the US Army Corps of Engineers quietly began acquiring vast tracts of land in remote areas of three states. The few residents of these areas were summarily evicted and their houses demolished. Soon thousands of young workers arrived from far and wide, initially occupying tents and other makeshift shelters within the newly designated military reservations. Shielded from public view by natural barriers and security fences, the workers quickly erected hundreds of buildings, ranging from prefabricated houses to industrial structures of unprecedented scale. The goal was singular. Aware that the Nazis were pursuing nuclear weapons – though they were not as far along as thought at the time – the US would invest unfathomable money and manpower to get there first. The cause could scarcely have been more urgent. “Despite that, in building these communities, it was considered important to create housing in environments that were comfortable for the people who would be working for the scientists and engineers who would be doing this important work,” explains Moeller, who first visited Oak Ridge three decades ago when his future father-in-law was a nuclear physicist with the national laboratory there. Housing at Oak Ridge.

Photographs: National Archives and Records Administration/SOM © Torkel Korling “There was agreement that they needed to feel at home. They needed to have a community that felt ‘normal’. And so during this time of national emergency, the US government built single family houses in what we would now consider typical suburban neighborhoods, instead of just jamming all of these people into dormitories and barracks as I would think almost any other country in the world would have done for time. That to me, in of itself, is extraordinary.” He adds: “These cities really were proving grounds for emerging ideas about town planning architecture and construction. In many cases they were continuing movements that were already in existence.” Built from scratch in half a year to produce fuel for atomic bombs, Oak Ridge was initially conceived as a town for 13,000 people but grew to 75,000 by the end of the war, the biggest of the secret cities. The housing was designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), now one of the biggest and most influential architecture firms in the world. And yet while Oak Ridge seemed to exist in a bubble, it was also very much of its time. The “Rhythm Engineers” residents’ musical group on stage, Oak Ridge, 1945; the mess hall of Hanford Construction Camp, circa 1943-45. Photographs: National Archives and Records Administration Moeller continues: “Although these cities were very much conceived as forward-looking communities – they really wanted places that were idyllic in many ways, great places to raise families – nonetheless segregation was designed in from the start. It was just considered to be a given by all parties concerned. There were racial issues that were baked into these communities.” SOM’s initial plan called for a “negro village” at the eastern end of town, furthest from the work sites, which was to include housing similar to that provided for white residents. But as Oak Ridge grew quicker than expected, those plans were abandoned and most African American residents were relegated to “hutments”: rudimentary plywood structures barely superior to tents. They were frigid in the winter – heated with crude stoves – and sweltering in the summer and offered little privacy. They lacked internal plumbing so residents had to use collective toilet facilities. Even married couples were not allowed to live together in the hutment camps. And residents were routinely subjected to more surveillance from the security authorities than those living in the more permanent neighbourhoods. By the end of the war, most of the white families had been moved out of the hutments and, as the population was then shrinking, went into more permanent housing. But many of the African American families continued to live in the basic dwellings until the early 1950s. Most African American residents were relegated to “hutments”: rudimentary plywood structures.

Moeller says: “In the postwar period, Oak Ridge, having now been settled as a place full of academics and very well-educated people otherwise, was one of the leaders in the desegregation movement in the south. In fact, two of the first public schools in the south to be desegregated were in Oak Ridge. Oak Ridge even threatened to secede from Tennessee in order to desegregate. So there was a relatively quick turnaround.” When the US dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, killing tens of thousands of people to force an end to the war, the city’s secret was out. Many residents celebrated. One local newspaper declared: “Atomic super-bomb, made at Oak Ridge, strikes Japan.” Another said: “Oak Ridge Attacks Japanese ... Workers thrill as atomic bomb secret breaks; press and radio stories describe ‘fantastically powerful’ weapon; expected to save many lives.” Not everyone was jubilant, however. Mary Lowe Michel, a typist in Oak Ridge, is quoted in the exhibition as saying: “The night that the news broke that the bombs had been dropped, there was [sic] joyous occasions in the streets, hugging and kissing and dancing and live music and singing that went on for hours and hours. But it bothered me to know that I, in my very small way, had participated in such a thing, and I sat in my dorm room and cried.” All three cities remained part of the military industrial complex, continuing to work on nuclear weapons during the cold war as well as broader scientific research; today Oak Ridge is heavily involved in renewable energy. The unique subcultures that grew during their early years of isolation also survive. Moeller observes: “These people really in many ways had to commit to create their own culture and interestingly, even to this day, some of the little theatre companies and musical troupes that were formed during world war two still exist and still operate as community cultural organisations in theses cities.” That includes “atomic culture”, or, to put it another way, gallows humour. At one of the most popular lunch spots in Oak Ridge, there are pictures of mushroom clouds on the wall. The logo of Richland high school contains a mushroom cloud. “There are pictures of atomic symbols and so on and I hasten to point out that that’s not because the residents of these communities are callous. “They realise the seriousness of the work that was done in those places during the war and afterwards during the cold war. But it’s kind of like doctors’ humour in emergency rooms. They’re somewhat notorious for being irreverent in their humor about medical conditions. It’s how they deal with the seriousness of what they do.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/02/facebook-engineer-fired-alleged-stalker-tinder","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T19:03:46Z","webTitle":"Facebook fires engineer accused of stalking, possibly by abusing data access","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/02/facebook-engineer-fired-alleged-stalker-tinder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/02/facebook-engineer-fired-alleged-stalker-tinder","fields":{"headline":"Facebook fires engineer accused of stalking, possibly by abusing data access","bodyText":"Facebook has fired a security engineer after he was accused of stalking women online possibly by abusing his “privileged access” to data, raising renewed concerns about users’ privacy at the social network. The controversy, which came to light after the employee allegedly called himself a “professional stalker” in a message to a woman he met on Tinder, is particularly bad timing for Facebook, which announced this week that it is launching an online dating feature while it continues to battle a major privacy scandal in the US and the UK. Facebook confirmed to the Guardian that the employee was terminated, but it did not provide any details on his position or the data he may have accessed, saying in a statement it was “investigating this as a matter of urgency”. The allegations emerged on Sunday in tweets from Jackie Stokes, founder of the cybersecurity consultancy Spyglass Security, who said she learned that “a security engineer currently employed at Facebook is likely using privileged access to stalk women online”. Stokes, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, posted a screenshot of text messages in which the man said that he was “more than” a security analyst, writing: “I also try to figure out who hackers are in real life. So professional stalker … so out of habit have to say that you are hard to find lol”. The woman reportedly replied: “Is that what you’re currently doing? Trying to internet stalk me?” Stokes, who said she was not the recipient of the messages, later tweeted that “many Facebook employees” had reached out to her, and she praised them for “deft handling of a dicey issue during a time when words and actions matter more than ever”. “It’s everyone’s issue when someone uses … possible privileged access to the biggest social media network of our time, and privilege of working in infosec [information security] ... to lord it over potential partners,” Stokes tweeted. Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, who gave a speech about safety at the company’s annual developer conference on Tuesday, said in a statement: “It’s important that people’s information is kept secure and private when they use Facebook. It’s why we have strict policy controls and technical restrictions so employees only access the data they need to do their jobs – for example to fix bugs, manage customer support issues or respond to valid legal requests. Employees who abuse these controls will be fired.” The company also said that access to sensitive data was logged and audited, and that when workers attempted to view this information they saw a policy warning requiring them to confirm that access was necessary. Facebook further said it had automated systems designed to detect abuse. The company has not commented on whether this engineer’s actions were ever flagged. The controversy resembles a major scandal at Uber in 2016, when a former forensic investigator at the company testified that employees regularly abused the company’s “God view” feature to spy on the movements of high-profile politicians, celebrities, personal acquaintances and ex-partners. In 2013, in the wake of the whistleblower Edward Snowden uncovering US mass surveillance operations, the National Security Agency also admitted that some of its analysts had abused the government spy tools, including by targeting exes and spouses. The news broke just as the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, revealed that the site was launching a dating app for the social network meant to rival sites like Tinder and Match.com. In unveiling the new service in a speech at the San Jose conference, Zuckerberg said: “We’ve designed this with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/25/revealed-child-labor-rampant-in-tobacco-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T05:00:52Z","webTitle":"Child labour rampant in tobacco industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/revealed-child-labor-rampant-in-tobacco-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/revealed-child-labor-rampant-in-tobacco-industry","fields":{"headline":"Child labour rampant in tobacco industry","bodyText":"Child labour in tobacco is rampant and on the increase in poorer countries, a major Guardian investigation can reveal, despite claims by multibillion-dollar companies that they are tackling the issue. Evidence from three continents shows how children aged 14 and under are kept out of school and employed in hard and sometimes harmful physical labour to produce the tobacco leaf that fills cigarettes sold internationally, including in the UK, US and mainland Europe. Families are trapped in generational poverty while salaries at the top of the industry run to millions of dollars a year. The companies say they monitor child labour and remove children from the fields to go to school, but experts have told the Guardian that the numbers are going up, not down, as tobacco growing increases in Africa and Asia. The consequences for children are lifelong. “I wanted to be a nurse,” said one 14-year-old girl in Malawi, who spends her days weeding under a hot sun with a heavy hoe. Families see no option but to use their children in the fields as unpaid labour. Many are in debt to landowners and landlords and have to stay on from one season to the next, unable to break the cycle of deprivation. “No effective actions have been taken to reverse this scenario,” said Vera Da Costa e Silva, head of the secretariat of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a key body tackling an industry that kills more than 7 million people a year. “What happens is that tobacco farming gives its profits to the industry but gives very low incomes to the tobacco growers themselves.” The tobacco firms say they are doing everything they can to end exploitative child labour. But it is a scandal for which the multinational companies have a direct responsibility, she said. “There is a double burden – the burden of child labour itself and the burden of working on a deadly product that ultimately affects the children themselves.” Silva said about 1.3 million children a year were working in tobacco fields in 2011 and, according to the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO), the numbers are rising with a shift in tobacco growing from some of the better-off countries to some of the poorer. It declined between 2000 and 2013 in Turkey, Brazil and the United States, said the report to the organisation’s governing body in February 2017, but increased in others, such as Argentina, India and Zimbabwe. Given that child labour in agriculture occurs more often in low-income countries, the ILO report said, “this shift in production may have resulted in increased child labour and other decent work deficits in tobacco production. Although there are no estimates of the number of child labourers in tobacco globally, surveys indicate that in impoverished tobacco growing communities, child labour is rampant.” The Guardian’s investigation found: In Malawi: Children being taken out of school to weed the tobacco fields and harvest the leaves by parents who live in dire poverty. Some families in straw huts are paid nothing for 10 months until the tobacco crop is sold after the harvest. They live on a pail of maize a week provided by their landlords and must raise money to mill it by extra piecework in the fields, often also done by the children. In Mexico: The Guardian saw children working in seven of 10 plantations visited in March in the Nayarit region, despite progress being made by industry and government to tackle the problem and keep children in school. In Indonesia: The Guardian visited tobacco farming communities in Lombok and talked to child workers, including a 14-year-old who told of chest health problems her family linked to working in the fields. The US Department of Labor lists 16 countries where children are suspected to work in tobacco. Human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch have documented child labor in the tobacco fields in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Brazil and most recently Zimbabwe. Experts say the very low prices paid to farmers in countries like Malawi make child labour inevitable. BAT and JTI tobacco firms say light work in the fields that does not affect health or education is acceptable for 13-15 year olds. Campaigners say they should not be anywhere near tobacco before they are 18. The average income of a tenant farmer in Kasunga, one of the biggest tobacco-growing areas of Malawi, for 10 months of work was 223,710 kwacha (roughly $380 or £286 at current rates) according to a study in 2017 by the Centre for Social Concern, a Malawian NGO. Each kilo of tobacco is estimated to provide enough for 1,200 cigarettes; tenant farmers in Kasungu last year earned 200 kawacha (30 cents or 23p) per kilo when the crop was sold. Tenant farmers are at the bottom of the tobacco food chain. They agree to work for a year for a contract farmer who has land, which he may own or have leased. That farmer’s contract is with one of the big leaf-buying companies – Alliance One, Universal (in Malawi known as Limbe Leaf) or Japan Tobacco International (JTI). The leaf-buying companies agree to purchase tobacco from their contract farmers and supply seed, fertiliser, pesticide and tools. The leaf buyers say they tell them not to employ children. Alliance One said the elimination of child labour is a “top priority”; Universal said it is committed to fighting child labour. The leaf-buyers are fulfilling orders from cigarette manufacturers – British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco. The tobacco giants have their own corporate social responsibility schemes. They say they monitor child labour and build wells or schools. But Professor Marty Otañez, of the University of Colorado in Denver, an anthropologist who has studied tobacco farming in Malawi for many years, said the welfare projects were “pushing out goodwill on behalf of tobacco companies to address some of the problems but avoid the harder issues of leaf prices and living and earnings”. All of the four major companies say they are doing what they can. “BAT takes the issue of child labour extremely seriously and agrees that children must never be exploited, exposed to danger or denied an education,” said a spokesperson. “We do not employ children in any of our operations worldwide and make it clear to all of our contracted farmers and suppliers that exploitative child labour will not be tolerated.” Imperial Tobacco said: “Child labour is unacceptable and we make every effort to stop it happening in our supply chain.” PMI called child labour an unacceptable reality. “We are committed to eliminating child labor and other labor abuses wherever we source tobacco,” said Miguel Coleta, the company’s sustainability officer. “We have been working to tackle the root causes of child labor head-on and have achieved a global reduction of child labor incidents on contracted farms over time. We welcome continued systematic scrutiny of our efforts and recognize we cannot succeed alone. This requires serious and lasting efforts by all stakeholders, including government and civil society.” JTI also said child labour was endemic to agriculture but had been decreasing in areas where it directly contracted farmers. “The reality is that child labor stems from a combination of social, economic and regulatory causes. At JTI, we don’t pretend to be able to solve the problem of child labor on our own, but we are doing our utmost to play our part in solving the problem, working with others,” the company said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/02/tsbs-prickly-paul-pester-hits-wrong-notes-in-front-of-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T18:52:44Z","webTitle":"TSB's Paul Pester hits series of wrong notes in front of MPs | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/02/tsbs-prickly-paul-pester-hits-wrong-notes-in-front-of-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/02/tsbs-prickly-paul-pester-hits-wrong-notes-in-front-of-mps","fields":{"headline":"TSB's prickly Paul Pester hits wrong notes in front of MPs","bodyText":"Paul Pester, the chief executive of TSB, had three main tasks to perform at the Treasury select committee hearing on Wednesday. First, apologise with maximum contrition for the IT shambles and the hassle caused to customers. Second, declare that he definitely won’t be getting any form of bonus this year. Third, say when the problem will be fixed. He failed on all three fronts. The formal apologies flowed (every chief executive knows the drill) but they were undercut by Pester’s combative assertions that much of TSB’s new IT system is working splendidly. The “underlying engine” is doing its job, he argued, but there were still “accessibility” issues – a bit like a shop being too small for all the customers who want to get in, he suggested. Since he was the executive ultimately responsible for commissioning the size of the shop, this explanation fell flat. When 40,000 customers have complained in 10 days, accessibility is the problem. The bonus issue should have been an open goal since even Pester, surely, can’t be expecting to collect more than his £900,000 basic salary this year. But, no, the TSB chairman, Richard Meddings, said Pester had agreed not to take any bonus “for this integration”, which left open the possibility that he could receive awards for other supposed achievements. This may not be a comfort to those overworked TSB staff struggling to handle the volume of complaints, or the complainants left hanging on the phone lines. As for when TSB will get control of the situation, nobody would offer a hostage to fortune. Once Pester had conceded there is still a problem that needs to be fixed, he wouldn’t set a date – although he inevitably wanted to lever in a reference to “improvements” arriving all the time. Only Miquel Montes, appearing for TSB’s Spanish parent, Banco Sabadell, agreed with a reference to “days” – but it sounded a long way from being a guarantee. Meddings, at least, seemed to grasp the grasp the seriousness of the TSB’s situation (perhaps because he saw a few crises during his executive days at Standard Chartered) but whether the postmortem by the law firm Slaughter and May will get to the heart of events is anybody’s guess. The true state of relations between TSB and its Spanish parent, and how much blame should fall on each party, is a crucial issue that was barely explored in the session. Instead, the lasting impression was of prickly Pester hitting a series of wrong notes. By the end, he was on to his favourite subject of how TSB will rise as a mighty challenger to the “big five” banks who enjoy too many privileges. Nicky Morgan, chair of the committee, had to remind him that, if you really want to challenge, start by running a reliable and robust operation. Quite. Bookmakers have little to moan about Damned bookmakers, they’re never happy. Their marketing departments never miss an opportunity to make exaggerated claims about being cleaned out when too many heavily backed favourites romp home at Cheltenham. Now they’re moaning about too many favourites losing – or, more specifically, Arsenal failing so often. A “sustained period of bookmaker-friendly results”, says Paddy Power Betfair, contributed to a soft first quarter. When Arsène Wenger’s heavily backed team got into the losing habit away from home, punters went into hibernation, apparently. There was “an adverse recycling impact”, meaning fewer people had winnings to blow on the next match. From the point of view of the bookmaker, this does not sound like the worst problem to have. The customers were still separated from their money, just more quickly than usual. Paddy Power, note, reckons it has still enough spare cash to spend £500m on buying back its own shares. It will live. Let it go, Mike Sports Direct is out of the headlines but the founder and chief executive, Mike Ashley, seems determined to get it back in. He’s grumbling about Iain Wright, the former chair of the business select committee that investigated working conditions at Sports Direct. Let it go, Mike: the inquiry happened two years ago, and if you didn’t want MPs turning up unannounced at your Shirebrook warehouse, you shouldn’t have said that they were “100%” free to do so. Wright isn’t even an MP these days, making Ashley’s stance doubly bizarre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/08/tax-haven-transparency-money-laundering-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T05:59:10Z","webTitle":"Tax-haven transparency won’t stop money laundering in Britain | Prem Sikka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/tax-haven-transparency-money-laundering-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/tax-haven-transparency-money-laundering-britain","fields":{"headline":"Tax-haven transparency won’t stop money laundering in Britain","bodyText":"Britain’s overseas territories are to be forced to adopt public registers of company ownership by the end of the decade. That’s a step in the right direction – and one many of us have long been calling for. But do not let the focus far afield distract you from the problem closer to home. It remains far too easy to launder money through companies in the UK. Over £90bn a year is estimated to be laundered through the UK financial system. The government recently announced reforms to tackle money laundering carried out through anonymous entities. But they will make little difference, because it is too easy to create companies in the UK, and for the most part, regulators do nothing about it. Don’t believe me? Consider, then, the story of Business Bank Italy Limited. BBIL was registered at Companies House in 2008, giving a central London street as its initial address. Since then, the bank’s registered address has changed several times, and is now in Birmingham. So far the bank has had 26 director appointments and 24 resignations. The shareholders and directors are mostly from Italy, Hungary, San Marino and Spain, and are resident outside the UK. Its website offered venture capital, wealth management and prepaid Mastercard services to the general public. Several directors have had run-ins with the Italian police. Alessandro Della Chiesa was BBIL’s first director, a position he held until 2009, and was also company secretary between 2010 and 2015. He had been on the radar of Italian police for some time, and was sentenced to six years in jail for fraud and embezzlement in 2009. Another former director, Antonio Righi (aka Tonino the Blond) had alleged links to the mafia. Righi was convicted of trafficking drugs and handling stolen goods in 2004. The carabinieri – an Italian military force charged with police duties – has been investigating Righi’s activities since 2008, and in 2016 Italian police seized the business empire of the Righi brothers. Righi is awaiting trial. Righi’s name has appeared and disappeared from a number of UK-registered companies. Most notably, he was once a director of Magnolia Fundaction UK Limited, which filed documents at Companies House stating that the name of one of its officers was “the Chicken Thief” with the occupation of “fraudster”, and another was resident at “Street of the 40 Thieves” in the town of “Ali Babba”. Companies House accepted all such returns, and in an answer to a written question, the business secretary, Greg Clark, said no action has been taken against the officers of the company for “filing inappropriate information in Italian”. BBIL is a dormant company and therefore files rudimentary accounts that barely cover one page. Its accounts say that in 2009 the company had share capital of £10m. The 2014 accounts stated that the company had a cash balance of £10m. The 2016 and 2017 filings reported share capital of £15m but said that it was “called up share capital not paid”. (In other words, there was no cash). No questions have been pursued by any regulator. This should not be happening. UK-based financial services companies, including banks, are regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). But I’ve searched for “Business Bank Italy Limited” in the financial services register maintained by the FCA and it could not be found – despite the fact that since 2009 certain sensitive words, such as “bank”, can only be used in a company’s name with the express approval of the secretary of state, although companies already registered with sensitive names were allowed to retain them. Surely, in the case of BBIL, there should have been a review of its authorisation to use the word “bank”. This has not been happening under cover of darkness. BBIL was raised in the House of Commons by Anneliese Dodds, Labour’s Treasury spokeswoman, in March. It was followed up by a written question to the chancellor asking him to explain when BBIL was authorised to conduct business, and a number of related questions. Eventually the FCA chief executive, Andrew Bailey, responded on behalf of the chancellor and said that BBIL is “not authorised by the FCA. It has never applied for authorisation with us. It is not clear if the company is carrying on any regulated activities … that would require FCA authorisation.” Despite the public revelations, BBIL has so far been allowed to retain the word “bank” in its name. Bailey confirmed that the FCA is aware of the reports about BBIL in the London Evening Standard, but would not say whether his organisation has taken any action, sheltering behind the cloak of “confidentiality” to avoid public accountability. After questions in parliament, the BBIL website has now vanished, though the company is still live. It is not known how many similar companies are still registered in the UK. The UK has at least 29 anti-money laundering regulators, with thousands of staff, yet none seem to perform checks on companies connected with questionable individuals. Individuals with criminal records can still control companies here because, the Department for Business says, “Companies House does not have powers to verify the authenticity of company directors, secretaries and registered office addresses”. So this is where we are. Ministers huff and puff about combating financial crime, but in the absence of effective action by regulators with teeth, the UK cannot win the fight against money laundering. Remember that the next time you’re told we have safeguards second to none. • Prem Sikka is professor of accounting at the University of Sheffield"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/03/choice-inequality-education-system-social-segregation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T07:00:34Z","webTitle":"‘Choice’ is code for inequality – and it has polluted our education system | Frances Ryan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/choice-inequality-education-system-social-segregation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/choice-inequality-education-system-social-segregation","fields":{"headline":"‘Choice’ is code for inequality – and it has polluted our education system","bodyText":"What price can you put on a child’s education? It depends on who that child is. New figures show the average fee for attending a top private school has now risen above £17,000 a year for the first time. In contrast, a child attending a state school in England can expect to have £4,000 to £6,000 spent on them, depending on location and additional allowances. This would be worrying in any circumstances but when we have crumbling and cramped state schools, it feels almost grotesque. While some children enjoy drama halls and swimming pools, others are trying to learn surrounded by leaks, mould and vermin. Inequality in education is not a new phenomenon. Even before vast underfunding set in, we had one of the most unequal school systems in the developed world. Private schools, remarkably, still retain charitable status, a gift from the taxpayer for retaining privilege. (The chair of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, which represents most of Britain’s leading public schools, once compared making greater links between private and state schools as a condition of their tax break to the ordeal of forced marriage.) There is also rampant inequality even within the state sector, with middle-class offspring more likely to get a better deal from a comprehensive. As Diane Reay, Cambridge University professor of education, who herself grew up on a council estate, points out, pupils in the more working-class comprehensives get less money per head, less qualified teachers, and higher levels of teacher turnover. Even if they are in the same schools as wealthier children, they tend to be in lower sets and get less experienced teachers. Throw in the introduction of academies, and this division only increases. In 2015, a Guardian investigation found that free schools received 60% more state funding per pupil (£7,761 in 2013-14) than local authority primaries and secondaries. With aching predictability, austerity measures have made this situation worse. Last year, an analysis of Department for Education data revealed that schools with the highest numbers of pupils on free school meals are facing the deepest funding cuts. Ministers have chosen to make “savings” predominantly off the back of low-income pupils in an education system that was already stacked against them. Instead of investing in existing state schools, the government has wasted money on vanity projects. Since the Conservatives’ free schools policy was introduced in 2010, it’s pushed funding from other pupils, often paying way over the odds for the land and even diverting £96m to academy budgets originally intended for improving in-need comprehensives. How has this plan worked out? This month, Plymouth studio school announced it would be the latest free school to close, only a couple of days after the Isle of Wight studio school said it would do the same due to lack of demand. The National Education Union (NEU) calculates that the latest closures bring the total to 66 new schools launched under the government’s flagship policy that have closed, partially closed or failed to open at all. “Free school” is a misnomer: while teachers are running out of paper for their classrooms, this ideological failure has cost the education budget almost £150m. Bear in mind also that free schools predominantly serve wealthier communities. Free schools and academies, just like grammar schools, educate significantly fewer children in receipt of free school meals (in fact, half of all free school meal children are educated in just a fifth of all schools). The ideology of “choice”, be it private or free school, has always been code for “inequality”. It’s an inequality that feels particularly desperate right now. Britain as a whole is becoming more and more divided, as the wealthiest individuals see their fortunes surge by hundreds of billions, while food banks are handing out a record number of parcels. Soaring child poverty is the unforgiving result of this: schoolchildren left to sleep on cardboard boxes before going to class the next morning; malnourished, tiny bodies, stuffing their pockets with food at school, or taking scraps from the school bins, because their parents can’t afford a hot meal at home. Guardian Education this week reported that deprivation has reached such a level that teachers are helping parents pay for underwear, a mattress, and even non-uniform clothes for weekends “so they can feel normal”. It is well-established that unequal societies create damage not only for the poorest but also for the whole population. The Harvard professor Ichiro Kawachi describes inequality as a “social pollutant” – a rot that breeds anything from mental health problems and loss of community to reduced wellbeing. Education – that supposed leveller and bastion of opportunity – far from providing a route to a better life in this country, is only replicating this inequality. Whether it’s tax breaks for private schools, futile free schools, or underfunded comprehensives, we are sleepwalking into an ever deepening class system – one in which a select few are given the tools to excel, and the rest are abandoned to the scraps. A time in which school inequality is deepening against a backdrop of rocketing child poverty may feel a hopeless point for progress but really, it should be a call to arms. It is not radical to say children from low-income families matter just as much as those born, on the roll of the dice, to advantage. Well-funded schools are the bedrock for a decent future – not just for some kids but for all of them. • Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/02/no-hard-brexit-not-enough-mps-martin-kettle","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T17:30:38Z","webTitle":"We won’t have a hard Brexit.

There aren’t enough MPs to back it","bodyText":"With the wonderful benefit of hindsight, the great moments of political choice can take on a deceptive inevitability. Yet in real time, these moments that make or break governments – such as Sir Robert Peel’s repeal of the corn laws, which split the Tories for a generation – are more typically the hard-fought climax of processes that follow a circuitous and up-and-down path, with the key decision put off until it is inescapable. The moment of decision for Theresa May over Brexit is following this pattern too. The route has meandered for nearly two years through negotiations, summits, law-making and elections; this week’s English elections will be part of the context too. The climax has been long predicted and frequently postponed. To judge by what Downing Street said this week, as ministers prepared for Wednesday’s cabinet committee on customs arrangements with the EU, it may well be pushed back yet again by a few weeks. Yet the moment is nearing all the same. When it finally arrives it will be bitter and destructive, above all for the Conservative party. But the Brexit terms were always going to have to be faced in some form. That form, it now turns out, will focus on the customs arrangements. Much of the commentary presumes that the outcome remains in serious doubt. Yet it seems increasingly likely that the UK will seek to remain in some form of customs association with the EU. Whether the EU will agree is, however, another matter. May has already grappled with this question twice during the Brexit negotiations. Both times it has come up in the unavoidable context of the Irish border. Both times, in December on the divorce terms with the EU and in March when a transition agreement was made, May signed up to a soft border in Ireland. The argument in cabinet this week is likewise about May’s hope of another accommodation with the EU in the form of a “customs partnership”, or its more defiant alternative, the technologically driven “maximum facilitation” or “max-fac” option. It is certainly true that the terms of the earlier deals contained significant elements of fudge. It is also true that the UK side still talks about technological max-fac solutions that the EU dismisses as fantasy. Nevertheless, unless May now abandons those two earlier agreements and unless the EU takes a much gentler line than it has done, there are only two realistic outcomes for Britain to choose from while avoiding the return of a hard border in Ireland. These outcomes are, first, the UK remaining in some form of continuing customs union with the EU or, second, Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union while Britain leaves it. The latter is opposed by Northern Ireland unionists and May dismissed it as recently as Wednesday when she said at prime minister’s questions that an Irish Sea customs border was something no UK prime minister would agree to. This leaves UK membership of the customs union – or something on similar lines – as still much the most likely outcome of the internal British political argument. Why? Because the EU has shown no interest in, and is under little internal pressure to explore, either of the alternative options being debated by British ministers, and the arithmetic in parliament is tending that way too. In the House of Lords, Tory peers have voted with the opposition parties to demand a continuing customs union. Meanwhile, in the Commons pro-European Tory MPs have put their names to pro-customs union amendments to two government bills. These would carry forward last week’s backbench debate on the same subject, on which a resolution of support for continued customs union membership was adopted without opposition. None of this guarantees that parliament will take a similar line when the votes come up in a few weeks’ time. But none of the other options is any likelier. At present, the numbers are close but in favour of the amendments. All the opposition parties (bar a small number of Labour leavers) plus the 15 or 20 declared Tory rebels would normally be enough to either defeat the government outright or to force it to accept defeat in advance, as it did this week on tax haven controls. The very fact that last month the government seemed to be flirting with making these into votes of confidence makes clear that they think they will lose them. Yet behind that admission there is a deeper and more stubborn truth. There is not a majority in the Commons for a hard Brexit. And there is no alternative prime minister to May who can deliver one, either. Short of a general election or a collapse of the negotiations, the only outcome of this process is a soft Brexit of some kind. If we see May’s purpose as being to obtain the least divisive soft Brexit for the Tory party, we are much closer to understanding what is happening. Yet there will be divisions. Some Tories will reject any soft Brexit, although no cabinet Brexiteer has said it is a resignation matter. But the issue need not bring May’s government down. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Eurosceptic sabre-rattling over the customs issue this week is a bluff she will have to call. In the end and with no small irony, the pivotal issue in Brexit is the same one that in different ways has so haunted British politics for more than two centuries – justice for Ireland. Today, peace and prosperity in Ireland depend upon a soft Brexit for which there is a parliamentary majority. A hard Brexit, with a hard Irish border, is clueless, delinquent and playing with fire, as Chris Patten put it in the Lords on Wednesday. It was a similar choice for Robert Peel. In February 1846, as the corn law repeal process neared its climax in the wake of the potato famine, Peel told his MPs: “It is absolutely necessary before you come to a final decision on this question that you should understand this Irish case. You must do so.” Then, as now, it was the right advice. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/may/18/books-that-made-me-taiye-selasi","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T09:00:55Z","webTitle":"Taiye Selasi: 'I'm ashamed not to have read The Color Purple'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/18/books-that-made-me-taiye-selasi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/18/books-that-made-me-taiye-selasi","fields":{"headline":"Taiye Selasi: 'I'm ashamed not to have read The Color Purple'","bodyText":"The book I am currently reading Chiara Barzini’s Things that Happened Before the Earthquake. I met the Italian author while I was living in Rome and fell in love with her stories: deliciously dark, unapologetically sensual. I’ve most eagerly awaited her debut novel — and it is a delight. The book that changed my life Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things. I first read Roy at university, when I was struggling to abandon the safety of studying for the wilds of creating. As a lifelong bibliophile, I’d felt that kind of passionate love before. What was new was the sense of being given permission.With her language, her wisdom, her brutal observations rendered in beautiful prose, Roy’s text gave me permission to write in a way that I’d been until then too afraid to attempt. That book suggested what might lie on the other side of my fear. The book I wish I’d written Garth Greenwell’s What Belongs to You. It does in its few perfect pages everything – absolutely everything – that I aspire to do with words. The book that influenced my writing Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being. I’ve always written in circles (I think and speak in them, too), but it wasn’t until reading this I became comfortable with the habit. I return to the book again and again. Teacher, touchstone, style guide. The book I think is most overrated No book is overrated. All books that touch a great many people do so for powerful reasons: a fabulous story, a familiar hero, a faithful account of what it is to be human. If these are the reasons that books succeed, then no success is unwarranted. The book that changed my mind When I left New York for Rome in 2012 I never imagined I wouldn’t be back. Last year – five years on – I found myself toying with the idea of return. A big city can be, for an artist, a bit like a dashing former lover: you keep thinking that you should get back together even though you know why it didn’t work. Enter Kamin Mohammadi’s Bella Figura: How to Live, Love and Eat the Italian Way – a beautiful meditation on the writer’s relocation from bustling London to bucolic Florence. It changed my mind in an instant, reminding me why I cherish slow living in southern Europe. The last book that made me cry Mira Jacob’s tender debut The Sleepwalker’s Guide to Dancing and Katja Meier’s Across the Big Blue Sea, a memoir of her work with West African refugees in Tuscany. More than any sad scene it was the profound candour of both texts that moved me deeply, the quiet portraits of lives lived far from other homes. The last book that made me laugh An Unnecessary Woman by Rabih Alameddine, and The Sellout by Paul Beatty – both wickedly funny, devastatingly so. The book I’m most ashamed not to have read Alice Walker’s The Color Purple. The books I give as a gift The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis and Teju Cole’s consummate Known and Strange Things.

After calls from politicians across Europe for the widening of the police investigation into the journalist’s death, the European commissioner for justice, Věra Jourová, announced she would be travelling to Malta within weeks. Three men are in custody and awaiting trial for planting and triggering the car bomb that killed Caruana Galizia near her home in the north of the island. The suspects have pleaded not guilty and there are heightened concerns over a lack of progress in identifying the attack’s masterminds. At a press conference to announce EU proposals on the protection of whistleblowers, Jourová said she wanted to hear about progress in the investigation on a trip “in May or June”, during which she would also discuss with officials the country’s poor record on fighting money laundering. Jourová said: “We need to see a strengthening of the financial intelligence unit in Malta. I want, of course, to inquire about the state of play in the investigation of the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.” One of Caruana Galizia’s final investigations was into a controversial Maltese government scheme that allows rich investors to acquire citizenship and visa-free access to the EU. The European commission’s first vice president, Frans Timmermans, told reporters during a joint press conference with Jourová in Brussels that the EU had limited powers to block such schemes. But, he added: “What is a European standard is that there should be a clear link between the country and the people who get the nationality. And I think this is an issue that could lead to debate, also with Malta. And the European commission won’t shy away from that debate. “If you grant citizenship to someone, that person should have a link, a demonstrable link, to your country. I think that is a question that can be raised with the Maltese authorities when discussing the passport scheme.” Malta is not the only EU member state offering individuals the right to settle for a payment. In a letter to the commission on Monday, the German MEP Manfred Weber, who leads the largest party in the European parliament, said the EU needed to act in relation to the “disturbing revelations” reported by a global consortium of news outlets, including the Guardian, into Caruana Galizia’s murder. “The people of Malta are looking to the EU for guidance and we must be able to respond,” he wrote. Meanwhile, Malta has become the first EU member state to be subjected to the scrutiny of a special rapporteur elected by the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe to scrutinise the murder investigation. Only two special rapporteurs have ever been appointed before on individual cases. Both related to political murders in Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/24/russia-neo-nazi-football-hooligans-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"The rise of Russia’s neo-Nazi football hooligans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/24/russia-neo-nazi-football-hooligans-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/24/russia-neo-nazi-football-hooligans-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"The rise of Russia’s neo-Nazi football hooligans","bodyText":"The day that Denis Nikitin, a Russian neo-Nazi who claims he once kept a framed photograph of Joseph Goebbels in his bedroom, took part in his first street fight, his mother made him a packed lunch. During the past 12 years, the Moscow-based MMA fighter has become a rising star of the far right, after brawling his way up through the ranks of one of Russia’s top hooligan firms. But on that day, Nikitin says, he was like a schoolboy on his first field trip; his mother, who thought her 22-year-old son was going to watch a football match, filled his rucksack with food and warm clothes. Nikitin took a six-hour bus ride to the match, but he had not bought a ticket. (His fellow hooligans joke that, in the past decade, he has been inside a football stadium fewer than five times.) Since his family had moved from Moscow to Germany a few years earlier, his interests had narrowed to far-right politics and violence. Nikitin’s local “team” was visiting Hamburg – a city whose left-wing supporters were a favourite target of the far-right Cologne hooligans. Nikitin’s hobbies just happened to intersect at football. At around midnight, as two buses carrying Cologne’s supporters approached Hamburg, someone shouted: “They’re here.” Through the window, Nikitin saw around 30 Hamburg hooligans in front of the vehicle. It seemed odd – the 90-odd Cologne hooligans on the buses greatly outnumbered the men outside. It would not be a fair fight. Nikitin disembarked, ran to a nearby bush, and set his rucksack beneath the branches. Then he looked up. On the guardrail of an overlooking footbridge he saw a line of silhouettes – at least 70 men, to add to the 30 in front of the coaches. An ambush, then. Nikitin remembers running toward the Hamburg hooligans. He picked out his first target and, from behind, landed a flying punch. As the man twisted in shock, Nikitin realised he had struck one of his own side. “Oh, fuck,” he shouted, “sorry, sorry, sorry, man.” The fight was chaotic; in the dark it was difficult to pick out team colours, badges or scarves. With the panic of a person who wants to immediately put right a wrong after it is made, Nikitin jumped on another silhouette and began striking him in the head. This, too, was a Cologne supporter. Blushing under his balaclava, Nikitin waited for some kind of sign. Moments later it came. One of the Hamburg hooligans came running at him, screaming abuse. Nikitin, wearing gloves lined with metal pellets, landed a sucker punch on the screamer. As the man fell to the ground, Nikitin readied a follow-up blow. Before it connected, a rival supporter pulled off Nikitin’s balaclava, and began pummelling his face. Nikitin broke free and started running for the buses, over ground scattered with fallen phones and wallets. Back at the road, only one vehicle remained; the other driver had fled. As the remaining bus pulled away, Nikitin looked at the men around him, their faces streaked with browning blood, and felt a surge of euphoria. It had not gone unnoticed that he was one of the last men to get back on board. In his leaders’ nodding approval, Nikitin experienced the first flush, not just of belonging, but of something close to a calling. “The media pretends that people like me will end up alone in prison, or as an alcoholic, or depressed,” he told me last year. “This is considered your inevitable fate as a Nazi football hooligan. It is a lie.” * * * In the summer of 2016, the Russian football hooligan, previously a provincial sort of bogeyman, padded on to the international stage at the European Championship in France. On 10 June, an estimated 150 Russians descended on Marseille’s Old Port. They moved in orderly phalanxes, greeting any England supporters they ran into with extravagant violence. One England fan had his Achilles tendons sliced. Two English men were left in a coma, one of whom was left paralysed on the left-hand side of his body (his alleged assailant, wanted for attempted murder, was arrested in Germany in February). Another man reportedly travelled home on the Eurostar with glass from a shattered bottle still lodged in his neck. “It was like nothing I’ve ever seen before,” Ch Supt Steve Neill, of Northumbria police, one of several officers deployed from England to aid French police that day, told Sky News. “The Russians came with serious intent to carry out barbaric violence. They were highly organised, very effective. We saw football hooliganism on a different level.” One Russian hooligan who took part in the fighting later told a French news agency: “The English always say they are the main football hooligans; we went to show that the English are girls.” Some Russian politicians claimed their country had been disproportionately singled out by the media and authorities (two English fans were jailed for their part in the violence). The deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko, then Russia’s sports minister, went so far as to call it a “set-up”. Other Russian public figures praised the hooligans for promoting a powerful, unassailable vision of their country to the world. “I don’t see anything wrong with the fans fighting,” tweeted Igor Lebedev, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament. “Quite the opposite: well done lads, keep it up!” At first, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, smirkingly questioned how 200 Russian supporters could see off “a few thousand Englishmen”. But the Kremlin was also aware that these same men could embarrass the nation if mass violence erupts at the 2018 World Cup, a tournament Russia will host for the first time – and the government belatedly tried to distance itself from the hooligans. After a meeting with the leaders of his own security agencies, Putin publicly stressed “the need to learn from the French experience”. Russian police gained new powers that class even minor offences, such as setting off fireworks at football games, as acts of terrorism. According to Russian newspaper reports, in December 2016, more than 100 police officers and members of the FSB, Russia’s security service, raided hooligans’ homes. Arrests duly followed, including that of Alexei Yerunov, the leader of the FC Lokomotiv firm Vikings, who had already spent several months in a French prison before returning to Russia. In all, more than 200 hooligans have been issued with court orders banning them from football matches till the end of the World Cup. Hooliganism came relatively late to Russian football, emerging in the early 1990s as a self-conscious copy of the decades-old English example – with its vicious firms, favoured clothing labels and racist chants. In a country emerging from the Soviet gloom in search of a new, assertive identity, hooliganism seemed to offer young men like Nikitin a shot of steadying nationalism, as well as a hypermasculine community that provided status and belonging. Hooliganism also presented something of a career path through the ruins of the post-Soviet economy. Politicians, especially on the far right, saw Moscow’s football thugs as a possibly forceful group of disenfranchised voters – and began to court these young men, laying on free transport to away games, paying members to work as bodyguards or street muscle, and even offering the occasional well-paid role as a party official. In time, imitation of the English developed into a new culture of thuggery. In Among the Thugs, the defining book on England’s hooliganism, published in 1990, the writer Bill Buford characterised the football yob as the “fatty manifestation of gallons and gallons of lager and incalculable quantities of bacon-flavoured crisps”. The Russians, by contrast, set down their beers and began training in earnest, not only at the gym, but also in covert fights staged in local forests, where young hooligans from rival teams would scrap in the dawn mist. It was at one of these gatherings, after an invitation from a fellow gym-goer, that Nikitin met his first hooligans, and began to learn the art of the mob brawl, first through observation, then participation. Like many of his peers, as Nikitin grew in confidence, he began to compete in and even organise MMA tournaments. Collectively, the Russian hooligans were becoming more professional. “At some point, Russian hooliganism shifted away from amateurism,” he told me when we met last autumn. In turn, fights became more deadly: in November 2017 a 30-year-old man died after his neck was broken during a clash between hooligans affiliated to teams Sibir Novosibirsk and Yenisey Krasnoyarsk. It was this well-trained force that debuted with such brutality on the international stage in Marseilles. And as the World Cup draws closer, pressure on Russian hooligans has intensified further. The Kremlin panicked after the broadcast of a BBC documentary last year called Russia’s Hooligan Army – in which the then-leader of the Spartak firm, Gladiators, Vasily “The Killer” Stepanov, was secretly filmed saying that the Moscow hooligans were Putin’s foot soldiers. Some of the men interviewed for the programme said it contained factual errors (Nikitin was assigned to the wrong firm, for instance, and Stepanov claims his views were misrepresented) – but in Russia, as one senior hooligan told me, it was “like a bomb had gone off”. Russian police issued a call for anyone featured on the documentary to report to local stations in order to sign forms stating that they were coerced by the BBC to lie on camera. (At a match the following month, Spartak fans unfurled a panoramic banner that mimicked the BBC logo, alongside the words “Blah Blah Channel”.) Last year, the Kremlin assigned an FSB agent to each of the 11 clubs in Moscow, where they work with a fan liaison officer – usually a senior hooligan from each firm – in an attempt to control their members. For hooligans who have for years had the backing of the authorities, both tacit and explicit, this reversal feels like a betrayal. “For 10 years we were supported by the government,” said Alexander Shprygin, who took part in hooligan fights starting in 1994, and who chartered a plane and flew a cadre of Russian hooligans to Marseille in 2016. “After France, the government stopped supporting us.” But the obsessive focus on violence at the World Cup – not least from UK tabloids – has overshadowed the real significance of Russian hooliganism. For two decades, Russia’s firms have been a machine for recruiting and radicalising young men to the far right, which has seeded racist ideology at the centre of the country’s football culture. They may have been forced underground, but Russia’s powerful firms are not likely to vanish – and their influence will take decades to erase. “After the summer,” Shprygin told me, “everybody will forget about us.” * * * Shprygin was turned away from his first football match at the age of nine. He had come to watch his team, FC Dynamo, play at the Central Dynamo Stadium in Moscow, but unaccompanied children were denied entry. So the next week, he convinced an older man outside the gates to pose as his father. Once inside, he recalled, Shprygin was immediately attracted to the loudest and most fanatical supporters – the ultras – and began to regularly sit among them. Young, isolated and with few career prospects, Shprygin was the ideal hooligan recruit. In August 1993, when he was 14, one of the older men approached him with news of a plan to found one of Russia’s first firms: Blue White Dynamite. As its membership grew, BWD’s members began to seek out and attack rival ultras. At first, these clashes, usually staged in Moscow’s vaulted subway stations, were modest. But when fans of Moscow’s best-known club, Spartak, formed a rival firm, the violence escalated in both severity and scope; skirmishes sometimes involved 500 participants. “By 1995, every Moscow football club had a firm,” recalled Shprygin. “The fights became much larger.” As the numbers swelled, smaller firms broke off from the larger groups, creating a network of distinct, yet interlinked gangs. Today, the largest of the Russian capital’s 11 football clubs, Spartak Moscow, has three major firms – Union, Shkola and Gladiators – each with an associated youth division. Beyond these, a constellation of smaller splinter groups operate under the Spartak umbrella. One senior hooligan estimates that there are as many as 500 active members of Spartak-affiliated firms. By collaborating with one another as the need arises, Spartak’s firms are able to raise a small army under their team’s banner. This collective power was first demonstrated in 1999, when Spartak played an away game against Saturn Ramenskoye. When Spartak conceded its first goal in the 23rd minute, violence began to bubble in the stands: jostling grew into a few fistfights and, eventually, a full-scale riot. For the first time in Russian football history, the match was stopped due to fighting in the stands. Footage of the event shows some police beating Spartak fans in the head with batons, while others struggle to pull their colleagues away. In August 1998, Shprygin, who was by then editor of Dynamo’s fan magazine, claims he received a message on his pager asking him to call a mysterious number. It was a meeting request from a prominent rightwing opposition politician. The next day Shprygin claims he visited the State Duma, the lower house of the federal assembly of Russia. In the lobby, he saw one of the hooligan leaders from Spartak Moscow. The pair were ushered into the politician’s office and offered jobs as his assistants. Shprygin’s role was to act as a liaison between the politician and the firm, who would routinely provide security for his party. “We were never fists of the party, per se,” Shprygin explained, when we met in a football-themed pub in Moscow. But, he claims, they would provide the politician with security, and in return, his party would pay for buses and trains to take the hooligans to away fixtures. No money changed hands, but Shprygin says the expectation was clear: the fans would thereafter vote for the party in elections, and fight when called upon. The arrangement proved useful for Shprygin’s career. In 2007, at the behest of the FSB, he says, he founded a group called the Union of Russian Fans. Despite his rising fortunes in politics at the time (Shprygin has been photographed with Putin on at least three separate occasions, before his alleged involvement in the Marseille violence led to his arrest) Shprygin continued to be actively involved in street violence. Shortly after founding the union, Shprygin and other members of his firm were invited by a far-right group of skinheads to meet up in a local park. The plan, it was explained, was to attack hip-hop concertgoers as they left a venue. “Rap is black music,” Shprygin told me, by way of explanation. “So we went to the park and we waited.” That night he took part in his first street violence aimed at people outside of football. Shprygin’s progression is common. “Many ultras are sympathetic to radical nationalists and some even take part in their activities,” said Mikhail Akhmetiev, a professor at Sova, a Moscow-based thinktank that studies nationalism and racism in Russia. “The former head of Spartak’s Fratria fan community, Ivan ‘Combat’ Katanaev, and the head of the Gladiators firm Vasily ‘The Killer’” Stepanov are involved in ultra-conservative activities,” he said. In recent years there has been a marked increase in so-called “white wagon” attacks, where groups of racists wearing surgical masks and balaclavas board trains and attack anyone of non-Slavic descent. A 2014 report from Sova reports that white wagon operations are committed “at least partly by football supporters”, and are “more likely to occur on match days”. For young men who, like Shprygin, become entranced by the older fans at matches, the route to radicalisation is quick and clear, and there has been no shortage of political entities eager to co-opt and leverage these fans. For Nikitin, hooliganism is inextricable from far-right activism. After he returned to Russia in the 2000s, radicalised by his time fighting in German hooligan circles, he became increasingly involved in violence against immigrants. He split his time between fighting hooligans and attacking minorities in the streets. When, during one of our meetings in Moscow last year, I asked Nikitin whether there was a difference between hooligan violence and racist violence, he told me to switch off my recorder. “If we kill one immigrant every day, that’s 365 immigrants in a year,” he said, after agreeing that I could record again. “But tens of thousands more will come anyway. I realised we were fighting the consequence, but not the underlying reason. So now we fight for minds, not on the street, but on social media.” * * * Football, with its tribal communities and martial symbolism, has long been a battleground for minds. A draft Home Office paper on English football hooliganism, published in October 2000, described the atmosphere at England’s international fixtures as like “watching a football match during a Nuremberg rally” – a hostile climate that was decades in the making. In 1981, for example, the National Front published a magazine about music and sport that included a section titled the League of Louts, in which football hooligans were invited to compete to have their club labelled the most racist in Britain. Readers were encouraged to hurl bananas on to the pitch whenever a black player was fielded. As Derek Holland, an organiser for the far-right group, once put it, the aim of targeting football fans was to “win the hearts and minds of young people”. “The old National Front thing was that you didn’t count England goals that were scored by black players,” explains Mark Perryman, a British academic and author of Hooligan Wars. “In the 70s there was a generalised racism and xenophobia which was a reflection of the popularity of the National Front, which had a strong base in certain clubs.” Some football hooligans became members of neo-Nazi organisations at the time, such as Combat 18, while, in the early 1990s, members of the Headhunters, one of Chelsea’s best-known firms, would provide muscle for fascist events. It was only following sustained anti-fascist campaigns at English clubs that racist violence around football began to subside. In Russia, hooligan racism did not generally face this kind of organised ideological opposition. “There were far more of them than there were of us,” says Maxim Solopov, a journalist who took part in anti-fascist clashes with Russian hooligans between 2006 and 2010. Without the intervention of police, anti-fascists like Solopov took the fight to the streets, placing informants in each of the different fan groups. “They would tell us where their groups were going to appear,” he said. “The first rule was to engage first. We were always trying to instigate the fights, to give us an advantage.” The first street fight Solopov attended, in autumn 2006, took place in central Moscow, outside the offices of the ministry for internal affairs. “We had girls acting as lookouts,” he recalled. “When the hooligans arrived, a row of antifa approached them with gas pistols.” Solopov, who was standing in the second line, broke a bottle over the head of a neo-Nazi. “Time collapsed,” he told me. “Ten seconds felt like for ever. I could see everything that was happening, every tiny detail.” The far-right hooligans, he says, were wielding knives. “The hooligans were attacking people not merely to scare, but to kill,” he said. Without any concerted challenge from clubs, rightwing extremism in Russian football has endured. Nazi imagery remains rife on the terraces, according to a 2017 report from Fare, a network of groups set up to combat discrimination in and around the game: “Football fans use other neo-Nazi symbols such as the Celtic cross, SS Totenkopf and the symbols of rightwing Slavic neopaganism.” Sightings of historical Nazi slogans, such as “My honour is loyalty” – the motto of the SS – and “Jedem das Seine” (“To each what he deserves”, a German proverb written above the gates of the Buchenwald concentration camp) are also common. The same report notes that, during the 2015-16 season, xenophobic attacks at matches “increased significantly”. In May 2017, the head of the Russian Football Union disciplinary committee, Artur Grigoryants, claimed there had been “no racist manifestations” during the 2016-17 season – but the authors of the Fare report clarified that “in fact he meant that there were no monkey chants”. (If true, even that moratorium was short-lived: last month there were monkey chants directed toward black French players at a friendly match in St Petersburg.) To change the international perception of Russian football fans, the Kremlin has hired PR agencies that have planted so-called gentle fans who distribute sweets, warm tea and blankets at matches and post cheery selfies on Instagram. Despite these public displays, some believe that the government continues to support hooligans in private. “It’s true that the government is trying to clean up the image of football ahead of the World Cup,” says Solopov. “But they are far more concerned that something like the Ukrainian revolution might happen here, and that, if it does, the rightwing hooligans will take to the streets against the authorities. So in private, they still support violent fan groups. I believe that political power remains in the hands of the rightwing fans.” The appointment of a so-called fan liaison officer in every club shows that the Kremlin believes it can control the hooligans. “The clubs appoint real hooligan leaders hoping they can keep the hooligans under control at important matches,” says Pavel Klymenko, who works for Fare. It is not clear the extent to which the system is effective, or even how it works. It may be difficult for the state to control what it earlier turned a blind eye toward. “The state believed that [hooligan groups] were an organised force that could be used to maintain order,” said Yuri Abrashov, a former police colonel who is now the executive director of Event Safety, a government body that organises stewarding at sporting events. “But these groups made promises that were not being fulfilled.” Despite the FSB monitoring, the bans and other efforts to crack down on far-right hooligan activity, there is still a legitimate risk of violence at the World Cup. “There might not be any pre-planned organised attacks because the hooligans are afraid of the security services,” says Klymenko. “But the way their structures work means it is not that easy to control everyone.” * * * On a drenched October afternoon, 40 minutes outside the centre of Moscow, near the dour Rostokino train station, I accompanied Nikitin along the railway tracks and down a slicked incline, into the woods, to a popular location for hooligan forest fights. Though bareknuckle fistfights were outlawed by the Bolsheviks in 1917, in recent years hooligans have resurrected the nationalistic tradition of Russian forest fighting, known as Stenka na Stenku. The practice, which provides a relatively low-risk entry point for young fighters to join the hooligan ecosystem, has spread throughout Europe, and forest fights are now part of hooligan culture from Ukraine to Switzerland. “You sometimes hear of fatalities,” says Nikitin. “But I don’t believe anyone has died. That said, I recently had to help a guy whose lung had been punctured.” When Nikitin first heard about forest fights, he had no interest in football or violence (he was, he admits, “into breakdancing”). “It seemed so stupid,” he says. “Surely it’s just idiots who have nothing better to do.” Then, when he was 23, a friend at his local gym invited Nikitin to a forest fight. “He seemed like a normal guy, so I become interested. I started asking him questions and he told me that it’s the best hobby anyone can pursue.” Nikitin, who says he rarely fought at school, was a natural. “I liked the atmosphere, the adrenaline, the need to be alert.” Nikitin is broad-set and with a network of scars on his forehead. As we walked, he kept one hand in the chest pocket of his bomber jacket, where he kept a knife. We tripped along a mud path till eventually, a few hundred metres past the treeline, Nikitin stopped and gestured toward the clearing we had come to look at. Here, Nikitin explained, every few weeks in the early morning, 30 or so men will gather. They arrive in separate groups, divided according to the football team they each support (in chaotic street fights the hooligans use a codeword to show which side they are on), and huddle at either end of the clearing to discuss tactics. After a while, the men form two opposing lines, 20 metres apart. Some limber up on the spot; others hold tins of ammonia to their noses, to heighten their senses. Around the clearing stand other, older men, their arms crossed, watching what’s happening with the keenness of talent scouts. Some will film the action, to be reviewed later – footage occasionally appears on YouTube. A whistle blows and the two groups pad toward each other. They move slowly at first, clapping their hands to show that they are not carrying weapons, before speeding to a sprint. The lines smash into each other, before peeling off into one-on-one skirmishes. Some fighters go down easily, perhaps hoping to avoid serious damage. Their lack of ambition is noted by the watching scouts; they will never again be invited back. Others crumple with real injuries. After just a few minutes, it becomes clear which side still has fighters standing, and has won. Some limp home or off to hospital. Those who have proven their talent for violence in the forest may be invited into the firm, and, from this boot camp, on to the street. When his family returned to Russia in the late 2000s, Nikitin began to look for a new team and firm. The owner of a clothing store, to whom Nikitin sold Thor Steinar clothing, a German label closely associated with neo-Nazi groups, asked if he would like to join a Spartak firm, which was due to fight another team from St Petersburg. “But before that fight took place, another of my friends invited me to fight for another team, CSKA,” he recalled. “So I just started fighting for the other side. I never gave a shit about football teams, you know?” Once a hooligan has chosen his team, however, there can be no switching. When one Spartak hooligan switched sides a few years ago, his previous firm threateningly unfurled a giant banner bearing his name and face at the next match. At CSKA, Nikitin soon began to rise through the ranks. In 2016, he received his pin, a badge of honour awarded for long and effective service that, he estimates, only 20% of the team’s hooligans have received. While we waited for a car back to central Moscow, as night fell, Nikitin claimed that a forest fight would often be the mere start of the day’s violence. “After a forest fight, I would often say to the guys: ‘OK, who wants to go kick some immigrants?’” he recalled. “Most of them would reply: ‘Yeah, we can do that.’” A few days later, at a Viking-themed restaurant in central Moscow, his knife resting on the table, Nikitin explained that, in recent months, his interest in street violence has lessened as he has come to realise it is an ineffective way to disseminate and implement his views. “Across Europe hooliganism is on the extreme rise right now,” he says. “But in Russia, it’s in decline” – thanks in part to the unwanted attention of this summer’s World Cup. To help inspire a new generation of football hooligans, Nikitin launched his own clothing label, White Rex, which is marketed to hooligans and neo-Nazis. (In 2013, a convicted criminal who calls himself Tesak wore a White Rex shirt in a video he filmed of himself attacking a gay man.) From the gym, to the forest, to the street, Nikitin’s far-right ideology has been nurtured and intensified by football hooliganism. And now through his own business, he’s promoting these values to younger men, some of whom he hires to model his clothes. Just as racism’s grip on English football has slowly loosened since the 1990s, attitudes may eventually shift in Russia as well, but it could take decades to undo what the hooligans have helped create. A few people suggested to me that attitudes among the youngest fans may already be starting to change. “Some are losing interest in the rightwing movement,” says Solopov, the former anti-fascist demonstrator turned journalist. “They want to just follow football. It’s happening slowly, but they are becoming apolitical.” But these young fans will grow up in a footballing culture steeped in nationalist racism and promiscuous violence. The present crackdown on Moscow’s hooligans may halt the violence that put Russia’s firms in the spotlight. But the obsessive fixation on whether English fans will be met by gangs in Volgograd risks missing the much larger story: the hooligans, with the opportunistic backing of the government that’s now trying to bring them under control, have promoted and normalised the racism of the far right. * * * On a lazy, sunny October afternoon, Spartak’s second team jogged on to the field to face off against Luch Vladivostok. A couple of haggard sports journalists squinted unsmilingly at their notepads. In front of them, a seated line of elderly men in identikit beige sports jackets sipped from water bottles. Behind the Vladivostok goalkeeper, a platoon of young Spartak fans, arranged in neat rows, started up a braying chant. There were maybe 15 boys here, between the ages of 12 and 17; trainee ultras who showed up to support the trainee-players on the field. The Spartak fans cycled through about five chants. Some of the precariously held tunes I recognised as English football chants, rewritten with loosely scanning Russian words. Others sound like old Soviet folk-songs. The singing was led by Arkady (not his real name), a boy with an unlovely yet muscular voice and a Beatles-ish mop. He rocked on his heels, head back, eyes closed, almost prayerfully, while the other boys followed his cues. The half time whistle blew and, finally, the Spartak boys fell quiet, and settled into their plastic chairs. An announcer politely asked, through the crackling tannoy, that supporters refrain from shouting racist slogans. Arkady is, by his own admission, a Spartak superfan. “I stand in the apolitical part of the stadium,” he said. “The firms and forest fights aren’t for me. Too many of those guys have been banned from coming to matches.” But boys like Arkady have learned what it means to be a football fan in a climate defined by men like Nikitin and Shprygin. In the second half, Spartak’s standout player was Sylvanus Nimely, a 19-year-old striker from Liberia, one of only two black players on the field – who showed untiring commitment even after his side was reduced to 10 men. At one point, when Nimely streaked forward with the ball, a Vladivostok player slid in from behind and the Liberian international crumpled to the ground, rolling in agony on his back as his teammates clustered around. Arkady whispered something conspiratorial to his crew. Then he leaned back and emitted a low “Ooooooh.” The note gathered and grew in volume as each boy in turn added his voice to the crescendo. And then, in unison, with faces as clean as cherubs, they began to sing a racist song. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2018/apr/24/tim-schafer-career-video-games-bafta-fellowship","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T05:30:11Z","webTitle":"Tim Schafer: 'There were so many occasions when I thought my career in games was over'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/apr/24/tim-schafer-career-video-games-bafta-fellowship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2018/apr/24/tim-schafer-career-video-games-bafta-fellowship","fields":{"headline":"Tim Schafer: 'There were so many occasions when I thought my career in games was over'","bodyText":"We went through a period in the games industry where I felt I was being shamed for doing story. It was like, all games should be Deus Ex, all games should be design-driven and systemic. Interactivity is what’s unique about games, a powerful tool that can’t be ignored, but I don’t like limited ideas about what games “should” be. It annoys me because there are so many different people playing games who like them for completely different reasons. Gamers aren’t just one thing. I learn a lot from my daughter. She likes to play little choose-your-own-adventure games when we go out to restaurants. While we’re waiting for our food to come, I’ll take her on imaginary dungeon crawls: I’ll say, “Okay, you’re in a cave, and in one direction you can hear a growling noise and in another you can hear dripping water – where do you go?” She got really into them and wanted to do them for me – and hers were so much more creative than mine. Mine are all dungeons and dragons and ghosts, but in hers anything could happen! I like that people in the games industry are taking diversity more seriously. If you looked around the room at the Baftas, there were so many powerful women ... you’re really missing something if you’re not seeing this. Games are for everybody now and games can cover all topics – there’s been a small group that’s controlled games for a long time and not everyone is like them. “No, everyone in this game should be white” is such a fucking silly thing to fight for – how weird, what do you gain from that? But there are so many new stories and topics and experiences that can be gained from letting people in. Revisiting the old LucasArts games is the opposite of what I usually try to do, which is immediately forget what I just worked on and then do something completely different. I don’t want to be lost in nostalgia. But it had been 20 years, and after that amount of time I thought, okay, it’s fair. We went back to the original musicians and artists and programmers to get help with the remasters and it was like a team reunion. That’s what those memories are about – you play one of those games and you remember sitting in a room with these people, solving problems that were really tough – and you realise how each game was such a miracle; that coming together of that exact group of people at that time, because none of us could have made those games without the others. There was a time when getting respect for artists was a struggle. In the early days, programmers ran the show – they did everything and they’d get angry at the artists for thinking they were an important part of the process. It seems strange now because artists are so important to games. I try to keep mutual respect at Double Fine, because games really are a great collaboration between different artistic and technical disciplines. The things I think are most important are great ideas and inspiration – they’re precious because they don’t come all the time. They are like magic fairies that fly through once in a while, and you’ve got to catch them in a jar or you lose them. If you want to be creative you can’t put anything else above that process. Sometimes your first dumb ideas are the best ones. Your brain is always trying to censor them, but those ideas are often the ones with the most flavour. I think comedy in games is more about giving the comedy tools to the player and making them feel like they’re the comedian. People liked that in Monkey Island; Guybrush always had a witty response and they felt almost like they had come up with it. With our next game Psychonauts 2 I’m doing most of the writing. I try to keep myself engaged with the parts of production I like the most, like writing and brainstorming. A lot of people who’ve had success doing something creative can get pulled into the nuts and bolts of raising money, business development and production – that can be powerful because you get to make important choices to protect the creativity, but it can also lead you into a situation where you wake up one morning and go, what am I doing? This doesn’t inspire me! There were so many occasions when I thought my career in games was over. When I started my company, I signed a big game with Microsoft, one that burned a lot of money, and then it got cancelled. We’d crunched for four years already and now we were going to go out of business, and what were those four years about, and what are these 40 people going to do? We just fought and fought, and got it re-signed. But at one point we had no prospects, we were out of money and I stood in front of the staff and said, next Wednesday’s payroll is the last one. Just then my throat closed up and I couldn’t talk and everyone was sat there in silent ... it was the brutal end. It was horrible. We don’t want to be like the publishers we’ve had trouble with in the past. Most publishers are investing the money of your shareholders and have to look at every project and think, how am I going to turn this dollar into 35 dollars? That’s not our priority – we want to be financially successful but we’re not only looking at that. If you want to be making money you should probably just invest in some fund. We want to do what the company has always done throughout its history: encouraging and supporting and fighting for creativity. We want to fight for developers who see making games as a labour of love. Just like us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/23/veggie-sausage-food-france-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T12:41:48Z","webTitle":"I want to eat a 'veggie sausage', not a 'mycoproteinous food tube' | Phoebe-Jane Boyd","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/veggie-sausage-food-france-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/veggie-sausage-food-france-ban","fields":{"headline":"I want to eat a 'veggie sausage', not a 'mycoproteinous food tube'","bodyText":"Mycoprotein, fusarium venenatum, fermentation, albumen, cultures, coagulating, curdling – these aren’t tasty words. Some of them are quite disgusting, actually. But if you’re vegan or vegetarian and incorporate meat substitutes into your daily diet, you’ll recognise them as the words in tiny font on the side of the packaging, you might even know how some of them are made. If you think about them too much, they can conjure up disturbing images of unformed Soylent growing in the dark, festering away like dark sludge to form unnatural shapes … We don’t have to think about all this, of course, because more palatable descriptors are used for the purposes of marketing, such as “bean curd sausage”, “tofu steak”. The name-substitutes given instead of “gelatinous fungus” are like kind lies; distancing what we put in our mouths from the reality of how it came into being. But these kind lies appear to be on the way out, following the vote by French MPs on Thursday to ban producers of vegetarian meat substitute from using meat-related phrasing in their descriptions. Products not partly or wholly composed of meat can’t be “steak”, “bacon”, or “sausage” any longer, just in case it’s “misleading” for consumers. This assumes, though, that no one has ever tasted both meat and meat substitute. Because anyone who has tasted, seen, or smelled them both knows. You know the difference between the look and texture of a meat steak – ribbons of white fat running through deep, pink flesh – and a meat-substitute steak – an amorphous beige lump that looks like it’s travelled from an outer limits hellscape. Fake bacon? Nothing like actual bacon; it’s a chewy slab of something (we can’t call it cardboard – cardboard has a texture) that vaguely tastes of bacon crisps, and smells a bit like cinnamon when cooked. Soya mince – cut-up rubber bands mixed with a yeasty flavour. If you use substitutes, you know what they are, and that they can be enjoyed just fine as part of a full meal. Some of us love them. However, associating these products with meat – even with meaty words – just isn’t right, according to the new regulation. “It is important to combat false claims, our products must be designated correctly,” said French MP Jean-Baptiste Moreau on the issue. But since when has food been described correctly or honestly? Is there going to be a change across the whole of the food industry? Dairy milk isn’t going to be described on the bottle as “mammary secretions” (thank goodness), even though that’s what it is. Beef is not yet “carcass” or “body part”, and offal is not “viscera”. Pork has not become “parts of pig”. Pig, cow, and sheep are more easily divorced in the mind from what arrives on plates when they’re called “pork”, “beef”, and “mutton” instead (just ask the children who don’t know that bacon comes from pigs, or what fish fingers are made of). You don’t have to think about it if you don’t want to. “Sausage”, “burger” and “steak” further remove the foodstuff from the animal they come from. They’re words that make the disconcerting worth eating – also lies, of a sort. They’re not as big as a Soylent Green lie, but they’re not upfront honesty either. It turns out that the truth just isn’t tasty, whether you eat meat or not. I don’t want to eat a tofu tube, instead of a sausage. Or disks, or balls, spheres, slop, chunks – I’m running out of words that could be used to describe coagulated soy milk pressed into white blocks of matter. I like the shorthand of words like “sausage” and “steak” for substitutes, because I don’t want to eat something that sounds like it came out of a horror film. If meat producers can distance consumers from the reality of where their products come from, the substitute industry should be able to do the same. Otherwise, what will we all eat instead when confronted with the unvarnished truth of what our food is? An apple?

But unlike, say, hate speech, terrorism advocacy or child pornography, fake news is a tricky area for the law: it has not, generally, been illegal – and in democracies, political speech is seen as deserving the strongest of free speech protections. Lawyers, technology experts, media representatives and free speech campaigners have expressed fears that hastily drawn-up domestic measures outlawing fake news may at best prove ineffective, and at worst counterproductive. “All too often, legislation focuses on the trees, not the forest,” said Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law. “It’s quite likely to end up being irrelevant, or even to exacerbate the root causes of the fake news phenomenon.” Infinitely easier and cheaper to produce and spread than ever before, fake news is also “low-hanging fruit” for politicians, Alemanno said: “They can talk to voters about it, whereas tackling the underlying, structural reasons why it’s so pervasive in our society and media environment is far, far harder.” From Europe to Asia, leaders are rushing to adopt anti-fake news laws. France – where “fake news”, necessarily narrowly defined so as to protect free speech, has been illegal since 1881 – aims to allow judges to order the deletion of false online content in election periods. The legislation will also oblige social media platforms to name advertisers who are financing content, and say how much they are paying, and permit France’s independent broadcasting authority to suspend media seen as trying to destabilise a vote, notably if “influenced by foreigners”. Germany earlier this year also introduced an online hate speech law, giving platforms with more than 2 million users 24 hours to remove “obviously illegal” terror content, racist material and fake news or face fines of up to €50m (£44m). Other offensive material must be blocked with seven days. Other EU countries including Sweden, Ireland and the Czech republic are weighing or implementing anti-fake news legislations. But as campaigners warn such laws could curb free speech or lead to inadvertent censorship, regimes often highly sensitive to media criticism stand accused of using similar legislation to try to silence free expression and opposition groups. Criticised for mounting a “full-frontal assault on mainstream journalism”, India last month abruptly withdrew, 24 hours after it was unveiled, a sweeping new order allowing the suspension of any journalist so much as suspected of spreading fake news (which it did not define). But Malaysia has passed a law setting fines of up to £88,000 and jail terms of up to six years for offenders who use traditional news outlets, digital publications and social media – including outside Malaysia – to spread fake news. Opponents have said the law takes the country “one step close to a dictatorship”. Thailand, too, has a cybersecurity law making the spread of false information liable to a jail term of up to seven years, while Singapore is preparing a report on measures to counter “deliberate online falsehoods” and the Philippines is mulling anti-fake news legislation that would punish offenders with up to 20 years in jail. Besides legislation, civil society measures being increasingly adopted to counter fake news, including fact-checking and debunking, also may not ultimately prove effective, Alemanno said. “The problem here is simply that fact-checkers don’t step in until after publication, by which time it’s too late.” Lisa-Maria Neudert of the Oxford Internet Institute, who specialises in countermeasures to computational propaganda, agreed: “Will a fact-checked story simply increase the visibility of the original? Will it be seen by the same people? Will it be believed? There’s a credibility problem. People don’t necessarily believe mainstream media and political elites.” With partners, the media freedom watchdog Reporters sans Frontières has launched the Journalism Trust Initiative, a possible future certification system that would promote rigorous and reliable journalism through standards covering transparency and trust issues such as ownership, independence, revenue sources, journalistic methods and compliance with ethical norms. “Two once-distinct arenas – the media, and public debate – have merged and changed,” said RSF’s director, Christophe Deloire. “False and reliable information now circulates in the same channels, and ‘bad’ news circulates faster than ‘good’. We have to give a real advantage to those who produce reliable journalism.” Deloire said he was not opposed to “a good balance between self-regulation and regulation”. But as the EU prepares to unveil a plan for voluntary self-regulation by internet giants such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, with the threat of laws to follow if they fail to comply, experts doubt that simply demanding the platforms take responsibility is a long-term solution. “There are questions around the time and resources social networks will put in to do that job, and also whether they are necessarily the best judges of the material,” said Neudert. “In France, decisions will be made by judges on a on a case-by-case basis, so there will at least be juridical oversight. But there are obviously gaps, and it’s very hard to see how it will work ... Extending existing laws and definitions into the online sphere can be difficult. And now authoritarian regimes can point to democracies taking these steps.” Alemanno said a big part of the problem was the social media platforms’ business model. “The push has to come from the platforms, but the way they make their money – increasing reader engagement, and monetising their data – means they have no incentive to play the role of arbiters of truth,” he said. “That may change, eventually. But rather than top-down, prescriptive laws, we should be thinking about changing the environment in which readers act, and empowering them: displaying related, fact-checked articles next to disputed stories; apps allowing users to check for veracity; certification systems.” For Naudert, the platforms are slowly “shifting their thinking”, realising that a pay-per-click model may not be the best guarantee of their long-term success. “What’s needed most,” she said, “is more transparency, all round. This is a societal, media and technological problem. Pointing the finger at just one actor won’t help.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/23/irish-emigrants-urged-hometovote-in-abortion-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T12:15:21Z","webTitle":"Irish emigrants urged #HomeToVote in abortion referendum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/irish-emigrants-urged-hometovote-in-abortion-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/23/irish-emigrants-urged-hometovote-in-abortion-referendum","fields":{"headline":"Irish emigrants urged #HomeToVote in abortion referendum","bodyText":"Irish emigrants are being urged in a new video to travel home to vote in favour of overturning the country’s constitutional ban on abortion in a referendum next month. The London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign has released the two-minute video, filmed in six countries, to encourage Irish citizens abroad to exercise their right to vote in the historic referendum on 25 May. About 40,000 out of an estimated 750,000 Irish people living abroad are thought to be eligible to vote. Only those who have been abroad for 18 months or less, and who intend to return to live in Ireland may vote, and they must register in advance and vote in person. Three years ago thousands of Irish citizens returned home to vote on same-sex marriage legislation, boosting the remarkable two-thirds majority for changing the law. James Hooper, who wrote the film, said: “We want it to encourage a tide of people back home, united not just by their destination, but by their common goal. We wanted to recapture that energy [of the same-sex marriage referendum] and show people they have the power to enact real change.” Claire McGowran of the London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign said: “This referendum could be lost or won on one vote. Every trip home matters, so if you’re eligible to vote please come home. “We’ve heard from voters who are travelling from as far away as south-east Asia and Australia. The fact that people are willing to journey thousands of miles, shows the strength of feeling behind the yes campaign.” The referendum will ask whether article 40.3.3 of the Irish constitution – known as the eighth amendment – should be repealed. This gives a foetus the same rights to life as a pregnant woman, and has been in place since 1983, enshrining in the constitution a ban on abortion, even in cases of rape and fatal abnormality of the foetus. If it is overturned, legislation giving women an unrestricted right to abortion up to the 12th week will be introduced. Since 1983 an estimated 170,000 Irish women have travelled to the UK to terminate their pregnancies, and up to 2,000 women a year end pregnancies by taking the abortion pill, illegally obtained online. An opinion poll last week showed a clear majority in favour of repealing the eighth amendment – 47% of voters said they would vote yes, while 28% said they would vote no, although support for the yes campaign has slipped by nine percentage points since January. One in five voters were as yet undecided, according to the poll conducted for the Irish Times by Ipsos Mori. Support for repeal is highest among younger, urban, female and higher income voters. In May 2015, Irish citizens travelled from as far as Australia to vote in the equal marriage referendum. Hundreds posted pictures and accounts of their journey on social media under #HomeToVote, the same hashtag being used in the 2018 campaign."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/25/kyotographie-in-japan-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T09:00:43Z","webTitle":"Kyotographie in Japan – photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/25/kyotographie-in-japan-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/25/kyotographie-in-japan-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"Kyotographie in Japan – photo essay","bodyText":"As the cherry blossom fades in Kyoto, attention turns to a visual spectacle of a different kind: the annual Kyotographie photo festival. Showing the work of 15 leading international photographers in unique locations, this year’s theme, Up, centres on a subtle call to action. The festival’s directors, Lucille Reyboz and Yusuke Nakanishi, say participants were asked to illustrate how social change can be encouraged through self-awareness, action and creation. The use of unusual architectural spaces, from a disused printing works to the sanctuary of a temple, gives the festival a distinct flavour and adds another atmospheric dimension to each photographer’s work. Gideon Mendel’s Drowning World The South African-born photographer’s installation, presented in a former ice factory and anchored by a series of portraits and video exploration of devastated living spaces, seeks to connect people affected by flooding and the catastrophic impact of industrial and environmental change. The Tidelines series is a collection of water-damaged photographs that provide a moving testament to the memories of family life before the floods. Alberto García-Alix’s Irreductibles Exhibited in the depths of the disused ice factory is the astonishingly personal work by Alberto Garcia-Alix. Renowned for his raw, hedonistic portraiture, the maverick Spanish photographer’s early images focus on some of the people in his life. The photos set the scene for a dreamlike, retrospective film that is woven together with video, still images and his poetic narration, detailing a life led against the grain of convention and the lost aspirations of youth. Play by Masahisa Fukase Regarded as one of the most radical and influential photographers of his generation, the Fukase retrospective is a festival highlight. The extensive exhibition features the acclaimed series Ravens, which explores the artist’s battle with depression, as well as his vivid photographs showing the wild side of his beloved cat, Sasuke. The jewel in the crown is his early colour work, which was previously published but never exhibited. Viewed in its entirety, the Fukase display gives a deeper understanding of the variety and complexity of the photographer’s work. Izumi Miyazaki’s Up to Me Izumi Miyazaki, one of the rising stars of the festival, is also the star of her work. Reminiscent of Magritte, at first glance her vivid use of colour and character seems whimsical, but her intent is a serious exploration of surrealism that leaves the viewer charmed and unsettled in equal measure. Miyazaki draws inspiration from her daily life, including what she has eaten. Hatarakimono Project by K-Narf The Kyoto central wholesale market is the inspired venue for K-Narf’s tribute to the proud work ethic that is respected in Japanese culture. On the opening day of the festival, the photographer’s almost lifesize portraits of market traders caused a stir of excitement as members of the local community recognised their friends and colleagues. The project is centred on the local people and preserving their respect for the next generation, K-Narf says. The Kyotographie international photography festival runs until 13 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/23/tsb-online-banking-failure-prompts-complaints","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T18:43:23Z","webTitle":"TSB online banking failure prompts complaints","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/23/tsb-online-banking-failure-prompts-complaints","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/23/tsb-online-banking-failure-prompts-complaints","fields":{"headline":"TSB online banking failure prompts complaints","bodyText":"One of the biggest transfers of banking data ever attempted in the UK, involving the switch of 1.3bn TSB customer records, fell into turmoil as millions of customers were locked out of their accounts. Some customers alleged that the IT “upgrade” had left them with rogue credits and debits on their accounts, while others complained they had been given access to random accounts. TSB said its 1.9 million mobile and internet banking customers suffered “intermittent” failures to access their accounts on Monday, while for about half an hour a glitch gave some users a view of “nominee” accounts they would not normally see. The transfer had been planned for months, and was supposed to be completed by Sunday evening, but on Monday morning the bank was bombarded with complaints from customers unable to log on. TSB was carved out of Lloyds Bank and then bought in 2015 by Spain’s Banco Sabadell. Initially, Lloyds continued to handle the IT infrastructure for TSB but over the weekend it moved all customer accounts to a system designed by Sabadell for its UK customers. Customers were warned that they would not be able to conduct transactions on the internet or their mobile phone over the weekend. When problems emerged on Monday morning, TSB said it hoped to have its systems “up and running again soon” but the outages persisted all day. By the end of the working day TSB was still unable to reopen all accounts. It told customers: “We don’t have any timescales that we’re able to provide at the moment. However, we are working to fix it as fast as we can.” A spokesperson for TSB said if any customer was left out of pocket as a result of the IT transfer they would be reimbursed.However, TSB insisted customers were able to use their cards throughout the period. It said the planned transfer from 4pm on Friday through to 6pm on Sunday meant customers were not able to make payments into and out of their accounts using the internet or mobile phones, and apologised that for some customers the services remained unavailable on Monday. “We are really sorry for the inconvenience this is causing our customers and want them to know we are working as hard and as fast as we can to resolve this problem,” TSB said. In an own goal, however, TSB’s parent group, Sabadell, issued a press release with a statement from the group chair, Josep Oliu, saying it had “successfully completed the TSB technology migration”. On Twitter, customers shared images of rogue debts and credits on their accounts. One bemused account holder showed his TSB banking app recording a direct debit paid to Sky Digital – in 81 years’ time. “Now I know there are a lot of theories about time travel, but look I have actually gone 81 years into the future and paid a direct debit to Sky. Just thought you should know!” Ben Stratton tweeted. Others were more unhappy about the prolonged outage. Paul Scriven, a House of Lords peer, tweeted that his account was wrongly showing a £0 balance. He wrote: “Stop telling me and other customers you have an intermittent problem. You clearly have a major systems failure. Be honest. It’s bad enough for us your customers without you taking us for mugs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/23/lso-rattle-review-barbican-helen-grimes-mahler-tippett","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T12:24:34Z","webTitle":"LSO/Rattle review – clarity and beauty bring insights to Mahler and Tippett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/23/lso-rattle-review-barbican-helen-grimes-mahler-tippett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/23/lso-rattle-review-barbican-helen-grimes-mahler-tippett","fields":{"headline":"LSO/Rattle review – clarity and beauty bring insights to Mahler and Tippett","bodyText":"Simon Rattle’s latest pair of concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra found him returning to late Mahler with the Ninth and Tenth symphonies, the latter in Deryck Cooke’s performing version. Each symphony was prefaced by a shorter work: the Tenth by Michael Tippett’s The Rose Lake; the Ninth by the premiere of Helen Grime’s Woven Space, the opening movement of which, Fanfares, had already been heard at Rattle’s first concert as the LSO’s music director last September. Woven Space takes its inspiration and title from a site-specific sculpture by Laura Ellen Bacon, woven from willow twigs and installed in Chatsworth Garden in Derbyshire from 2010 to 2015. Grime echoes Bacon’s work by weaving sonic fragments and melodic shapes into tapestries of sound that coalesce, disperse and reform as the textures alternately thicken, lighten and glare through the score’s three movements. The outer sections have a brittle quality that is in danger of turning insubstantial, though the central slow movement-cum-scherzo, with its slowly shifting string writing, carries deeper emotional resonance. With a Mahler-sized orchestra at her disposal, Grime’s scoring is at times extravagant, and marked by a fondness for tintinnabulatory effects supplied by an array of tuned percussion. It arouses mixed feelings, but Rattle conducted it with considerable energy and drive, and the playing was dexterous, elegant and crystal clear. Woven Space, in many respects, stood apart from the three remaining works, all of which were written towards the end of their respective composers’ lives and confront mortality. Mahler’s Ninth, written after a diagnosis of what proved to be a fatal heart condition, is usually seen as a self-conscious farewell to to life, but in Rattle’s performance the leave-taking was as much angry as resigned. A jolting intensity characterised the shifting moods of the first movement, and the Ländler and Rondo-Burleske were all bitter irony and wit. The LSO sounded glorious in the finale, as its moments of noble assertion gave way to the uneasy calm of despairing acceptance. The second concert was the more remarkable of the two, partly because it fulfilled Rattle’s longstanding ambition to reintroduce The Rose Lake into the repertory of the LSO, who gave the world premiere in 1995. Tippett’s “song without words for orchestra”, completed in 1993 when he was 88, is quite simply astonishing. It is the work of a man contentedly aware of the beauty of the natural world even as the end approaches. Inspired by a trip to Lake Retba in Senegal in 1990, it depicts the sunlight turning the lake’s waters pink, in music at once complex and extraordinarily serene. The performance was well-nigh faultless, with Rattle and the LSO wonderfully alert to Tippett’s exquisite scoring throughout. Rattle likens The Rose Lake’s spiritual calm to the final pages of Mahler’s Tenth, which strive for and attain genuine peace after the terrible turmoil that precedes it. It is in part thanks to his advocacy that Cooke’s performing version has entered the symphonic repertory, and his interpretation remains outstanding. Tautly controlled, it traverses a tremendous emotional arc from despair to transcendence, while remaining aware of the innovations in harmony and structure that would have pointed new ways forward for Mahler had he lived. You can hear the performance, together with The Rose Lake, on the LSO’s YouTube channel until July. •There will be a repeat performance of Woven Space and Mahler’s Ninth Symphony at the Barbican, London, on 26 April.

Given that their afternoon in the sun at Red Bull Arena went to form, emphatically so in fact, with RB Leipzig as leaky at present as Hoffenheim are lithe, one might take issue with the description. It’s pretty much the only area in which Nagelsmann can be challenged. His sporting director, Alexander Rosen, had told Kicker in an interview on Friday that a top-six finish, and Europa League qualification, would be “a sensational achievement”. Now, after tearing Leipzig to shreds, Hoffenheim are well poised to finally capture a prize which looked impossible until recently – Champions League football, with Die Kraichgauer only two points behind fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen with three games left. Moreover, this time, with Uefa’s changes to the competition’s qualifying format, that would guarantee group stage participation in contrast with last time around, when the Sinsheim club were denied third place by Dortmund on the season’s final day and subsequently dumped out by Liverpool in the play-off. The bullet points on Nagelsmann’s coaching resumé are well documented. He turned down a role in charge of Bayern Munich’s under-23s before becoming the youngest (permanent) Bundesliga head coach just over two years ago, at 28. With his appointment brought forward because of Huub Stevens’s ill health, he improbably saved Hoffenheim from the drop, before improbably transforming a modest squad into hard-to-beat, enterprising contenders for European football, something the owner Dietmar Hopp’s significant investment had failed to win before. You might have thought, then, that you had Nagelsmann’s number by now. Yet just as recent months saw him drift from red-hot favourite for the Bayern job – many sensed he was trying too hard by drip-feeding details of his attachment to Munich, and that he and his partner are currently building a family home back there – recent weeks have caused a rethink. Nagelsmann is on the brink of something even more spectacular than what went before. Hoffenheim can now look beyond a pat on the head for keeping it together in the midst of the increased workload brought on by the club’s first European qualification. In the shadow of that and a mini-exodus – losing their team’s spine to Bayern, with Niklas Süle and Sebastian Rudy exiting last summer and the talismanic Sandro Wagner jumping ship in the winter – they have crept up to the Champions League scrap on the back of an eight-match unbeaten run. They are doing it in style too, having scored 20 in their last six matches, with only Bayern and Dortmund having scored more this season. It would be an extraordinary landmark for club and coach. That they definitively entered the equation by tearing past Leipzig was significant too, a club with a not-entirely dissimilar rapid rise fuelled by plentiful investment and smart planning, while roundly offending popular sensibilities (though Hoffenheim are keen to make distinct their story). It was Leipzig who were meant to be able to cope with the extra workload but they – despite holding on to key men, for this season at least, in Naby Keita and Emil Forsberg – have crumbled. Their own feted coach, Ralph Hasenhüttl, was ashen at the end of this 5-2 thrashing, having seen his side exit the Europa League and their aspirations of a return to the Champions League all but disappear in the last four games, during which they have conceded 15 goals. Hasenhüttl knows they had it all in their own hands. They took a 1-0 lead to Marseille for the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final and added an away goal inside two minutes before capitulation. In the Bundesliga, two defeats in the last three have been to direct competitors in Leverkusen and now Hoffenheim, both at home. They conceded four in the first and five in the second. Sporting director Ralf Rangnick intimated after the game that talks over a new deal for Hasenhüttl were shelved for now, with minds needing to be focused on the field. They will have to pick themselves up for the run-in minus Forsberg, sent off in the second half, even if Florian Grillitsch seemed to overreact to being caught by the Swede’s arm. Rangnick’s opposite number Rosen believes his side already have the necessary tranquillity to visualise the task at hand. In fact, being written off as yesterday’s news has suited Hoffenheim. “We are definitely benefiting from the fact that there is absolute peace and quiet here with us,” he told Kicker. Nagelsmann’s future is unlikely to be a distraction either. He casually brushed off speculation linking him with Arsenal to Sky’s cameras pre-match, though Bild claim Hopp would not stand in his way in the event of a concrete approach from a foreign giant. He is more likely to consider his next move when a release clause in his contract activates in 2019. So Hoffenheim’s players should continue to enjoy what seems like a fun way to aim for the top, not least via the enormous screen on the halfway line of the team’s main training pitch, which the coach uses to break down images and sequences of play in-session. If the players behave themselves, they get to play Fifa on it too. They will probably need maximum points from the last three games to reach the Champions League places – anything less and “it will be difficult,” conceded Nagelsmann – but this time, at least, they know fourth will be enough. Then, Nagelsmann would have achieved the near-impossible – making him an even hotter property than before. Talking points • The only negative news for the Hoff this weekend was Dortmund’s surge back to form, as they hammered Leverkusen 4-0 in the top four tussle of the weekend. BVB were terrific in their best performance of season, and the scoreline doesn’t do full justice to the extent of their dominance. Jadon Sancho was sensational, scoring the opener and laying on two assists and Marco Reus scored two, missed a penalty, and had one ruled out via VAR in front of watching Jogi Löw. The weakened Peter Stöger made his point too, with his big decision to drop Marcel Schmelzer from the squad vindicated. • Hamburg are still alive after beating potential relegation rivals Freiburg with a single Lewis Holtby goal - the league’s “undead” team, as Bild described them. “When you’re getting ready for the funeral,” they wrote, “they jump out of the coffin again.” Losses for Wolfsburg and Mainz as well kept Christian Titz’s men five points behind the struggling trio. • Bayern again rocked a very illustrious substitutes bench in the 3-0 win at Hannover before the Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid, including Robert Lewandowski, Franck Ribéry and Javi Martínez. Thomas Müller came on at the interval to subsequently score the opener and there was a debut for defender Lukas Mai, who turned only 18 three weeks ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/23/eventbrite-apologises-for-footage-rights-grab","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T10:18:47Z","webTitle":"Eventbrite apologises for footage rights grab","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/eventbrite-apologises-for-footage-rights-grab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/23/eventbrite-apologises-for-footage-rights-grab","fields":{"headline":"Eventbrite apologises for footage rights grab","bodyText":"A website that allows users to create, promote and sell tickets to events has apologised to users for a clause in its terms of service that allowed it to attend, film and use the footage for its own purposes. Eventbrite hosts more than 2m events a year, ranging from small free gatherings of friends to large paid-for conferences. Buried near the bottom of the website’s 10,000-word merchant agreement was a section titled “Permissions you grant us to film and record your events”. It gave Eventbrite wide-ranging powers to use private events for its own purposes, including in adverts for the site. The terms and conditions also allowed the company to film behind the scenes as an event was being set up or packed away, and required event hosts to obtain, at their own expense, all the “permissions, clearances and licenses” required to allow Eventbrite to do what it wanted, and left the question of whether it had to even credit performers or hosts “in its discretion”. The clause, which affected the British version of the site as well as the American, was added to the merchant agreement at the beginning of April, but it took until Friday for user Barney Dellar to bring the rights grab to wider attention. Eventbrite apologised for the clause on Sunday night, and removed it from its site. A spokeswoman told the Guardian: “Earlier this month we made an update to our terms of service and merchant agreement that would allow us the option to work with individual organisers to secure video and photos at their events for marketing and promotional purposes. “We’ve heard some concerns from our customers and agree that the language of the terms went broader than necessary given our intention of the clause. “We have not recorded any footage at events since this clause was added, and upon further review, have removed it entirely from both our terms of service and merchant agreement. We sincerely apologise for any concern this caused.” Many companies are rushing out large updates to their terms of service in the runup to 25 May, the enforcement date for Europe’s general data protection regulation (GDPR), which strengthens individuals’ data protection rights. In the last week, Facebook, Tumblr, and Airbnb have all notified users of their new terms of service."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/28/saturdays-best-tv-performance-live-akala-presents-the-ruins-of-empires-salamander","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Saturday’s best TV: Performance Live: Akala Presents The Ruins of Empires; Salamander","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/28/saturdays-best-tv-performance-live-akala-presents-the-ruins-of-empires-salamander","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/28/saturdays-best-tv-performance-live-akala-presents-the-ruins-of-empires-salamander","fields":{"headline":"Saturday’s best TV: Performance Live: Akala Presents The Ruins of Empires; Salamander","bodyText":"Performance Live: Akala Presents The Ruins of Empires 10pm, BBC Two If you can’t imagine ever finding yourself at a live poetry performance of a Saturday night, then this is a horizon-widening opportunity.

They're killing us': Puerto Rico after the storm","bodyText":"Gloria Meléndez knew the women’s shelter had to close down. The building was so badly damaged after Hurricane Maria that the electricity didn’t work, and water no longer ran from the taps. With nowhere for the mothers and their children to go, she decided to wait until the new year before closing the door. Shortly before Christmas, local people donated one week’s worth of fuel for the generator. “Christmas is a big deal in Puerto Rico,” says Gloria, who works for the charity Casa de la Bondad. “And so the children decorated the tree, and put lights on it, and then for a few hours each night they lit them up using the generator.” Seven months after the hurricane, all that remains here is the Christmas tree and old boxes of dry food. The entrance is still blocked by piles of rubble, and the water and power are still down. Across Puerto Rico, at least 150,000 people are still without electricity. And a new hurricane season looms in just a few month. As a US territory, an estimated 135,000 people have left Puerto Rico for the mainland. The remaining island residents rely on community efforts and aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the US body responsible for disaster response, to try to rebuild. But Gloria faces a different problem. Although the shelter was forced to close down because of hurricane damage, Fema only offers loans to businesses and organisations for hurricane damage, not aid. This means women’s shelters and charitable organisations that cannot afford loans and repairs, and suffered damage when the hurricane struck, are at risk of closure if they cannot find donations. “That just wasn’t a realistic option for us,” Gloria says. Myra Lespier Cruz, a mother of two, is among those benefitting from the support of the few women’s services still operating on the island, such as mental health support and resources for survivors of sexual violence. She still suffers shock from the hurricane, and says it exacerbated her health issues. She believes she would have died without their help. “We were hungry, and they were the ones who gave me food. I went a month without medicine for my anxiety, but they were the ones who helped me,” she says. Myra recalls President Trump’s visit to Puerto Rico. At the time, he spoke of a death toll then estimated at 64. But subsequent media reports and estimations suggest the true number is probably more than 1,000, partly as a result of ongoing trauma caused by the hurricane, including a huge rise in suicide rates. “I remember him saying around 60 people were dead, and I thought, ‘Well, that’s not true.’ There are people I know still dying from having no electricity, people who need medical machines in hospitals. “I felt a lot of rage and frustration about that. We are American citizens too, but why don’t they help us? They’re killing us. They don’t care about our lives.” Gloria and other charities are fighting to have Fema protocols changed to help people like Myra. Earlier this year, they met with the agency to discuss putting arrangements in place to provide them with aid, not loans, if another hurricane hits. In the meantime, Gloria wants to reopen the shelter in the coming months, regardless of the lack of electricity, because of the urgent need for shelters for women who need to leave abusive partners. The Christmas tree that still stands in the shelter, she says, was one of the few reminders of normality the women and children once had. “I hope by the end of this year, we can light up the tree without needing to rely on a generator.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/i-want-to-stand-up-to-racists-as-my-uncle-did-nikesh-shukla","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"I want to stand up to racists – as my uncle did | Nikesh Shukla","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/i-want-to-stand-up-to-racists-as-my-uncle-did-nikesh-shukla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/i-want-to-stand-up-to-racists-as-my-uncle-did-nikesh-shukla","fields":{"headline":"I want to stand up to racists – as my uncle did","bodyText":"At a panel event I’m doing with Maxine Beneba Clarke and Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan, a white man stands up in the Q&amp;A part, and makes a comment. “Can the word paki always be offensive? Is it always a slur?” he asks. “Sometimes people use it affectionately to talk about the paki shop.” People in the audience register their disapproval with the question. All of us sitting on the panel are stunned, not sure what to say. I look at the chair. The chair doesn’t quite know what to do, so I fire back at the man: “Did you just say that sometimes a racial slur can be affectionate?” It’s 2018 and we’re still fielding this comment. We know the word paki is a slur. I’m shocked it even has to be discussed. I leave the event shaking with anger at the casualness of the comment. If you’re calling somewhere a paki shop, if you really interrogated why you choose this word, it’s really not affectionate. The following day, I have a conversation with Mama (my mum’s eldest brother and the first in our family to immigrate here) about 1968 and the newly instituted Race Relations Act. In 1968, he tried to buy a house in Huddersfield. He was trying to find somewhere commutable between the town centre and his place of work. He took his parents and his wife and child to see the property. It worked for what they wanted and so they decided to go for it. When he called up the company to make an offer on the house, having secured a loan from his work, the person on the phone asked if he was the “coloured fella” who had come to visit. He said he was. He was told that the company had a policy not to sell properties to coloured people as it would devalue house prices in the area. Taken aback, Mama replied: “Did you know this is now illegal?” “It’s company policy,” he was then told. Mama was the first person in the country to bring a case of racial discrimination under the Race Relations Act in 1968. The judgment was ultimately reserved and then dismissed on a technicality (this was a test case for legislation in its infancy, so they were still finding their feet), but the judge said that despite said technicality, discrimination had occurred. The company was compelled to change its policy. Mama stood up for what he believed to be right and as a result is a small and significant part of UK history. When we talk about how much things have changed in the 50 years since that incident, he tells me that things feel worse than they did in the 60s; than they did in the 80s when he was attacked by skinheads and hospitalised. Worse. Now. In 2018. I tell him about the court case in 2017 in which a landlord refused to rent properties to south Asian families because they stank the place out with curry smells. I hear him sigh on the phone. The day we have this conversation, people are talking about Enoch Powell’s Rivers of Blood speech and the anniversary broadcast on the radio, whether it’s right to broadcast it or not. BAME friends of mine are declining offers left right and centre to go on news shows to debate whether this constitutes hate speech or not. Then there are the scandalous stories of the treatment of people from the Windrush generation. Suddenly, we find ourselves in a week where those things we knew to be true – racism is bad, the word paki is a slur, the rivers of blood speech was racist – are all up for debate. I think about what my uncle said, that things have got worse, the entire weekend. I feel heavy with the thought. I think back to the man who said that sometimes the word paki can be affectionate and I wondered why now, in 2018, he felt it was OK to ask the question. But mostly I think about what Mama did. Because, regardless of how much things have changed, he stood up for what he believed in, and he fought for what was right, at potentially huge cost to himself and his family. And that’s the type of person I want to be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/29/slick-woods-model-gappy-smile-tattoos-drugs-rihanna","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T06:00:36Z","webTitle":"Slick Woods: from homeless teen to rebel style setter – the model taking fashion by storm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/29/slick-woods-model-gappy-smile-tattoos-drugs-rihanna","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/29/slick-woods-model-gappy-smile-tattoos-drugs-rihanna","fields":{"headline":"Slick Woods: from homeless teen to rebel style setter – the model taking fashion by storm","bodyText":"If Slick Woods had a business card, she’d want it to describe her as “multifaceted,” “intellectual,” and “hood”. Those are words you don’t often see associated with her job title: model. “I model to have a platform. I use my platform for whatever the fuck I want. So, basically, I’m whoever. I’m everyone. I’m nobody.” Today, though, I have to disagree. She is definitely somebody. At a midcentury hotel in Palm Springs on the first Saturday of the Coachella festival, Woods is leaning against an electric car that’s so new it’s not yet on the market. She’s wearing a candy-pink bathing suit with mesh insets, matching pink low-slung shorts and a light trench. Her buzzed hair is dyed a fiery red, her chin is tilted up, her lips slightly parted to reveal the gap in her front teeth, and her gaze is steady. The southern California sun is blazing above us, but all heads are turned towards Woods, as if she’s the source of the warmth. As the photographers circle her slowly, she exudes self-assuredness and control. If you didn’t know better, you would think she’d been posing her whole life – and not in the way that most 21-year-olds are comfortable with their front-facing iPhone cameras. In the three short years she’s been a model, she’s walked the runway and appeared in ads for Moschino and Marc Jacobs and Fendi. She was featured in the 2018 Alice in Wonderland-themed Pirelli calendar as the Mad Hatter. She is the face of Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty and Fenty X Puma lines, and boasts a few other huge partnerships, too. Which is why Woods is currently leaning on a Mercedes-Benz. She’s one of a handful of “cultural visionaries” – including the Met Museum social media manager Kimberly Drew, the Serpentine Galleries artistic director Hans-Ulrich Obrist and the musician Solange Knowles – chosen by Mercedes for its #WeWonder campaign. Each of the visionaries has a theme they’re focused on, and Woods has picked “youth”. Woods knows a thing or two about the power and potential of youth. In 2015, at the tender age of 19, she was sitting at a bus stop in Los Angeles when the English model Ash Stymest saw her and asked if she modelled. He connected her with his agency and that autumn she appeared in the lookbook for Kanye West’s Yeezy line. She took off from there. People keep asking her if she’s going to see Beyoncé’s headlining performance at Coachella that evening. She’s not. “What am I gonna do, hold up a lighter?” she asks, laughing. Later, she’ll treat her 489,000 Instagram devotees to a photo of herself, cross-legged in the grass at the festival and sinking her teeth into a taco, and caption it “Best part of @coachella cause @badgalriri [Rihanna] didn’t bless us.” You can’t accuse her of being a follower. When Woods is done posing with the car, we head to the pool to cool off. As we dangle our feet in the water, she tells me her story. She was born Simone Thompson in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved to Venice Beach, California with her mother when she was two. “I never really had a childhood,” Woods says. “My mother went to prison when I was four. I was on my own.” Her mother, whom Woods says is her best friend, is serving an 18-year prison sentence for manslaughter in upstate California. Her grandmother took her in, but their lives were unstable, and Woods spent the rest of her childhood bouncing between Los Angeles and Minneapolis, living everywhere from apartments to motels to cars. She got her first tattoo when she was 12, an eye of Horus on her wrist. Her grandmother used to tell her the story. “It’s a pharaoh named Horus, and he had a brother who betrayed him,” she says. “And he used magic to take one of his eyes out and then separate it into pieces, and the pieces were supposed to represent different characters that he lacked. So one is loyalty, respect, humility, family and community. He had to look for each one and go through different tasks to get the character he needed back so his family would accept him.” She paid $7 for the Horus tattoo – some lady did it at her house. It was the first of many. Now she has “Loyalty” written in large script on her right forearm. A rifle on her solar plexus. FENTY in block letters on her neck. Her favourite tattoo, though, is curling script on the right side of her neck. It’s her mother’s sign-off at the end of one of her letters to Woods. “I truly love you more than life itself,” it reads. Woods’s grandmother enrolled her in Santa Monica High – which was a good school, but Woods never really clicked there. Just 11% of the students were black. “On my first day I sat down in class and the guy sitting next to me asked me if I could read… If my mom has taught me how to read,” she says. “I’m really dark-skinned. They’d turn the lights off and be like ‘Where’d Simone go?’ I was like, ‘Are you serious?’” People used to stop her on the street and ask if she was Willow Smith. (Now they confuse her with the model Adwoa Aboah. “She has freckles all over her face. She has big eyes, little mouth. I have a big mouth, little eyes. Complete opposites,” Woods says, shaking her head.) As a teenager, her friends started calling her Slick Woods “because I roll really nice… cigars,” she says, clearly alluding to rolling something more potent. “Slick just stuck. I talk slick. I talk shit. My grandma will be slipping up and call me Slick.” During a few periods of her teen years, she lived in her Chevrolet Monte Carlo with her dog Cleo, a black pitbull with yellow eyes. Back then, Woods did not aspire to have a modelling career. “I never had time to look at magazines,” she says. “You know how rich people don’t hear buses pass by? I’d walk past a magazine store and not look twice. You know what I mean? I didn’t even see it.” But she drew pictures of who she wanted to be: “this Tank Girl superhero situation”. In the dystopian comic book series of the same name, the main character drives a tank, which doubles as her home, and fights against the mega-corporation that controls the remaining water supply on the planet. Woods pauses to order a margarita. She’s not in touch with many people from her childhood, she tells me. “I’m not a bag lady. I’m very easy to let go of things – and people especially,” she says. “There’s things I know I can’t tolerate: disloyalty, dishonesty, lack of integrity, kissing my ass. I hate that shit.” She dropped out of Santa Monica High when she was 17. In general, she made “a lot of bad decisions as a teenager,” she says. “The worst things you can possibly do. Just because I like to prove people right. So people were like: ‘Oh, you’re going to be just like your mom.’ I’m like: ‘Let’s do it. Fine, cool. Let’s do it.’” At 18, she went to jail for a few months. By 19, she was using a range of drugs and living in a crack den. Woods was waiting for the bus one day when Stymest approached her with an “Oi!” Woods was wary, because, she says, “I hate English accents.” He asked if she’d ever modelled before. “Nah,” she replied. Then he asked: “You smoke weed?” She did. He passed her a joint and they struck up a conversation, but she didn’t believe Stymest was actually a model until he Googled himself on his phone and showed her the results. “There’s something about Ash that we’re very similar,” she says. “I just saw myself in him. And when you’re trustworthy, you trust other people. I’m a very trusting person, so what’s the worst that can happen?” Stymest’s agents flew from New York to Los Angeles to meet Woods. She had to borrow a pair of stilettos from a friend for the casting call. “I just took them off and was like, ‘I can’t walk in these,’” she recalls. “They all laughing and shit. I literally just told them I can’t do my job.” It didn’t matter. Since then, she’s clearly figured out the sky-high heels – I watched her navigate the landscaped hotel grounds in a pair of 5in platforms. But “it is a constant struggle to keep your face,” Woods says, not seeming to struggle at all as she makes a photo-ready expression that’s somehow simultaneously posed and relaxed. “After that I never went hungry again,” she says of the day she met Stymest. “I never slept on the streets again. He made sure I lived the way he did.” When she first started getting big paychecks, she “used to go crazy”. But not so much any more. The last thing she bought herself was some Fenty lip gloss – even though, as a face of the brand, she probably doesn’t have to purchase it in a store. But she loves supporting Rihanna, who is one of the few people she cites as an inspiration. “I watch her because I like the way she moves and I like the way she portrays herself as a woman,” she says. Woods identifies as a woman, too, and likes to be called “she” and “her”. But “when it comes to ‘girl’ versus ‘boy,’ I like ‘boy,’” she says. Her Instagram bio identifies her as, among other things, an “unappreciated loverboy”. One of her gold rings reads DAD. Woods makes a point of ensuring her perspective comes through on each shoot and in every photo. The fact that she’s not willing to act like a human clothes hanger has caused tension with some designers and photographers. “Sometimes there’s a lot of beef, but it’s cool,” she says. “I never give in to anything. I’d rather be broke and happy than unhappy and rich as fuck with somebody else’s vision.” Two years ago she moved to New York and she now lives in the Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bushwick. She has talked openly about her tough breakup with fellow model Ebonee Davis last year. These days, one of her best friends is the rapper Joey Bada$$. “We stay in Brooklyn and don’t worry about nothing else,” she says. “We take care of each other.” She says she’s more likely to find kindred spirits in the music industry than among her professional peers. “I started noticing that girls were becoming models just to become bullies,” she says. “They were gaining a platform just to tear other people’s platforms down. So I just try to do my opposite of bullying routines.” Two margaritas arrive. I ask if she’s ordered a back-up drink for herself. “No, bitch, that’s for my friend,” Woods says, laughing. I look around behind me. “No, bitch,” Woods says, still laughing, “it’s you.” The opposite of bullying, indeed. I sip my margarita and feel like I’ve just been asked to sit at the cool kids’ table. When I ask Woods about the future, she brings it back to the present. “My goals are very in-real-time,” she says. “My goal is just to be very happy and live every day exactly how I want to do it.” Some days, that means she cries in the shower (hey, it keeps the skin clear). She might stay in bed all day with her dog. She might go to Six Flags amusement park and eat 10 funnel cakes. But her vision seems bigger than that. After I press her a bit, she admits that if she were the kind of person to set goals, this is what she’d want to do: she wants to keep working for Fenty. She wants to build homeless shelters in Los Angeles where people can actually stay for a period of time, not just stop in for a shower, and she wants to open a branch of Homeboy Industries in New York – it’s an LA organisation that serves former gang members and the recently incarcerated. She would love to create, direct and style her own Vogue cover story – and cast it. “It would look like every old 90s black film that you’ve seen combined,” she says, grinning at the thought. And yeah, she wouldn’t mind if she is still modelling when she’s old and grey. “I’ll still be on my cool shit,” she says. “This is Slick’s ‘old campaign’. You know, like me and my grandma driving through the Hamptons smoking a blunt, like going to get some mimosas. White hair…It’d be popping.” Slick Woods joins the #mbcollective as one of seven visionaries building the Mercedes-Benz #WeWonder Manifesto Styling by Jessy Cain; Make-up by Lucy Halperin at The Wall Group using NARS and REN Skincare; Hair by Johnnie Sapong for Leonor Greyl at Salon Benjamin"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/24/thousands-pledge-to-run-last-miles-of-marathon-to-honour-matt-campbell","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T13:39:32Z","webTitle":"Thousands pledge to run last 3.7 miles of Marathon to honour Matt Campbell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/24/thousands-pledge-to-run-last-miles-of-marathon-to-honour-matt-campbell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/24/thousands-pledge-to-run-last-miles-of-marathon-to-honour-matt-campbell","fields":{"headline":"Thousands pledge to run last 3.7 miles of Marathon to honour Matt Campbell","bodyText":"More than 2,000 people have pledged to run 3.7 miles in honour of a chef who collapsed and died that distance from the London Marathon finish line. Matt Campbell, 29, from Kendal, collapsed at the 22.5-mile mark during Sunday’s event, which took place in record 24.1C (73.3F) temperatures. No cause of death has yet been announced. By Tuesday afternoon, more than 2,300 people had signed up to run and donate money to the Cumbria-based Brathay Trust, which works with vulnerable young people. Using the Facebook group “Finish for Matt”, people across the country posted that they had taken part, with some organising to complete the run with others in their home towns. Campbell, a former MasterChef contestant, was running to raise a target of £2,500 for the Brathay Trust, which was where his father had worked before he died suddenly in 2016. More than £100,000 has been raised for the charity on Campbell’s Just Giving page, with nearly 7,000 individual donations, despite his initial target being just £2,500. Campbell finished second on BBC Young Chef of the Year when he was 20. After travelling around the world, he returned to the UK and last year made it to the semi-finals of MasterChef: The Professionals. “As many of you know, I lost my father Martin 18 months ago suddenly,” he wrote on his fundraising page. “The past year and a half have been the toughest of my life but his spirit and energy live on in me.” “He was the most inspirational man in my life and was the one who said: ‘Go on, why don’t you give it a go? I know you can do it!’ and entered me into my first marathon,” he went on. “It was maybe the proudest day of my life standing at the finish line having achieved something I never imagined possible with my dad and my brother by my side.” People from across the restaurant industry paid tribute to Campbell, with Simon Rogan, the head chef at L’Enclume, where Campbell previously worked, saying he had “showed a lot of promise, was always very inquisitive and had a nice touch”. The London Marathon race director, Hugh Brasher, said his thoughts were with Campbell’s family and friends, but warned against linking the chef’s death to the high temperatures on Sunday. He said there had been 14 deaths in the last 38 London Marathons. The last death at the race came in 2016, when Afghanistan veteran David Seath had a cardiac arrest three miles short of the finish."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/24/duchess-cambridge-new-mothers-royalty","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T11:45:45Z","webTitle":"Don’t save it for the duchess.

All new mothers should be treated like royalty","bodyText":"A woman has had a baby. I know! Amazing, really. It’s baby-shaped, as far as we can tell under the blanket, and appears more than capable of doing things newborn babies generally do, such as lying there. It may do other baby-like things soon, such as having a name. More as we get it. And yet let’s not be churlish here. The reason pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge on the hospital steps still resonate for many – achingly fashionable as it is to wish the whole circus would just go away – isn’t just that they evoke fond parental memories. It’s that being pregnant and having a baby even of the non-royal variety is such a weirdly visible thing to do. Everyone feels a sense of ownership when you’re pregnant. Everyone feels the need to ask inappropriately intimate questions or pat the bump or offer advice about going back to work, plus in some cases bare-faced nagging dressed up as attempts to be helpful. The world’s cameras may not literally be trained on every new mother, but at times it damn well feels like it. The day the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth, pregnant women could look forward to side-eye in Starbucks amid reports that drinking more than one coffee a day might be bad for the baby (never mind that it is based on one study from Norway describing a very slightly elevated risk of having an overweight child, and the causation has been described as “weak”). Then over that guilty flat white, they could read all about how one in four hospitals now refuses women’s requests for a caesarean delivery for anything other than clinical reasons. This is despite guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence that says women should have a choice, even if they have endured grim vaginal deliveries previously, or are terrified of the process, or even if they are just grown adults who, having read up on all the risks, were mad enough to imagine they might have some say. NHS patients quite properly make choices all the time about which form of medical intervention suits them, yet nobody is ever described as being Too Posh To Choose Conservative Management Over Radical Surgery For Slow Growing Cancer; it is only the routine choices that women make over childbirth that attract such intense public debate and censure. Yet at times parenthood comes to feel like one long process of being invited to defend and explain choices that aren’t really anybody else’s business. If a grown woman is confident wearing heels when pregnant, in the full and certain knowledge that there might be an infinitesimal risk of falling over in them, then who are you to stand between her and the pleasure of dressing at least one part of her body in something recognisable from a previous life? Who cares which bit of your body the baby came out of, so long as everyone’s alive and well at the end? Performative parenting of the achingly middle-class kind – the sort that involves dragging an oblivious toddler round a museum, talking at the top of your voice about educational things just so everyone knows what an excellent parent you must be – may be exceptionally irritating to witness, but it’s a defence mechanism deep down, an insecure reaction to that feeling of being silently judged. There have been endless calls for royal births to be treated more like the ordinary, mundane events they really are; to be politely ignored, not plastered all over rolling news. But honestly, there is a reasonable argument that it should be the other way round, and that every single woman who has given birth deserves to come out of hospital to the works: a faux town crier and Kay Burley in full cry and someone reverently erecting a golden easel outside the house, which anyone who will be spending the next three weeks sitting on a rubber ring knows damn well they have earned. But given the practical difficulties of granting everyone their own 16-page commemorative tabloid pullout, many new parents would settle for the other thing royal mothers now get from the media: a very particular sort of scrutiny from strangers, which at least bends over backwards to be kind. One that focuses chiefly on how well the children behave at weddings, considering their age, or how sweet they look in their dressing gowns; and one which is increasingly afraid of being hammered on social media if it’s seen to judge too harshly or harp on about when mum is losing the baby weight. The Duchess of Cambridge isn’t the only one who deserves a break. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/27/tracks-of-the-week-reviewed-ariana-grande-sean-paul-and-lykke-li","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-27T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Ariana Grande, Sean Paul and Lykke Li","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/27/tracks-of-the-week-reviewed-ariana-grande-sean-paul-and-lykke-li","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/27/tracks-of-the-week-reviewed-ariana-grande-sean-paul-and-lykke-li","fields":{"headline":"Tracks of the week reviewed: Ariana Grande, Sean Paul and Lykke Li","bodyText":"Ariana Grande No Tears Left to Cry Big, this. Gigantically big. Suppose it had to be: Grande is on the cusp of a fourth album, in that weird liminal space between “gigantically, massively famous” and “can’t just trot out the same old thing, though”. So, NTLTC is exactly what it needs to be: massive, lung-busting notes; weirdly Madonna-esque ooh–oohs; a sound-of-the-summer beat and a bit where she sings “shut your mouth”. Big. Huge. Enormous. Sean Paul ft Major Lazer Tip Pon It The Seanpaulaissance marches ever on. There is something quite soothing about it, in a way: the rock-solid knowledge that somewhere, out there, at all times, Sean Paul is recording another summer banger with another new contributor, presumably while wearing really expensive studded trainers and some $600 sunglasses. Listen: as long as Sean Paul is having fun, I’m having fun. Naughty Boy ft Ray BLK &amp; Wyclef Jean All or Nothing I find myself forgetting about this song halfway through, which might be because of the distraction of the impending summer: outside is bright and yellow and luscious, and I want to be out in it, eating a Solero dipped in a Corona, and not here listening to yet another Wyclef Jean ft. It might also be because this is quite such an inoffensive summer jam. Lykke Li Deep End Another song doomed by the weather, because Deep End is a banger destined for 2am laptop-screen reflection, or staring out of a window from a skyscraper as the city at night buzzes neon beneath it. Plus, the “Indigo/ Deep blue/ Deep blue” bit is a great hook that’s impossible to sing along to when you’re three ciders deep in a sunsetty London park, which is where I intend to be for the next four months. Re-release it in September, ta.

Organisers of the Ivor Novello awards, now in their 63rd year, announced shortlists on Tuesday for the 2018 awards which also included two nominations for Ed Sheeran and two for Manchester-based art-poppers Everything Everything. One of the most intriguing categories is best contemporary song, in which Stormzy’s Don’t Cry for Me, a reflection on the complex relationship he has with the area where he grew up, is up against Question Time by thesouth London rapper Dave. Question Time is perhaps one of the most political songs ever nominated. Over the course of seven minutes, Dave condemns Theresa May for UK involvement in Syria, her response to the Grenfell Tower fire, the state of the NHS and her treatment of health workers. He also has messages for her predecessor David Cameron – “I mean you fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing line / I wanna know how you managed it” – and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn – “Do you really have the faith of your party? Do you really have faith in the party that will come with you?” The third nomination in the category is Cola by the producers CamelPhat and vocalist Elderbrook. It tells the story of a young woman who gets drunk, can’t get into clubs, gets offered a cola by a friendly bouncer so she can sober up, but she still thinks it is a rum and coke. “It is a very odd and specific song,” said Elderbook. “I started with the phrase Coca-Cola and the story kind of made itself around that.” The difference in the nominees should be celebrated, said Paul Gambaccini, who has been presenting the awards for 31 years. “If there were three songs of the same kind I would be worried because that would mean we’d be in the disco period, where disco just dominated everything for two years.” The radio and TV presenter said music had been evolving more drastically in recent years than in any time he could remember, and that there was much to celebrate as well as work to be done. “We have had the breakthrough of the black British writer, Dizzee Rascal was a real pioneer, and that is an important change,” Gambaccini said. “I’ve seen over 31 years the gradual increase of in the percentage of women writers but it is still too low for everybody’s comfort.” This year’s nominations are still dominated by men. In the best song musically and lyrically category, Sampha’s (No One Knows Me) Like the Piano will compete with Elbow’s Magnificent (She Says) and Everything Everything’s Can’t Do. In the most performed work category, two Ed Sheeran songs are up against Human by Rag‘n’Bone Man. One of the few female nominees is the indie folk singer-songwriter Kate Stables, also known as This Is the Kit, in the album category for Moonshine Freeze. Also nominated are Everything Everything for A Fever Dream and Stormzy, winner of two Brit awards this year, for Gang Signs &amp; Prayer. Vick Bain, the chief executive of the British Academy of Songwriters Composers and Authors, which organises the Ivors, said the nominees were decided by individual juries who spent two days going through submissions with no knowledge of other categories. “What they are looking at is excellence in songwriting,” she said. “If you look over the 63 years, all the different winners and categories, it is an absolute snapshot of our social history. It is a reflection of who we are from the big band era onwards and I think this list is entirely appropriate and reflective of our culture.” The winners will be announced on 31 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/24/sleeping-rough-comfortable-army-exercises-tory-mp-adam-holloway","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T16:51:24Z","webTitle":"Sleeping rough more comfortable than army exercises – Tory MP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/24/sleeping-rough-comfortable-army-exercises-tory-mp-adam-holloway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/24/sleeping-rough-comfortable-army-exercises-tory-mp-adam-holloway","fields":{"headline":"Sleeping rough more comfortable than army exercises – Tory MP","bodyText":"A Conservative MP and former army officer has said that sleeping rough is “a lot more comfortable” than military exercises, in a debate he led on tackling street homelessness. Adam Holloway, the MP for Gravesham in Kent, told parliamentary colleagues in the Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday that if a person is “able-bodied and sound of mind” there are resources that make it possible to sleep rough. He said begging was also part of the problem, allowing homeless people to make “quite a lot of money”. Holloway, a supporter of the pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave, also said that a rise in street homelessness was driven by eastern European immigration, claiming that many migrants from that region preferred to sleep rough than pay for accommodation. He said mental illness and drug addiction were “real ingrained problems” behind homelessness that needed to be tackled to solve the crisis. Holloway, who told MPs he had spent a number of nights during the parliamentary recess in February sleeping on the streets as part of a television programme on street homelessness, said: “One observation I do have, if you are able-bodied and of sound mind there are all sorts of services – not quite 24 hours a day – that make it possible to sleep out. “I’m 52, I was in the army; to be honest for me sleeping rough in central London is a lot more comfortable than going on exercise in the army. “But if you’re mentally ill or you are old or you are personality disordered then it is a very different thing. Or if you’re drug addicted it is very difficult. We have to accept that some people are able to sleep rough because there are resources to do so.” Holloway’s comments come after research revealed at least 78 homeless people died on the streets and in temporary accommodation this winter, bringing the number of recorded homeless deaths to more than 300 since 2013. Challenged by the Labour MP Laura Smith, Holloway acknowledged that he was not saying “even a large minority of the homeless are there because there are resources for them” but added “we’re going to get absolutely nowhere on this, in solving the problem in getting to the people who are most needy if we just continue to just talk about the homeless and feel sorry for everybody”. He later said there was a link between the scaling back of mental health services and the rise of homelessness. He said in February he took some cardboard to Covent Garden and “bedded down” for the night under the awning of St Paul’s church. The MP said he had first attempted this nearly 27 years ago as a television reporter for ITN’s World In Action. He said that compared with the early 90s, the majority of rough sleepers were “foreign nationals”. Holloway, who faced criticism in 2015 for claiming asylum seekers often holidayed in the country from which they had supposedly fled, said: “As I wandered round as shawls and brand new trainers who were handed out I honestly didn’t hear English being spoken by anybody. I heard east European languages. I heard Arabic. And I heard Italian.” He later said: “If we’re to be honest about the correlation between immigration and rising numbers of street homeless, it’s no surprise to me that 1,950 rough sleepers in 2016-2017 were migrants from Romania, Poland and Lithuania. When people are far from home and familial support structures, homelessness is a much greater risk. “Some migrants do indeed sleep on the streets by choice, preferring to sleep rough than to pay for accommodation.” On the same topic, he said: “On the subject of people from eastern Europe, perhaps it’s time to ask ourselves whether it’s exploitative to build an economy on cheap labour provided by those who can barely afford to accommodate themselves in our country. “Of course you could argue these people are not strictly homeless because they might have a home back home but that’s their reality when they’re here.” Holloway’s claim that the majority of homeless were foreign nationals was challenged by the shadow housing minister Melanie Onn, who said UK-wide this was not the case. Data from the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (Chain), a multi-agency database recording information about rough sleepers and the wider street population in London, found 45% of rough sleepers in the capital were of UK origin. But in the whole of England, 16% of rough sleepers are EU nationals from outside the UK, and 4% are from outside the EU, according to official figures from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Holloway said during his experience on the streets in February he was taken to a hostel in Hither Green, which he said was less comfortable than sleeping rough. “When I left there I was quite relieved, the thought of potentially sleeping days and weeks on the floor in a cramped room between a refrigerator and french windows did not appeal to me,” he said. “I can completely see how if you’re able-bodied and of sound mind it would be much more appealing to sleep under the awning of St Paul’s in Covent Garden because there you have freedom.” Holloway said “people’s generosity can sometimes be as much part of the problem as part of the solution”. “Begging is part of the problem,” he said. “You can make – if you’re able-bodied – quite a lot of money from begging on the streets of London. So generosity of members of the public is a factor in this. Generosity can be enabling.” Holloway did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/24/happy-birthday-youtube-terrifying-cesspit-clickbait-13","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T12:37:50Z","webTitle":"Happy birthday to YouTube?

It's now a terrifying cesspit of clickbait","bodyText":"A massive happy birthday to what looks like the world’s most influential dick joke. Thirteen years ago this week, Jawed Karim uploaded a video of himself standing in front of some elephants and making a juvenile quip about their “really, really, really long trunks”. The short clip, titled Me at the Zoo, would be as unremarkable as it was unfunny, were it not for the fact that Karim is the co-founder of YouTube and this was the first video uploaded on to the site. I never thought I would be nostalgic about the good old days of elephant genitalia gags. However, Me at the Zoo seems endearingly wholesome when you look at the terrifying cesspit of clickbait content YouTube has become. In 13 years, the video-sharing website, which was purchased by Google in 2006, has redefined the nature of celebrity. It has, to quote an Observer headline from 2010, made “superstars of everyday people”. Increasingly, however, it seems to be making psychopaths of everyday people. If you want to make money from YouTube, then – to reduce its constantly changing monetisation rules into their simplest terms – you need a shedload of views. In order to get those views, and compete with the billions of other videos on the site, some content creators are resorting to highly unethical behaviour. Take Logan Paul, for example. The popular 22-year-old vlogger, who netted £9.3m from YouTube in 2017, faced widespread criticism earlier this year after uploading a video of a suicide victim in Japan. He did it, he said, to “raise awareness” of mental health issues. It seems more likely, however, that he did it to raise awareness of his own brand. And while he was widely reprimanded for the sick stunt, it seems there really is no such thing as bad publicity; Paul’s subscriber count jumped after the scandal. He went from having 15 million subscribers in January to more than 17 million now. Not all vloggers who have pushed boundaries in order to up their views, it should be said, have been similarly rewarded. Last year, a 19-year-old US woman, Monalisa Perez, accidentally killed her boyfriend in a YouTube stunt gone wrong. The couple had wanted to make a viral video in which Perez shot at an encyclopedia her boyfriend was holding to his chest. The book, they thought, would stop the bullet. It didn’t. Perez pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter last month. Another YouTuber facing jail time because of a quest for viral fame is 20-year-old Kanghua Ren. Last January, Ren, who goes by the YouTube name ReSet, fed Oreo cookies stuffed with toothpaste to a 52-year-old homeless man. “Maybe I’ve gone a bit far, but look at the positive side: this will help him clean his teeth,” Ren joked. The video reportedly made about €2,180 (£1,908) in advertising revenue, before being removed from YouTube amid public outrage and a police investigation. The Barcelona-based YouTuber was charged with a crime against moral integrity and could face two years in prison. Ren’s behaviour was disgusting. However, it seems a little unfair that YouTube hasn’t been charged with crimes against moral integrity alongside him. Ren isn’t one bad apple in the YouTube ecosystem: he is an inevitable byproduct of a platform that seems to prioritise money over morality. Last week, for example, an investigation by CNN found that YouTube was running ads from major companies on channels with extremist content, despite promising to demonetise “hateful content” last year. Like Facebook, the founders of YouTube have created a monster that has spun out of control. And, like Facebook, YouTube spends a lot of time talking about “community” but seems more interested in monetising it than protecting it. The US is a monarchy by another name When Barbara Bush died last week, she was widely heralded as being the second woman to be both the wife and the mother of US presidents (the first was Abigail Adams). This factoid, I noticed, was almost always rolled out as if it was a great achievement, rather than an indictment of the United States’s political dynasties. The US likes to think it did away with the monarchy in 1776. It prides itself on being a land of equal opportunity, without the class barriers that stratify British society. However, I would argue that hereditary privilege is even more important in the US than it is in the UK. Indeed, I’d even say the US is a monarchy of sorts. While it may not have a king or queen, it has aristocratic families in which power is a birthright. Take the Kennedys, for example. Barring 2012, a Kennedy has held office in the federal government every year from 1947 to the present day. Earlier this year, the Democrats chose congressman Joe Kennedy, a great-nephew of President John F Kennedy, to give a response to Trump’s State of the Union address. Then there is the US’s widespread “legacy” programmes – in which universities give preferential treatment to applicants who are related to alumni of the institute. Oxbridge is often, rightly, accused of being a bastion of privilege. But it’s nothing compared with the US’s elite higher education institutions, in which your last name seems to be more important than your grades. It was reported last year, for example, that Harvard’s incoming class of 2012 is one-third legacy students. So, if incessant news about the royal baby has turned you into a raging republican who is mortified about Britain’s outdated monarchy, take some small solace from the US. The monarchy may well be anachronistic, but at least it doesn’t pretend to be otherwise. A tale of two sauces Earlier this month, Heinz asked Americans a difficult question: should the company release a combined mayonnaise-ketchup product? This is not actually a revolutionary innovation, as various people pointed out. People eat it all over the world and it is called everything from fry sauce to salsa rosada to “absolutely disgusting”. But, you know how it is. Nothing truly exists until a multinational corporation creates a viral social media campaign around it. So, there we go; mayochup is coming to the US. It may not be the condiment the country needs, but I fear it is the condiment it deserves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"fashion/2018/apr/25/hair-meghan-markle-messy-bun-perfect-modern-princess-trouser-suits-shoulder-robing-serious-fairytale","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"Hair to the throne: Meghan’s messy bun is perfect for a modern princess","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/25/hair-meghan-markle-messy-bun-perfect-modern-princess-trouser-suits-shoulder-robing-serious-fairytale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/apr/25/hair-meghan-markle-messy-bun-perfect-modern-princess-trouser-suits-shoulder-robing-serious-fairytale","fields":{"headline":"Hair to the throne: Meghan’s messy bun is perfect for a modern princess","bodyText":"I am totally intrigued to see what Meghan Markle wears on her wedding day. Go ahead and roll your eyes all you want, you’re not going to make me feel bad about that. I definitely care about the dress and I absolutely believe that what the first self-proclaimed feminist to join the firm wears at the moment she becomes a royal matters. I care about who the designer is, whether it has long sleeves, whether there is a second look for the evening. Sorry not sorry. But the most significant aspect of the Meghan Markle look isn’t a dress at all, but the way she fixes her hair up: a messy bun that has become her trademark look. In January, for the couple’s first major public outing of this year, a visit to a Brixton radio station, the long grey coat she wore, by the Canadian label Smythe, immediately sold out. But the most compelling aspect of how she looked, the thing that lodged in my mind, was the way her hair was twisted into a casual bun, the kind you do yourself. As a veteran messy-bun wearer, I recognised that bun. It’s the kind you do almost absent-mindedly, without looking in the mirror, with a few ends sticking out at the nape of the neck and some wispy bits from your middle parting tucked behind your ears. The loose ends are what makes this style different from the chignon, worn often by the Duchess of Cambridge, which is bun-shaped but covered, invisibly, by a hairnet. Fellow bun-wearers will immediately recognise that while both techniques involve having your hair pinned at the nape of your neck, there is a world of difference between Kate’s hairnetted chignon, which requires either a hairdresser or a complex two-mirror setup, and Meghan’s DIY bun, which can be done in the back of a car. Although it was reported in January that the messiness of the bun broke royal protocol – Meghan’s second transgression, after the bare-legs-no-nude-tights shocker of her engagement photos – the royal-in-waiting has continued to wear it regularly since. (For evening events such as the Queen’s birthday this weekend, she tidies it up a bit.) Meghan’s bun is not in the joyless lineage of Miss Trunchbull and scary ballet teachers, but in that of the messy buns favoured by Gwyneth Paltrow when she is being photographed for her cookbook or Victoria Beckham backstage at her catwalk shows. This kind of messy bun adds an element of relatability to a glossy image. And it semaphores being busy, which is much more aspirational than being a lady of leisure these days. A packed schedule is also the subtext of a jacket worn shoulder-robe style, as Meghan did last week. Shoulder-robing is a classic Anna Wintour power move, telling the world that (a) you are too busy for sleeves and (b) you possess the kind of properly structured tailoring that sits photogenically on your shoulders and keeps its shape. Meghan and her soon-to-be-sister-in-law Kate have modernised royal style in different ways. Kate shook things up by showing that you can look like a fairytale princess while wearing high-street pieces; Meghan is shaking things up by showing that this fairytale doesn’t have to mean dressing like a princess. Kate wore a £34.99 Zara dress for her going-away outfit after her wedding, and her love for a comfortable LK Bennett shoe is well evidenced. The budget-friendly piece is important, and Meghan plays this game too. She wore a dress by Self-Portrait to meet the Queen for the first time, which made her seem super normal, Self-Portrait being everyone’s go-to special occasion label. (She wore Self-Portrait again, on Saturday, prompting about half the women who saw the image on Instagram to shout out “I’ve got that dress!”.) And I am quite sure that the £45 Marks &amp; Spencer sweater she wore in January was at least a semi-deliberate ploy to win over the British public. But what stands out most about her look is how functional it is. How non-princessy it is. For her very first official evening engagement with Harry on 1 February, she chose a black Alexander McQueen trouser suit with a crisp white blouse, when she could have chosen a floor-length gown. In 2014, the actor spoke at the One Young World conference about challenging TV producers over the sexualisation of her character, the lawyer Rachel Zane. “In the show, this season, every script seemed to begin with ‘Rachel enters wearing a towel’,” she said. “I said, ‘No, I’m not doing it any more.’” She has applied a little of the same approach to her public persona since the engagement announcement. Hemlines are longer, clothes are looser, colours more muted in her official wardrobe than they were when she was dressing for the red carpet. Meghan, who has written for Elle magazine about being biracial and is a longstanding ambassador for UN Women, is deliberately playing down the dazzle to ensure that she frames herself in public as a thoughtful and substantial person. Sustainability is a theme in Meghan’s wardrobe, with lots of Stella McCartney pieces, and jeans by the ethical Welsh denim label Hiut. There is a Rorschach test element to the way we view the royals. When Meghan wore a white beret in March, some style observers took it as a tribute to Princess Diana (the same milliner, Stephen Jones, designed both womens’ berets) while others took it as a nod to her feminist credentials (berets being a standout accessory of the latest collection from the house of Dior, whose designer Maria Grazia Chiuri has put feminism at the centre of its world). Perhaps the British public falls for each new princess figure who joins the firm because, in the absence of them actually saying very much, we see what we want to see. But Meghan’s messy bun makes her perfect for 2018. Or, at least, it looks that way to me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/24/sheffield-universities-investigate-four-allegations-of-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T14:49:57Z","webTitle":"Sheffield universities investigate four allegations of racism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/sheffield-universities-investigate-four-allegations-of-racism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/24/sheffield-universities-investigate-four-allegations-of-racism","fields":{"headline":"Sheffield universities investigate four allegations of racism","bodyText":"Two Sheffield universities are investigating four allegations of racism, including claims a black student was hit with a banana during an ice hockey game. Tyrell Pearce, a PE student at Sheffield Hallam University, said a supporter of rival Sheffield University threw a banana at him at a match last month. He said it was “the most racially abused I have been in my whole life”. Three other incidents allegedly took place at Hallam library, according to Luke Renwick, president of Sheffield Hallam University students union. One student claimed that someone had written on a library whiteboard that there were “Too many Asians (Brown ones)”, Renwick said on his blog. The comment had been left under a message from the library asking students for feedback, according to a report in the National Student online. Another said they had been called a monkey by a member of staff after forgetting their student card. This prompted an allegation from another student that the same member of staff may have been racist to someone else the previous week. Pearce told a student publication that he was wearing Hallam-branded clothing in a section of the ice hockey arena mostly populated by Sheffield University fans when he was hit. When his friends, both Sheffield University students, went to get some drinks, the problems began. “A few minutes after they left I felt something hit the top of my head. But I didn’t turn around,” he told the Tab. “I chose to ignore it until I looked down and saw that it was a rotten banana. And I had the contents of this banana all over my head. “Immediately I got up and people were shocked as they realised what had been thrown. I knew the direction the banana came from, I shouted: ‘Who threw the banana?’ very angrily, as this is the most racially abused I have been in my entire life.” The student who claims to have been called monkey at Hallam library told the Tab that he was racially abused by a security guard after forgetting his student card. He said the guard in question got frustrated with him because he suffered from ADHD and regularly forgot his things. The student, who has not been named, told the Tab: “He proceeded to let me in then turned to his colleague as I walked away and said: ‘You know I get annoyed with that monkey,’ referring to me as the ‘monkey’. I was in complete shock and upset at the way he casually said it.” In a statement Renwick said: “In the last four weeks alone, I have been made aware of four separate incidents on our campus or at a university event where a student has allegedly been subjected to racism.” A Sheffield University spokesman said its investigation into the banana incident was ongoing and that it would be inappropriate to comment. Renwick said the timelag was unacceptable for those involved to wait and called on both the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University to hold an extraordinary/emergency meeting of the varsity steering group to discuss the case. “If we are to take racism allegations seriously, we have to deal with it swiftly and robustly, communicate this back to students and show we are serious in tackling racism with our actions, not just words. Students have a right to know that we are taking these issues seriously and that they’re not being swept under the carpet,” said Renwick. He would be addressing the issues in a meeting with Hallam’s vice-chancellor on Wednesday, he said, and had also been in contact with the provost of Sheffield Hallam, Christina Hughes. “University campuses are not the bastion of acceptance and equality that they’re purported to be and that is a reality we all need to face,” said Renwick. A Sheffield Hallam University spokesperson said: “The recent incidents that have taken place involving our students are in the process of being thoroughly investigated and where possible, action will be taken to prevent similar incidents from happening again. We are in direct communication with those affected by these incidents. “We take any incident regarding racism, hate speech or other abusive acts extremely seriously. Incidents such as this will never be tolerated by the University and appropriate action will be taken against perpetrators where they can be identified.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/gaijin-sushi-birmingham-an-utter-delight-restaurant-review-jay-rayner","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"Gaijin Sushi, Birmingham: ‘An utter delight’ – restaurant review | Jay Rayner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/gaijin-sushi-birmingham-an-utter-delight-restaurant-review-jay-rayner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/29/gaijin-sushi-birmingham-an-utter-delight-restaurant-review-jay-rayner","fields":{"headline":"Gaijin Sushi, Birmingham: ‘An utter delight’ – restaurant review","bodyText":"Gaijin Sushi, 78 Bristol Street, Birmingham B5 7AH (0121 448 4250). Meal for two, including drinks and service: £60 I think I’m in love, in that sweaty-palmed, unhealthy way; the sort that makes you think you’re going down with the flu. The object of my desire: Ugly Delicious on Netflix, which I have binge watched until images of bronzed and shiny Peking duck, golden-carapaced fried chicken and plump, taut-skinned soupy dumplings were flashing through my tortured mind each night as I drifted off to sleep. American-Korean chef David Chang and the food writer Peter Meehan had already disrupted the cosy, hugging-and-learning school of food media with their magazine Lucky Peach. Chang has never cooked anything with love; it has always been with filthy lust. Now, across a set of themed episodes – fried chicken or pizza, tacos or fried rice or crayfish – they have done the same for television. They travel the world, with suitable guides – our own Fuchsia Dunlop makes repeated, bemused appearances – in what feels like a gloriously haphazard set of jump cuts, interrogating issues of cultural identity. Deftly, they put to death notions of authenticity in food. Chang compares the latter to a nation state run by a dictator. All that matters, they say, is whether the food tastes good. Sometimes they make grandstanding statements; Chang has always been a champion provocateur. (He once gave me a kicking over what was essentially a positive review; God knows what he’d have done if I’d hated his restaurant.) But he does it with a clear-eyed sense of self and the ridiculous. What and how we eat is such a part of who we feel we are, that inevitably it leads us to emotional outbursts. Chang is reliably emotional. If he didn’t seem to hate me, I’m sure we’d be friends. I thought a lot about Ugly Delicious as I booked in to Birmingham’s Gaijin Sushi, which appears to be getting its apology in first. Depending on who is using the word, Gaijin is either an aggressively offensive word for non-Japanese people, or a self-mocking term used by non-Japanese people to signify their otherness. Either way it applies here, because this is a sushi joint run by a tall Polish chap with a shapely beard called Michal Kubiak. Previously he cooked at Sushi Passion in the city, where he developed a following among the city’s chefs. Before that, he cooked in a Japanese restaurant in Poland. So no, he has not laboured with some ancient Japanese sushi master for decades before being allowed to even wash the rice. He has not been forced to stand outside by the bins practising his knife skills until he can turn a whole turnip into an unbroken single ribbon. He’s a Polish guy who loves Japanese food. And if any of that bothers you, because you just adore a cultural stereotype, then please go somewhere else. Gaijin Sushi is an utter delight. Is it the very best sushi in the world? No. It probably isn’t even the best sushi in the Midlands. (There’s a place on a back street in Derby called Ebi that people mutter about in hushed tones.) But it’s very solid and does its thing with grace, humour and enthusiasm. Gaijin opened in March. It’s a tiny space, on a slightly brutal shopping parade next to the A38. The room is dominated by an L-shaped blonde wood counter seating just 12. Currently they are unlicensed, but they’ll let you bring your own booze for a small corkage fee. (Note to Birmingham locals: they are also on Deliveroo. Please support. It’s not like most of the food will get cold.) Hot steamy bowls of fragrant miso soup – is that sesame oil I smell or something else? – come with pieces of salmon bobbing in their depths. There are two tempura options, salmon and prawn, though as both are panko breadcrumbed rather than battered and lacy, I’m not sure they quite qualify as tempura. But as with the arguments on authenticity, I’m really not that inclined to give a toss. They can call them new wave tempura, or Japanese fritters or Keith for all I care. Let’s just describe them as very fine deep-fried things. Discs of salmon are soft beneath their crisp overcoat as if they have steamed in just seconds (the steaming of breadcrumbed foods being the whole point of most deep frying). These are also both extremely good value. Just £8 brings you six big prawns, each longer than my middle finger and trust me, I have big hands. It’s a steal. The same applies to the nigiri sushi, which are about £4 for two pieces. Slices of sticky, grilled eel are blowtorched until the oils are just starting to run, then dribbled with a little more teriyaki sauce. There are sweet, glossy translucent prawns, and surf clams, running from a deep crimson to white, like the petals of a variegated rose. There is the deep purple of tuna, and salmon with the lines of fat ribboning it in white. (A perfect example of the pointless debate over authenticity. Up until the 1970s, Japan imported very little fish, which meant salmon was not a part of the sushi repertoire. It took an enterprising Norwegian trade delegation, looking for new markets, to change that.) We have spicy tuna rolls, with a proper late-blooming kick of heat, and seaweed-wrapped rolls of crispy prawn and eel, an endlessly pleasing call and response of soft and crunch. They’re the Baptist church of uramaki rolls. Crab rolls come topped with bright orange beads of tobiko, the roe of the flying fish, like a comedy nod to Donald Trump’s combover. The eggs burst satisfyingly beneath our teeth. There are tight prawn maki rolls and, most outrageous of all, a tempura roll, tightly filled with prawn, salmon, tuna and avocado, then lightly battered and deep fried before being sliced up. The rice in all of these is perfectly fine: very lightly vinegared, a degree or so above room temperature as it should be. We have run up a bill just shy of £90, but much more out of a sense of professional duty than appetite. I’ve always been one to take one for the team. At Gaijin you can feed yourself properly for £30 a head. One thing to be aware of: they don’t open for lunch until 2pm, which may be a way of controlling trade in such a small space or may just be because it’s their place and they can run it how the hell they like. I’d like to think it’s the latter. Jay’s news bites Andy Oliver and Mark Dobbie are British cooks who, like Michal Kubiak at Gaijin Sushi, became fascinated by a culinary tradition a long way from them, in their case that of Thailand. The resulting restaurant, Som Saa in Spitalfields, is an antidote to over-sweetened green curries. Go for a black-pepper stir fry with lamb sweetbreads and oyster sauce, soy braised pork belly, or grilled aubergine salad with egg and prawn floss (somsaa.com). This year’s National Festival of Making, held in Blackburn on 12-13 May, will reveal the results of the Reg Johnson Young Chef Schools Competition, held in memory of the vastly influential Goosnargh poultry farmer who died in 2015. Finalists have been challenged to make a dish using duck. The winning dish will be available at the festival. Great news for fans of xiao long bao, the soupy dumplings of Shanghai. Din Tai Fung, which has 135 outlets worldwide, is soon to open its first British restaurant on London’s Henrietta Street.

I fired more than 250 people. They were dark days: we’d be invited to dinner somewhere and my wife would say to me: ‘Don’t tell anyone what you do for a living.’” What ignoble occupation had Sundin chosen? Arms dealer? Cigarette manufacturer? CEO of Enron? Not quite: he was the head of Universal Music’s Nordic operation. The “disaster” he was talking about was working for a record label when CD sales were in decline. Sundin’s fatalistic outlook was reflected across the music industry. Despite the fact that artists such as Adele and Rihanna were selling millions of records, music companies seemed perennially glum. As revenues declined, they lashed out, fighting legal battles with teenagers who illegally downloaded music and investing in propaganda campaigns to try to teach pesky young people the value of intellectual property. At one point, they worked with the animator Aardman to create a free iPhone game called Music Inc, where you attempt to manage a band, but always fail because of online piracy. For decades, a job in music had been some of the most fun you could have as an adult. Labels were charging up to £20 for a CD, raking in hundreds of millions of pounds. And they typically received the lion’s share. When Guy Hands, a private equity manager, arrived at EMI in 2007, he wondered why hundreds of thousands of pounds were being spent on floral arrangements until he realised that “fruit and flowers” was accounting slang for drugs, sex workers and other items otherwise difficult to put on an expenses claim. Parties, hedonism and drug use were part of the job. Then, in the space of a decade, the music industry essentially collapsed – in the US, music’s biggest market, annual revenues fell from $14.6bn in 1999 to $6.3bn in 2009. Some artists still did OK, particularly those who focused on live shows, merchandise and brand endorsements, but labels had to dramatically cut costs. At EMI, Hands did away with the slush fund as well as almost half the workforce. At the label Per Sundin ran, the majority of the team was laid off. The expense accounts, the marketing budgets, the joy of taking a punt on a weird band of misfits in the hope something magical might happen – it was all over. Chart music became safer; the bestselling records of the 2010s have all been by middle-of-the-road acts with lots of “nan appeal”: Adele, Ed Sheeran, Michael Bublé and Take That. People were talking about the decline, maybe even the end, of the music business. But recently things have started to change. In 2015, Universal Music Group, the biggest player in the music industry, posted revenues of more than $5bn, about $1bn of which came from streaming. Today, it was announced that streaming music revenues had surpassed income from the sale of traditional formats for the first time last year. And earlier this month, we learned that British music company revenues grew faster in 2017 than in any year since 1995, with labels experiencing a 10.6% rise in earnings year-on-year. British companies enjoyed a 45% increase in subscription streaming revenue in just one year – from £239m in 2016 to £347m in 2017. Spotify went public this month, with the company now valued at $25bn. And Apple Music says it is catching up in terms of paying users, especially in the US. So does that mean we’re back to the glory days of Britpop, private jets and swimming pools full of cocaine? It doesn’t seem that way. There is money sloshing around, but it is not ending up in the places you might expect. Certain genres of music and types of artist are experiencing a boom, while others remain destitute. It’s a world where Nordic cloud-rappers and South American reggaeton artists are watching their bank balances grow, whereas young, hyped guitar bands are struggling. The balance of power has shifted in all kinds of unexpected ways. What has happened, in the space of a couple of years, is the biggest change to the industry since the launch of Napster. Where is all the money ending up? “Five years ago, the kinds of artists we work with wouldn’t see a penny until their album came out – and even then the album would have to do really well to make any money back,” says Sahil Varma, who works in A&amp;R for a mid-sized London based independent label, 37 Adventures. “Now, you’re making money from day one.” He gives the example of Jones, a soulful singer-songwriter signed to the label. She is not a big artist; she plays mid-sized venues in London and her debut album failed to make the Top 200. But on Spotify she has been streamed more than 70m times. “That equates to revenue of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Five years ago, with such low sales, she would have been dropped the week after her album came out. Brands have started looking at Spotify plays, too, so she is doing some stuff with Barbour. Now she has a steady income.” Varma says there are thousands of artist like Jones, who just a few years ago would have had to get other jobs. This was always the promise of the streaming revolution. When Spotify launched in 2008, it pledged to defeat music piracy and ensure that artists got paid for their music – but it quickly emerged that what they were willing to pay artists was a couple of thousandths of a penny for each stream. There is a big debate over exactly how many thousandths – the latest survey by Digital Music News suggests that Apple Music pays $0.00783 and Spotify pays $0.00397. However, Rolling Stone has reported that artists and labels with greater clout in the industry are getting better rates. When I ask Tim Dellow, at the indie label Transgressive (home to Foals and Flume), he says that they are “on a par” with the majors. What remains true is that the biggest artists will have more favourable deals with their labels, allowing them to see a bigger percentage of royalties, just as in the CD era. Whatever the specifics, we are talking about tiny amounts of money, especially compared with CD sales. Initially, artists revolted, with, for example, Thom Yorke removing his solo album The Eraser from Spotify in 2013, after its producer, Nigel Godrich, complained the service favoured established acts and didn’t support new artists. Some of the biggest artists in the world – Taylor Swift, Adele, Beyoncé – followed suit, withholding their releases from streaming platforms either temporarily or indefinitely. Smaller artists signed to big labels were essentially powerless to choose whether their music went on to the service or not, and complained that labels were raking in big profits from Spotify while artists were seeing scraps. But, over time, it has become clear that the fraction of a penny you receive from a stream can’t be seen in the same context as the royalty on a CD sale. The money an artist made from a physical album was a one-off payment; within weeks of it being released, this revenue frequently dried up. On Spotify, every time a listener wants to play the song, the artist gets a tiny bit of money. If a listener adds the song to one of their own playlists, that can mean it will be repeatedly revisited over a lifetime. If it gets added to one of Spotify’s curated mood playlists – Acoustic Spring, for example – the artist can expect tens of millions of plays. Acts whose biggest hits came well before the streaming era are banking huge new revenues from their existing catalogue. Fleetwood Mac have 11 million monthly listeners; that’s more than Stormzy, George Ezra or Harry Styles. They will collect a huge cheque every month without doing anything. There are ways to exploit the system, too. “Almost every track we release, we then release in an acoustic version a few weeks later,” says Varma. “The acoustic version will end up on different playlists to the main version – ones such as Sunday Chilled, and often it will get more streams.” Some bigger artists have taken this “moneyball” approach to extremes. Not content with the 1.7bn streams his song Shape of You has had on the site, Ed Sheeran released an acoustic version (74m streams), a reggaeton version for the Latin market (69m), a version with a Stormzy verse (50m), a Major Lazer version for dancehall playlists (48m) and three further dance remixes (32m streams). When just the remixes of one Sheeran song get more streams than some artists will have in their entire career, you can see why big labels are excited. Analysts say the biggest artists, such as Sheeran and Drake, have received in excess of $50m from Spotify before other streaming services are factored in. Sheeran’s label, Warner music, took $1.3bn from streaming alone last year. “Our catalogue has become so much more valuable,” says Alec Boateng, the co-head of A&amp;R at Atlantic Records. “That means we’ve got more money swirling around the whole company, allowing us to invest pretty heavily in A&amp;R and development. We’re patient with artists – and being patient can be expensive. The new income makes us feel a bit more comfortable spending time working with an artist to develop them.” The way that A&amp;Rs are finding new artists is changing, too. Today, every major label has at least one analytics expert, whose job it is to follow trends on the streaming platforms and flag up any unsigned artists who are performing well. It means that a kid from nowhere who uploads a song to Spotify that does well can find every label in the world descending on them, trying to sign a deal. “If you walked into any major label meeting this week, the thing they’d be talking about is how ‘Spotify-friendly’ an artist is,” says Varma. “By that, they mean: can they get on Spotify’s playlists, such as New Pop Revolution or Chilled Pop?” Artists such as Nils Frahm, a relatively obscure German composer, gets more than 2.5m monthly streams from appearing on playlists such as Peaceful Piano and Songs for Sleeping. Music used to be dominated by audiences with the most spending power – so middle-class, middle-aged people, buying albums at Tesco as part of their weekly shop, often decided what topped the charts. Now, Afrobeat, Danish rap, hundreds of genres of niche electronic music and particularly British urban music are flourishing commercially, without having to make any concessions to the mainstream. “Before, you had to get on mainstream radio, have a certain style or sound,” says Boateng. “It’s allowing for a more diverse proposition for British music and a wider range of people who are stars. A generation are coming through and feeling free.” Even artists who had been written off by the industry are finding an afterlife on streaming. After her much-hyped debut, the BBC Sound of 2010 winner, Little Boots, failed to make the Top 40 with her second record and was dropped by her label. Now she releases her own music to a small but committed fanbase. “Before, I might have sold a ton of records, but none of that money went to me after I got my advance and I had very little say in how the money was spent,” she says on the phone from Los Angeles, where she now lives. “Now, when I release something, I have to pay a percentage to my distributor, but most of it ends up with me. It’s not a huge amount, and I think it should be higher, but I have control and I have transparency. If I know I’m going to get 5,000 streams of a track I can do the maths and say: that’s this amount of money, so I can spend this amount of money on a new EP and project how much I’ll make back. I’m like a boutique business.” Indeed, streaming has allowed artists such as Chance the Rapper, Skepta, Stormzy and Novelist to release music without signing to a traditional label, with hundreds of smaller artists successfully following a similar path. Are labels not worried that streaming, while providing a short-term bump, will make them obsolete? “It’s definitely a challenge for labels to persuade artists that signing a record deal will be useful to their careers, but I think that’s a good thing,” says Boateng. “It makes us clear about what we’re trying to achieve. Because artists can see that they’ll earn a certain amount of money without any involvement from a label, I make an understanding with an artist about what I’m offering. Helping them make the best music they can make, challenging them, introducing new creative relationships – that’s where the value lies. Sometimes you’ll get an artist who isn’t interested and they might walk away, but then others, who ambition-wise are thinking a bit more globally, they can see what we bring to the table.” I wonder if this all sounds too good to be true – can streaming really be making things better for small artists, big artists and labels? Boateng says there aren’t really any losers, but some music managers and label staff I speak to say that if you don’t fit neatly into Spotify playlists, it can be a lot harder to make an impact. This is particularly true if you’re an unusual indie band whose record someone might once have bought as a status symbol, but not listened to that often. Spotify’s hip-hop playlist Rap Caviar, described by Vulture as “the most influential playlist in music”, has 9.3 million subscribers. The service’s Punked playlist, described as “vital, angry new music from the bleeding edge of modern punk”, has fewer than 5,000. There are lots of small ways Spotify has changed the way music is made. The intros of songs have become shorter to stop listeners skipping a track with a slow buildup. Albums have got longer, often clocking in at more than 20 tracks, simply because listening to a 20-track album generates twice as much revenue as listening to a 10-track one. Acts with global appeal obviously perform much better than those who are only popular in one country, which means region-specific sounds can lose out. The creation of so many activity-based playlists (music for running, music for relaxing) has also proven challenging for artists who make abrasive music. “It’s undoubtedly easier to programme ‘mood-based’ tunes than music that’s unignorable, interruptive and commands your full attention rather than passively soundtracking another activity,” says Dellow. In practice, this has meant that electronic and urban artists are performing better than they would without streaming whereas local alternative acts are struggling. A band such as Pale Waves, fifth on the BBC Sound of 2018 tastemakers poll with lots of radio play and written about extensively in the music press, have 428,000 monthly listeners. 6ix9ine, a Brooklyn “SoundCloud rapper” who is barely played on UK radio, has 6.1 million. For Dellow, whose label signs mostly alternative acts, this just means they can’t give up on other revenue streams, including physical sales. “In a sense, we have two markets: those who were previously just listening to music on the radio and not going to shows or buying albums – and that’s great, and they’re easier to reach now – but also a market of diehard obsessives who I’d love to see still supporting an artist with a purchase if they’ve been repeatedly streaming and enjoying a release.” Few insiders would air their worries about Spotify on the record, citing the sensitivity of the relationship. The shadowy decision-making process by Spotify playlist compilers is a concern, with so much power concentrated in the hands of a few, often unidentified, people. Spotify, which has 3,000 employees, refused repeated requests for an interview. (“No one from the team is available,” its publicist said.) Varma strikes another note of caution: although previously artists weren’t making much money from record sales, they were able to develop a financial connection with their fans through touring or merchandise. Now that’s being lost. “Streaming often has no bearing on whether people want to buy tickets or a physical album,” says Varma. “The audience is pretty passive for most huge streaming acts. For Jones, we found out that many people streaming her didn’t even know who she was; they were streaming her on a playlist alongside 50 other songs.” Still, even the insiders I speak to who do express reservations say that the overall benefits of streaming outweigh the negatives. There is a sense that streaming has created a more democratic music industry; one in which artists can make money with or without a label, and where the spending power of a genre’s audience doesn’t affect how much money can be made. Even Sundin, that despairing Nordic label boss, thinks things are changing. “Thanks to [streaming] – especially Spotify, I would say – we were taken out of the dark times,” he said in a trade press interview. “We went from bad boys to something much better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/29/catrin-finch-seckou-keita-soar-review-senegal-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T07:00:36Z","webTitle":"Catrin Finch and Seckou Keita: Soar review – an enchanted middle ground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/29/catrin-finch-seckou-keita-soar-review-senegal-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/29/catrin-finch-seckou-keita-soar-review-senegal-wales","fields":{"headline":"Catrin Finch and Seckou Keita: Soar review – an enchanted middle ground","bodyText":"Senegal and Wales share few obvious similarities, but Seckou Keita and Catrin Finch, respectively maestros of the kora and classical harp, have found an enchanted middle ground between their birthplaces and traditions. Arriving some five years after an acclaimed debut, Clychau Dibon, this second album weaves much the same magic, taking as its motif the osprey, the sea bird that migrates between west Africa and northern Europe. “They know where they will find peace and happiness,” says Keita. “I’ve been on the same journey myself, but in a different way.” The exultation of flight is captured on opener Clarach, kora and harp cascading around each other intricately, while the enforced migration of slavery is addressed in 1677, a darker, bluesier piece referring to the infamous slave station of Goree – though even here the playing is gloriously airborne. Bach to Baïsso begins as an extract from Bach’s Goldberg Variations before flipping into an antique Senegalese tune with griot chants; a daring but successful leap. The pair take turns to supply an underlying riff or play lead, but the interplay between their instruments is seamless, and testimony to their years working together. Hypnotic and ethereal, Soar is a unique marriage of cultures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/ng-interactive/2018/apr/24/david-squires-on-arsene-wengers-22-seasons-at-arsenal","type":"interactive","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T10:00:53Z","webTitle":"David Squires on … Arsène Wenger's 22 seasons at Arsenal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/apr/24/david-squires-on-arsene-wengers-22-seasons-at-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/apr/24/david-squires-on-arsene-wengers-22-seasons-at-arsenal","fields":{"headline":"David Squires on … Arsène Wenger's 22 seasons at Arsenal","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/24/labour-government-would-hold-amritsar-raid-inquiry-corbyn-vows","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T10:39:54Z","webTitle":"Labour government would hold Amritsar raid inquiry, Corbyn vows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/24/labour-government-would-hold-amritsar-raid-inquiry-corbyn-vows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/24/labour-government-would-hold-amritsar-raid-inquiry-corbyn-vows","fields":{"headline":"Labour government would hold Amritsar raid inquiry, Corbyn vows","bodyText":"An independent inquiry into Britain’s military role in the Indian army’s 1984 raid on the Golden Temple in Amritsar will be launched under a Labour government, Jeremy Corbyn has said. The Labour leader promised that an investigation into the attack, which is said to have left thousands of people dead, would be in the party’s next manifesto. Sikh groups have repeatedly called for a fresh inquiry into an apparent decision by Margaret Thatcher’s government to send an SAS officer to Delhi to advise the Indians on the operation. David Cameron ordered his most senior civil servant to investigate alleged British involvement in 2014. He found that the advice was ignored by the Indian army, which launched a full-scale ground assault, causing a heavy loss of life. The finding was met with “disappointment” by British Sikh groups, and the Sikh Federation said Sir Jeremy Heywood’s review had been “limited in scope”. Corbyn, speaking at a Sikh Federation event in Watford, said: “You can be very sure that, whenever the election comes, it will be in the next manifesto ... it’s a commitment that’s going to be there and we will honour that commitment.” It came as Sir Simon McDonald, the Foreign Ooffice’s most senior civil servant, apologised after describing the Golden Temple, one of the most revered in the Sikh religion, as a mosque on Twitter. After realising the error, the permanent secretary said: “I was wrong: I am sorry. I should of course have said the Golden Temple or, better, Sri Harmandir Sahib.” However, Bhai Amrik Singh, the chairman of the Sikh Federation, said: “This was a major gaffe by a top civil servant and totally unacceptable. It demonstrates a remarkable level of ignorance from someone in his position.” He added: “In our view, a public apology and admitting the mistake is not enough. What we need is a commitment from the UK government and senior civil servants to root out such ignorance and discrimination or we will continue to face hate, abuse and threats of violence.” The error is particularly sensitive given the suspicions that exist around the extent of UK involvement in the 1984 raid. Inside the temple with his armed followers was a spiritual leader, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who was understood to want an independent homeland for Sikhs in predominantly Hindu India. Some Sikhs dispute that he had made this demand. Many hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed in the assault in June 1984. They included Bhindranwale. Many pilgrims were caught up in the violence. The temple was badly damaged in what many Sikhs saw as an attack on their religion. The botched operation, in which 136 Indian soldiers also died, led to the assassination of the prime minister, Indira Gandhi, by her Sikh bodyguards, which in turn provoked massacres of Sikhs. About 3,000 were stabbed, burned or beaten to death by mobs in Delhi, the capital, alone. Gandhi’s Operation Blue Star horrified moderate Sikhs and in its aftermath, Punjab, the north-western state that is their historic homeland, was plunged into a violent insurgency that lasted almost a decade. • This article was amended on 1 May 2018 to include more of the Sikh perspective on the 1984 events."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/24/return-to-albany-william-kennedys-ironweed-oscars","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T12:56:37Z","webTitle":"Return to Albany: was William Kennedy's Ironweed machine-tooled for the Oscars?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/24/return-to-albany-william-kennedys-ironweed-oscars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/24/return-to-albany-william-kennedys-ironweed-oscars","fields":{"headline":"Return to Albany: was William Kennedy's Ironweed machine-tooled for the Oscars?","bodyText":"As if winning a Pulitzer prize and getting a MacArthur fellowship following the publication of his novel Ironweed in 1983 weren’t enough, William Kennedy continued his lucky streak with a film deal. Brazilian director Héctor Babenco fell for Ironweed and told Kennedy: “This book is talking to me and saying, ‘I want to be a movie.’ I am going to make a movie of you.” It was a hot-ticket team. Babenco’s previous film was Kiss of the Spider Woman, and Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson were persuaded to star, while Tom Waits agreed to make an extended cameo. Babenco, known for sensitively filming life on the streets, seemed like the ideal fit. Kennedy, also an excellent film critic, wrote the screenplay. The film studio dug deep into its coffers and spent $27m to ensure the setting looked authentic and impressive. What could possibly go wrong? The good news: Nicholson and Streep received Oscar nominations for their portrayals of the down-and-out William Phelan and his ailing partner, Helen, who struggle to make it through the cold and danger of life on the streets in 1930s Albany. The bad news: just about everything else. In 1988, Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune wrote: “Watching Ironweed is like having a large, metal object lodged in your brain for two-and-a-half hours. It hurts.” He even resented the acting: “It’s the kind of film that has no reason to exist other than to win Academy Awards,” he wrote. “Less than a movie, Ironweed emerges as a collection of resumes.” Janet Maslin in the New York Times was similarly damning: “Ironweed is skeletal, a mere outline of Mr Kennedy’s far more resonant book. That Mr Kennedy himself adapted the novel to the screen is only further evidence of how much more greatly film and literature diverge than those on either side of the fence often imagine.” The film recouped roughly $7m from the $27m budget and has since shuffled into the shadows. I could only find it on a special Korean region 0 disc. I’d love to tell you the critics had it wrong. But it’s not that simple. Ironweed makes for a bleak two-and-half hours. As Maslin noted, a lot is missing from the film, notably the moments of shining light in Kennedy’s prose and a sense of optimism despite everything. The film also has trouble with the ghosts that haunt Francis. On the page, they are ambiguous. Sometimes apparently real, sometimes figments of Francis’s imagination, sometimes existing in memory. In the film, they’re clumsily rendered in white costumes. But if you can set aside cynicism about Streep and Nicholson gunning for Oscars, you’ll appreciate their performances. By 1987, Nicholson was deep into the unrestrained stage of his career, whacking out performances in films such as The Witches of Eastwick with sledgehammer subtlety. Here he remains quiet, thoughtful and even meek. Every so often there’s a sly eyebrow lift and a glint in the eyes, otherwise he plays against type. It works. Streep is even better. She looks and sounds sick – faltering in her speech and carriage and her eyes red-rimmed, she is compelling and frightened. There’s a scene where she overcomes her dissolution to blast out He’s My Pal that is triumphant and heartbreaking. The film has plenty of impressive and touching moments, and I’d recommend it to fans of the novel. Kennedy may have struggled to translate his luminous prose to screen, but there are moments that cast an interesting light on the book. If you want an interpretation of the book’s mysterious ending and more clarity about whether Jack ships out of town, returns home, or dies drunk, you won’t get that. But you will get more of an idea about Kennedy’s thought processes. It’s a bit of a slog, but I’m glad I made the effort."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
