We begin somewhere outside Prague, where Karel Benes, who forcefully took over the operation from his defenestrated ex-boss, looks on as his friends in the police arrest two of Vadim’s operatives on suspicion of smuggling. “Business is good,” says officer Hancil, presumably a pal of Benes’ from his police days, as he’s handed a bag of Euros. “Maybe I should leave the force too.” The disruption of his Prague operations has not evaded Vadim’s attention. He can’t figure out why the death of one of his business rivals should result in his losing trucks all of a sudden. Dissatisfied with the official explanation, he resolves to visit Prague to seek answers himself. Dimitri, meanwhile, is undergoing physical therapy as he continues to recover from his fall. The consultant is anxious that Dimitri take up counselling, so that they can get to the bottom of why he attempted suicide. Alex is quick to smother this idea at birth. He has his family to counsel him. Nothing to see here. Back at Alex’s, Rebecca glides in, prompting him to shut down his computer like a man caught streaming porn. If it were only that. She recounts to him a meeting with an Antonio Mendez at a function: a friend of his from Harvard, interested in investing in his fund. Alex, as becomes clear when he takes a call from him later at his office, has no idea who Antonio Mendez is. However, his first instinct is to go along with this stranger’s lie, sniffing something clandestine afoot. Mendez invites Alex to his villa in France to meet personally to discuss business. No need for Mr Kleiman to know about his and Alex’s meeting, Mendez says. Kleiman himself is in Eilat, showing would-be investors, including Israeli government representatives, around his casino ship, trying to interest them in building a super-casino. Meanwhile, Lyudmilla is being groomed by Tanya to entice the investors by subtle means; to converse with them, posing as a woman of independent wealth; “not one of those girls”. Her job is to gather information in the conversations that ensue. She does very well and Kleiman himself assures her so with the gentleness of a Young Mr Grace as he puts her in the back of a car and sends her home. Lyudmilla initially looks understandably concerned; last time she was driven off by a male stranger things did not work out well. But she relaxes when she gets into conversation with driver Joseph, who turns out to be Moscow-born. Back in London, Oksana walks in on husband Dimitri, just in time to hear him speaking on the phone intimately, in Russian, to another woman. Mariya Shukshina subsequently puts in a virtuoso performance, bristling and quivering with emotions ranging from the distraught to the homicidal beneath the lipstick and foundation. She uncovers a letter in Dimitri’s bureau. It’s addressed to Masha, whose brief appearance last week is now explained. She quotes it back at him when he returns home drunk; “without you I have nothing to live for,” she sneers, and the blood drains from his burst capillaries. Later, she meets Masha and invites her to take on Dimitri; clean up after he throws up, put him to bed when drunk. “You have him, all of him – or you get out of my life, daughter of a bitch!” – a curse that sounds much better in Russian. ‘Without you, I have nothing to live for’ Vadim is in Prague – he has brought his daughter along, and they light church candles together, say a prayer for her mother. But this is no pilgrimage. First, Vadim goes Sherlock as he visits Reznik’s apartment and reconstructs his probable death, discovering a tell-tale fingernail. He discovers the name of the officer who filed the investigation - officer Hancil. His man in Prague advises him to be careful in negotiating with the Prague police. Vadim notes the suggestion, then meets Hancil, who is tied, bound and bloodied on a railway line. He extracts from him the name of Benes then, as his sideman wince at the indelicacy of his negotiating tactics, beats him to death with a length of metal tubing. Alex has invited Rebecca to Mendez’s idyllic villa, a real five star Tripadvisor job. Surprisingly, Alex takes the opportunity to propose to Rebecca – she accepts. They take a boat ride in perfect conditions; Mendez and Alex then go for a swim to discuss whatever is on Mendez’s mind. Turns out he wishes to avail of Kleiman’s cargo ships to expand his cocaine smuggling operation. He has a gift for Mr Kleiman as a gesture of good faith – a tip-off about an upcoming shipment of heroin through Mumbai, which would prove embarrassing to Vadim if it were thwarted. He also has a gift for Alex. Leading him into the dank basement of his villa, he opens a door into a room in which, hanging by his wrists and drenched in his own blood is one of Boris’s killers. Such are the violent secrets that lurk beneath the yacht rocking surface idyll of 21st century organised crime. Additional notes Alex has a bit of a torso-off with Mendez during their swimming trip, in a sidelong shot, with Alex winning handsomely. Yet his chiselled looks serve almost to mock the sheer helplessness of his situation, as crime, corruption and deceit overwhelm him. Why would Vadim take his daughter on a killing trip and Alex take Rebecca to a dodgy meeting in France? Because for both, the women in their lives represent to them a connection with their better selves, or the illusion that they have a better self. Rebecca’s smiling conviction about the possibility of ethical capitalism (we hear another speech on the subject this week) coupled with her obliviousness to Alex’s dealings only make her radiate sunny gormlessness. But this is just for the time being. A word for the soundtrack, composed by Tom Hodge and Franz Kirmann, particularly effective in a twisted, electronic passage at the conclusion which aptly conveys Alex’s inner turmoil as he’s forced to swallow more secrets like razor blades. How long before Alex’s work associates, and Rebecca, cotton on that all is not well with the golden boy? Is he on the point of double crossing Kleiman? And might romance blossom between Lyudmilla and Joseph? He might have to adjust his naïve opinions of his boss before that happens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jan/05/will-grace-review-gay-90s-sitcom-return","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T23:00:25Z","webTitle":"Will & Grace review – welcome return for smart, irrepressible foursome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/05/will-grace-review-gay-90s-sitcom-return","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/05/will-grace-review-gay-90s-sitcom-return","fields":{"headline":"Will & Grace review – welcome return for smart, irrepressible foursome","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"That’s right, honey! Will &amp; Grace (Channel 5) is back! After an 11-year hiatus, the snarky foursome are in Will’s apartment, playing a hyper-current game of Celebrity to remind us that we are in 2018. Unfortunately, there’s even more scope for gags now than in 1998. Will: “He’s a man but he’s aged into a lesbian.” Grace: “Newt Gingrich?” Will: “We want to love her but she makes it impossible.” Grace: “Caitlyn Jenner!” The kind of man Karen worships is now president of the United States, but, apart from that, everything in the show – once credited with helping to educate Americans on same-sex marriage – is just the same. Ish. To get round the problem of reviving a classic but tired 90s network sitcom in the age of Trump, award-winning queer series (such as Transparent), and numerous other revivals, co-creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan return to the source: the camaraderie between Will, Grace, Jack and Karen. Thankfully, it’s as sparky as ever. The limp season eight finale in which Will and Grace raised children separately is immediately dismissed as one of Karen’s drug-addled nightmares. Instead, Grace is staying with Will for a couple of weeks until the dust has settled. (“On your genitals?” Jack quips. “On my divorce,” she retorts.) It’s just like the noughties again, but with Grindr, some half-arsed attempts at being woke, and a president invoked by a packet of Cheetos but never actually named. The first episode is stuffed with more references to the present moment than there are nods to the 80s in two seasons of Stranger Things. This is either hilarious or trying way too hard, depending on your irony levels. Will ends up abandoning his principles to pursue a Republican congressman at an energy caucus. Grace goes against everything she believes in to decorate the Oval Office. “He wants it to look like he’s there from time to time,” Karen – who remains the best thing about Will &amp; Grace – advises. It all descends, as the best episodes of Will &amp; Grace always did, into camp farce, easily digestible satire, and a pillow fight in the White House. Whether a series that was once radical in its centre-stage representation of gay people can keep up the pace and relevance is another matter. For now, there is something deeply comforting about watching smart, queer characters being their usual irrepressible selves. “This time, everything will be exactly the same,” Will promises Grace. Everything except the entire political landscape."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/07/brexit-why-buyers-remorse-hasnt-hit-the-uk-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T13:04:13Z","webTitle":"Brexit: why the UK economy hasn't led to buyer's remorse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/07/brexit-why-buyers-remorse-hasnt-hit-the-uk-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/07/brexit-why-buyers-remorse-hasnt-hit-the-uk-economy","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: why the UK economy hasn't led to buyer's remorse","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We’ve all been there: that moment when you get home and realise you didn’t want that new jumper and couldn’t really afford it either. It is known as buyer’s remorse, and it was a concept that gave the remain camp comfort as it reeled from the shock of defeat in the EU referendum vote in June 2016. In the context of Brexit, buyer’s remorse meant that people who had voted to leave would quickly regret what they had done because the economy would plunge instantly into the stonking recession predicted by the Treasury in the run-up to the plebiscite. Project Fear was actually Project Reality, it was said, and before too long Brexit voters would be clamouring for the chance to think again. No question there were those in the remain camp who, despite the obvious flaws in the European project, genuinely thought nothing good could ever come of Brexit and it would be the poor and the vulnerable who had voted leave who would suffer most from what they saw as its inevitable baleful consequences. There was, though, a snobbish and nasty subtext to the buyer’s remorse theory, which was that the plebs were too dumb to know what they were voting for. Yet it was always a long shot that a second referendum would come about by these means and so it has proved. Eighteen months on and there has been little sign of buyer’s remorse. In part, that is because people voted remain or leave in the referendum for complex reasons. The referendum was never just about economics, and in retrospect it was a strategic blunder on the part of the remain camp to fight only on what the vote would mean for GDP per head and house prices. Another reason why buyer’s remorse has not set in is that the country – or rather the part of the country (by far the bigger part) that is not obsessed with Brexit – has moved on. There are Brexit fanatics, there are remain fanatics, and in between there are millions of people who were asked for a decision in June 2016, made it and now expect democracy to take its course. They have switched off from Brexit in just the same way that they switch off from politics between general elections. But buyer’s remorse strategy required the UK to fall into recession and it has not come remotely close to doing so. The economy’s performance has been lacklustre – especially in comparison with other major developed countries – but buyer’s remorse would have required the economy to contract sharply and for unemployment to rocket. Something equivalent to 2009 – when the economy shrank by more than 4% – might have done the trick. Instead of which the economy is growing slightly below its long-term trend and unemployment has fallen to a 42-year low. The absence of economic Armageddon has simply reinforced the lack of trust in expert forecasters. The stickiest patch for the economy since the referendum was in the first half of 2017, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote, and even then growth averaged 0.3% a quarter. Since then, things have picked up a bit and, with inflationary pressures abating activity, is likely to remain reasonably firm in 2018. Expectations for the global economy are being revised up and that will help UK exporters of both manufacturing goods and services. Some of the exuberance in stock markets is froth, but one thing can be said with confidence: 2018 is not going to be another 2009. The tide turned for the global economy around the time of the Brexit vote and the upswing will continue for some time yet. There are a few reasons for the changed mood. Prolonged stimulus in the form of record-low interest rates and the money-creation process known as quantitative easing has been one factor. Another has been the improved financial position of the banks. A third has been the natural rhythm of the business cycle, which means that even cautious firms have to start investing because their existing equipment packs up or becomes obsolete. For all these reasons, animal spirits started to revive. Firms that had made it through the Great Recession decided that things were going to get better rather than worse. They got fed up with being fed up. This does not mean that the world has been magically transformed and that all the problems that have dogged the past decade have magically gone away. Far from it. Those deep structural problems – the over-reliance on debt to support consumption, a lost decade of productivity growth, growing income inequality – have not gone awayand are merely being disguised by a strong cyclical upturn. A period of solid growth creates a more benign climate in which some of those weaknesses can be addressed. It remains to be seen whether the opportunity is taken. That is particularly true of Britain where the big story of the past decade has been dismal productivity. Had growth in output per head since 2008 continued on its pre-recession trend, living standards would be about 20% higher by now. Not even the most pessimistic predictions for the long-term impact of Brexit expect it to be that costly. All of which brings us to the final problem with the buyer’s remorse theory: its proponents have spent so much time banging on about how terrible Brexit will be that they have neglected to come up with any solutions for tackling the reasons people voted for Brexit in the first place: low wages, job insecurity, the feeling that they were not being listened to. Remainers have latched on to any piece of negative economic news – no matter how trivial – in the hope that this will lead to change of heart among leave voters. But they have struggled to sketch out a plan for dealing with Britain’s structural economic problems, which were there before 23 June 2016 and will still be there whether or not the referendum result is overturned. Constantly accentuating the negative without coming up with any solutions to Britain’s chronic balance of payments deficit, its north-south divide and its reliance on debt-fuelled growth has helped create the impression that some remainers would welcome a stiff recession because it would bring voters to their senses. Remainers do themselves no favours when they over-hype the bad economic news. They may be better off pointing out that the part of the global economy that most outperformed expectations in 2017 was the eurozone and that Mario Draghi has done a brilliant job as president of the European Central Bank in disguising the single currency’s innate flaws. The UK economy will do better than expected in 2018. That it will do better partly as a result of a stronger eurozone is one of life’s ironies.

The funding freeze announced on Thursday, along with a decision the same day to place Pakistan on a watchlist for “severe violations of religious freedom”, is the most forceful US effort in years to pressure Islamabad to rein in militant groups operating in the country. A US Department of State spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said the money would be withheld until the Pakistan government acted against groups including the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network, which she accused of “destabilising the region and also targeting US personnel”. The suspension of funds came days after Donald Trump tweeted that Islamabad had been treating US leaders as “fools”, and prompted accusations of betrayal and calls by Pakistani opposition leaders to sever ties with the US. “We do not have any alliance” with the US, said Khawaja Asif, Pakistan’s foreign minister, in an interview with Geo TV on Friday. “This is not how allies behave.” Asif had described Washington in a TV interview the previous day as “a friend who always betrays”. Pakistan’s foreign ministry said enduring peace required “mutual respect and trust along with patience and persistence”. It added: “Arbitrary deadlines, unilateral pronouncements and shifting goalposts are counterproductive in addressing common threats.” Nuzhat Sadiq, a senior legislator who chairs the Senate foreign affairs committee, said the US move was “not good for its policy against terrorism and for a lasting peace in this region”. She said Pakistan could manage without US assistance, as it had in the 1990s, but preferred to put the relationship back on track. Pakistan had always “played a vital role in the war on terror”, she said. Imran Khan, the former cricketer turned key opposition leader, said the US was trying to scapegoat Pakistan for the former’s failures in Afghanistan and called for the two countries to be “delinked”. Trump signalled action against Islamabad on Monday, tweeting that the US had “foolishly” given Pakistan more than $33bn in aid in the last 15 years and received “nothing but lies and deceit”. Alleged Pakistani support for militant groups fighting in Afghanistan has poisoned relations between Washington and Islamabad since the military campaign was launched in 2001. Citing similar concerns, the Obama administration suspended about $800m in military aid in 2011. Like Barack Obama, Trump would need to learn to work with Islamabad, said Ayesha Siddiqa, an author and expert on the Pakistani military based at Soas, University of London. “Ultimately the US will have to come to the table,” she said, citing the need to use Pakistan’s roads and airspace to fuel and supply US forces in Afghanistan. “It’s an issue of logistics. The American military understands this and the Pakistan military understands this too.” Siddiqa predicted Pakistan would give some ground but not significantly suppress the militant groups. “They’ll soften a bit, there will be some negotiations, some concessions will be extracted, and maybe somebody from the Haqqani network will be shot dead,” she said. “But I don’t see any major change in policy.” The Trump administration in August suspended $255m for Pakistani purchases of US military hardware. Nauert said on Thursday those funds remained blocked but added that money for civilian development and economic assistance would not be affected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/jan/05/into-numbers-review-christopher-chen-rape-nanking-massacre-iris-chang","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T12:05:14Z","webTitle":"Into the Numbers review – stark tale of author haunted by Nanking massacre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jan/05/into-numbers-review-christopher-chen-rape-nanking-massacre-iris-chang","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jan/05/into-numbers-review-christopher-chen-rape-nanking-massacre-iris-chang","fields":{"headline":"Into the Numbers review – stark tale of author haunted by Nanking massacre","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It is a critical cliche to call plays disturbing. But Into the Numbers, by the Chinese-American playwright Christopher Chen, genuinely is. It explores the story of Iris Chang, who killed herself in 2004, seven years after the publication of her bestseller The Rape of Nanking. Subtitled The Forgotten Holocaust of World War Two, her book described a massacre in which Japanese soldiers killed 300,000 civilians and raped up to 80,000 girls and women in Nanking, China, during six horrendous weeks in 1937. Chen uses several means of getting to the heart of the matter. The play begins as a lecture in which Chang sets out the basic facts recounted in her book. A subsequent public interview turns into a form of nightmare in which she is confronted by victims of the atrocity as well as by a survivor, a Christian missionary named Minnie Vautrin, who killed herself on returning to the US. The actor playing the Interviewer morphs into Chang’s husband, Brett, and also her doctor – both of whom seek, in different ways, to rescue her from acute depression. In 90 minutes, the play raises any number of issues. The most obvious is whether detailed research into genocide inevitably has a destabilising effect. How do you live, Chang asks herself, with the recurring image of babies thrown into the air and bayoneted? Chen suggests, as the Interviewer tries to relate the Nanking massacre to other mass killings, that it is impossible to quantify evil. The play also endorses Chang’s fury at Japanese unwillingness to offer a public apology for the events at Nanking. Yet for all its multifaceted approach, the play never fully explains why Chang, who went on to write another acclaimed book, The Chinese in America (2004), suffered a nervous breakdown at the peak of her success. Elizabeth Chan gives a remarkable performance, showing how Chang’s initial public assurance gradually disintegrates: one minute she angrily rebuts an evasive Japanese diplomat, the next, she retreats into moody solitude, listening to Ray Charles records. Timothy Knightley switches with seamless skill from the Interviewer to Chang’s concerned husband and bewildered doctor, and Amy Molloy is quietly impressive as the missionary who believes she has witnessed the devil at work. Georgie Staight directs with great clarity a sombrely haunting play that reminds us of past crimes and exposes the high price paid by the individual for uncovering historical injustice. • At Finborough, London, until 27 January.

Saudi Aramco was recently forced to deny it was planning to shelve plans for its $2tn flotation of 5% of the company, and the new change suggests the planned IPO is still on track. A royal decree published on Friday converted the firm into a joint stock company, meaning it can have more shareholders than its current sole shareholder, the Saudi government. “This is part of the preparation process for the IPO. You’d expect that to happen,” said a source close to Saudi Aramco. The decree changed the legal status of the oil company from 1 January. The source said the company was doing everything it needed to deliver the IPO for the Saudi government, which has insisted the flotation is on track for the second half of 2018. There has been intense speculation over where the international listing will take place, with London, New York and Hong Kong in the frame. The UK government had to deny last November that a $2bn loan to the oil company was tied to efforts to woo Saudi Aramco to list in London. The kingdom’s top officials hope to list on New York but the company prefers London, but both may be ruled out because of regulatory obstacles, the Financial Times has reported. “No decision has made on the listing,” a company source told the Guardian. Sceptics have questioned whether the listing will be as great as $2tn, but whatever the final valuation, it will hinge on the oil price. The price of Brent, the international benchmark, reached a two-and-a-half year high this week, at more than $68 a barrel, over the geopolitical uncertainty in Iran. The buoyant price has been driven in large part by the production cuts led by the oil cartel Opec, where Saudi Arabia is the dominant player, and Russia. The curbs were recently extended to the end of 2018, but will reviewed in June. Industry observers are keenly watching to see how much the cuts are offset by crude production increases by US shale drillers, driven by the higher oil price. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/05/justin-timberlake-filthy-review","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T10:14:18Z","webTitle":"Justin Timberlake: Filthy review – comeback single channels Prince for grown-up funk masterpiece","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/05/justin-timberlake-filthy-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/05/justin-timberlake-filthy-review","fields":{"headline":"Justin Timberlake: Filthy review – comeback single channels Prince into grownup funk masterpiece","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Justin Timberlake’s single Filthy is his first new release since his ambitious, occasionally riveting but ultimately bloated 2013 double album The 20/20 Experience. Well, if you exclude his schmaltzy score for The Book of Love, and Can’t Stop the Feeling!, a single released in tandem with the animated Trolls movie – a fluffy, kid-friendly pop song that ended up being his biggest hit to date. One wonders what Filthy might sound like in a live set alongside tracks from his new album Man of the Woods, which could well be a darker, gnarlier affair. The artwork features a photo ripped in two, one half showing him in jeans in a field, the other him in a suit in a snowy forest – big clanging signifiers for an artist trying to reconcile R&amp;B and Americana, slickness and rootsiness, coldness and warmth. The guest stars play out the split too: Alicia Keys and Timberlake’s old sparring partners the Neptunes on one hand, country star Chris Stapleton on the other. Trolls are unlikely to feature. So can Timberlake have it all – get serious again, last the R&amp;B course and also, as The Outline neatly put it, “rebrand as a white man”? On the basis of Filthy, he absolutely can. Beginning with some bombastic guitar rock, it transmogrifies into a beautifully dark, undulating funk track underpinned by a whiplash bass womp. This kind of wobbling bassline was made ludicrous by the American take on dubstep earlier in the decade, but here co-producers Timberlake, Timbaland and the latter’s protege Danja conspire to make it dangerous again. Alongside the blockbuster elements there are gorgeously subtle flourishes, like the fluttering intake of breath sitting low in the mix. Vocally, Timberlake heavily channels Prince, particularly the exacting, scornful tone of When Doves Cry, while his “whatchu gonna do with all that meat?” is like an X-rated version of Bruno Mars’s “whatchu tryna do?” from 24k Magic. If this is Timberlake’s white rebranding, he’s not doing a great job of it. But it’s not a mere parroting of others, either – the chorus, which modulates into a sweeter, smoother key, is signature Timberlake. The video meanwhile, with shades of Ex Machina’s cyborg dance scene, stars Timberlake as a Steve Jobs figure controlling a robot with his own moves backstage – a smart way of announcing his maturity, not putting himself front and centre, while still getting to essay his magnificent flair for dance. The maximalist ending of the track might not be to everyone’s tastes – it boils a little of the taste out of the funk – but is still handled with brio, and the song sounds like nothing else in the pop landscape right now. With its relatively experimental bent, Filthy may only get a 10th of the 737m streams Can’t Stop the Feeling! has got on Spotify – but it’s riveting evidence that Timberlake can still be the R&amp;B futurist he was at the outset of his solo career."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/05/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea-west-ham-andy-carroll","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T08:12:24Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Chelsea to sign West Ham’s Andy Carroll on loan?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/05/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea-west-ham-andy-carroll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/05/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea-west-ham-andy-carroll","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Chelsea to sign West Ham’s Andy Carroll on loan?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The days gradually begin to lengthen, the Christmas decorations come down and Antonio Conte is still fidgety about the size of his squad. Will he resort to recalling one of Chelsea’s 33 loanees? No, there’s a much better plan: succeed where they failed in August and nail Ross Barkley’s colours to the mast. Given Everton’s association with blue and white that should not be overly difficult: they may even get him for a cut-price fee of around £15m, with the Toffees scrambling to get something for a player who is out of contract this summer and – because of the hamstring injury that scuppered his proposed move in 2017 – is yet to be involved this term. Now they’ve got the scent for it, will those in the Stamford Bridge corridors of power sanction a further move? Perhaps even for Andy Carroll, who appears to have timed his annual star turn perfectly and could provide Barkley with some much-needed company if he arrives from West Ham on loan – hopefully on the pitch rather than the treatment table. Talking of strapping centre-forwards, Newcastle are in desperate need of some extra cojones and Watford, seemingly, quite keen on losing some. So a move north-east for Troy Deeney may make sense, as Marco Silva prefers to ride with Bournemouth’s Benik Afobe in his unstoppable journey towards being the best manager the Premier League has ever seen. Roy Hodgson is far less fashionable but on rather better form; that won’t stop him making tweaks to the Crystal Palace squad this January, and he is close to adding the Ipswich goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski to his ranks for a mooted fee of around £4m. Bialkowski has his eye on a World Cup place with Poland; that, of course, relies on Julián Speroni not making a stunning late charge for Argentina’s No1 spot. Another Championship star could move on for rather bigger cash. Fulham’s Ryan Sessegnon – who scored past Bialkowski twice on Tuesday night – is being watched by Paris Saint-Germain, who are ready to move decisively for the thrillingly gifted 17-year-old. They could pay £30m for the youngster, who is already a mainstay in the second tier and, although generally playing at left-back, packs quite a punch further up the pitch. That would disappoint Tottenham, whose interest has been long-standing, and also Manchester United. They’ll live. But how will La Liga’s basement side Las Palmas survive if their prize asset hot foots it to the sunlit uplands of, you guessed it, Burnley? Jonathan Viera has caught Sean Dyche’s attention as he looks to add a little creative je ne sais quoi/no se que to his robust ranks. Rafa Benítez has similar thoughts though – will Newcastle pip the Clarets to a £17.8m move? Finally, news that a quick-witted, richly talented attacker is on his way out of Liverpool! That would be Ben Woodburn, and he’s only off on loan – with second-tier strugglers Sunderland, managed by his former national team maanger Chris Coleman, front of the queue to give him five months in the school of hard knocks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/jan/07/the-town-hall-affair-play-reopens-memorable-feminist-debate-of-1971","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T01:38:51Z","webTitle":"The Town Hall Affair reopens raucous 1971 debate and touches a nerve in the era of #metoo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/07/the-town-hall-affair-play-reopens-memorable-feminist-debate-of-1971","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/jan/07/the-town-hall-affair-play-reopens-memorable-feminist-debate-of-1971","fields":{"headline":"The Town Hall Affair reopens raucous 1971 debate and touches a nerve in the era of #metoo","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It was 1971 and the women’s movement was the hottest thing in town. It had thrown up charismatic stars such as Germaine Greer and Gloria Steinem, and achieved the legalisation of abortion in some states. Out on the streets, women marched and staged sit-ins. One, in 1970, had them occupy the Ladies’ Home Journal offices, demanding changes to the uber-domesticated images of women in magazines. The second wave of feminism was in full flight; yet its overall tone, and the shape it would take, was still up for grabs. Part of that shape was formed on the stage in a theatre on the upper west side of Manhattan, when in 1971, a panel billed as “A Dialogue on Women’s Liberation” – moderated by novelist Norman Mailer – tried to tease out the terms of the movement. Mailer’s involvement as moderator put a lot of feminists off (in 1960 Mailer twice stabbed his wife Adele Morales with a pen-knife in a drunken altercation. She had apparently said he wasn’t as good a writer as Dostoevsky). Kate Millet declined an invitation to speak, as did Steinem. Eventually Greer said yes (turning up in a slinky dress and a feather boa), as did New York intellectual Diana Trilling. In the audience – and asking provocative questions in the Q&amp;A (the event went for almost four hours) – were Betty Friedan, Susan Sontag, Jacqueline Susann, Philip Roth and Cynthia Ozick. A camera had been smuggled into the event and a documentary with wonky sound, called Town Bloody Hall, was produced by DA Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, and released in 1979. It was this documentary that actor Maura Tierney thought might make a good play. A few years ago, she took it to the Wooster Group director Elizabeth LeCompte. LeCompte, 73, meets Guardian Australia in a dressing room at the Sydney Opera House. She was both there and not there during those heady days of feminism’s second wave. “There were a lot of women’s marches, talking circles, the encounter and conscious-raising groups. I didn’t participate in any of those because I was trying to make a theatre company. I didn’t get involved in that way, I got involved directly in what men were doing,” she says. The Wooster Group would go on to make some of the most interesting and experimental theatre in America. According to a lengthy profile on LeCompte in the New Yorker 10 years ago: There isn’t another director in the country whose demands are so exhaustingly eclectic, or whose disapproval is so direct and steely, or whose enthusiasms are so sudden and so shifting that a few hours of rehearsal can leave her actors reeling with what one described to me as “imagination fatigue.” But no one who has ever worked with her regrets the experience, and everyone in the business seems to want to have it. LeCompte says she hasn’t read the piece. The actor and writer Spalding Gray was involved in an early incarnation of the group and Willem Defoe joined, later bringing some Hollywood stardust to the productions (he and LeCompte were also long-term partners and have a son together, Jack, born in 1982). TV and film actors Frances McDormand and Maura Tierney have also worked for the theatre company. The group’s latest project is The Town Hall Affair, which is touring Australia as part of the Sydney festival this week and will head to London in June. The aim – if you could call it that – is to tackle the unfinished business of the debate. It is mostly told from the point of view of one of the speakers, Jill Johnston – an essayist and dance critic for The Village Voice – who was shut down by Mailer for talking too long, and who history records as a marginalised figure in the debate. “I realised Jill Johnston was the story,” says LeCompte. “It escaped through the cracks because she was very radical – maybe even more so than Germaine. She was a performer. They were two performers – Germaine and Jill – but Germaine was always on the inside because she was beautiful, educated, glamorous and she liked men. Jill was a lesbian and nobody wanted to deal with that in the intellectual circles that these women travelled in, in those days.” For a start Johnston spoke for too long, and she talked in a non-linear, strange manner, which LeCompte sees as being quite modern. Speakers were allotted 10 minutes, and by this stage, “she wouldn’t stop – some people in the audience were enjoying it, others weren’t, they thought it wasn’t fair. She had planned some kind of event to happen at the end of her time and she didn’t get to the end of the event properly.” The event (or “happening” as such things were known) was some female friends of hers coming up on stage and kissing and fondling her and each other. They fell over in what Mailer called a pile of “dirty overalls”. “Other women in the audience – these were academic women – didn’t so much like it,” says LeCompte. “It was a downtown thing and this was an uptown event. They toppled over, making out. Now it was silly looking but then it disturbed a lot of people.” But “there was something unfinished about it. Mailer felt he had to mansplain about why he let her go on over time.” Johnston was a “disruptor” and looking at her with 2017 eyes, “she was the more utopian figure – a Cassandra. She saw something.” The dynamic between the panelists makes good theatre. “Germaine is quite charming in this and emotional, and I think trying to seduce Norman Mailer. Jill was probably trying to seduce Germaine,” says LeCompte. Could the debate happen today? LeCompte believes a lot of that playful, public flirtation between the sexes has gone. Women aren’t playing the game in the way they used to, flattering men’s egos. “I think we’ve gone to guillotine in the revolution,” she says. “Before it was, ‘we want bread’; now it is ‘we want heads’.” In this wave of feminism, the revolution “is not clear-cut because we’ve still got to figure out what it means for a man to be equal with a woman. What does that mean? “Does it mean we’re going to have to change our genders or something so radical? Does it mean there will be no gender – we’re neither male or female?” As for characters like Mailer moderating a feminist debate – it wouldn’t fly now. LeCompte thinks that by now Mailer would have been caught up in the #MeToo movement for some sort of infraction. “He thought of himself as a feminist but was tone deaf on what that actually meant. He’s very similar to Louis CK in that way and Charlie Rose. He [Mailer] couldn’t believe they [feminists on the panel] didn’t think he was a sincere feminist.” The Town Hall Affair plays in Sydney from 7-13 January as part of Sydney festival. It will play at London Barbican in June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/jan/05/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-5-january","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T08:13:48Z","webTitle":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 5 January","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/05/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-5-january","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/05/politics-live-readers-edition-friday-5-january","fields":{"headline":"Politics Live - readers' edition: Friday 5 January","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’m not writing my usual blog today but here, as an alternative, is the Politics Live readers’ edition.

Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities minister, and Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, expressed concerns about Young’s “history of homophobia, misogyny and indifference to the rights of people with disabilities” in a letter to Theresa May on Friday. “The virulence of Mr Young’s misogyny is disturbing; furthermore, he has offered no apology for his remarks,” they wrote. “Instead, Mr Young has said that it would be a ‘shame if people who have said controversial things in the past, or who hold heterodox opinions, are prohibited from serving on public bodies’.” They said Young claimed to be a “supporter of women’s rights and LGBT rights” after coming under fire this week, but that his “historical comments beg to differ”. The letter comes a day after a major teachers’ union articulated its own misgivings about Young’s suitability to serve on the board of the Office for Students (OfS), given his “sexist and homophobic comments”. It increases pressure on the government after widespread criticism of the decision by Justine Greening, the education secretary, to appoint Young on Monday. Critics of Young’s appointment highlighted the numerous sexually charged comments the journalist has made in public about a female former colleague, as well as television presenters, politicians and other women, as evidence of his unsuitability for a position the Department for Education (DfE) has said demands high standards of personal conduct. Young has also caused controversy with his support for “progressive eugenics” in education and his disdain for the use of wheelchair ramps in schools. He publicly said George Clooney was “as queer as a coot”. Many of the remarks for which Young has been criticised were made on Twitter and, two days after his appointment, he appeared to have deleted about 40,000 of his posts on the site.In a separate letter to be delivered to Greening on Friday afternoon, the Liberal Democrats’ education spokesman in the Lords, Lord Storey, said he would note that the Nolan principles – by which OfS board members and other public servants are expected to abide – required openness. “But Mr Young has certainly breached this principle by deleting thousands of entries on his Twitter account, many of them grossly offensive and, on occasion, obscene,” a draft of the letter said.It also emerged that the DfE exaggerated Young’s qualifications when defending his appointment this week. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, said he was denied an interview for the job despite holding two senior positions within the higher education sector. Senior government figures have publicly defended the education secretary’s decision to appoint Young, including Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who tweeted his support on Wednesday. His cabinet colleague Michael Gove agreed. “Quite right too – how many of Toby Young’s critics have worked night and day to provide great state schools for children of every background?” the environment secretary tweeted. In their letter on Friday, Butler and Rayner said Young had portrayed many of the concerns about him as “confected outrage” motivated by his conservatism and his support for Brexit. “This is an irresponsible attitude from someone who has already made offensive remarks,” they told May. “Instead of apologising for causing offence, Mr Young has instead indulged in gaslighting many of those who have objected; rounding on them and questioning their sanity. This is not evidence of what the foreign secretary termed ‘caustic wit’, it is simply misogyny.” Butler and Rayner told May: “When you stood outside Downing Street in the summer of 2016, you claimed that you wanted to build a country that works for everyone. In the autumn of that year, you talked of a ‘truly meritocratic country’. The appointment of someone like Mr Young stands in contrast.” They added: “We sincerely hope you will reconsider this appointment and reassure the country that you are not on the side of bigotry and cronyism.” Young did not respond to a request for comment. The 54-year-old previously said he regretted those of his comments that were “sophomoric and silly”. But he said some had been “deliberately misinterpreted to try and paint me as a caricature of a heartless Tory toff”. He acknowledged a lack of experience within the higher education sector but insisted he had other qualifications, including his work with free schools, his efforts to help people from schools that send few pupils to the best universities and his position as a Fulbright commissioner. “But I am a Tory, obviously, and for some people that alone is enough to disqualify me from serving on the OfS’s board. That’s plainly nonsense. If the OfS is to do its job properly it should include people from both sides of the political divide, left and right,” he said. A spokesman for No 10 said the letters had been received and May would respond in due course. He did not respond when asked if the prime minister supported Young’s appointment. The DfE has not commented, though it has repeatedly cited Young’s “diverse experience” as evidence of his suitability for the role."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/26/assams-list-indian-state-preparing-to-deport-tens-of-thousands-of-foreigners","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-26T03:44:05Z","webTitle":"Assam's list: Indian state preparing to deport tens of thousands of 'foreigners'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/assams-list-indian-state-preparing-to-deport-tens-of-thousands-of-foreigners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/26/assams-list-indian-state-preparing-to-deport-tens-of-thousands-of-foreigners","fields":{"headline":"Assam's list: Indian state preparing to deport tens of thousands of 'foreigners'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Just before midnight on New Year’s Eve, authorities in the north-east Indian state of Assam published a list of 19 million names. But not Hanif Khan’s. Early the next morning police found Khan, a taxi driver from Cachar district, dead from an apparent suicide. “I am sure he killed himself after he found his name missing,” his wife Rushka says. Two years ago, Assam, a lush state bordering Bhutan and Bangladesh, embarked on a vast exercise: to identify every resident who could demonstrate roots in the state before March 1971. And deport anyone who couldn’t. An unfinished draft was released on 31 December – minus the names of 14 million other residents. Officials have stressed the final list will include millions more names, but the process is sparking anxiety in Assam, and warnings India might be about to manufacture tens of thousands of stateless people. Khan, 40, had grown increasingly tense in the weeks leading to the publication of the draft. Though he was born in Assam to an Indian mother, his father was an Afghan national who had long since drifted home. “He told me many times that the documents he presented to prove he was a citizen of India were perhaps not enough,” his wife said. Assam is building a new detention centre to process the “foreigners” it plans to evict in the coming years. At least 2,000 people are already detained in six facilities across the state. Khan often mentioned the detention centres, and had started to panic at the sight of police cars near his home, Rushka says. “He was extremely frightened. Every day he told me that police would arrest him and push him to Bangladesh.” By December he was skipping meals and turning down driving jobs in unfamiliar places. Five hours before the list was published, his wife says, he vanished. The eastern Indian border with Bangladesh traverses five states and more than 4,000km. For centuries until the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, human traffic flowed freely across the territory. In smaller numbers, people have continued crossing in the decades after: Indian security agencies estimate about 15 million Bangladesh citizens work and live in India without authorisation. Just as with porous borders elsewhere, the flow of migrants from Bangladesh inflames Indian passions. Border guards were accused of gunning down nearly 1,000 people, most of them suspected smugglers, in the decade to 2010. A barbed-wire fence, bolstered in parts by floodlights and cameras, has been under construction since the mid-1980s and will eventually stretch more than 3,300km. Resentment has been most acute in Assam, where it sparked an anti-migrant movement in the 1980s that paralysed the state and eventually won government. It also fuelled one of India’s worst single-day massacres since partition: a frenzied seven-hour pogrom in a clutch of Muslim villages that left at least 1,800 people dead. “Here, foreigners are like people from a different planet,” says Aman Wadud, a lawyer who represents people accused of migrating illegally. Assamese residents complain thousands of migrants have found their way onto voting rolls and take jobs and land from locals. “In the past two decades, loads of Muslims from Bangladesh have settled around us,” says Pankaj Saha, a retailer from Dhubri district. “Twenty years ago, Hindus formed 75% of my town’s population. Today, the Muslims are in majority.” Proving the identities of more than 30 million people – many bearing handwritten records, or none at all – has fallen to Prateek Hajela, a senior civil servant. “We have received around 65 million documents,” he says from his office in Guwahati, the Assam capital. The fate of those who fail to win citizenship is outside his control, he says. “What happens to those people who have applied and are not found to be eligible, I can’t say.” Yet this is the question dogging the process. Tribunals have already declared about 90,000 people in Assam to be foreigners, according to statistics obtained by IndiaSpend, a data journalism initiative. Only a few dozen have been deported in recent years – Bangladesh and India have no formal repatriation agreement – and officials admit many turn around and return at the first opportunity. Another 38,000 of those declared to be foreigners in Assam have disappeared into the community, according to police records. Thousands more claim to be wrongly accused and are awaiting citizenship hearings. The prospect of being suddenly arrested as a foreigner and languishing for years in a detention camp is worrying Bengali Muslims in particular. “There is enormous fear and apprehension in the community,” Wadud says. Other than Hanif’s, at least two others suicides have been linked to the process. “I am telling people, we need to wait for the second list,” says Subimal Bhattacharjee, an analyst who runs welfare schemes in the state. “A significant number of names will be added. Verification is still going on.” When the government finally publishes the full list of citizens on 31 May, the ranks of foreigners in Assam could swell by tens of thousands – with no clear plan yet of what to do with them. The Assam chief minister, Sarbananda Sonowal, said in an interview last month that foreigners would lose constitutional rights. “They will have only one right – human rights as guaranteed by the the UN that include food, shelter and clothing.” The issue of deportation, he said, “will come later”. Officials in the Indian home ministry declined to comment on the record but said their expectation was that Bangladesh would take back any of its citizens, as it currently does on a case-by-case basis. Bangladesh says it is not aware of any citizens living illegally in Assam, and that India has never raised the prospect of mass deportations from the state. An official at the country’s high commission in Delhi confirmed this position was unchanged. “Deportations will never happen,” Wadud says. “Bangladesh will never accept these people. I can’t imagine what will happen to them. They will become stateless people with no rights whatsoever.” Shaikh Azizur Rahman contributed to this report.

The benchmark US stock index gained another 220 points, or 0.88%, to finish the day at 25,295, which is obviously a new all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 also hit a new closing high, as Wall Street celebrated its best start to a new year since 2006. Economic optimism, and predictions that US interest rates won’t be hiked too quickly, helped to push shares higher. Can the bull market continue next week? Come back on Monday to find out :) Until then, goodnight! GW Hello again. Marketwatch has an interesting explanation for the market rally: Investors are feeling good about the U.S. stock market. In fact, they haven’t felt this good in years. The latest AAII investor sentiment survey, conducted on Jan. 3., indicates that 59.8% of polled investors are bullish on the market, meaning they expect prices will be higher in six months. That’s the highest level in about seven years, since a reading of 63.3% on Dec. 23, 2010, and it is significantly above the 38.5% historical average. The number of bullish investors has gone up by 7.1 percentage points in the past week alone. There has been a corresponding drop in both bearish and neutral investors. The percentage of market pessimists has dropped to 15.6%, down 5.1 percentage points over the last week, while neutral investors have slid by 2 percentage points to 24.7%. Both are below their historical averages, which is 30.5% for bears and 31% for neutral investors. More here: Bullish sentiment for U.S. stocks is at a seven-year high OK, time for a recap. The global stock market rally has driven Britain and America’s stock markets to fresh highs today, despite an underwhelming employment report from the US. The Dow Jones index has pushed further over the 25,000 mark, while in London the FTSE 100 has closed at a new peak over 7,700. Shares jumped despite the news that America’s economy didn’t create as many jobs in December as expected. The closely-watched Non-Farm Payroll only rose by 148,000, missing forecasts of a 190,000 gain, while wage growth was unexceptional at 2.5% over the last year. My colleague Dominic Rushe explains: The headline numbers suggest that the jobs market remains strong. The labor department announced that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% in December, close to a 17-year low. The US economy has now added more than 2m jobs a year for seven straight years, a run last seen in the 1990s. But the pace of hiring has slowed, the recovery remains uneven, and wages continue to lag behind growth. Analysts voiced concerns that US retailers cut jobs in December - despite the festive shopping season. In the UK, car sales fell in December for the first time since 2011 - and by the biggest amount since 2009. Further falls are expected in 2018, as consumers continue to shun diesel cars -- with some switching to electric cars instead. The automobile industry is now urging the government to agree a Brexit transition deal by March, at the latest, otherwise manufacturers will be forced to trigger contingency plans. I’ll be back later with the close of Wall Street.... Boom! The FTSE 100 has ended the week at a new all-time high. The blue-chip index of the biggest companies listed in London has closed at 7724 - the first time it has finished over the 7700 mark. That’s a gain of 28 points, or 0.37%. Energy provider Centrica and water group United Utilities were the biggest risers, up around 3% after an analyst upgrade. But insurance group Admiral led the fallers, down 3% after figures showed UK car sales fell last year - and may keep falling in 2018. Fewer new cars means less insurance business. Other European markets also had a strong day, as the first week of 2018 gets off to a strong start. No wonder analysts are talking about a ‘melt-up’.... I missed this detail earlier, but the opening bell of the New York stock exchange was rung by a professional bull rider - J.B. Mauney. This honour was to mark the 25 anniversary of Professional Bull Riders (an enterprise devoted to the noble art of not falling off a 2000 pound bull with a temper). You know you’re in a bull market when you see stetsons on a trading floor.... With 30 minutes to go, London’s stock market could end the week at a new record high. The FTSE has dropped back from this morning’s intraday peaks, but is still 11 points higher than yesterday’s record close, at 7707 points. Here’s a nice summary of the US jobs report: Just in: German lender Deutsche Bank says Donald Trump’s tax reform package will cost it €1.5bn. This makes Deutsche Bank the latest in a string of major companies to announce that their deferred tax assets are less valuable, now that America’s corporation tax rate is being cut from 35% to 21%. Deutsche also says that weak markets have hit its revenues, meaning it will post a small loss for the fourth quarter of the financial year. This has sent Deutsche’s shares sliding almost 5%. It’s slightly ironic, as Deutsche Bank has been a major lender to Donald Trump over the years (a relationship that has come under increasing scrutiny). MSNBC’s Steve Benen have calculated that US job creation slowed last year - the first 12 months of Donald Trump’s presidency. Benen writes: Now that we have data for all of the previous calendar year, we can note that the U.S. added 1.84 million jobs in 2011, 2.19 million jobs in 2012, 2.33 million in 2013, 3.11 million in 2014, 2.74 million in 2015, 2.24 million in 2016, and 2.05 million in 2017. Or put another way, while Donald Trump’s first year as president has been pretty good overall for job creation, Americans nevertheless saw the slowest job growth in six years. Newsflash: US factory orders rose by 1.3% in November, beating the consensus forecast of 1.1% growth. That’s up from 0.4% in October, and the fourth monthly rise in a row. American factories reported rising demand for transportation and electrical equipment. However.... the latest survey of America’s services sector is less impressive. Growth slowed to a four-month low in December, according to ISM’s non-manufacturing index which has dipped to 55.9 from 57.6. Boom! The US stock market has hit fresh record highs (yet again) at the start of trading in New York. Traders are shrugging off the news that America’s job creation slowed last month. The Dow Jones continued its march upwards, gaining 70 points to 25,145. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are also pushing higher, as the bull market shows no inclination to fizzle out. But while shares rise, the US dollar has dropped. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, explains: “Surprisingly, Wall Street shook off the lower than expected jobs data and rose still higher, although the Dollar fell 0.3% versus the Euro and 0.26% versus the Pound on the news. “December’s Non-Farm Payrolls data does not fit the current narrative of booming US growth. The initial reaction from the market is to ignore. That could be perilous. “It’s also possible markets have decided the recent harsh weather contributed to the slowdown in jobs The good news is that America’s economy has now created jobs for 87 months in a row - dating back to early in Barack Obama’s first term as president. That has helped to pull the jobless rate down to its lowest since the end of 2000, at just 4.1%. Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, says the US may be approaching full employment: “2017 has been an extraordinary year for the US labour market, with around 200K jobs added every month, leading the Unemployment Rate to its lowest point in 16 years. The fact that we now see a slowdown can be more of a sign of employers not being able to find qualified personnel, than it is an indicator of weakness in the US economy. Despite the fact that the Hourly Earnings Growth remains soft, this can report can still be a nudge for the Federal Reserve in the direction of hiking the rates. The 148,000 increase in the US non-farm payroll last month was “slightly disappointing’, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. He also singles out the drop in retail employment: Looking at the December gain in detail, manufacturing had a strong month, adding 25,000 jobs. Given the strength of the global economy, the decline in the dollar and the recent strength evident in the surveys, we can expect further factory job gains in the next few months. The obvious weakness was in retail, which shed 20,300 jobs. That could be just noise or a consequence of the shift from bricks and mortar stores to online. As a comparison, couriers &amp; messengers added only 2,100 jobs, so in net terms the structural shift is hardly positive for employmen Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab, says: “The US economy ended on a mixed note in 2017. However, despite disappointing job numbers, over the year average hourly earnings have risen by 2.5%. In addition, we have seen the economy grow quarter on quarter, manufacturing and services indices rise and other factors such as business confidence and housing are also picking up. Here’s Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, on today’s Non-Farm Payroll: “There was something for everyone in the latest US Labour Market Report. On the one hand, employment growth slipped below 200,000 after a couple of strong months, while on the other, the headline rate of unemployment remained very low at just 4.1%, on an unchanged participation rate. Wage growth ticked higher to 2.5%, still a very modest rate despite the sharp fall in unemployment over the past few years. “The Federal Reserve puts much more weight on labour market data than on any other information, including the volatile and often misleading early estimates for GDP. Most survey based indicators of economic growth are strong in the US, and while the current severe weather is bound to impact economic activity in Q1, the Fed tend to look through these events, and are still on track to raise interest rates once again in March.” Jobs site Indeed.com have made a handy charts showing where jobs were created, or destroyed, last month across the US economy: Ben Casselman of the New York Times is also worried by the fall in retail jobs Seth Harris, who was deputy US labor secretary under president Obama, is concerned by the rise in under-employment (the U-6 rate). He tweets: Yikes! America’s retail sector cut around 20,000 jobs last month, according to today’s non-farm payroll. That could be proof that the rise of internet shopping is forcing Main Street stores to cut back. The NFP report also shows a 55,000 increase in goods-producing jobs, a 30,000 increase in construction, and a 91,000 increase in service-sector roles. Worryingly, the US under-employment rate rose to 8.1% in December, from 8.0% in October. That means more Americans wanted to work more hours than they were able. In better news, November’s non-farm payroll has been revised up to show 252,000 new jobs were created (up from 228,000). But what the revisions give with one hand, they take with the other. October’s NFP has been revised down to 211,000, from 244,000. Instant reaction - this isn’t a great jobs report. It’s not a disaster either. On wages..... earnings rose by 2.5% per year in December, as expected. But November’s wage data has been revised down, to 2.4% (from 2.5%). Breaking! The US economy created 148,000 new jobs in December. That’s rather less than the 190,000 which economists had predicted. The unemployment rate has come in at 4.1% - unchanged on last month. More to follow..... No argument.... Just five minutes to go, and the excitement is building.... The US jobs report is notoriously hard to predict, and invariably revised sometime in the future. But the Non-Farm Payroll is still one of the most eagerly awaited pieces of economic data in the calendar, as it gives an insight into how the world’s largest labo(u)r market is performing. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Today is the day- the most important economic data, the US Non-Farm Payroll number, on the face of the earth will reveal its colour. This number sets the trading tone and the trend for the rest of the month for traders. Today’s number would provide us significant clues if the moderate growth in the US economy has left any impact on the jobs market, most importantly on the wage growth. Since the financial recession, the jobs market has been strengthening and this momentum was set by former President Barak Obama and Mr Trump is reaping the rewards. World stock markets are at record levels today, partly thanks to Britain’s FTSE 100 hitting new heights this morning. And Wall Street is likely to push the bull market even higher when trading begins -- unless the US jobs report is a shock. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM says: Another day, another record high for world stocks, as a growing sense of optimism over the global economy boosts risk sentiment. Asian shares ventured higher during early trading on Friday, while European markets opened on a positive note amid the risk-on environment. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday, U.S equity bulls are clearly back in town and as such, we could see further gains on Wall Street this afternoon. Investors on both side of the Atlantic are bracing for the latest US jobs report to hit the wires, in 35 minutes time. December’s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that America’s economy created around 190,000 new jobs last month, leaving the unemployment rate at just 4.1%. However, there is talk that the NFP could be better, after another survey yesterday suggested that US firms hired 250,000 people in December. Here’s a round-up of the latest Wall Street forecasts: Economists will also be looking closely at the wage growth figures, for signs that the US economic recovery is reaching workers’ pockets. Average earnings are expected to have risen by 2.5% per year, the same as a month ago, and by 0.3% in December alone. Craig Erlam of City firm Oanda says: We’ve been promised higher inflation and wage growth for some time and investors are increasingly not buying it. Even some policy makers are starting to question why nothing has not materialised and should that continue, rate hike forecasts will start to slip, especially with interest rates now already elevated. Today’s jobs report should offer some insight on this, with average earnings having arguably become the most important component of it. Still earnings are only expected to have risen by 2.5% compared to a year ago, below last year’s peak and well below where they need to be for inflation to sustainably return to target. Whatever happens, we’ll probably hear Donald Trump’s views through the usual channel.... The Labour Party is also voicing concerns about the drop in UK car sales last year. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, says: “The Government’s mismanagement of the economy and mishandling of the Brexit negotiations has shaken consumer and business confidence and it’s concerning that the sales of new cars are falling. “The industry has been warning the Government time and time again and, as has become typical with the Tories, they have failed to listen or take action. “The British car industry is a vital part of our economy, directly employing up to 170,000 people. Labour’s Industrial Strategy will set out a radical programme of investment and genuine partnership between industry and government, to protect vital jobs and build an economy that works for the many, not the few.” Here’s our financial editor, Nils Pratley, on the idea that markets are in a melt-up phase: Over in the City, the FTSE 100 index has climbed to new heights. It just hit 7727 points for the first time, up 0.4% or 31 points today, as the global stock market rally continues to bubble away. Markets have been surging in recent weeks, and there is plenty of talk that shares will keep rising as markets ‘melt-up’. Rupert Harrison of asset manager BlackRock (and former top official in the UK Treasury), told Bloomberg TV that “there are very good reasons to be positive” Harrisons says: Since coming back from New Year, the phrase I’ve heard most is ‘melt up’. There’s been a strong start to the year, and there are good reasons for that - the data is staying barn-stormingly strong. There doesn’t seem to be any sign of the reversion to the mean that people had been looking out for. On top of that, you’ve got tax cuts in the US juicing the prospects for earnings and also potentially boosting the Capex cycle we are in. But, Harrison also cautions that there are some potential risks, including: Everyone is ‘bought in’ to the idea that global growth will continue, so any slowdown could alarm investors.. Trade policy: Donald Trump must soon decide whether to take action against China over the alleged dumping of cheap metals and solar panels. The US president is up early, and wasted no time in tweeting about the bull market: But as one City expert has already pointed out, each 1,000 point gain is less impressive than the last one..... While diesel sales slumped by 17% last year, sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles jumped by almost 35% as more people bought electric cars. This shows that consumers are keen to drive less polluting vehicles, argues Greenpeace UK’s clean air campaigner Paul Morozzo. He says: “Sales of diesel cars are falling but sales of EVs and hybrids are growing at double-digit rates. Consumers are sending a clear message to the car industry that it’s time to move on from polluting diesel and the industry should listen to it. Diesel cars have been fuelling a major air pollution crisis that has made our cities’ air toxic and harmful to breathe. EVs and hybrids are better for both air quality and the climate. If the UK car industry fails to invest in the technologies that consumers want then they’ll be left behind in the race for this trillion-dollar market.” This charts hows how the market changed last year: Back to cars, and Ana Nicholls of the Economist Intelligence Unit, has identified several reasons for the drop in sales last year: Most people who can afford a new car have bought one recently, and pent-up demand from the auto market crash during the financial crisis is now completely sated. The average age of cars on the road is now less than eight years, so there’s little replacement demand. Consumer confidence is faltering: with incomes nearly stagnant and the outlook uncertain because of Brexit people are becoming less keen to take out credit. November’s rise in interest rates didn’t help, raising many people’s mortgage payments and making the financing deals from dealers less attractive A drop in PPI claims has also cut the number of people with one-off lump sums to spend. The sharp slump in diesel sales, after the VW scandal exposed concerns about NOx emissions. With the London congestion charge now higher, and the vehicle excise duty due to rise for the most polluting diesels, buyers are edging away rapidly. In the longer term there will be a shift towards electric cars, but at the moment sales (though fast-growing) are too low to make up the difference. The latest inflation figures from the eurozone are out -- and they show that prices are rising more slowly than expected. Despite the European Central Bank’s huge money-printing operation, eurozone inflation probably only rose by 1.4% per year in December, down from 1.5% in November. Energy prices were up 3% year-on-year, down from 4.7% in November, while food, alcohol and tobacco inflation dipped to 2.1% from 2.2%. This seems to vindicate the ECB’s decision to press on with its monetary stimulus -- which has been a factor behind the rise in stock markets recently. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you’d expect, there’s an at-a-glance agenda of the day’s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Breaking away from the car sales figures.... we have good news for the UK economy. UK productivity (basically how much each worker actually produces) jumped by 0.9% in the third quarter of last year, new figures show. That’s the largest increase in productivity since April-June 2011, and may show that future growth will stronger than previously expected. Labour productivity grew in both the services and manufacturing industries, according to the Office for National Statistics. This looks like good news for the UK government. Last autumn, the independent Office for National Statistics slashed its forecast for productivity growth, having concluded that it would not recover to its levels before the financial crisis. Weak productivity leads to slower economy growth, smaller tax receipts and higher government borrowing. But.... UK productivity has still taken a severe knock over the last decade, and basically flat-lined since the financial crisis. Unions fear that British car workers could be laid off this year, if sales don’t recover. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of Unite, says the UK’s “world class car workers” will be looking to the year ahead with trepidation”, adding: “The government has caused confusion and damage with its policy on diesel cars and needs to start listening to the industry and workforce. Diesel engines produced by Unite members in the UK are the cleanest in the world. “Ministers’ botched and badly thought through announcements are causing major damage to the industry. Combined with economic and Brexit uncertainty this risks taking the sheen off the jewel in the UK’s manufacturing crown and the 800,000 high skilled jobs it sustains. 2018 could be another bad year for the motor industry, if consumer confidence remains subdued. Richard Jones, managing director of motor finance group Black Horse, says the next few months will be crucial “I believe we’ll see new car sales continue to decline in the first quarter of 2018 given that this period in 2017 was so strong. This should help dampen fears of oversupply having a negative impact on used car prices and is positive in the long term by ensuring the new car market is operating from a sustainable position. I would also expect the used car market to continue to perform well. “With uncertainties facing the UK economy it’s hard to make a confident forecast for 2018 as a whole. I believe a big test for the industry will come after quarter one when we will see how the underlying UK economy and consumer confidence is influencing car demand.” Brexit is the biggest threat to the UK automobile industry this year, according to a new survey of car dealers from Close Brothers Motor Finance. More encouragingly, 92% of dealers are confident about business prospects in the market for 2018, up from 63% last year. However, that optimism could wilt if Britain doesn’t agree a Brexit transition deal soon.... Worryingly, the drop in diesel car sales seems to have pushed emissions of carbon dioxide up. That’s a disappointing consequence of consumers shunning diesel motors and buying petrol ones instead, following revelations that diesel cars were pumping more nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere than officially reported. The SMMT explains: Carbon tailpipe emissions have risen for the first time since 1997, with new cars averaging 121.04g/km, up 0.8% on 2016. Last year, UK new car CO2 emissions fell for the 19th consecutive year and this is the first year the figure has risen since records began. The SMMT have just issued a press release, confirming that UK car sales declined in 2017. Here are the key points: Overall annual demand falls -5.7% in 2017 – but new car market still third biggest in a decade at over 2.5 million vehicles. December represents the ninth consecutive month of decline, as registrations for final month of year drop -14.4%. Appetite for electrified cars reaches record high, with almost 120,000 alternatively fuelled vehicles (AFVs) hitting UK roads – a 34.8% uplift. Diesel demand declines -17.1%, undermining progress on emissions and CO2 as industry body warns consumers could end up paying more in fuel if they travel high mileages. There’s a couple of handy charts too: In contrast to the UK, car sales in Germany actually rose last year. Auto sales in Europe’s largest economy increased by 2.7% during 2017. However - as in Britain - diesel sales tumbled (by 13%). Reuters explains: Pressure is growing on Germany to tackle diesel pollution as dozens of cities including Munich and Stuttgart, where BMW and Daimler are based, could face penalties for allowing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in excess of European Union limits introduced in 2010, the DUH environmental lobby has said. Newsflash: Britain’s FTSE 100 has hit a fresh intraday record high. The index of blue-chip companies gained another 12 points, or 0.15% points, to 7708 points, six points above yesterday’s record levels. Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investor optimism is undimmed, for the moment.... European markets continue to make further gains, with the sheer scale of the global rally demonstrating how investors are embracing all things equity and risk related, basking in the euphoria of synchronous global growth. Equity markets, which were already strengthening well in advance of Trump’s $1.5tn tax cut, or indeed a prospective US infrastructure bill that could form the centrepiece of 2018 legislation, show no sign of any stress, with new record highs an almost daily occurrence. With the party in full swing and implied volatility at such low levels, markets are seemingly immune to any possible downside, but the key risk that might ultimately bring markets down is inflation. A material increase in inflationary pressures would potentially force central banks to tighten rates faster than the market is expecting Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, believes Brexit anxiety and opposition to diesel cars are the main reason car sales fell last year. “Today’s figures reflect the impact that anti-diesel messages from the government and ongoing Brexit trade negotiations are having on both business and consumer confidence across the motor industry. December marks the ninth month of consecutive decrease in new car sales as squeezed consumers are reluctant to purchase big ticket items such as cars and motorcycles. Alex Buttle, director of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says diesel’s days are numbered (after the emissions scandal). He wants the government to offer more incentives to shift to electric. “Quite frankly, 2017 has been a year to forget for the UK car industry. “You’d have to dig pretty deep to find anything positive to take from the past 12 months which has seen diesel demonised in the media on a weekly basis. “As sales of new diesels continue to fall, 2017 could well mark the end of one era of motoring and the dawn of a new one, as hybrid and electric sales start to take off. “The destiny of diesel may already be set in stone. Now the Government needs to stand by its commitment to the future and put its full backing behind AFVs. “Incentives to encourage consumers to switch to hybrid and electric vehicles need to run alongside the billions of pounds of investment being pumped into the supporting infrastructure. Bloomberg blames “Brexit’s impact on buyer confidence and lingering skepticism over the emissions performance of diesel cars” for the 5.6% drop in UK car sales last year. The Financial Times agrees that Britain’s car industry needs clarity about the UK’s future relationship with the EU, fast: You can’t wait until March 2019,” [SMMT chief Mike Hawes] said, when the UK will leave the EU. “Production is a tap that takes a long time to turn on and off.” The SMMT said contingency plans could include carmakers investing in additional warehouse capacity to guard against delivery disruptions, or deciding to expand production abroad rather than produce new models in the UK. Mr Hawes said that even the more limited changes, such as investing in warehouse capacity, were the “thin end of the wedge” because they would impose additional costs on British car manufacturers, making them less competitive and damaging their ability to attract new investment. It’s official: Britain’s car industry has suffered its biggest drop in sales since the financial crisis. Sales of new vehicles fell by 5.6% during 2017 - the first annual decline since 2011, and the worst since 2009. Diesel sales were particularly dire, as my colleague Gwyn Topham explains: UK car sales declined in 2017 after five years of rapid growth, with the industry blaming government for a collapse in consumer confidence in diesel vehicles. Total sales for last year were 2.54m new vehicles, a decline of 5.6% on 2016, with diesel sales dropping 17%. Despite the decline, 2017 sales remained near the highest on record. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK automotive industry’s trade body, has forecast a further 5% to 7% decline in sales in 2018. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said 2017 had been a “very volatile year”. While sales reached a record high in March, by December they were 13.9% down year-on-year, with 152,000 fewer cars sold than in the same month in 2016. Hawes attributed the drop to a decline in business and consumer confidence in the wider economy and uncertainty over the future of diesel. Sales of diesel cars dropped by 31% in December, while petrol car sales dropped by 1.6%, after relatively minor tax changes targeting diesel in the November budget. The SMMT is now urging the UK government to rapidly agree a Brexit transition deal with Brussels. Otherwise, Hawes warns, carmakers will soon be forced to take tough - and potentially irreversible - decisions. He says: “Some investment decisions are overdue … we need clarity [on the terms of a transitional period] by the end of the first quarter.” [Otherwise] They will have to start implementing contingency plans.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With stock markets at record levels, investors will be looking to today’s US unemployment report for reasons to keep optimistic, and keep buying assets. The monthly non-farm payroll report is expected to show that America’s economy continued to create jobs in December. The Wall Street consensus is that around 190,000 new workers were hired across the US last month, down from 228,000 in November. But it’s possible that the NFP could be stronger. The figures will probably also show that America’s unemployment rate remained at just 4.1%. But economists will be hoping to see evidence that employees are being paid more. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: On a month-on-month basis average earnings are tipped to increase by 0.3% and on an annual basis they are forecasted to rise by 2.5%. The US has been steadily creating new jobs over the past few years, but wage growth has been sluggish. If the US economy wants to step up a gear in terms of economic growth, wage growth and in turn the spending levels will need to tick up. Also coming up today. European stock markets are expected to open mixed, after Thursday’s strong session drove the UK FTSE 100 to a new alltime high. Last night the US Dow Jones closed over 25,000 points for the first time ever, on hopes that the world economy will remain upbeat this year. Traders will also be watching out for the latest eurozone inflation figures, and new UK car sales figures (of which more in a moment....)

The overhauled offence provisions, introduced to the House of Representatives in December just hours after marriage equality became law, form part of the Coalition government’s broader crackdown on treason, espionage and foreign interference. If passed, the reform will increase tenfold the maximum penalties for anyone communicating information potentially harmful to the national interest, where that information is obtained via a government official without authorisation. “This is ‘creeping Stalinism,’” said Ethicos Group specialist Howard Whitton, who has advised governments and the United Nations ethics office on whistleblower policy. “The absolute protection of principled disclosure of wrongdoing – unfettered by government – must be preserved, or Australia will become a laughing stock internationally.” Australia’s existing official secrecy laws date back to 1914, when sections 70 and 79 of the federal Crimes Act were hurriedly introduced following the outbreak of the first world war. Describing prior prohibitions as “shamefully lax”, the attorney general (and future prime minister) Billy Hughes imposed a penalty of two years’ imprisonment on public servants who disclosed any government information without authorisation. No defences were made available. Despite the draconian nature of such wartime provisions, that legislation has remained law in Australia over the following century with only minimal amendment. In 2008, the Rudd government asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to hold an inquiry, which resulted in modest reform proposals in its report Secrecy Laws and Open Government in Australia. “Reform of Australia’s secrecy laws is long overdue,” said Hugh de Kretser, executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre. “After a careful and comprehensive review, the ALRC concluded that our secrecy laws were excessive and needed to be better targeted to protect legitimate government interests. Instead of acting on the ALRC’s recommendations, the Abbott government intensified our secrecy laws with the introduction of the Australian Border Force secrecy provisions and expansive Asio secrecy laws.” That trend looks set to continue. The proposed legislation criminalises communicating or otherwise dealing with information where that information was obtained by a public servant and is “inherently harmful” or likely to harm “Australia’s interests”. The former is defined as including any information produced by a security agency, while the latter includes prejudicing Australia’s international relations “in any way” or damaging relations between the federal government and a state. “These broad definitions, coupled with penalties of up to 20 years in prison, raise serious risks of stifling the free flow of information and leaving Australian people ignorant of important matters in the public interest,” de Kretser said. “Open government is a foundational principle of democracy. Australians have a right to know what their government does in their name. Of course, some information must remain secret to protect our security and national interests. But these proposed laws have not got the balance right.” The new provisions are primarily directed at commonwealth officers, defined to include current and former public servants, contractors, defence force personnel and employees of businesses who provide services to the federal government. But the expansive wording of the offences means any person who comes into contact with information obtained by a commonwealth officer could fall within the legislation’s scope. The prescribed penalty ranges from five to 15 years’ imprisonment for standard offences, stretching to 20 years for aggravated offences. Aggravating circumstances include where the relevant information was classified secret or above, the person committing the offence held a government security clearance, or the offence involved five or more records each with a security classification. These aggravation provisions appear intentionally designed to target Edward Snowden-type leakers. The bill’s explanatory memorandum even provides an example strikingly similar to the Snowden case, a contractor who leaked extensive American intelligence information to the Guardian and other publications. “Person A is employed as an IT systems administrator at a commonwealth government intelligence agency,” the explanatory memorandum hypothesised. “Throughout his employment Person A copied 1,000 electronic files from the agency’s internal holdings to a personal hard drive … Person A publishes all 1,000 documents on the internet.” This impetus for the new offences mirrors that of stalled attempts to reform official secrecy laws in the UK, which were described last year by Open Rights Group chief executive Jim Killock as “a full-front attack … squarely aimed at the Guardian and Edward Snowden.” “The suggested changes take the wrong lessons from the Snowden and other revelations, and ignore the reality of the connected, global information environment in which we now live,” said Gill Phillips, director of editorial legal services at Guardian News and Media. “If public interest journalism is made harder or even criminalised, there is a real risk that whistleblowers will bypass responsible journalists altogether, and simply anonymously self-publish data leaks online, without any accountability.” While journalists are partially protected by a defence established in the new laws, this safeguard has been derided as insufficient. Journalists prosecuted under the offence would be required to satisfy a court that their reporting met vaguely defined criteria, said the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) chief executive Paul Murphy. “The explanatory memorandum states that journalist protections are lost if they are not engaged in what is deemed to be ‘fair and accurate reporting’ and in circumstances where it is alleged their reporting is ‘distorted,’” he said. “The protection is entirely unavailable if the subject matter is said to not be in the public interest. This is a very broad term. “A further issue is the definition of ‘journalist’ used in the bill. The MEAA acknowledges that this definition covers journalists not regularly employed in a professional capacity and may include a person who self-publishes news or news analysis, but anchoring the definition of journalists to the dictionary meaning could well prove a mistake down the track and lead to legitimate coverage being excluded from the bill’s modest protections.” The proposed legislation additionally provides that the public interest test will not be met where the information concerns the identify of intelligence officers, or if the journalist’s conduct could endanger public health or safety. The draft statute is also ambiguous about the legal test to be applied: whether the reporting must objectively be in the public interest or whether it is sufficient for the journalist to reasonably believe it to be so. “It is always hard to know how this type of defence will work until you see how a judge interprets it,” said Phillips. “On the face of it, it is a good thing that thought is being given to the inclusion of a public interest defence, especially as there is not one presently available. However, the reality is that public interest defences to alleged criminal acts are few and far between. What we do know from our experience in other areas of the law is that it can be hard for journalists where the evidential burden, as I understand is being proposed here, rests on them.” Public servant whistleblowers will not enjoy the benefit of a public interest defence. While the offences are not applicable where the information is disclosed through appropriate channels via the Public Interest Disclosure Act, the federal whistleblower protection scheme, that law has often been criticised as ineffective and is awaiting reform. The approach taken in the proposed reform, according to Murphy, “ignores the inherent weaknesses of these laws to protect complainants and preserve their rights. These changes represent a substantial threat to whistleblowers and journalists who seek to publish critical public information. Whistleblowers in Australia get punished; it is as simple as that. Laws like these create further disincentives for people who witness wrongdoing and corruption to air their concerns.” “This is a corruption issue, not a free speech issue,” added Whitton. “Australia is at serious risk of state capture if whistleblowers are not protected.” Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull’s second reading speech to the House of Representatives gave little attention to this element of the amendment bill, with the term “secrecy” appearing just once. A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Department said: “The government is committed to striking the right balance between openness and transparency in government and the legitimate need to protect some commonwealth information. “Protecting Australia from espionage and foreign interference relies heavily on having strong protections for our information, especially where disclosure causes harm to an essential public interest.

That’s the situation in Florida, where unusually cold temperatures have sent the green lizards tumbling from their perches on trees – a result of the cold-blooded creatures basically shutting down when it gets too chilly. The iguanas are probably not dead, experts say, but merely stunned and will reanimate when they warm up. Iguanas aren’t the only species struggling to cope with the cold snap. In Texas, the temperature in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico has dipped low enough to cold-stun sea turtles, causing them to float to the surface where they are vulnerable to predators. The National Park Service had rescued 41 live but freezing turtles by midday Tuesday. Meanwhile on Massuchusetts’ Cape Cod, the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has reported the strandings of three thresher sharks. Two of the sharks were probably suffering from “cold shock”, the group said, while the third had frozen solid. “A true sharkcicle!” the group wrote on Facebook. Even animals that seem particularly well-suited to frigid temperatures are feeling the chill. The Calgary Zoo announced on Sunday that it was moving its king penguins inside amid -13F (-25C) temperatures. King penguins are native to the subantarctic islands surrounding Antarctica. And a group of snowmobilers in Canada rescued a bull moose buried in 6ft of snow. If penguins and moose can’t handle this weather, chances are your dog or cat can’t either. The Humane Society advises pet owners to keep their animals inside, make sure they have plenty of food and water, and wipe their paws with a damp towel to remove residue from sidewalk salt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jan/05/larissa-waters-faces-tough-internal-challenge-for-greens-spot-in-senate","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T00:56:55Z","webTitle":"Larissa Waters faces tough internal challenge for Greens spot in Senate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/05/larissa-waters-faces-tough-internal-challenge-for-greens-spot-in-senate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jan/05/larissa-waters-faces-tough-internal-challenge-for-greens-spot-in-senate","fields":{"headline":"Larissa Waters faces tough internal challenge for Greens spot in Senate","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Former Greens senator Larissa Waters faces a more complicated path back to Canberra, with the announcement that Ben Pennings will challenge her for the party’s lead Senate spot. The incumbent senator, Andrew Bartlett, who replaced Waters in the Senate when she resigned over her dual citizenship, said on Friday he also planned to nominate. Pennings was third on the 2016 Queensland Greens Senate ticket, before leaving his job as a party media adviser to help lead the Stop Adani group. The race for the lead candidacy is being billed by party members as the most important preselection contest the Queensland Greens have faced, with a divide emerging between members who support the more “established” candidates, such as Waters, and others who want the party to take a more radical position. Pennings has taken aim at fears the federal party was losing relevance. “The numbers are clear,” he wrote in a statement posted to his Facebook page on Friday. “We must do at least 50 per cent better than our 7 per cent vote last federal election, when we were saved by a double dissolution election. “This requires change. Disaffected outer surburban and regional voters who supported us in 2010 have not come back, have instead flirted with the populism of Palmer and the horrors of Hanson. “We must appeal to these voters, many who now see the Greens as part of the ‘inner-city’ political establishment. With the right candidate we can get a senator elected, instead of a Hanson candidate. People living in outer suburbs, regional towns and rural communities will vote for us in large numbers if we focus on their needs and concerns.” Waters became the second federal senator to resign over dual citizenship concerns last year. Former Australian Democrats senator Andrew Bartlett, who had been next on the Senate ticket, stepped into the role in her place, but it had been understood Waters would return as the lead candidate for the next election. However, Bartlett confirmed to Guardian Australia on Friday he would also nominate again. The party’s federal leadership have stated their desire to see Waters returned to Canberra, but have repeatedly said the decision lies with the Queensland party branch members. The Queensland Greens have experienced a small resurgence in popularity, with Jonathan Sri, known federally as “rainbow scarf man”, winning a Brisbane council ward from Labor in 2016, and Michael Berkman becoming the first Greens MP in state parliament after winning former Newman government minister Scott Emerson’s seat in the 2017 election. Waters remains popular within the Queensland Greens, but the party has wrestled with some of the same issues affecting the New South Wales branch. Bartlett, who may face a section 44 challenge of his own over his university work, depending on the outcome of a parliamentary inquiry into the contentious constitutional section, is yet to state his intentions for the preselection battle. Waters has been contacted for comment. Preselection opens on Saturday, with a decision to be made in March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/05/manchester-city-vincent-kompany-premier-league-drop-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T00:04:27Z","webTitle":"Vincent Kompany calls on Premier League clubs to drop ticket prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/05/manchester-city-vincent-kompany-premier-league-drop-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/05/manchester-city-vincent-kompany-premier-league-drop-prices","fields":{"headline":"Vincent Kompany calls on Premier League clubs to drop ticket prices","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vincent Kompany has called on Premier League clubs to force down the price of match tickets and attract the “right people” back into football. The Manchester City captain has recently graduated with an MBA [Master of Business Administration] from Manchester Business School and, during his research on maximising revenues from home advantage, he concluded ticket prices should be reduced for business reasons. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live’s Wake Up To Money, Kompany said: “You get better home advantage depending on the atmosphere that you can create within your facilities, and that is linked to the people who enter your stadiums. The Premier League is generating two or three times the revenue of the other top five leagues in Europe, so at what point do you realise that your revenues are that big as a TV product, and the revenue from match-day tickets is only getting smaller? “At what point do you decide we are actually now going to make sure if it is a TV product, it is the best product in the world? Meaning not just the best players, but the best atmosphere in the stadium; meaning the right people in the right place.” Kompany, who has been at City since 2008, in which time the club has been transformed into one of the world’s richest, added: “Those that live for the club, are probably more attached to the club than anybody else. But those are probably not always the guys who can afford it. “We know the Premier League can still grow. The question is at what point do you reach breaking point where you squeezed so much out of your people at home?” Kompany, 31, who is likely to be part of the Belgium squad that faces England in their World Cup group in Russia this summer, added: “If you assume the Premier League gets bigger and you gain markets in China, India, Africa, America, you could fill the grounds with tourists. You can do it, and make more money. They’d just come and spend £400 a ticket, it’s nothing for them because it is a once in a lifetime experience, like going to an NBA or NFL game.

Son Heung-min blasted Tottenham Hotspur level just when it seemed that West Ham were going to pull off one of the great Wembley heists, but Moyes could still reflect on another minor tactical triumph. There will be a temptation to belittle West Ham’s approach, even though they were confronted by a brilliant Spurs side who have already torn to shreds Borussia Dortmund, Liverpool and Real Madrid this season. They swallowed the key after parking the bus and there were times when a repeat of West Ham’s Carabao Cup victory here in October, when they produced a sensational comeback from two goals down, looked about as likely as Moyes running on to join his team’s desperate defensive effort However they were hardly the first lowly team to go into lockdown mode against a so-called big-six opponent – negativity from the inhabitants of the bottom half has been a prominent feature in the most exciting league in the world all season – and a dismissal of West Ham’s willingness to cede possession would underestimate how broken they were when Bilic was finally sacked. The Croat’s final game in charge was a humiliating 4-1 home defeat by Liverpool at the start of November. Since his arrival, Moyes has beaten Chelsea, drawn with Arsenal and Spurs, and almost held Manchester City. West Ham remain in grave danger of going down despite ending the festive period on a positive note, with this battling 1-1 draw and Tuesday’s dramatic 2-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion lifting them two points above the bottom three. Their uncertain future, which stems from their long litany of mistakes in the transfer market, has forced them into an embrace of pragmatism. Moyes has often sighed about his squad’s lack of depth and balance, weaknesses that threatened to undermine them against Mauricio Pochettino’s side. Without the injured Marko Arnautovic, Michail Antonio and Aaron Cresswell, West Ham arrived with a scratch side, naming four academy players on the bench and using a raw but game 18-year-old defender, Declan Rice, as part of a five-man defence whose onerous task was to keep Harry Kane quiet. Kane had his first sight of goal after four minutes, forcing the impressive Rice to hook clear in the six-yard box, and it would not be his last. One of Kane’s most impressive qualities is how regularly he looks to unload shots and he had four in the first half an hour, testing Adrián with the best of them, a curling effort from 25 yards. With Cheikhou Kouyaté, Mark Noble and Pedro Obiang performing screening roles and in midfield, West Ham’s ambition was limited. Midway through the first half the isolated and ineffective Javier Hernández produced an inviting cutback from the right, only to realise that none of his team-mates had managed to burst into the Spurs area. Then Manuel Lanzini got a bit excited and ran into a threatening position before losing possession; Tottenham broke, but West Ham still had five defenders back and the attack fizzled out. There were, of course, plenty of moments to make the visitors wince. Kane miscontrolled in front of goal, while Christian Eriksen and Son tested Adrián’s reflexes. This was one of Winston Reid’s better performances, though, and the home team’s frustration grew despite their dominance. The crowd’s howls when Moussa Sissoko sent a pass out for a throw were telling. Spurs were vulnerable to a sucker-punch and Obiang duly landed it when he let fly from 25 yards. Hugo Lloris was stunned, just like everyone else inside the stadium. West Ham had taken until the 70th minute to have a shot and now they were in front. But back came Spurs, with Son conjuring an equaliser to rival Obiang’s spectacular goal, and the points were shared. It seemed slightly preposterous. West Ham had contributed so little as an attacking force. As he barked orders from his technical area, though, Moyes was not alone in appreciating the value of good organisation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/04/tottenham-hotspur-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T00:21:00Z","webTitle":"Spurs’ Son Heung-min matches Pedro Obiang’s strike in draw with West Ham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/04/tottenham-hotspur-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/04/tottenham-hotspur-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Spurs’ Son Heung-min matches Pedro Obiang’s strike in draw with West Ham","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There was little on for Pedro Obiang. Just as there had been little on for West Ham United for 70 minutes, which had not been a great surprise given the emphasis David Moyes has placed on defensive solidity. Obiang had three Tottenham players in his vicinity but none of them moved to close him down and so he edged forward a little and decided to have a shot. What happened next sent the travelling supporters into raptures and represented the latest step in the right direction for the club’s relegation battle. From fully 25 yards, Obiang aimed a shot at Hugo Lloris’s near, top corner and the goalkeeper could only feel its fizz as it beat him. Perhaps Lloris was surprised. It was not only West Ham’s first shot of the evening but their first opening of any description. Moyes had instructed Obiang to sit in front of the back five, alongside Mark Noble, and not to stray too far. “I don’t know what Pedro was doing there,” Noble said with a smile. When the ball hit the net, the smash and grab was on. Tottenham were staring at a setback in their attempt to get closer to the top four. They needed a riposte. Son Heung-min provided it. Whatever Obiang could do, he clearly felt he could match. It was a similar kind of situation. Son had no clear options when he collected possession and so he tried his luck. He cut across the ball with his right boot and the swerve and power were too much for Adrián. The long-range classics brought a drab encounter to life. Rather abruptly, a London derby broke out and West Ham, against the run of play, might even have nicked it. André Ayew, who Moyes felt had made a difference after his introduction as a substitute, wriggled through and Lloris needed to block at close quarters. Defeat would have been awfully hard on Tottenham, who dominated the game and had 31 attempts on goal to West Ham’s three. They hogged possession and for long periods, it seemed as though they were camped inside the West Ham half. But it was not a night when Harry Kane or any of their attacking talents were able to cut loose. Moyes put that down to the resilience of his players. “My reaction was disbelief when Pedro’s goal went in,” he said. “It was a brilliant strike. I hadn’t really seen him do it in training. But it was about the players’ resolve tonight. We had one of the worst defensive records in the Premier League when I came in but we’re on a good run.” West Ham had already won the most important game of their week – the home fixture against relegation rivals West Bromwich Albion on Tuesday – and the pre-match theory had been that this was something of a free hit, if a must-not-lose derby against hated rivals can be so considered. Tottenham’s previous match had been their 2-0 win away to Swansea. A feature of Moyes’s tenure has been his cagey approach against so-called big six teams and it had worked in the victory over Chelsea and the 0-0 draw against Arsenal. West Ham had even looked good in the loss at Manchester City. As against those teams, they were under no pressure to come out. They did not. West Ham made it into the Tottenham penalty area only once during the first half, through Javier Hernández and, when the striker cut the ball back, there was nobody there. But Moyes has made no apologies for his approach in this type of game and with the unbalanced squad that he has inherited, he need not. Kane was back in the Tottenham starting XI, after only playing the last 22 minutes against Swansea, and he had five flickers in or around the West Ham box in the first half without truly threatening. He worked Adrián from 20 yards and when Serge Aurier headed Jan Vertonghen’s long ball inside, Kane could not meet it. Davinson Sánchez had seen a shot blocked in the early running, after Adrián had dropped a corner, but West Ham could be pleased at their efforts to keep Tottenham at arm’s length in the first half. Most of the home team’s attempts were from distance and there were a couple of ragged ones from Eric Dier and Aurier, which seemed like signs of frustration. On the other hand, Christian Eriksen fizzed a low one past the post and fully extended Adrián with a deflected shot on 45 minutes, after Dele Alli had teed him up with a nutmeg on Obiang. Tottenham continued to press in the second half; West Ham continued to throw bodies in their way. Eriksen had a volley blocked by Winston Reid and another shot saved by Adrián while Kane turned Reid only for Pablo Zabaleta to step across to make the saving tackle. When the ball looped up, Adrián cleaned out Alli but Mauricio Pochettino did not complain about the non-award of a penalty. “We did everything to win but sometimes this happens in football,” the Spurs manager said. “We scored from our most difficult situation and, in the end, we need to be happy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/05/calls-for-australia-to-implement-more-road-safety-measures-to-reduce-road-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T00:39:56Z","webTitle":"Road toll: new car technology must be mandatory, government adviser says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/05/calls-for-australia-to-implement-more-road-safety-measures-to-reduce-road-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/05/calls-for-australia-to-implement-more-road-safety-measures-to-reduce-road-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Road toll: new car technology must be mandatory, government adviser says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"An expert leading the government’s effort to curb the road toll has called for autonomous emergency braking technology to be made mandatory in all new cars immediately. John Crozier, a surgeon, has warned Australia is not on track to meet its already conservative targets to reduce road deaths and serious injuries by 30% in the 10 years to 2020. He has urged the new transport minister, Barnaby Joyce, to bring the same passion and leadership to road safety as his predecessor and fellow National Darren Chester, who was dumped in Malcolm Turnbull’s December cabinet reshuffle. Crozier, who has been appointed to review Australia’s 10-year road safety strategy, said the government must take dramatic steps to achieve its road toll targets. That includes moving more quickly than European nations to make modern car safety technologies mandatory. The European Commission has directed that collision avoidance, autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning and fatigue monitoring technology be mandatory in all cars by 2020. “We could move more quickly than that,” Crozier told Guardian Australia. “Autonomous emergency braking will predictably deliver decrease in death and serious injury, and certainly decrease the number of crashes. “The immediate implementation of that has been adopted by South Korea late last year. Now, if that ... nation can do something as dramatic as that as quickly, we as a nation should be prepared to demonstrate agility adopting those proven safety measurements.” Asked whether Australia should follow South Korea’s lead, Crozier responded: “Absolutely.” The road toll has been in long-term decline in Australia since the early 1970s, but recent rises have prompted concern among experts. In 2017, Australia was on track to post a near-record low death rate on its roads. The number of deaths per 100,000 people fell to 4.92 in the 12 months to the end of November, down from 5.62 the previous year. There were 1,209 road deaths in the same period, 5% fewer than the previous year. But the result may have been marred by a horror Christmas period in some states, including New South Wales, where 28 people died, double last year’s toll. Crozier said the current road toll, even with the long-term decline, was unacceptable. “It’s still an acceptance that there will be over 1,000 of us killed each year on the roads as a price paid to travel. That’s actually an unreasonable cost,” Crozier said. “Forty-four thousand seriously injured. A country town of moderate size, the whole population of that hospitalised each year as a price for travelling ... is absolutely unacceptable.” Crozier said the black spot program, which seeks to prioritise funding and infrastructure improvements in areas with high numbers of road death, was flawed. It acted only as a band-aid solution to dangerous areas, he said, when improvements were needed to the entire road corridor. “What we know in 2017 is that there are a number of engineering elements in a road system which from the outset will make that whole traffic corridor much safer,” he said. “Better by far to target that funding to improving the whole corridor than playing band-aid fix-up, catch-up, after the event, after accepting numbers of deaths and serious injuries.” Australia’s road toll targets are relatively low compared with other countries. Car manufacturers such as Volvo and international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development believe the road toll can be quickly cut to zero. The UN believes road deaths and serious injuries can be cut by 50% of 2010 levels by 2020. “But we also need to accept how fragile as human creatures we are,” Crozier said. “As a surgeon I see each day the serious injury [of] the forces generated from these crashes, thousands of which occur each day on our roads.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/04/trump-administration-plans-to-allow-oil-and-gas-drilling-off-nearly-all-us-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T22:17:50Z","webTitle":"Trump administration plans to allow oil and gas drilling off nearly all US coast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/trump-administration-plans-to-allow-oil-and-gas-drilling-off-nearly-all-us-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/04/trump-administration-plans-to-allow-oil-and-gas-drilling-off-nearly-all-us-coast","fields":{"headline":"Trump administration plans to allow oil and gas drilling off nearly all US coast","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Trump administration has unveiled a plan that would open almost all US offshore territory to oil and gas drilling, including previously protected areas of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the interior, said a new oil and gas leasing programme, which would run from 2019 to 2024, would make more than 90% of the outer continental shelf available for what would be the largest ever number of lease sales to fossil fuel companies. The draft plan includes nearly 50 lease sales in all but one of 26 planning areas in US waters, including 19 sales off the coast of Alaska, seven in the Pacific, 12 in the Gulf of Mexico and nine in the Atlantic. The plan reverses protections put in place by the Obama administration and would introduce drilling for the first time to the Atlantic seaboard – a prospect fiercely opposed by communities along the east coast. “We want to grow our nation’s offshore energy industry, instead of slowly surrendering it to foreign shores,” Zinke said. “This is a clear difference between energy weakness and energy dominance. Under President Trump we’re going to have the strongest energy policies and be the strongest energy superpower.” Zinke said any drilling would be done in an environmentally sustainable way and that the plan will be subject to a “lengthy and robust” public comment period. But the prospect of oil rigs deployed across huge areas of US territorial waters brought immediate condemnation from an unlikely alliance of environmental groups and some senior Republicans. Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida, said he opposed drilling off the state’s coast due to environmental concerns. “I have already asked to meet immediately with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the critical need to remove Florida from consideration,” Scott said. Other states reacted with hostility to the new plan, with the governors of New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina all expressing concerns about the potential impact upon marine ecosystems and coastal economies that rely on tourism and fishing. The governors of west coast states – California, Washington and Oregon – have also condemned the prospect of drilling in the Pacific for the first time since 1984. Opponents of drilling have raised the spectre of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, one of the worst environmental disasters in US history. The incident on the BP rig caused 215m gallons of crude oil to flood into the gulf, coating beaches and seabirds and leaving a toxic legacy that is still felt. BP has paid more than $60bn in penalties since the disaster. “Trump’s trying to turn our oceans into oilfields,” said Kristen Monsell, ocean program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “His reckless plan would expose more wildlife and coastal communities to devastating oil spills. “Offshore drilling is dirty and dangerous and many coastal communities want no part of it. Letting the oil industry loose in our oceans will mean more deadly disasters like the Deepwater Horizon. And when those big oil spills happen in the Arctic, they’ll be impossible to clean up. “This appalling plan should be a call to action for everyone who wants to move past the dirty energy and politics of the past.” Shortly before leaving office, Barack Obama made 115m acres (47m hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8m (1.5m hectares) acres in the Atlantic from New England to Virginia off limits for drilling, citing fragile ecosystems and public sentiment for the decision. By contrast, Zinke has proposed that just one area, off the coast of Alaska, be safeguarded from drilling – because it was protected by an executive order issued by George W Bush. It is unclear how many companies will bid for leases once they are offered, given the current low price of oil. But some Republicans have voiced optimism that an expansion in drilling will spur economic activity, despite the potential fallout for coastal towns and marine life. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican who is House majority whip, said the plan was “yet another positive step” by Trump towards “American energy dominance”. “With increased exploration and production in the Gulf and beyond, Louisiana will see more jobs and continue to receive the revenue sharing that is vital to rebuilding our coast,” he said. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which will oversee the leasing process, is to hold a 60-day period of public comment on the plan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/04/lta-tennis-review-after-coach-abuse-case","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T20:09:33Z","webTitle":"LTA launches review into procedural failings over jailed tennis coach","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/04/lta-tennis-review-after-coach-abuse-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/04/lta-tennis-review-after-coach-abuse-case","fields":{"headline":"LTA launches review into procedural failings over jailed tennis coach","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Lawn Tennis Association has announced an independent review chaired by Christopher Quinlan QC into its failures for years to heed warnings about a coach, Daniel Sanders, who in July was sentenced to six years in prison for sexually abusing an underage player. The LTA admitted that its safeguarding failed after it did not act sufficiently on the warnings, and promised that the review would highlight these inadequacies. In the terms of reference, agreed with Sports Resolutions, which will oversee the review, the LTA promised: “The overriding objective of the review is to ensure that any failings by the LTA are brought to light and to ensure that lessons are learned and similar failings are not repeated.” The terms of reference state that Quinlan and his two panel members, Jane Aldred and Lisa Wilkins, both solicitors, should have access to all materials they require, and that “the review is keen to talk to individuals who have been directly or indirectly involved with, or affected by, the events”. As revealed by the Guardian in November , Sanders was allowed to remain in his job as head coach at the Wrexham Tennis Centre (WTC) for years despite other coaches and parents repeatedly sounding the alarm about his bullying and sexualised conduct towards young players. One parent, Richard Hughes, who was an experienced police officer, in 2012 explicitly warned that in his professional assessment, Sanders fitted the profile of a sexual predator. Both the WTC and LTA conducted some form of inquiry at that time following warnings and complaints made in writing by other coaches that Sanders was untrustworthy and behaving highly inappropriately, but both permitted Sanders to continue in his role coaching young girls. The LTA said the review will make its final report publicly available, saying the panel itself will decide what should be published. The terms of reference state that if the review finds information of further offences or safeguarding concerns, they will pass it to the local authority, “and, where appropriate, the police”. Any breaches of tennis regulations will be referred to the LTA or Tennis Wales “who will take appropriate action”. Hughes, whose daughter complained of being bullied by Sanders at the WTC, said he welcomed the announcement of the review and he hoped that people affected will come forward with information and evidence. “For me, only a thorough, transparent enquiry, with those who failed to protect children in the past being held to account, and lessons learned implemented, will restore the confidence of parents, players and coaches in the future,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/04/grand-designs-27000-eco-home-in-wales-burns-to-the-ground","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T21:13:27Z","webTitle":"Grand Designs £27,000 eco-home in Wales burns to the ground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/grand-designs-27000-eco-home-in-wales-burns-to-the-ground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/04/grand-designs-27000-eco-home-in-wales-burns-to-the-ground","fields":{"headline":"Grand Designs £27,000 eco-home in Wales burns to the ground","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An eco-home labelled the “cheapest house ever built in the western hemisphere” on the Channel 4 programme Grand Designs, has been destroyed by a fire.

Friends of the couple, who have two children, have launched a Justgiving fundraising page and are asking people to donate so the house can be rebuilt. Almost £6,000 has been raised so far. Jane Wells, who set up the fund, said the fire started on New Year’s Day and the house, which the family had built themselves, was destroyed. Wells said: “Simon, Jasmine and their two children have been residents at Lammas eco village, Pembrokeshire since the start of the project. They have been working on their family home for the past six years. “This beautiful building was featured on Grand Designs. Sadly, a fire started on New Year’s Day and their beloved home was burned to the ground.” She added: “Luckily, no one was hurt but, as you can imagine, the family are devastated.” Firefighters spent six hours at the scene trying to extinguish the blaze but the house, which was made with reclaimed materials including glass and timber and insulated with sheep’s wool, could not be saved. Dai Swan, group manager for Mid and West Wales fire and rescue service, told the Western Telegraph: “It’s utterly heartbreaking for the crews seeing how much workmanship has gone into these [house] frames. “Each piece of this building is bespoke, it’s done to a beautifully high standard and to see it damaged by fire is just heartbreaking.” Posting on its Facebook page, Lammas community hub said it was a suspected electrical fire. The post continued: “Their huge greenhouse escaped, as did Simon’s workshop, and their little roundhouse is still fine too. Huge amount of work that went into the creation of the building, and the kids rooms, all destroyed. Thankfully no one was hurt, which is a miracle.” The Dales began building their dream home with just £500 in the bank and moved into it in October 2013. On the popular housebuilding programme, presenter Kevin McCloud told viewers: “This won’t be a cramped hobbit house, but a spacious, solid, three-bed, low-impact family home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/04/melt-up-coinage-could-signal-last-hurrah-for-us-stock-market","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T19:27:34Z","webTitle":"'Melt-up' coinage could signal last hurrah for US stock market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/04/melt-up-coinage-could-signal-last-hurrah-for-us-stock-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jan/04/melt-up-coinage-could-signal-last-hurrah-for-us-stock-market","fields":{"headline":"'Melt-up' coinage could signal last hurrah for US stock market","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Welcome to the world of “melt-up”, a phrase we could be hearing a lot in coming months. It describes the idea that the US stock market, despite currently looking absurdly expensive by traditional yardsticks, could be set for one last euphoric hurrah before the inevitable crash happens. There are a couple of reasons why the “melt-up” theory may not be as wacky as it sounds. First, it comes from Jeremy Grantham, an investor who has rightly earned a reputation for knowing how to read financial bubbles. He dodged the end-of-the-century dotcom bubble and the 2007-09 blowup in the US housing market – two of the best calls anybody could have made in the past 20 years. Grantham’s default setting, as you would expect, tends to be bearish, or at least cautious. If he’s talking melt-up, that’s newsworthy. Besides, GMO, the Boston-based fund management group he founded, manages $75bn of assets – he’s a player. A second reason is that Grantham is certainly not arguing that shares are cheap. “We can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high,” he states. Instead, his melt-up thinking is driven by a “mish-mash of statistical and psychological factors based on previous eras”. On the statistical side, he points out that the global economy is in sync, profit margins are fat and president Trump’s corporate tax cuts could make them even fatter and “perhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising”. Then there’s the fact that the current strength in the stock market is fairly broad-based. In past bubbles, the end was nigh when gains were concentrated in an increasingly small collection of “winners”. The likes of Apple are roaring this time, but the same divergence has not occurred – yet. For “touchy-feely” evidence of excess about to appear, Grantham looks at media coverage. US newspapers and TV stations are getting interested in financial markets (with bitcoin, “a true, crazy mini-bubble of its own”, to the fore) but not yet with the wild obsession of the frenzied dotcom years. “Keep an eye on what the TVs at lunchtime eateries are showing,” he says. Grantham’s guess is that there is more than a 50% chance of a melt-up, or end-phase of the bubble, within the next six months to two years. If it happens, then there’s a 90% probability of a melt-down, which could mean a halving of share prices from the peak. A credible theory? Well, yes, anything is possible. A year ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average passed 20,000, few thought it would hit 25,000 within 12 months – but it happened on Thursday. Is that a case of extreme euphoria, or just early signs of it? Given the impossibility of knowing, Grantham’s advice to “brace yourself” sounds reasonable. Brace, and keep a clear eye on the exit. Debenhams Christmas tidings not as joyful as chief predicted Eight months ago the chief executive of Debenhams, Sergio Bucher was telling investors he would make the tired-looking department store group “a destination, digital and different”. He didn’t quite disavow discounting, but the tactic would be deployed less often and with more impact. Nice idea, shame about the results. Even before the completion of one lap of a three-year plan, Debenhams has coughed up a horrible profits warning that imperils shareholders’ dividends, even if nobody is saying so yet. Profits for the full year will arrive at £55m-£65m. Call that a plunge of a third from last year’s £95m. Debenhams’s Christmas grumbles sound familiar. The report was a long complaint about the “highly competitive” and “promotion-driven” state of the market, especially on “gifts”, which is shorthand for everything from booze to Christmas crackers. That won’t cut much ice with investors. The likes of B&amp;M, with its cheap’n’cheerful sheds, aren’t going away. One can’t, of course, judge a three-year revival plan on the basis of one bad Christmas. Equally, however, you can’t blame investors for taking a gloomy view – the shares plunged 15% and Debenhams is now worth just £370m. Five years ago, the business was making £139m of pre-tax profits and the downwards trend has been consistent. Borrowings are lower than they were in the bad old days of private equity ownership, as the company keeps saying, but the current “medium-term financial leverage target” is to reduce net debt to 0.5 times top-line operating profits. The new profits forecast may mean no progress whatsoever from last year’s 1.3 times. That is why a dividend costing £42m a year looks unsustainable – the theoretical (or imaginary) dividend yield of 11% says as much. Bucher came from Amazon, where they don’t have to worry about excess store space, long leaseholds or even shareholders’ dividend expectations. Good luck – this job looks much harder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2018/jan/06/burberry-check-makes-a-casual-comeback-with-gosha-rubchinskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T18:21:03Z","webTitle":"Burberry check makes a casual comeback with Gosha Rubchinskiy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/06/burberry-check-makes-a-casual-comeback-with-gosha-rubchinskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2018/jan/06/burberry-check-makes-a-casual-comeback-with-gosha-rubchinskiy","fields":{"headline":"Burberry check makes a casual comeback with Gosha Rubchinskiy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good news – or bad, depending on your memory. The Burberry check is back in the luxury fashion fold, thanks to a collaboration with hip Russian designer Gosha Rubchinskiy. Going on sale on the same day the fashion industry poured into London for the menswear shows, it launched in Dover Street Market in Piccadilly and various Burberry stores, with both featuring football-themed installations of the collaboration. A handful of teenagers arrived in the dark to queue, wearing Burberry scarves to stay warm. The collection offered a bold return to the brand’s difficult role in 1980s and 1990s “casual culture”, with Burberry-check shirts and matching shorts, Harrington jackets and a split-colour trench with a checked lining. Gabardine bucket hats and caps, another collaboration between the designers and milliner Stephen Jones, rounded off the collection and were the fastest items to sell, despite the usual Burberry prices (hats start at £175). The Russian designer also continued his more affordable collaboration with Adidas, which featured shellsuits, T-shirts (£40) and drawstring bags (£20) in the run-up to this summer’s World Cup. In many ways, given London’s lighter schedule, the weekend’s launch makes sense. Rubchinskiy routinely shows off-calendar, but Burberry skipped the London men’s shows last year and this year will hold a “co-ed” show in February. The various collaborations were shown at Rubchinskiy’s show in St Petersburg, the first city in Russia to play football in the 19th century. It’s this theme that the designer said anchors the whole collection to England. “I thought, ‘Which brand is most iconic?’” he told the Financial Times. “It’s Burberry.” The labels’ shared references are glaring, but, culturally, they run much deeper. Burberry has historically suffered from counterfeits, while the Russian designer often celebrates the counterfeit culture of Russia before the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union with ironic branding and motifs. And just as Burberry became a signifier for the British working class, Rubchinskiy often references the tracksuit wardrobe of the “gopnik”, the Russian equivalent of controversial British slang word “chav”. Last year, Christopher Bailey stepped down as Burberry’s CEO, having boosted sales to £2.8bn following a shaky decade in which the brand suffered from its own success. Once linked to terrace hooliganism, it later rolled out affordable gateway pieces such as dog collars, the affordability of which pushed Burberry too sharply into the mainstream in the early 2000s. In an attempt to shake off its tricky past, the brand removed its signature check from almost 90% of its pieces, or tucked it into lining. On Saturday, in Burberry’s own store, the customers were largely affluent buyers and bloggers, who bought multiple pieces. At Dover Street, they were teenagers, affectionately known as Gosha-heads. One, aged 16, in a Burberry scarf, was queuing from 8.30am, determined to get his hands on some of Rubchinskiy’s pins. “We were expecting it to be like the Supreme and Louis Vuitton collaboration” he said. “It wasn’t nearly as busy here, though, so we went and got breakfast before coming back.” Though an outlier of the luxury industry, Rubchinskiy has turned elevated sportswear into something marketable and mass. His continued popularity comes at an interesting time politically. While the relationship between east and west is frosty, there has been a rebirth in youth engagement here with ideologies that borrow from communism, something the designer regularly riffs on by either referencing the hammer and sickle or alluding to nostalgic post-Soviet fashion. The price point of this collection is not the end of capitalism – but it will be interesting to see how well it sells."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/06/dorset-police-launch-appeal-after-woman-and-son-go-missing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T16:18:07Z","webTitle":"Dorset police launch appeal after woman and son go missing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/06/dorset-police-launch-appeal-after-woman-and-son-go-missing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/06/dorset-police-launch-appeal-after-woman-and-son-go-missing","fields":{"headline":"Dorset police launch appeal after woman and son go missing","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Dorset police have launched an appeal to find a woman who has gone missing with her three-year-old son.

A goal after 10 minutes from Rudy Gestede, another after 42 minutes from Martin Braithwaite and Boro had justified their odds-on status without drama. Sunderland were the visitors. The new Middlesbrough manager, Tony Pulis, had said he would name a strong team and he did. Other than Britt Assombalonga it was the same starting XI that faced Aston Villa here last Saturday and Assombalonga’s replacement, Adama Traoré, was as significant to the result as anyone. Sunderland’s new manager, Chris Coleman, would also like to be able to name a strong starting XI. He is however in no such position and already with 11 injuries in his squad, his top scorer, the loanee Lewis Grabban, returned to his parent club, Bournemouth, on Friday. That left Coleman handing in a teamsheet with 18 names, of which George Honeyman was the top scorer with four goals. The other 17 had five between them. Given there were four teenagers on that sheet, plus six more aged 23 or under, it could be argued Sunderland did well to get two efforts on target. Add the facts that the club is up for sale, but unwanted, and bottom of the Championship and Sunderland are in serious peril – in the short- and long-term. “We’re in a dogfight,” Coleman said, “and you don’t take kittens into a dogfight, that’s for sure.” Asked whether some players were not bursting to get fit, he replied: “Could one or two be doing a bit more to be with us? Yes. My conscience is clear – I’m ready for what’s in front of me. I won’t always come out on top but I never duck it.” He then added: “We’re stretched.” It is a comment that could refer to the entire club and also to a midfield and defence shredded 10 minutes in by Traoré’s Roadrunner pace. The sprinting winger is deemed erratic by some but he can be devastating at this level. Stationed on the right, Traoré proved as much with his first foray into the match, a zoom of acceleration from inside his own half that took him past four Sunderland players. Suddenly 30 yards out, the 21 year-old released Gestede, whose slight touch from 18 yards steered the ball past the onrushing Sunderland keeper, Jason Steele. Coleman’s young men, as he said, did not fold – “There’s a bit of spirit in the boys” – and on 24 minutes a neat passing movement ended with Bryan Oviedo in the Boro area crossing dangerously. Ben Gibson was back to clear. Any sense of a real contest evaporated three minutes before half-time when Stewart Downing’s corner, whipped in with his left foot from Boro’s right, was fisted by Steele into a melee of players. It ran via a ricochet or two to Braithwaite, who showed calm to slide in a shot from 10 yards. Three minutes after half-time, Sunderland’s lone, lonesome striker, the 19-year-old Josh Maja, directed a near-post header on to the bar and 20 minutes from time Tyias Browning’s close-range header from an Oviedo corner was somehow pushed away by Darren Randolph. It was a spectacular save, but Middlesbrough were going through the motions. They knew they were going through to the fourth round. “We were excellent in the first half,” Pulis said. “In the second, we got a bit sloppy. But that’s four wins in five, the lads have got a bit of confidence. I’ve got great respect for the FA Cup, that’s why I put out a strong team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/06/emily-thornberry-defends-corbyns-silence-on-iran-unrest-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T16:13:23Z","webTitle":"More than 90 Iranian university students 'detained' by regime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/06/emily-thornberry-defends-corbyns-silence-on-iran-unrest-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/06/emily-thornberry-defends-corbyns-silence-on-iran-unrest-labour","fields":{"headline":"More than 90 Iranian university students 'detained' by regime","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ninety university students are among the more than 1,000 people arrested in Iran’s unrest, an Iranian MP has said. Mahmoud Sadeghi, who represents an electoral district in Tehran, was quoted by the Iranian labour news agency as saying: “It seems that the total number of detainees is around 90. Ten students from universities in Tehran and some other cities are in an uncertain position and … it is still unknown which body has detained them.” It comes as Emily Thornberry defended Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over his silence on the civil unrest in Iran, saying the party takes an approach of “extreme caution” when it comes to the politics of the Islamic republic. The shadow foreign secretary told the BBC it was impossible to determine what political forces lay behind the protests, which began on 28 December and are said to have led to at least 21 deaths – mostly of protesters but also some security guards, according to officials. Corbyn has been under increasing pressure to speak out about the protests. Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, said it was “extraordinary” that Labour had not spoken out against the Iranian regime. Thornberry told the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast: “Our approach now is one of extreme caution when it comes to Iran and a recognition that the society in Iran is an immensely complex one, and seemingly contradictory. “For example, with these current riots, sometimes they are calling to reinstate the monarchy, sometimes they’re calling out against [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei, sometimes they’re calling for Khamenei, sometimes they’re calling for the price of eggs. “It’s very difficult, in those circumstances, to actually come to a conclusion as to what political forces are behind the current disputes on the streets of Iran. “So we take a cautious approach to Iran and we don’t want to leap to judgment and say: ‘Well, we don’t like the regime in Iran, these people are against it, they must be the guys with white hats.’ “Because it doesn’t work like that. We’ve seen that in Syria, we’ve seen it in Libya, we see it time and time again.” Tehran University has set up a committee to track the fate of students arrested during the unrest, according to the university’s vice-president, Majid Sarsangi. “Our efforts at the university are aimed at cooperating with the relevant authorities to create the conditions for the return of the detained students to the university and their families in the shortest possible time,” Sarsangi told the Iranian student news agency. According to Reuters, Iran has several parallel security bodies and arrests are often not immediately announced. Videos that have appeared on social media in recent days showed relatives of detainees gathering outside prisons in search of their loved ones. Iran’s state TV on Saturday showed government supporters rallying in several cities. The demonstrations were described as a “response to rioters and supporters of the riots”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/07/closure-nhs-walk-in-centres-nhs-winter-crisis-hospitals-services-medical","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T00:55:08Z","webTitle":"Mass closure of NHS walk-in centres is fuelling winter crisis, claim campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/07/closure-nhs-walk-in-centres-nhs-winter-crisis-hospitals-services-medical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/07/closure-nhs-walk-in-centres-nhs-winter-crisis-hospitals-services-medical","fields":{"headline":"Mass closure of NHS walk-in centres is fuelling winter crisis, claim campaigners","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Dozens of NHS walk-in centres have shut since 2010, depriving patients of easy access to medical help for minor ailments without having to wait days for an appointment, and adding to the pressure on A&amp;E units. A total of 95 walk-in centres – 40% of the overall original number – have closed since the Conservatives came to power, or are due to shut soon, says the campaigning organisation 38 Degrees. Critics claim the loss of the centres has piled even greater pressure on hospitals, many of which are suffering in the face of the NHS winter crisis. At the end of last week Lister hospital in Stevenage joined the Royal Bournemouth hospital in Dorset and a number of others in asking anyone without a “life- or limb-threatening” emergency to stay away. “The closure of walk-in centres on such a dramatic scale is depressingly shortsighted. This has been happening under the radar, but will doubtless be driving some of the pressure that is pushing A&amp;E units to breaking point,” said Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who served as a coalition health minister. “The rhetoric from the government is always about how we can reduce the need for admission to hospital and A&amp;E, and yet the reality is endless closures of the very services that help to avoid these admissions. It comes down to crisis management to keep within budget at a local level – but the chaos in hospitals this winter shows that the consequences are disastrous.” Yeovil health centre, which opened in 2009, closed in September. The Somerset NHS clinical commissioning group said it was because too many people were misusing the facility, situated in the town centre, because it was “convenient” for them. Last week 38 Degrees highlighted how Yeovil district hospital became one of at least 21 NHS acute trusts in England forced to declare a “black alert” because of winter pressures – an admission that not all patients needing care can be looked after and that patient safety may therefore be at risk. Somerset CCG defended its decision in the summer to shut the centre. It had found “a large number of people were there for the convenience of location, with relatively minor ailments that could be solved by a pharmacist or by ringing 111”. The centre has been replaced by an urgent care service, based at Yeovil district hospital, but it is only open from 10am to 6pm on Saturdays and Sundays and is not a walk-in service. Similarly, Worcester walk-in health centre closed in 2014 despite the then Labour shadow health secretary Andy Burnham pleading with NHS England to retain “a valued and important local service” and warnings that it would lead to more people seeking help at the town’s Worcestershire Royal hospital. That hospital has been one of those worst affected in recent weeks and has been forced to divert patients to the A&amp;E at the Alexandra hospital in nearby Redditch because it could not treat arrivals quickly enough. The walk-in centre has been replaced by a GP surgery, but patients need an appointment – they cannot just turn up and be seen. Walk-in centres were one of the last Labour government’s flagship NHS policies. About 230 of them opened in England in the 2000s when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were in Downing Street. Designed to provide an alternative to A&amp;E and GP services, they were popular with patients, but critics said from the start that they were not cost-effective. In 2014, the health regulator Monitor found that 51 had closed since 2010. Research by 38 Degrees has found that another 44 of the remaining 185 have since shut. Some have been replaced by urgent treatment centres or other forms of easy access to NHS urgent care centres. Holly Maltby, a campaigner at 38 Degrees, blamed the closures on government underfunding of the NHS. “Each time an NHS service is cut through lack of funding, it piles pressure on remaining services.” Lamb added that the closures “fly in the face of Jeremy Hunt’s grand promises of better access to out-of-hours services and the so-called ‘seven-day NHS’. Unless the government changes course and invests properly in the health service, we will see more service closures and more patients needlessly ending up in overcrowded A&amp;E rooms.” The Department of Health declined to comment. An NHS England spokeswoman said: “There are almost one and a half million more patient visits to walk-in centres, minor injury units and urgent care centres compared with five years ago, so obviously that means nationally these services have been growing fast, rather than the opposite.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/jan/06/norwich-city-v-chelsea-fa-cup-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T19:24:51Z","webTitle":"Norwich City 0-0 Chelsea: FA Cup - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/jan/06/norwich-city-v-chelsea-fa-cup-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/jan/06/norwich-city-v-chelsea-fa-cup-live","fields":{"headline":"Norwich City 0-0 Chelsea: FA Cup - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"And that’s that. Norwich were decent, Chelsea under par. A draw seems a fair result. And it’s back to Stamford Bridge they go! 90 min +2: Norwich are under the cosh as they attempt to hold on for a replay. Sterling wheechs down the right and earns a corner. The set piece drops to Zappacosta, to the left of the D. He chests down and tries to Le Tissier a volley into the bottom right. It’s a lovely effort, inches wide of the right-hand post. 90 min +1: Musonda has a whack from 25 yards out on the left. It’s well wide of goal. “£142 million seems a lot for one football player,” argues Simon McMahon. “You could buy the entire Dundee United team for that money, and still have £141 million left over for sweets.” 90 min: Zappacosta takes a looping punt from distance. Gunn gathers. Sterling comes on for Pedro. Drinkwater curls a high cross into the Norwich box from the left towards Morata, who is flagged offside. There will be three added minutes. 88 min: Wildschut comes on for Pritchard. 87 min: Rudiger, moving to gather a ball that had gone out for a goal kick, goes nose to nose with a punter in the front row who had thrown it elsewhere. The punter smiles for the camera as Rudiger thinks better of lingering and continuing the discussion. 85 min: Olivera’s first act is to skedaddle down the right. He nearly gets the better of Pedro, but not quite. Pedro goes racing off upfield, and is tugged by Tettey, who is booked for his cynicism. 83 min: Murphy is replaced by the not-fully-fit Olivera. 82 min: Drinkwater eases his way towards the Norwich box and looks for the top right from distance. Gunn claims easily. 80 min: Maddison buys a cheap free kick from Bakayoko, running into him down the Norwich left. Pritchard scampers after the set piece, sent flying down the inside-left channel, but Caballero has it covered. 78 min: Musonda comes on for Kenedy. 77 min: Luiz whips a wonderful effort towards the top left. It’s inches over the bar. Gunn would have probably tipped that over with a strong hand, but what a free kick from a frankly silly angle. Luiz is one of the most entertaining players in the world, whatever he gets up to. 76 min: Bakayoko drives gracefully down the inside-left channel and is brought crashing to the floor by Hanley, who is booked and doesn’t bother arguing. A free kick 25 yards out, but well to the left. Luiz seems to fancy it, though. 74 min: Batshuayi, who has been very quiet, is replaced by Morata. 73 min: The corner is no good. 72 min: Chelsea hog the ball, slowly moving their way upfield with some crisp, pretty triangles. Eventually Willian earns a corner. 70 min: The corner is no good. 69 min: Kenedy faffs around over a throw-in, is closed down by Pritchard, and hacks his opponent to the ground. Free kick, which is whipped into the box, and ... can you shank a punch? Well, if you can, Caballero’s just managed it. He flies out of his goal and, in an attempt to punch the ball out to the left, sends it to the right, and to the feet of Murphy, whose first-time shot through a crowded box is going wide right but is deflected off Luiz for a corner. 66 min: A long period of Chelsea possession ends when Pedro glides in from the left and unleashes a bobbler which is gathered easily by Gunn. The champions are on top, but the Norwich keeper has yet to be seriously worked. 64 min: Space for Pritchard in the Chelsea box, Norwich having finally turned up for the second half. He turns on a sixpence and gets a shot away, looking for the top right. But it’s deflected over for a corner, which leads to nothing. Still, that’s better from the hosts, and much more like their first-half stylings. 62 min: Some rat-a-tat pinball in the middle of the park. Suddenly the ball breaks to Pritchard, who threatens to break quickly. With no Caballero to calmly deal with the situation (!) Cahill is forced to bring his man down. He takes a booking for the team. 59 min: Free kick for Chelsea out on the right as Lewis clips the ankle of Zappacosta. He’s lucky to escape a booking. Chelsea lump the ball into the box. It’s cleared way upfield, forcing Caballero, who had been wandering a long way from his area, to win a header in the centre circle in order to stop a quick break. Entertaining, if not ideal. 58 min: Willian has the ball glued to the toe of his boot, Charles Charlie Charles style. He sashays down the inside-right channel, past Trybull and Klose, and enters the area with zig-zagging ease. His low fizzer towards the bottom corner isn’t so good, gobbled up easily by Gunn. Shame, that was a mesmeric run. 56 min: Willian drops a shoulder, George Besting his way left to right across the face of the Norwich area. Eventually he lashes a low shot towards the bottom right. Gunn turns the ball round the post. From the corner, Pedro has a look at the top left from distance. Not quite. But Chelsea are totally on top now. Antonio Conte’s hairdryer must have been turned on full blast. 55 min: Kenedy rambles down the left and lays off for Bakayoko, who attempts to send a heatseeker into the top right. Ambitious. It would have been spectacular. 53 min: Willian romps down the inside-right channel before pulling one back for Drinkwater, just on the edge of the area to the right of the D. Drinkwater isn’t far off threading a fine first-time shot through a crowded area and into the bottom left. Not quite; just wide. Norwich are being made to work a lot harder in this second half. 50 min: Chelsea have come out with renewed purpose. Batshuayi works a little bit of space 25 yards from goal and sends a pea-roller straight into the arms of Gunn. Speaking of renewed purpose, and regarding that £142m half-time breaking news, here’s Grant Tennille, with an email headed Hoochie Coutchie Man: “Barcelona finally nabbed theirs, but it’s worth noting that a shift from Fab Four to trio doesn’t necessarily mean sacrificing power, thrust, and creativity.” Isn’t it a bit early for the bong? 48 min: He gets a cross away now, though! A deep one from the same left flank, Zappacosta heading back across goal from the right. Willian is waiting to sweep home, six yards out, but Zimmermann hacks clear just in time. Fine football all round. 47 min: Some sterile possession for Chelsea in the early stages of the second half. Pedro makes off down the left but can’t get a cross away. And we’re off! Chelsea get the ball rolling, having been made to wait in the cold by tardy Norwich. No changes. Half-time breaking news: Maddison circumvents Drinkwater with ease on the edge of the Chelsea box, but then lashes wildly over the bar while looking for the top-left corner. Kenedy tries to skin Pinto down the left, but is ushered out of play. And that’s that. Daniel Farke will be pretty happy with that. Antonio Conte, not so much. 45 min: Luiz tries to get something going for Chelsea in attack, striding forward down the centre of the park and lifting a long pass forward for Kenedy. But that’s easy pickings for Gunn. 43 min: Pritchard flicks and turns past Cahill on the right-hand edge of the Chelsea box. He fires across for Lewis at the far stick, but Zappacosta has read the danger and steps in to concede a corner before his opponent can sidefoot home. The corner comes to nothing. 41 min: Luiz is booked for a late clip on Maddison, who was in the process of nicking a loose ball past him. To be fair to the Chelsea man, there was no malice and he holds his hands up in acknowledgement of his mistimed challenge. 40 min: Norwich stroke it around nicely, without really going anywhere. The high point: Maddison executing a lovely spin and turn to wriggle out of trouble in the middle of the park. He’s awarded a warm round of applause for that one. 37 min: You can’t quite say Norwich have had their chances. But they’ve had their half-chances. They’ll hope to make another, and take it, before the break, and before Antonio Conte can deliver the bollocking his players are almost certainly going to get. 35 min: Maddison pings a lovely reverse pass down the inside-left channel to release Murphy. Rudiger just about does enough to deal with the situation, sticking with Murphy and pushing him wide left, though the Norwich man is still able to get a shot away. He drags it harmlessly across the front of goal. 34 min: More space for Pedro down the left. He loops long, and Klose is forced to head out for a corner with several Chelsea men buzzing around. Once again, though, the resulting set piece is a waste of time. 32 min: Chelsea have been a bit sleepy for the last few minutes, but it looks as though they’ve woken up a bit. Willian tries to make space to shoot, just inside the Norwich area on the left, but faces three men and is forced to lay off for Kenedy, who squirts a low shot through a crowded box. The ball deflects out for a corner. Kenedy takes it himself, and sends it straight out of play on the left. On the touchline, Antonio Conte threatens to bubble over into Fume Mode. 30 min: A bit of space for Pedro down the left. He lifts one into the area, looking for Batshuayi, but the striker doesn’t show and the ball is aimless, drifting into Gunn’s arms. 28 min: Murphy bombs down the left, spots Caballero off his line, and attempts a spectacular curler into the top right from the edge of the area. It’s wild and high. Norwich are enjoying themselves right now, playing some very entertaining, attacking football. 26 min: Murphy dribbles past Rudiger and into the Chelsea box on the left. He tries to thread a pass through a thicket of black shirts to Pritchard; the ball’s never getting through that forest of legs. Chelsea clear their lines. But Norwich have responded well to that brief period of Chelsea midfield control, and are right back in this game. 24 min: Pritchard, his dander up, comes skittering in from the right wing. He’s got chance to shoot, but opts to look for an even better one, so when he finally gets an effort away, it’s closed down by Cahill. 23 min: Chelsea ping it around the back in the Pep style. Eventually Caballero gives the ball to Luiz on the edge of the box. It’s not a great ball. Also Luiz is dozing. Pritchard, suddenly snapping around Luiz’s ankles, gets a toe on the ball and sends it wide right of the goal. Had that pinged away on target, we’d have an opening goal to report, because Caballero wouldn’t have been able to stop it. 21 min: Willian is once again illegally impeded, hauled back by Klose’s arm on his shoulder. Again the referee makes do with a stern chat. A fair chance that the next foul on a marauding Chelsea player may result in a booking. 20 min: Norwich play some nice pretty triangles down the left, but go nowhere. Progressive tendencies on display. 18 min: Trybull ensures he falls into the back of Willian as the Chelsea winger zips past him. That could have been a booking, but the referee is lenient. 17 min: A good time, then, for Norwich to remind everyone that they’re the home side. Murphy makes good down the left and reaches the Chelsea area. He’s got men in the middle but instead of crossing he looks to diddle Caballero at his near post. That’s not happening. 15 min: A slight lull as Chelsea opt to stroke it around the middle of the park in a sterile fashion. They’re in no rush. But the first sign of Chelsea establishing a smidgen of control on Championship opposition. 13 min: Pinto looks to be just fine now: he whistles a wonderful crossfield pass, right to left, to release Pritchard into space on the wing. Pritchard can’t get a ball into the box, but Norwich have started this game in a positive and confident fashion, going toe to toe with the champions of England. 12 min: Luiz struts around the centre circle in the imperious style. He floats a gorgeous long quarterback’s pass down the inside-right channel, very nearly releasing Zappacosta into the Norwich area. Just a drop too much juice, and the ball flies out for a goal kick. But Zappacosta was close to gathering that and homing in on goal. 10 min: After a couple of minutes, a slightly groggy Pinto sits up and then wanders to the touchline. He winks at Kenedy - no hard feelings - and waits to be waved back on. He’ll continue. 8 min: Pinto and Kenedy go up together for a high ball. The Chelsea man clatters into the side of his opponent, shoulder meeting head. Pinto is poleaxed, laid out on the floor. On come the doctors. 6 min: Lewis embarks on a rococo ramble down the left, and nearly has the better of Rudiger. Eventually he’s swarmed by black shirts, but for a second it looked as though he might break clear into the area. That was a promising sortie. 4 min: A bit of space opens up for Maddison down the inside-right channel. For a second there’s a huge gap in the centre of the Chelsea defence, and he heads for it. But just as he cocks his leg to shoot, Luiz comes across to block. Great covering. But Maddison hesitated for a split second there, as though he couldn’t believe there was a route to goal opening up. 3 min: Kenedy strides forward from a deep position on the left and decides to have a go for goal from the best part of 35 yards. Nope! His shot is dragged harmlessly wide right. He’s got the good grace to look sheepish. Over-ambitious. 2 min: A reasonably quiet start, both sides taking turns to get a feel of the ball, stroking it hither and yon. And we’re off! The hosts get the ball rolling. Chelsea haven’t lost in the third round since Manchester United did for them in 1998. Their fans accordingly are in good voice. The teams are out! Norwich City in their gloriously traditional yellow and green, Chelsea in a very fetching third-choice black with sky-blue trim. A marvellous atmosphere at Carrow Road, a stadium that always looks stunning under floodlights. We’ll be off in a minute! Antonio Conte speaks! “Every trophy is important for us. We try to do our best in every competition. For sure we know it won’t be easy against Norwich. We try to make rotations in every game, we have been doing this for a long time. But it is right to give good chances to everyone, and I always get a good answer from my players. It is a good chance for David Luiz, who has had a long recovery from injury. I hope he has a good performance.” Norwich manager Daniel Farke speaks! “We are looking forward to this game, especially after our decent run in the Carabao Cup. It is important to be realistic. We know that Chelsea is the big favourite. In ten games, eight times they will win the game and one time there will be the draw. But there’s always one game where you can create something special and we have a pretty relaxed situation. We have had a decent run in the league recently, so we will see what happens!” Pre-match reading: Here’s our man Paul MacInnes on why Norwich, not so long out of the Premier League, could do with a strong second half to their season. Just the one change to the Norwich XI named for the New Year’s Day win at Carrow Road over Millwall. The attack-minded Nelson Oliveira makes way for the more defensive Christoph Zimmermann; he’s not fit to start but may feature. Nine changes to the Chelsea team from the side sent out at Arsenal midweek. The big news is the return of David Luiz from injury. Also note Alvaro Morata, on the bench with the kids. Punishment for missing three one-on-ones at the Emirates? Of course not. But maybe. Norwich City: Gunn, Ivo Pinto, Hanley, Klose, Lewis, Tettey, Trybull, Pritchard, Maddison, Zimmermann, Murphy. Subs: Husband, Vrancic, Oliveira, Watkins, Hoolahan, Wildschut, McGovern. Chelsea: Caballero, Luiz, Cahill, Rudiger, Zappacosta, Drinkwater, Bakayoko, Kenedy, Willian, Batshuayi, Pedro. Subs: Morata, Musonda, Clarke-Salter, Eduardo, Ampadu, Sterling, Hudson-Odoi. Referee: Stuart Attwell (Warwickshire). Norwich City have never won the FA Cup. They’ve never even got to the final. Just the three semi-final appearances in 1959, 1989 and 1992. Chelsea by comparison have lifted the famous old pot seven times. Norwich are a mid-table Championship side; Chelsea are the reigning champions of England. Norwich have lost seven of their last 13 games; Chelsea just the one. Norwich have lost all four of their previous FA Cup rubbers with Chelsea; Chelsea are unbeaten in 13 games against Norwich. But this is the third round of the FA Cup, where dreams can come true and the impossible is occasionally achieved. It, we must therefore conclude, is on. Kick off at Carrow Road is at 5.30pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/06/jimmy-anderson-working-harder-than-ever-ashes-worry-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T15:03:00Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Anderson working harder than ever and that should worry England | Ali Martin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/06/jimmy-anderson-working-harder-than-ever-ashes-worry-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/06/jimmy-anderson-working-harder-than-ever-ashes-worry-england","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Anderson working harder than ever and that should worry England","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The fifth ball after tea on the third day in sizzling Sydney was in itself nothing remarkable. Jimmy Anderson wound up as he had done 29,544 times before in Test cricket, fired the ropey old Kookaburra down to Shaun Marsh from around the wicket, looked up from his familiar head-dipping action to see it thud into the middle of the left-hander’s crisp defensive shot. Statistically, however, it marked new ground for Anderson. Never before has he sent down so many deliveries in a Test series. The current Ashes campaign has surpassed his efforts in 2010-11 for the heaviest workload of his career – 213.2 overs when Marsh offered his riposte – at a time when he is into his 36th year and has recently become the most-capped seamer. While he has been the thriftiest bowler on either side– his skills are so honed now there is minimal dross, with an economy of 2.12 runs per over testament to this fact – it has been a hard slog for his 17 wickets at 27 runs apiece. Though Anderson did not have his most penetrative day in an England shirt given the soaring temperatures and an unresponsive pitch, he remains a quality asset that Joe Root hopes will be at his disposal for a little while yet. Anderson remains supremely fit and there is at least one last mountain he will likely climb. When he shook hands with Glenn McGrath at the start of Sydney’s pink day – the excellent breast cancer charity event in memory of the former Australian fast-bowler’s first wife, Jane – there may even have been a word exchanged about title of the all-time leading Test seamer. Anderson, as it stands, sits 40 short of McGrath’s 563 victims. Whether he pushes towards and past this landmark, England are in Anderson bonus time right now. A recent switch of agent to the more showbiz-inclined M&amp;C Saatchi suggests thoughts are moving beyond cricket and there are question marks over the longevity of Stuart Broad too. Though four years younger, the latter has struggled for impact bar a flickering of the flame in Melbourne. He will bemoan the surfaces but this is the game away from home. Chris Silverwood, the new England fast bowling coach who starts his job this month, has an unenviable task given the apparent lack of established resources that will be at his disposal when these two greats eventually make way. The levels of experience will fall off a cliff, something that Tom Curran, for all his worthy efforts here, is demonstrating right now. Silverwood’s job is not so much to nurture seam bowlers from the soil either, but rather finesse the best produced. It is here where there must also be concerns, given the direction of travel for English cricket. The England and Wales Cricket Board talk a good game about finding pace bowlers for future red-ball campaigns but it is in their actions that they should be judged. First-class domestic cricket is, in effect, a spring/autumn sport. With a new Twenty20 tournament being plopped into the height of it in two years’ time just days after the existing T20 Blast, will the next generation be drawn to the prospect of sending down 200-plus overs in a Test series when there is a lighter and less scrutinised workload on offer? After all, two short-form competitions will mean up to 28 Twenty20s games for those good enough to play in both. Sure, Test central contracts are lucrative and will no doubt bulge when the new broadcast riches are divvied up. But it is the process of getting to that level that will become the less appealing career path, not least for the physically demanding discipline of fast bowling. England have spent four years masking the retirement of Graeme Swann through Moeen Ali and the battery of seamers and a new hope could be finally emerging in the spin department through the raw yet promising Mason Crane. But when the big two finally draw stumps – and chastening days like this will only hasten this – it is hard not to worry about what will follow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/jan/08/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T15:00:13Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/08/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/jan/08/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. The festive season is almost out of the way. But not quite. Benner notes: Currently reading Beyond Black, Hilary Mantel. I chose it as my first book of the year purely because of the opening sentence: ‘Travelling: the dank, oily days after Christmas.’ Lovely. But that’s not to say there isn’t still seasonal fun to be had: the Christmas diary entries of Samuel Pepys have been amusing clivejw. The 1667 entries couldn’t be more Pepsyian if they tried. After walking about in various parts of London on Christmas Eve, and a visit to the Swan Inn in New Palace Yard, during which he manages to “bezar” the barmaid, he visits midnight mass at the Queen’s Chapel... He complains of the crowd and says he was afraid of his pocket being picked. However, he soon overcomes this nervousness by his usual diversion: But here I did make myself do la cosa by mere imagination, mirando a la jolie mosa and with my eyes open, which I never did before -- and God forgive me for it, it being in the Chapel. He enjoys the music of the chapel, but reflects negatively on the ‘frivolous’ service and, simultaneously, the inattention of the ‘papists’ to it, as they count their beads with one hand and “point and play and talk and make signs with the other” (is this less pious than ejaculating after an erotic fantasy?) And then proceeds shortly to note how “prettily” the King’s mistress, Lady Castlemaigne, looks in her nightclothes! Elsewhere, Vieuxtemps decided to end the year with Faulkner’s The Sound And The Fury: And it gets better and stranger with each pass. Score a 10 out of 10 on the Southern Weirdo Scale. Recommended for those that like Southern Weirdo Lit. Talking of weirdness, JamesLibTech has started on Jesse Ball’s upcoming novel Census: It’s very unconventional and weird. I’m about a third of the way in and I have only the slightest of ideas as to what’s going on and where the story is going, but he’s a spectacular writer so I’m looking forward to getting through it. William Gibson’s Neuromancer also seems unusual to resextensa: I won’t lie, I’m finding it quite disorienting. No doubt that’s part of the point, but while I certainly don’t need to be spoonfed there are moments that drift into such obscurity that it borders on outright incoherence. That aside, it’s vivid and intriguing and I have no plans to put it down, but I know for sure I’ll need to read it two or three more times to absorb it properly. Back with realism, Tom Mooney has found The Power Of The Dog by Thomas Savage admirably “dark”: Tells the story of two brothers who run a large Montana cattle ranch in the 1920s. They live alone, apart from the help, for years, running things as they always have. Then one brother marries a local widow and brings her onto the ranch with her ‘sissy’ son, throwing the brothers’ relationship into an unspoken disarray. The subtlety of the book took me quite by surprise as it shuns action and plot in favour of realism and introspection, as the end of the old west clashes with the advent of 20th century life. I didn’t quite love the book, but more admired it as a quiet, meticulous and highly literary work of art that will live long in the memory. Finally, one last word on Christmas from PortlandRace: I began last week reading the first section (‘Winter’) of Laurie Lee’s Village Christmas And Other Notes on the English Year. Growing up in a small Dorset village (before leaving for London), I relate so much to Lee’s depiction of rural life (and of Christmas) and his writing moves me in a way I find rare in an author – to me it is quite beautiful. ‘Spring’ will follow in a month or two … That sounds like a good promise to me. Interesting links about books and reading “Much ado about not much”: The New York Times weighs in on Lily Cole and the Brontë society. “He found Americans malodorous, ill-mannered and invading his privacy.” Sounds like Charles Dickens didn’t always enjoy being on the other side of the Atlantic. Two journalists have retraced John Steinbeck’s Russian Journey. Willa Cather’s letters are soon to be made available online. Bette Midler has been doing some serious reading.

We can all see and feel it. It’s unhelpful to hear remarks about the NHS being broken when we are all working so hard to ensure that it doesn’t pack up, but it leaves me and my colleagues questioning why we are in this situation. Chronic underfunding? Poor planning? Is there worse to come? Will we be able to turn up to work and feel like we are delivering the care we would want for our own loved ones? We see stories about it being the busiest period for the NHS in history. Partly this is down to more severe flu than we’ve had previously. More people are sick, and sick people are sicker. Some patients with flu are so sick they need to be in intensive care. This is having a knock-on effect. Yesterday, there was only one ITU bed available across the whole of London. Where do we put all the sick people that need treatment? And how do we move them around the system? We talk about flow in hospitals, but things feel blocked – with no obvious plumber to come help fix it. But that’s the technical stuff. More importantly, when it happens to be you, delivering care to a patient in a way that you didn’t train for, and know isn’t ideal, the personal impact of that compromise is huge. We may have to put men and women together on wards in our hospital; or put patients that we know would be better cared for on medical wards, into beds designated for surgical patients. A poor patient experience is also a poor staff experience. It’s difficult to get an adequate number of people in to work, let alone manage unprecedented demand. Many of my colleagues are working longer and harder than they ever have. The discretionary effort being put into this cannot be an indefinite thing. People rally when they see a need. When it’s business as usual it melts away. How long can we go on like this? However, I like to think that I’m a balanced person and strive to see positives where I can. With some of the teams I work with, engagement hasn’t been higher. There’s a feeling of being all in it together – the visibility, appreciation, recognition and thanks for the hard work from our executives, senior leaders and politicians. The derision and blame heaped upon managers for the failing state of the NHS has fallen somewhat silent. The bullying behaviour in different parts of the system feels less prominent. We are concentrating on delivering the clinical care instead of being distracted by other things, such as the urgent data request coming in at 4pm on Friday evening, or the organisation’s financial position, or the next CQC inspection. These things are important but can overshadow what we are here to do. If you could take a temperature check on compassion, gratitude and forgiveness, I’d bet it would be higher than at recent times. Perhaps we can take these as our key lesson when we make it out of dark winter.

But a charity working in cat protection has played down the significance of the arrest. The 31-year-old man was held after five cats were found dead and mutilated in the town between August and November last year. Northamptonshire police said the suspect, who was arrested in connection with arson attacks and cat mutilations in the Duston and Kingsley Park areas, had been released under investigation. The force confirmed it was working closely with the Metropolitan police inquiry into a number of animal deaths, known as Operation Takahe. But it said that although the offences were similar to attacks in the London area, officers were not sure that they had been carried out by the same person. South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty (Snarl), which has been cataloguing the deaths and helping police with the investigation, has said it does not believe that the person arrested was behind the killings and warned pet owners that their animals were still not safe. The group believes up to 400 cats and other small animals may have been slaughtered across the country by at least one culprit, who has also been labelled the M25 cat killer and the UK animal killer. In a statement on its Facebook page, Snarl said: “The person or persons known as the UK animal killer remains active and we continue to attend incidents, the latest one yesterday.” Over the festive period there was a string of reported attacks in south London, north London, Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, and Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Snarl’s co-founder, Boudicca Rising, said that she believed the most recent spate of attacks could hold the key to catching the killer. “What is really clear from the timeline over Christmas is that he was in south London and then started travelling again,” she said. “We have always thought he is a south London resident. He seemed at ease with getting around and the killings seemed more confident.” The attacker was first labelled the Croydon cat killer because it is believed the killings started in the south London area in about October 2015. But small animals, including rabbits and foxes, have since been found dead and mutilated across the country. In an interview with the Observer in 2016, Rising said she believed the killings were the work of the same person. “They are mostly bodies with the heads, or heads and tails, removed.” The same year the RSPCA also investigated some of the cat killings believed to have been the work of the Croydon cat killer. It said an examination of the bodies by its vets suggested that the cats’ heads and tails appeared to have been removed by a human. The Met has been working with the RSPCA and Snarl, while a £10,000 reward has been offered to anyone who provides information that could lead to the arrest of the killer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/06/ross-barkley-seize-chance-chelsea-antonio-conte","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T20:00:02Z","webTitle":"Misunderstood Ross Barkley must seize his chance at Chelsea | Daniel Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/06/ross-barkley-seize-chance-chelsea-antonio-conte","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/06/ross-barkley-seize-chance-chelsea-antonio-conte","fields":{"headline":"Misunderstood Ross Barkley must seize his chance at Chelsea","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There was a time, going back a few years, when Everton envisaged Ross Barkley being a different kind of player to the one we see now. Ask David Moyes and he will tell you that at 15 Barkley was the closest he had ever seen to a young Norman Whiteside. Barkley could get up and down the pitch, he had the same kind of rare quality that saw Whiteside bend the ball past Neville Southall in the 1985 FA Cup final and, more than anything, he was utterly fearless in the tackle. Moyes and the youth-team coaches would flinch when they saw him hurtling into a 50-50 challenge. That changed, at 16, when Barkley broke his leg in two places after going into a tackle during an England Under‑19s game against Belgium. When Barkley came back from that double fracture his coaches noticed how he no longer launched himself at the ball quite so vigorously. Barkley started to play with more restraint, relying on the skills that brought other comparisons, not least to Paul Gascoigne. He took his time but when he announced himself as a first-team pick, amid gushing eulogies from Roberto Martínez and the sense the entire team could be shaped around him, it was perfectly reasonable for Evertonians to think that maybe this time, just for once, one of their emerging heroes might actually stick around. Instead, the next time we will see him in blue will be for Chelsea and it is difficult not to think that Everton have come off distinctly second-best in a deal that gives Barkley the chance, in a World Cup year, to restate his England ambitions and leaves the distinct impression that the Merseyside club, however it is dressed up, have been played like a fiddle. Chelsea have certainly worked the system, bearing in mind the transfer fee was set at £35m in August until Barkley ruptured his hamstring and the Premier League champions obligingly stepped to one side. Everton have continued to pay the player £60,000 a week, as well as forking out for his medical bills and overseeing his rehabilitation programme, until now he is fit again, the transfer window has reopened and Roman Abramovich’s staff have swooped back in to resurrect the deal, just for £20m less, with Barkley moving within six months of his contract expiring. In the meantime, Davy Klaassen and Gylfi Sigurdsson have arrived at Everton for a combined £79m and Wayne Rooney has signed on record wages, all with the mandate of filling the void left by Barkley’s impending departure. None, however, has consistently played with the wit or creativity that Barkley, at his best, could offer and it feels a bit of a stretch to imagine that Kieran Dowell, on loan at Nottingham Forest, is going to save Farhad Moshiri from spending even more. Chelsea have got their man for £15m, the kind of fee a 15‑goal‑a‑season Championship striker goes for nowadays, while Everton would be kidding themselves if they think they have done well out of this deal. That, however, is the way the business goes sometimes and it is tempting to think Liverpool’s mayor, Joe Anderson, should be busy enough without announcing via Twitter on Friday that he is going to ask the Premier League and the Football Association to investigate the way Everton have been “ripped off”. Anderson, an Everton supporter, maybe needs to read up about the Bosman rule and the way players’ transfer values depreciate in the last year of their contracts. He won’t be alone in thinking Everton have been done up like a kipper but, if there was anything sinister enough to warrant a top‑level investigation, shouldn’t it be the club issuing the complaint? The fact Everton agreed the transfer and have absolutely zero plans to take it up with the authorities suggests Anderson didn’t get voted in because of his football knowledge. This is an unsatisfactory story, though, from Everton’s perspective because there is always something profoundly sad when a local player breaks through with the club he has embraced all his life only for it to end badly, and in Barkley’s case, without him offering even a flicker of an explanation. Perhaps he doesn’t feel it is necessary when Chelsea can offer better wages and all the fun of the Champions League. Yet a few honest words might have been appreciated when Everton’s supporters, on the whole, thought of him as one of their own. Sure, there were a few grumbles during his periods of lost form. But the game against Burnley towards the end of last season was an accurate barometer. A few days earlier, CCTV pictures had leaked of Barkley being thumped in a Liverpool bar. Barkley’s name was belted out by the Goodison crowd. He played well, clutched his badge in front of the Gwladys Street end and there was a standing ovation when he was substituted late on. It is not true Everton fans had unequivocally turned against him. Might he now re-establish himself as an England player? Barkley was part of Roy Hodgson’s squad in Euro 2016 but came home without playing a single minute. Sam Allardyce excluded him for his one match in charge of the national team and on the solitary occasion Gareth Southgate called him up, for the double-header against Germany and Lithuania last March, Barkley was one of only two players not to kick a ball. Barkley has not played for his country since May 2016 and has made only three 90-minute appearances in 22 caps, 14 of which have come as a substitute, since making his debut at the age of 19. In his last seven call-ups he has been an unused substitute and if he is not careful that is threatening to be the story of his international career – a nearly man, a player who stayed too young too long, never quite fulfilling his potential or showing he can dominate, rather than decorate, matches. Yet Southgate has shown already that he is willing to change his mind about a player and it is still possible Barkley can find a way back, before Russia, if he has not been held back too much by that hamstring tear (anyone doubting the seriousness of that injury, incidentally, should check out the nine-inch scar that runs down the back of his leg) and if Antonio Conte, his new manager at Chelsea, can make him start believing again that he is capable of holding his own at the highest level. Barkley is a confidence player. The problem is that confidence started to ebb away when Ronald Koeman took over at Everton and misread the situation by assuming Barkley was the type of character who would respond better to public criticism than Martínez’s arm-round-the-shoulder indulgence. Barkley, in fact, was a Toffee with a soft centre, sensitive enough to Koeman’s words that at one point he asked his manager why he talked about him so much in press conferences. It hurt him that his manager would go to the media and it hardened his resolve to cut himself free, even if what Koeman said was fundamentally correct. Another insight into Barkley’s personality goes back to Everton’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United in April 2016, in the final few weeks of the Martínez era, when the players came in at half-time, losing 1-0. There were boos from the Everton end and Barkley had convinced himself, wrongly, they were directed towards him. It was up to the other players, led by Phil Jagielka, to let him know he was worrying unduly. For such a gifted player, Barkley has still to show, aged 24, that he has the maturity to make that next step from being a good, sometimes very good, player to being an outstanding one. The bottom line, however, is that people talk about him, and write about him, because he belongs to the small band of players with the potential to do it. What Barkley has to avoid is for people to still be discussing all that rich potential when he is in his late 20s. But the facts, statistically, are that no other player at Everton has set up more goals, created more scoring chances or had more successful dribbles in the previous three seasons. Those kind of players do not come through the system very often and that, I suspect, is what really grates Liverpool’s mayor rather than the fact that Chelsea, for once, have paid below the odds. Nice-guy Mata looks a bit lonely Juan Mata is plainly a thoroughly decent chap – the kind of guy, to put it one way, who would have been pleading for a group hug when the fists and bottles were flying in the Old Trafford tunnel after the Manchester derby – and it is no surprise that his Common Goal initiative is gathering support from the football world. The numbers are steadily increasing, with 35 other players now signed up, and the aim is to reach 200 by the end of the year. Kasper Schmeichel of Leicester City, Sunderland’s Duncan Watmore, Charlie Daniels of Bournemouth and the Brighton defender Bruno are among the players based in England who have agreed to donate 1% of their wages, whereas the names from abroad include Mats Hummels, Giorgio Chiellini, Serge Gnabry and Shinji Kagawa. Looking through the list, it also becomes apparent that there is a good deal of support from the women’s game – which is noteworthy because those players are earning only a tiny fraction of the men’s salaries. Jean Sseninde, Common Goal’s first African player, is just one example, as someone who earns her main income in the British Army rather than playing for Crystal Palace. One question, though: where are all the Manchester United players? It was August when Mata launched the idea and, to date, not one of his team-mates has felt compelled to back the Spaniard’s venture. Nobody wants to be guilt-tripped into taking part but is it too much to think one of Mata’s colleagues might have signed up when the average first-team salary at Old Trafford is getting on for £6m a year? Is there really not one of José Mourinho’s players who would be willing to pledge £60,000 or so from his annual wage? And just imagine, perhaps, if Mino Raiola, with his reputed £41.4m fee for negotiating Paul Pogba’s transfer, asked if agents could enrol, too. Wishful thinking, perhaps. Atkinson’s wit dug him out of a hole Arsenal’s visit to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup on Sunday reminds me of that little piece of comedy gold from the last occasion they met as Premier League opponents, all the way back in January 1999, when Ron Atkinson, taking his first match in charge of the home team, strode out of the tunnel and, quite brilliantly, clambered into the wrong dugout. Atkinson, you might recall, had to make his apologies after getting a nudge from a member of the Arsenal entourage. Once he had found his way to the correct dugout, his first line was a beauty. “I looked around me and thought: ‘How can we be bottom of the league with these substitutes?’” Not that it got any easier. His next home game was a nine‑goal thriller against Manchester United – otherwise known as an 8-1 home defeat – and Forest have never been back since their relegation at the end of that season. Gary Brazil, their academy director, will be in temporary charge for the Arsenal tie and should know the geography of the City Ground well enough not to repeat Atkinson’s mistake. If Brazil did fancy re-enacting that moment, however, Arsène Wenger’s touchline ban has at least left a space."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/07/iran-street-protests-economy-social-media-not-near-precipice","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T00:01:07Z","webTitle":"Iran is not near a precipice, but vast changes are afoot | Masoud Golsorkhi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/iran-street-protests-economy-social-media-not-near-precipice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/iran-street-protests-economy-social-media-not-near-precipice","fields":{"headline":"Iran is not near a precipice, but vast changes are afoot","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Shortly after Christmas, conservative opponents of the reformist Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, organised a small demonstration in the city of Mashhad. The protests rapidly spiralled out of control, spreading across the country. No one should be surprised by this show of deep dissatisfaction and anger – a cocktail of poverty and unemployment mixes headily with the ability to be connected to the outside world thanks to satellite TV and social media. For numerous external critics of the Islamic republic, these protests offered a glimpse at the possibility of regime change in Iran, and were gleefully received. The leader of the free world flexed his Twitter digits and obscure opposition groups raced to record YouTube messages. On the streets in Iran, the anti-government chants of “death to high prices” escalated into anti-regime slogans such as “death to the mullahs”. While these made their way on to global news broadcasts, the more xenophobic chants of “we are Aryans, we won’t worship Arabs” got less airtime. Iranians are active social media users (20-30 million have smart phones) so not surprisingly images and video footage from the demonstrations and the associated riots filled the airways. As Ladane Nasseri, an Iranian journalist for France 24, tweeted, some of these have been very suspect. One might hesitate to emulate Michael Ignatieff and seek pearls of wisdom from questionable sources, such as Khaled bin Salman, 28, the Saudi ambassador in Washington. The muddied and bloodied waters are – at least as far as the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia are concerned – wriggling with potential geopolitical advantage. Among less partisan observers and my unscientific sample of friends and family, the dominant view is that the country is not near a precipice. Nor does anyone think that this revolt by marginalised and impoverished people mostly in provincial towns is directed from abroad – something both the opposition and the regime claim. Certainly a serious rupture within the political landscape has occurred; a line has been crossed in the history of the 39-year-old republic. In Iran political struggle is always complicated by a struggle over cultural policy which remains key to social control. The state concerns itself with such frippery as tightness of jeans and exact coverage provided by head scarves. Rouhani (a pragmatic and centrist reformist politician) inherited a basket case of an economy from his populist conservative predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: a 40% inflation rate, a freefalling currency and exploding unemployment. The Iranian economy is dominated by corruption, favouritism and a lack of transparency verging on gangsterism. To his credit, by the end of his first term, Rouhani had reduced inflation to under 10% and had made peace with the world by signing the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action, the nuclear deal. In his second term he has tried to tackle the structural problems in the economy, fixing the balance of payments and curtailing the gigantic public sector, which counts for more than 30% of the economy. On the cultural front, Rouhani had managed to reduce the incursions by the state into people’s private lives and dramatically reduce the number of executions for drugs trafficking. Rouhani has tried to reduce or remove subsidies and had plans for people to sign up for benefits rather than receive them automatically. These measures directly affect about 30 million people, including the poorest in society, while his attempt at balancing the budget with a more rigorous taxation policy made obvious enemies, especially among businesses owned and operated by religious foundations. The budget, released on 16 December, united his conservative enemies. The foundations and other business institutions, which trace their roots to the first years of the revolution, are today fiefdoms of powerful religious and military figures. They cost the state millions: they pay no taxes and there is no proper accounting. Rouhani had the audacity to publish exactly how much they cost. In 1978, the spark that led to the downfall of the Pahlavi regime didn’t seem significant either: a single article attacking the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini, then an obscure figure. However there are key differences between the political context of 1978 and our times. The shah was an old-school despot with a great deal in common with today’s Saudi royal family. He wasn’t just the leader of a one-party state – having ordered the abolition of all political parties, he acted as the chief ideologue and day-to-day ruler. He was the state, power personified. Today’s noisy and messy Iranian political scene bears no resemblance to the arctic silence that preceded the 1979 revolution. Factions representing interest groups widely characterised as reformist and conservative, in fact contain factions within factions, with a multitude of sometimes overlapping and always competing groups. The often questioned and no doubt imperfect elections are nevertheless held with regularity and are energetically contested and are representative of the polity. The Islamic republic may seem fragile and divided from the outside yet it has successfully transitioned from revolution to establishment and fought off both Saddam Hussein and resisted intense US pressure for decades. The very idea of street protest shocked the Pahlavi regime which reacted with brutality. The Islamic republic has been used to daily street demonstrations for decades. In recent times, especially after the suppression of the green movement in 2009, the state has been acquiring the latest crowd-control methods. The less reported, but perhaps more significant conflict in Iran, is one that has pitted the president against conservatives, supported at least by some elements of the Islamic revolutionary guard. Those who initiated the original anti-government demonstrations are trying to absorb much of the energy it released, riding the tiger they barely control. A media arm of the revolutionary guard posted on Thursday an impassioned crowd-sourced set of genuine grievances on Aparat, the Iranian version of YouTube, as a direct dig at the government, while the BBC reported that leading reformist cabinet members’ social media accounts were also hacked by groups associated with the guards. Whatever their wrangling, both political factions are acknowledging the grievances of the crowds even as they attack and curtail their methods. Both are trying to figure out how to leverage the demonstrations to further their cause. The reformist government’s ability to deliver on its economic plan depends on its capacity to offer more social freedom to its middle class base who hungers for it, while the conservatives’ claim to deliver their less well-off supporters freedom from hunger is not without merit. Iran is a country blessed with an embarrassment of riches: it should be able to deliver both bread and circuses. The survival of the republic depends on it.

Barry McElduff has deleted the tweet, posted on Friday, and apologised following condemnation from unionist politicians and victims’ campaigners. Ten Protestant workers were lined up and shot dead by the IRA near the village of Kingsmill in South Armagh on 5 January 1976. A Protestant clergyman who has worked with the families and sole survivor of the multiple IRA murders called on McElduff to resign his Westminster seat. Pastor Barrie Halliday, who led prayers for the Kingsmill dead at a service on Friday, said the Sinn Féin MP’s position was “untenable”. In the video, McElduff walks around a shop with the Kingsmill loaf on his head. Below, he wrote: “I’m in the Classic Service Station here, but I’m just wondering – where does McCullough’s keep the bread?” McElduff said it was never his “intention to offend anyone who has suffered previously”. The West Tyrone MP said he had “not realised or imagined for a second any possible link between the product brand name and Kingsmill anniversary”. The 10 men murdered at Kingsmill were killed by members of the IRA’s South Armagh brigade, though the organisation has never publicly admitted its role in the atrocity. It is believed to have been carried out in retaliation for a number of sectarian murders of Catholics by Ulster loyalist paramilitaries in Armagh in the same period. The workmen were taken out of their minibus and shot dead. Their Catholic colleague was spared because he told the gunmen his religion. The historical enquiries team – the police unit tasked with investigating unsolved past crimes from Northern Ireland’s Troubles – has officially laid the blame for the massacre at the IRA’s door. No one has ever been convicted over the 10 murders but an inquest into the atrocity is still running at a court in Belfast. Last year the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland announced that a man whose palm print was found on the suspected getaway vehicle would not be prosecuted. The PPS said it could not pursue the case against the man because of insufficient evidence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/06/angela-merkel-german-coalition-social-democrats-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T10:35:52Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel at bay as Social Democrats to set high coalition price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/06/angela-merkel-german-coalition-social-democrats-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/06/angela-merkel-german-coalition-social-democrats-talks","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel at bay as Social Democrats to set high coalition price","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Germany’s beleaguered chancellor returned to the negotiating table on Sunday with politicians from the Social Democratic party (SPD) and representatives of her Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), to stave off the end of “Merkelism” by re-establishing the coalition that governed Germany from 2013 to 2017. Angela Merkel’s efforts will involve tough bargaining with the centre-left, which eyes control over the country’s well-stocked state coffers as a reward for entering a new coalition – in the knowledge that failure of the talks could spell the end of the Merkel era. “I think that it can be done. We will work very swiftly and very intensively,” Merkel told journalists as she arrived at the Social Democrats’ headquarters on Sunday. “I am going into these talks with optimism. At the same time it is clear to me that we will have an enormous piece of work in front of us over the next few days but we are willing to take it on and to bring a good result.” Following the collapse of talks to form an unorthodox “Jamaica” coalition with the Free Democrats and the Green party in November, a centrist alliance would guarantee the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) her best chance of a stable government for a fourth term in office. But historically poor results for both parties at last September’s elections mean that a new “grand coalition” could barely lay claim to such a name, and sliding polls are increasing pressure on the two political tribes to retreat behind orthodox party lines. The SPD leader, Martin Schulz, who has previously ruled out forming a coalition with Merkel, has to win over a highly sceptical party membership that will get a final vote on whether to enter an alliance with the CDU, and is likely to seek protections for increased social security spending and infrastructure investment. Key figures in the SPD believe Schulz can only guarantee such promises by laying claim to the previously CDU-run finance ministry. A centre-left finance minister could relax Germany’s balanced budget rules and work to meet French president Emmanuel Macron’s goals for reforming the eurozone. The previous SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel’s decision to pick the economic and foreign ministries as trophy posts in 2013 is now widely seen within the party as a strategic mistake. But Schulz’s proposals will meet fierce resistance from the conservatives on the other side of the table, many of whom look towards the rightward-lurching government of the new Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, as a model to emulate. Facing state elections in Bavaria in the autumn this year, Merkel’s allies in the CSU in particular have ratcheted up their rhetoric. Politicians from the party have over the past week called for cuts in benefits to refugees, mandatory age tests for asylum seekers, and extending the suspension of Germany’s policy to reunite refugees with their families. In an comment article for the newspaper Die Welt, former transport minister Alexander Dobrindt called for a “conservative revolution” against a left-liberal mainstream he saw as typified by the culture of Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg district – a hotbed of dissident culture in 1980s East Germany, now itself a byword for gentrification. At Friday’s party conference in Seeon-Seebruck in southern Bavaria, the CSU leader, Horst Seehofer, risked antagonising Merkel by inviting the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, the European Union’s most vocal critic of the German chancellor’s open-borders stance during the 2015 refugee crisis. The populist leader said on Friday he believed 2018 would be “the year of restoring the will of the people in Europe”. Merkel, meanwhile, goes into negotiations from one of the weakest positions of her leadership. A survey by the public broadcaster ARD has shown that more Germans prefer fresh elections to a renewal of last term’s grand coalition. A majority (69%) of those polled said Merkel’s party had failed to address concerns caused by the refugee crisis, and her personal approval ratings have dropped since the September elections. However, 53% still say that they would approve of Merkel being the next chancellor, and as many as 93% said she remained a good chancellor. The 63-year-old has rejected a so-called “KoKo” or “cooperation coalition” option floated by the Social Democrats, which could involve the SPD and the CDU/CSU forming an alliance and agreeing on some issues while leaving trickier points to parliamentary debates. Shortly before Christmas, the tabloid Bild quoted the senior CDU politician Norbert Lammert as saying that Merkel would step down if talks with the Social Democrats collapsed and there were fresh elections – comments which the former leader of the Bundestag later denied having made. German media have tipped the Saarland state premier, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, as one of the few successor candidates who would fit Merkel’s mould of pragmatic centrist conservatism. But the CDU politician is relatively unknown even in her own country, and would need a spell in a ministerial post to build up her profile. One leading German public intellectual has predicted that the next government is unlikely to last a full four-year term, even if Merkel and Schulz manage to come to an agreement in the coming weeks. “We are in a transition phase,” said the political scientist Herfried Münkler in an interview with Die Welt. “Since we are not used to transitional phases – unlike the Italians, for example – the end of Merkelism is a special situation for us, and an exciting one.” Münkler, who is also a bestselling author of books on global history, said that any political era required a phase of renewal and revitalisation after around 25 years. “We are without doubt in the middle of such a phase,” he declared, “where the decline of a politically leading figure goes hand in hand with significant changes in the surrounding conditions.” Exploratory talks are expected to last for about a week. On 21 January, SPD delegates will decide at a special party conference whether to start proper talks, which could last until mid-February. The Social Democrats will then allow their membership a vote on whether to enter a coalition with the CDU. STICKING POINTS Immigration Wrangling over fallout from the European refugee crisis dominated last year’s failed coalition talks with the liberal Free Democratic party and Greens, and is likely to top this year’s negotiations agenda. While the two parties will easily agree to speed up deportations of rejected asylum seekers, Martin Schulz, leader of the centre-left Social Democratic party, rejected conservative proposals to extend the current ban on reuniting refugees with their families, which runs out on 16 March. Healthcare The SPD wants wholesale reform of health insurance, equalising the contributions made by employers and employees and unifying the two-tier system of private and public health insurances. Politicians from Merkel’s CDU say the plans would put private health insurers out of business. Infrastructure Germany’s two big centre parties may find it easier to find common ground on investing in the country’s healthy fiscal surplus in a marquee infrastructure project, such as a state-funded house-building programme to take steam out of the overheating rental market in cities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jan/09/have-you-given-up-on-cash","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T16:52:15Z","webTitle":"Have you given up on cash?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/09/have-you-given-up-on-cash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jan/09/have-you-given-up-on-cash","fields":{"headline":"Have you given up on cash?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Technology is making it ever easier to avoid using cash.

News reports are full of this magic internet money’s rocketing value – currently $16,000 – and Facebook is dotted with people who picked some up at $500, $50 or even 50 cents. But the cryptocurrency ship hasn’t yet sailed. In the volatile market of alternative cryptos, relatively unknown alt-coins such as ripple, litecoin and ethereum regularly shoot up by hundreds of per cent in a matter of weeks, and plummet just as fast. Bitcoin envy has brought in vast sums of new money, dollar-eyed investors taking a Las Vegas gamble on which of the more than 1,000 alt-coins might rocket next. In September the cryptocurrency market cap was $137bn. Today it’s $800bn. It’s a blockchain gold rush. In mid-December a Facebook friend well-versed in crypto tipped Cardano’s ADA, which at 21 cents was just the tip I was after. Little did I know I was riding unarmed into a lawless digital wild west, where fortunes are made and lost on a tweet and every shill, trickster, bot and conman is using all the unregulated tricks in the book to make a fast buck. And this was undoubtedly my first rodeo. For a form of currency designed to wrestle financial control away from centralised banks and governments and back into the hands of the people, there is a surprising amount of red tape involved with buying cryptocurrency online. It took me two days to pass security checks on depository Coinbase and crypto exchange Binance and scour Reddit to find out how a digital “wallet” worked. One night my wife woke me at 5am: ADA was 51 cents and rising fast. I scrambled for the laptop and bought all the ADA I could. Rookie mistake: the Fomo – “fear of missing out” – buy. The pump quickly turned to dump – a regular cycle in cryptocurrency – and ADA drifted painfully downwards. With my very first trade I was that most maligned of crypto trader noob – the top-buyer. Let loose in this cyber-cash chocolate factory, I browsed further. Avoid the vast number of scam “shitcoins” floating around and the potential is clearly enormous. If bitcoin is the Atari of internet money – a slow, first-generation technology with heavy fees – then the faster and cheaper ethereum and litecoin are its ZX Spectrums, and the crypto community is jostling to discover the third-gen PlayStation, with each new alt-coin designed for an innovative purpose. Due diligence is key: you’re looking for a respectable team with an innovative project that could eventually reach mass adoption, a strong support community and a bargain price for a coin with a small circulating supply. John McAfee, head of McAfee Antivirus and a major voice in crypto, tweeted, “it is easier for a 3 cent coin to go to 3 dollars, than it is for a $300 dollar coin to go to $30,000”, so I looked to the cheaper coins for my future fortune. Most intriguing was a five-center called verge (or XVG), tipped by McAfee as the next big privacy coin. Several years in development, verge was created by a team of volunteers led by head developer Justin Vendetta and were promising the imminent release of Wraith Protocol, a means by which users can make a transaction with verge either public or untraceable at the flick of a switch. You could pay your gas bill and run a Mexican drug cartel with the same currency. Verge was already a phenomenon. On the back of a single tweet from McAfee, the price had shot up 2,000% in a couple of days, and almost 30,000% in 2017; $400 of verge purchased in January would now be worth $17m. With McAfee claiming Verge could hit $15 in a year, it sure looked like the future. I grabbed me a hefty chunk. I wasn’t alone. All of crypto’s shadowed eyes were on verge. Its bullish community of supporters filled Twitter with entreaties to HODL – hold on for dear life – until it goes “to the moon” and everyone can buy “lambos”. Within a couple of days, as the hype about Wraith Protocol’s spread and firm promises were made that it would be released before 2018 was rung in, the price tripled. On the day bitcoin crashed to $10,000, taking most of the market with it, verge soared, hitting almost 30 cents. Graph readers were suggesting the release of Wraith would shoot the value to 70 cents or more. I found myself obsessed, constantly monitoring Twitter, waking in the night to check coin tracking apps. Pundits were hailing verge as a game-changer, the next bitcoin. Unbelievers pointed to previous missed deadlines and called it “vaporware”, a nonexistent con, the biggest scam in crypto history. In this unprecedented hype, there was clearly unprecedented money to be made. And more than one way to make it. Three things hold sway over these unregulated crypto markets: coin innovations, bitcoin whales manipulating prices with huge pump and dumps, and social media. The merest hint of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) on a coin’s Twitter or Reddit threads can tank its price quickly, and as the final days of 2017 slipped by with Wraith Protocol still unreleased, the FUDers went to town on verge. A crypto tipster named Marquis Trill tweeted his 4.6 million followers on Christmas Day to “sell XVG!”, claiming he had proof from a Reddit whistleblower that the Wraith Protocol project was falling apart. The price plummeted, only to recover again when Trill claimed his Twitter had been hacked and the allegation proved false. In the dip, a new verge wallet was opened and 2bn coins were purchased, 14% of the supply. Someone, somewhere, on the back of just two tweets, had made millions in minutes. If that wallet suddenly emptied when verge went to the moon on the release of Wraith, one commenter suggested, it would be “the heist of the century”. Then, on 27 December, McAfee posted a tweet claiming his prediction of a future $15 price for verge had come from a fake account, and that he’d only ever claimed it would reach 15 cents. Verge’s price dropped to that amount. In retaliation, on 30 December, the coin’s highest-profile Twitter supporter XVG Whale posted a series of texts claiming to be from McAfee, demanding the team give him more than $1m in ethereum or he’d tweet the coin into the ground. New Twitter accounts were opened, tweeting FUD about verge 170 times a day to drive the price down; in the dips, that monster wallet grew by 2m coins every half hour. Dark forces were at work, and all us minnows could do as the days ticked by was strap ourselves in to the Wraith Protocol rocket and hope that, come midnight on New Year’s Eve, its release would shoot us moonwards. For verge, and my fledgling portfolio, this was death or glory. At 5am on New Year’s Day, I and thousands of #Vergefam sat hunched over verge’s Twitter feed as eagerly as Beyoncé fans awaiting a surprise album drop, counting down the ball in Times Square. Five, four, three, two, one … nothing. Like thousands of others, I hit the sell button; the price dropped 3 cents in as many seconds. Then a tweet from Vendetta citing a last-minute bug steadied the price and I bought straight back in, but the short-term profit seekers had hopped off and, when Wraith Protocol arrived four hours late, a site quickly popped up claiming to have hacked the first batch of IP addresses from it. By the time this was proved to be fake news the Verge price had dwindled to 13 cents, and the momentum of cryptocurrency’s biggest moment was lost. Then a minor miracle. Once the FUD cleared and Wraith was shown to work exactly as promised, Verge’s price rallied to about 20 cents, with tipsters predicting it to hit $1 in the coming months. They might be a small band of developers with poor PR being buffeted by the malevolent winds of crypto, but verge is the game-changer, not the scam. So, yes, the bitcoin bubble might soon burst, bringing this whole, wild rollercoaster ride off the rails, but I’ll be HODLing my verge for a year or two. Meanwhile, ADA quietly hit $1.20. Perhaps I’ll be opening that lambo dealership on the moon yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/05/manchester-united-derby-county-fa-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T22:01:29Z","webTitle":"Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard and Romelu Lukaku end Derby’s resistance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/05/manchester-united-derby-county-fa-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/05/manchester-united-derby-county-fa-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard and Romelu Lukaku end Derby’s resistance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Manchester United seemed destined for an unwanted replay before Jesse Lingard again took responsibility, scoring a superb eighth goal in his past 10 appearances with six minutes remaining, which was followed by Romelu Lukaku sealing the win at the end of normal time. José Mourinho’s side had appeared unable to kill off Derby County, as towards the close Marcus Rashford crashed the ball off the right post, Lukaku’s header hit the left, and Paul Pogba missed a sitter. Yet Lingard’s swerving long-range shot showed them how to do it and so United move on content. Of Lingard, whose season tally is now 11, the manager said: “He is in a clear evolution. He’s comfortable in the position he plays, improving with the progressive style of the team, which makes him feel even more like a fish in the water. He’s the opposite of Marcus because Marcus scores unbelievable goals in training and missed unbelievable chances in games. I’m not worried with Marcus because his good moment will arrive. Jesse won’t lose his stability. He’s mature, he understands the game better.” Mourinho made five changes, drafting in Sergio Romero, Daley Blind, Chris Smalling, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Rashford. Gary Rowett’s XI showed six different personnel from their previous match, the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United, with Tom Lawrence, Andre Wisdom, Alex Pearce, Sam Winnall, Marcus Olsson and George Thorne all selected. United made a crisp start. Luke Shaw and Pogba moved the ball along the left. The Frenchman beat a Derby defender and switched possession to Lingard, who should have scored, instead lifting the shot over Scott Carson’s goal. Yet following a flurry of United chances, the visitors stroked the ball around. Lawrence, the No10 in Rowett’s 4-2-3-1, broke up the middle and reversed play to Winnall but the centre-forward was stymied. The contest had an attractive flow. Lingard and Mkhitaryan put Rashford in and after a trick to create space the striker missed a glaring chance to open the scoring. Mata’s free-kick was saved well by Carson to his right and from the ensuing corner United found themselves back-pedalling. Mkhitaryan took this short and suddenly Shaw was passing back towards the centre-circle. When the ball found its way to Johnny Russell he coasted down the left and found Martin Olsson’s head, the left-back forcing Romero to tip over. As the half-hour approached United became sloppy. Mkhitaryan gifted possession to Derby, Winnall raced forward and the Armenian was fortunate to see the attack fizzle out. The same was true of United’s initial momentum: their display had flattened and they were now vulnerable. The lack of ruthlessness Mourinho can bemoan was evident when a Rashford glancing header from Mkhitaryan’s ball hit Carson’s left post. The No19 was at close range so had no excuse for missing. It was a repeat story when Mata picked him out and he could only head straight at the keeper. As the interval neared United kept pressing. A Pogba free-kick drew “oohs” from the home support as Carson saved sharply to his right. Yet at the break the tie remained deadlocked. Mourinho believed a change was required so Lukaku, who missed the win at Everton due to a head injury, replaced Mkhitaryan for the second half. The Belgian took his customary No9 berth, Rashford moved left and Lingard went in behind Lukaku. Derby, though, made the brighter start. A Lawrence free-kick from the right found Tom Huddlestone who was unlucky not to score with a shot. From here United mounted a first attack of the period. Pogba and Lukaku combined and when the latter lost the ball he quickly claimed it back. Up stepped Herrera whose attempt was deflected for a corner. This enlivened United. Pogba dug a route into Derby’s area and when the ball arrived at Mata’s feet he pulled the trigger and Carson beat the ball away. The passage reflected United’s dominance at the start of the contest. A Rashford corner from the left found Lukaku’s head but he could not direct it and the same player’s cross moments later was missed completely by Mata’s head. All of this illustrated a troubling lack of requisite quality in the danger area and when Lawrence fired at Romero, who dived to his right, this was as accomplished as anything United had produced. Mourinho’s men quickened the tempo yet a hint of desperation remained. Rowett brought on Matej Vydra for Winnall and Derby’s manager may have seen a credible replay move into sight. But Lukaku’s second confirmed victory and a potential warm weather break in Dubai. According to Mourinho, this rests on Stoke City not drawing with Coventry City in their tie as United are due to face them on Monday week. If the Potters do have a replay then United’s league meeting with Mark Hughes’s side is moved to Saturday week and may curtail or even mean there is no trip."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/05/paul-haggis-sexual-misconduct-allegations-crash-director","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T20:44:54Z","webTitle":"Paul Haggis: Crash director accused of sexual misconduct by four women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/05/paul-haggis-sexual-misconduct-allegations-crash-director","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/05/paul-haggis-sexual-misconduct-allegations-crash-director","fields":{"headline":"Paul Haggis: Crash director accused of sexual misconduct by four women","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Paul Haggis has been accused of sexual misconduct by four women, including two allegations of rape. The Oscar-winning screenwriter and director was originally the subject of a lawsuit in December from a publicist who claimed he raped her. Now, three other women have come forward with accusations, according to the Associated Press. Haggis’s lawyer has denied any accusations, saying: “He didn’t rape anybody.” In a later statement, the following has also been added: “In a society where one of a person’s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct.” Publicist Haleigh Breest originally accused Haggis last month of “a shocking and egregious case of rape and sexual assault” that occurred in 2013. “The emotional and psychological damage to Ms Breest from the attack cannot be overstated: it has been profound and lasting,” the complaint read. In response, Haggis filed a countersuit claiming that the lawsuit was “extortion”, a $9m attempt to get money from him. The three new accusers have refused to be identified for fear of retribution. One was a 28-year-old publicist working on a television show with Haggis in 1996. She claims he forced her to perform oral sex on him before raping her. She didn’t come forward because she worried that no one would believe her and that Haggis would end her career. “The power, the anger, the financial resources, you feel like you are not really a match for that,” she said. A third accuser claimed to have met Haggis while pitching him a TV show idea in his office. She states that Haggis told her he had an arrangement in his marriage that allowed him to sleep with other women before trying to kiss her. “I felt like my life could have been over,” she said, before she managed to escape, followed by him outside. The final accuser claims that in 2015, Haggis forcibly kissed her before following her into a taxi. After many women came forward against Harvey Weinstein, Haggis was interviewed by the Guardian about sexual harassment in Hollywood, a place he referred to as a “fairly sexist” town. “A lot of people are compromised by Harvey’s alleged actions,” he said. “Although everyone thinks it is vile behavior, you have got to focus on those who may have colluded and protected him. For me, they are as guilty as he is and in some cases more so, if I can say that. I mean, he was a predator and a predator is a predator. But what about those who would rather look the other way?” Haggis rose to fame with race drama Crash and won two Oscars for the film. He has since written screenplays for Million Dollar Baby, Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale as well as directing In the Valley of Elah and The Next Three Days. He was previously a prominent Scientologist and has written about his process of escaping the organization. His lawyer’s statement has also suggested that Haggis “questions” whether or not the group has played a role in the accusations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/06/knife-crime-metropolitan-police-cressida-dick","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T11:43:48Z","webTitle":"Knife crime needs public health strategy, says London police chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/06/knife-crime-metropolitan-police-cressida-dick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/06/knife-crime-metropolitan-police-cressida-dick","fields":{"headline":"Knife crime needs public health strategy, says London police chief","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The head of Scotland Yard has thrown her weight behind the idea that knife crime should be treated as a public health crisis rather than purely a crime. Speaking to the London assembly, Cressida Dick argued that persistent levels of knife-related violence required a preventative program to help reduce the number of deaths and injuries from attacks. Dick’s comments will be seen as a significant show of support from the UK’s most senior police officer for knife crime to be viewed through the “public health lens.” Responding to a question on whether the Met was engaged in discussions about knife crime and public health, Dick said she was aware that most of those involved or prosecuted for knife crime had a troubled upbringing. She said: “We are all committed to the notion that prevention is better than enforcement, which is, after all, the public health approach. “[The majority of such offenders] are people who have suffered some kind of adverse experience of a significant sort when they are young and/or have limited or problematic family lives and parenting, all things that can lead to other negative outcomes and not just being subject to, or causing, serious violence to somebody.” Her comments came only days before three fatal attacks on New Year’s Eve and a fourth on New Year’s Day, killings that pushed the total number of fatal stabbings last year in London to 80. Sarah Jones, Labour MP for Croydon Central, and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on knife crime, said: “Any person of influence who suggests we start taking that approach is very welcome. “I know that the government have a cross-departmental committee that meets to talk about violent crime, knife crime – the seeds are there. But this is something that goes beyond the Home Office, way beyond policing. It is a public health issue, it’s an epidemic.” Treating knife crime as a health issue is credited with prompting a dramatic drop in stabbings in Scotland, with the decline most pronounced in Glasgow, a city that once had one of the highest murder rates in western Europe. Dick said: “The public health approach is well evidenced in Scotland. There are very different communities, very different dynamics and very different issues around violence and, indeed, youth violence but, nevertheless, there have been massive reductions in violent crime through a primary health lens.” Siân Berry, who represents the Green party in the London assembly and who has long campaigned for a public health approach to the issue, said it was the closest Dick had ventured to endorsing that approach. “We have many international examples where they have cut youth violence by mainly investing in young people but the government in England doesn’t seem to be up for that yet,” she said. Another option, said Berry, might be to invest a proportion of the police budget into youth services as a preventive measure to help offset funding cuts. “London will not be able to arrest itself out of this problem,” she said. A recent crackdown in November and December, Operation Winter Nights, saw 900 people arrested along with the recovery of 359 weapons, including 278 knives. However, the latest data for London shows a sharp rise in knife crime with 13,715 incidents – a rise of 30.2% – during the 12 months to September. Funding cuts have been cited as one reason for the increase, with Dick last Thursday stating that more resources would be put into tackling knife crime if extra money were available . “We have taken thousands and thousands of knives off the streets. We are doing stop and search in an intelligent way, and we are stopping and searching those people we know are prolific knife carriers,” she told BBC radio. But Jones said that targeting the issue at source was the most cost-effective method, stating that each murder ended up costing upwards of £1m in terms of police and criminal justice costs The MP added: “There is considerable evidence that if you look at it as a public health issue, you tackle it at source; you have real intervention with the kids who are on the edges of involvement with criminal activity. Nobody from the prime minister down will disagree with that, the trouble is we are not doing it.” The Home Office said: “Knife crime has devastating consequences on our communities and we are determined to tackle this head on, that’s why we are collaborating with a number of partners, including social services, schools, the police and the voluntary sector, as well as local councils, to address the root cause.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-documentary-guardian-readers","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T12:00:10Z","webTitle":"Made in Stoke-on-Trent: local people inspired our documentary.

Tell us what you think","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In February 2017 I was one of many journalists who descended on the former industrial powerhouse of Stoke-on-Trent for what what was billed as the “Brexit by-election”. The city had voted heavily for Brexit, and had the lowest turnout in Britain at the last election. A 21-year-old man leant out of a council block window to shout: “They don’t give a shit about us. I’m not voting for anyone.” In the comment thread under the resulting film, I noticed that several negative comments had been left by people who lived in the city. I started to read more local reaction to the national coverage of the by-election, and it was soon clear that a particular feeling was widespread: the national media only tells one kind of story about places like Stoke-on-Trent: that of in the post-industrial, broken-Britain, Brexit-voting heartlands. The left behind. One of those locals pretty much ordered me to come back. “Sharpen your bloody pencil,” he told me. He became the first character in the series. I started coming to the city regularly, with the idea to speak to as many Stokies as possible and allow them to tell their story. I set up a call out on the Guardian, expecting a handful of replies. Hundreds of people wrote in, with great detail, about how they felt about their city and its portrayal. And I went back to that 21-year-old man, Kamen. It turns out he wanted to rewrite his narrative too. Much news has come and gone in Britain since then, very little of it from Stoke-on-Trent. But the cast of inspiring characters that make up this series have been working away trying to make their city a better place. Stoke-on-Trent was also making an ambitious bid to be the next UK City of Culture – a comedy footnote in some places at the time, but for many people in the city, a massive deal. It’s a fascinating and rare experience for a journalist to get to spend this amount of time in one place, with one set of people, and you come see that place in a different, deeper way. In fact how we look at places has emerged as one of the key themes of the series. Stoke-on-Trent is a city that defies expectation and rewards the time you spend looking. It is fighting back against its stereotype of a depressed Brexit heartland. It’s a place that has been high on political apathy and anger, but where people of many backgrounds are building something exciting with enterprise, passion and creativity. It’s a contradiction that goes to the heart of modern Britain – with our high streets and industries changing fast, how do our towns and cities move forward in the 21st century? How do we rebuild and support communities? And what is the ‘culture’ of a place, in the deepest most human sense? Share your views Do you live in Stoke-on-Trent or another city like it?

After the gig, the manager came in and said the audience were refusing to leave. When I asked why, she said they were all expecting a raffle. So I had to go back out and conduct the raffle. You don’t get that kind of thing with arena tours, where all the venues look the same. Those tours can quickly get out of hand, too. I remember looking out of the dressing-room window when I played at Newcastle Metro Arena and there were nine trucks, two support vehicles and another couple of vans. “Who’s that for?” I said, imagining it was some gigantic rock band, and they said: “You!”If you spend too long in your hotel room you go crazy, so I always insist on everyone going out together wherever we are. We mainly take boat trips, go rambling or mountain-biking. We do a lot of birding, too. It’s amazing how many crews have got into bird-watching. Some of the baddest looking, most tattooed and pierced roadies will sidle up to me and say: “Er, Bill, I think I saw a green woodpecker today.” Of course, touring can get you down. I missed my son’s birthday once. Stuff like that can really get to you. Just to amuse myself, I once tried to outsmart my minibar. You know those robotic ones where an item is automatically charged to your bill when you remove it? Well, I really wanted a tube of Pringles so I looked for something of equivalent weight that I could replace it with very quickly. A balled-up pair of socks worked a treat. Bill Bailey is on tour Shappi Khorsandi It can be awkward touring with other comedians who are doing better than you. I remember doing a gig in Brighton with Alan Carr and he asked me for lunch. I had no disposable income. I remember handing over a tenner to pay and thinking: “That’s half my food shopping for the week.” The next day, he texted me to ask me out for coffee and I made the most bullshit excuse. I said: “I’m really into the book I’m reading.” And it was The Da Vinci Code! Today, every time I walk into a coffee shop, I remember what a luxury it is to grab myself a soya latte. When I started out, I couldn’t even afford trains. I’d get the bus up and down the country. I remember being heavily pregnant with my son and travelling from London to Birmingham or Bristol and waddling around. I get very lonely in hotels. If I can, I stay in friendly B&amp;Bs with my kids. They always come on stage with me if I bring them on tour. They’ve got to earn their keep. The moment he could talk, my son would come up on stage and do a turn. My younger daughter’s different – she’s four and not as calm. She’s the sort of kid that once you get her on stage, you can’t get her off. I also stay with friends, or friends of friends. I’ve even had friends’ parents put me up. It’s not a skinflint thing. If I can be with people who will have a cup of tea with me, I’m so much happier. That’s why I love doing all the small venues in market towns, especially if they’re run by volunteers. You get amazing hospitality, the venues are packed out, and the audience all know each other. Last autumn, my daughter did an impersonation of me that broke my heart. She went: “Bye bye. Love you. I’m late. Gotta go. Bye.” That’s when I decided to do I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! – because it’s bought me bedtimes with my kids. After this current tour, I’ll be able to take a few months off. Once, I was playing in Salford. I accidentally booked myself into this hotel that is notorious among comedians – bouncers on the door from 5pm. I walked out of the lift and disturbed a couple in the hallway. When I say a couple, I think they’d met fairly recently. He was in a suit and she was on her knees. Did they stop? No. And I was the one who felt rude. How British is that? I was in the attic room. There were no windows, so they’d drawn a window on the wall with bushes in a forest. If it had been accurate, it would have had people shooting up. I felt so sorry for myself. “I’ve left my children,” I thought. “I have to sit up in this garret with rats after my beautiful sold-out show.” I went on Facebook and asked if anyone could recommend a cheap and cheerful place. The comedian Jason Manford got in touch. He said: “I’m not home, but I’ve got a house really near your venue. My mum will leave the keys for you. Go in, help yourself.” I knew Jason through the circuit, but he wasn’t a bestie or anything. It was such a kind thing. So I stayed at his house on my own, like a weird little burglar. Shappi Khorsandi is on tour Dane Baptiste Before I started touring, I thought places outside London were full of Brexit voters and people who would sooner throw a banana on the stage than listen to me. But I’ve been everywhere from the Lake District to Farnham and the audiences have always been great – except at Brunel University. They hated me before I even came on. I’ve never bombed so badly. I found out later that most people were only there for the party afterwards. As far as they were concerned, I was just delaying it, which meant I was the biggest cockblocker on campus. I’ve had great experiences outside the UK as well. Estonia was great. And the audiences in Latvia were really clued up, although I ate an egg and burger that was not nice. The egg was rarer than the meat. After that experience I started eating Haribo for breakfast and existing on the holy trinity of McDonald’s, KFC and Burger King. There was a show in Amsterdam where I’d eaten a Chinese takeaway, McDonald’s at the airport and then Haribo. The hotel I was staying at had bedbugs and my skin broke out. My manager was so appalled that she took over, and these days it’s all green tea and mineral water for me. I once tried to do a mid-tour detox by booking into a hotel and spa in Telford. But it was overbooked and they ended up sending me by taxi to another hotel miles away. It was like the hotel from The Shining. Mainly because of the decor, but also because of the voices in my head that kept telling me to kill everybody there.

However, few of the 31 who gathered in Brighton at the start of last week for a training camp before the Six Nations have stood out in the seven rounds of league and European matches since then, not least his captain, Dylan Hartley, who has succumbed to the malaise afflicting his club, Northampton, notable only for his mistakes. Last weekend against Harlequins the Saints fielded six of Jones’s previous selections and conceded 50 points for the second time at Twickenham this season, making it just as well they are unlikely to return there for the Premiership final in May. Hartley missed five of the 10 tackles he attempted but the England head coach is not minded to drop the hooker who has led England to two Six Nations titles and through two unbeaten autumn campaigns. Jones said last week he was not fixated by club form, a blessing for most of his regular starters who, apart from the Bath full-back Anthony Watson, have not excelled since the autumn series. The six from Northampton and Leicester went into this weekend’s round of league matches in search of their first victory since returning from England duty and the Saracens contingent had to wait a month. “I watch club rugby to assess how players are going to be at international level,” says Jones, making the point that some excelled at the one and not the other. He could have cited the former England batsman David Gower, whose bat flourished far more often in the Test arena than at sparsely attended county cricket grounds. “Dylan brings something we need at the moment, strong leadership.” That may be a factor behind the surprise recall of James Haskell who, at 32 and with the demands placed on his body catching up with him, looked to have played his last Test when he was left out of the squad in the autumn. The absence of Sam Underhill with concussion aided his return but no more than the self-belief and willpower of a player who has Japan 2019 in his sights rather than international retirement. Jones has lamented the lack of leadership qualities in players who emerge from academies cosseted and cocooned, one reason for the retention of Hartley and the recall of Haskell when, to some, the hardened oaks have reached their fell-by date. England lost only one of their 10 Tests last year but they tended to play in patches, fortified by the winning habit. Jones wants his players to solve problems as they arise but from Italy’s ploy of not contesting rucks and so not drawing an offside line to Samoa winning turnovers and penalties at the breakdown because England were often outnumbered, that day is yet to come. Samoa was the first match in which Jones started with Jamie George, the Lions hooker, ahead of Hartley, but while the Saracen made an impact, England were not collectively stronger in the absence of the captain, who remains his master’s voice. Jones said last week that the year before a World Cup is “when you win or lose it”. He spent his first two years in charge assessing his options, still looking out for players he has just enough time to mould into contenders for Japan, such as the Harlequins fly-half Marcus Smith and Bath’s loosehead prop Beno Obano, whose impact is equal in the tight and the loose, and lying in wait in November will be the World Cup holders and the one team ahead of England in the world rankings, New Zealand. England, New Zealand and Ireland are the only three tier-one nations to go into 2018 looking equipped to reach the World Cup final. Australia are rugby’s version of Arsenal, gung-ho to the point of regarding defence as an optional extra; Scotland are stirring but judgment on them will be suspended until after their opening Six Nations match in Cardiff, given their poor recent away form in the championship, with only three wins, two in Rome, this decade; Wales have stalled while South Africa and Argentina have regressed; France are weaker than they have been for more than 60 years and Italy are starting over under Conor O’Shea. It will be a testing year for Jones because of the potential José Mourinho effect. He is the most demanding of coaches, expecting excellence and pushing his players and management team to the limit and beyond. If he strikes gold, he immediately looks for more, never resting or content. While his players quickly responded to his methods, it is the point when a message and an approach become familiar that separates the best coaches from the rest. Mourinho’s way tends to work for three years before flames burn out; Jones needs an extra one. Jones has so far remained loyal to his players: of the side that started his first match, the 15-9 win at Murrayfield in February 2016, only George Kruis has been discarded, and that is likely to only be temporary following the second-row’s loss of form after the Lions tour to New Zealand. It is the undercard that has changed and, if few of England’s starters have impressed in recent weeks, those that have include Henry Slade and Sam Simmonds, along with the Exeter flanker Don Armand, who came on as a replacement in the first Test against Argentina last summer but has not featured since. Jones should have Billy Vunipola and Maro Itoje by the start of England’s Six Nations campaign, in Rome on Sunday 4 February, players adept at providing the quick ball George Ford thrives on at fly‑half, but while the head coach talks about making history by winning the Six Nations for a third consecutive year, New Zealand will rarely be far from his thoughts. They have what he covets and everything is geared to overhauling them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/05/pakistan-prime-minister-trump-funding-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T23:39:24Z","webTitle":"Pakistan PM calls US aid 'insignificant' as Trump threatens to cut it off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/05/pakistan-prime-minister-trump-funding-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/05/pakistan-prime-minister-trump-funding-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Pakistan PM calls US aid 'insignificant' as Trump threatens to cut it off","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Pakistan’s prime minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, has declared himself mystified by US threats to cut off funding, saying that US financial assistance was “very, very insignificant” and that Pakistan was “on the forefront of the war on terror”. In an interview with the Guardian, Abbasi said that reports that the US was considering cuts of up to $2bn in security assistance were bewildering because the total aid Pakistan – civilian and military – actually received was a tiny fraction of that amount. “I am not sure what US aid has been talked here,” Abbasi said in his office in Islamabad. “The aid in the last five years at least has been less than $10m a year. It is a very, very insignificant amount. So when I read in the paper that aid at the level of $250m or 500 or 900 has been cut, we at least are not aware of that aid.” Donald Trump used his first tweet of 2018 to threaten to withhold aid to Pakistan because of what he called its “lies and deceit” over terrorism, claiming: “They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help.” The president has that the US had “foolishly” given Pakistan $33bn over the past 15 years. According to the US Agency for International Development, the US gave $778m to Pakistan in assistance in 2016, of which 35% was military and the rest economic. The threatened move – designed to force Pakistan’s military and intelligence apparatus to cut support for the Taliban and other Islamist groups – would include both US military assistance and Afghanistan coalition funding to Islamabad. A senior official was quoted by the French Press Agency as saying that potential cuts could affect bilateral security assistance and funding that is channelled to Islamabad through the US-led coalition in Afghanistan. The official said it was “approximately $2bn worth of equipment and coalition support funding that is in play”. The official added that “all options are on the table” when it comes to further moves, including stripping Pakistan of its status as a “major non-Nato ally”. Pakistani officials said that the amounts actually of aid money spent are much less that those quoted and they plan to publish their version soon. Abbasi, who was elected prime minister last year, rejected Trump’s charge of duplicity over the fight against terrorism, calling his claim that Pakistan was harbouring terrorists a “fallacy”. “Pakistan is a sovereign country and Pakistan has always abided by international conventions,” he said. “We are today fighting the largest war on terror in the world. We are fighting the world’s war on terror with our own resources ... That is something the world has to appreciate. “We have over 6,500 [killed] almost 37,000 of the civilian population has been killed. There are tens of thousands of people injured. We have suffered a loss of over $120bn in our economy. So the world has to appreciate that. We just want the world to know that Pakistan is on the forefront on the war on this terror.” “Today we are fighting terrorists. So if somebody says we are harbouring terrorists, there is no greater fallacy,” Abbasi said. “We have engaged US at every level from President Trump down. We have explained to them ... what Pakistan has done we have explained to the rest of the world also.” “[It’s] the rest of the world failed in Afghanistan to control terrorists who today attack Pakistan across the border. Pakistan has won the war against terror on its own territory,” Abbasi said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/07/pepinster-poverty-rural-poor-herefordshire-priests-church-of-england-society","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T00:03:07Z","webTitle":"How rural vicars became the last social workers in the countryside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/07/pepinster-poverty-rural-poor-herefordshire-priests-church-of-england-society","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/07/pepinster-poverty-rural-poor-herefordshire-priests-church-of-england-society","fields":{"headline":"How rural vicars became the last social workers in the countryside","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Rural Britain is facing unprecedented challenges of isolation, homelessness, poverty and cuts to public services and, like medieval England, it is the church that has become the welfare organisation picking up the pieces, a new documentary series will argue. A Vicar’s Life is a six-part BBC2 series, starting on Friday, which examines country life through the work of four Church of England priests in Herefordshire, England’s most rural county. While it seems idyllic at first – with its backdrop of the Black Mountains and the Welsh borders and traditional scenes of village life such as church fetes selling homemade cakes, a much tougher rural existence is exposed. The vicars, who were followed by the documentary makers for six months, are seen helping people struggling with homelessness, losing their livelihoods, loneliness and the arrival of foreign migrant workers. While it is no Vicar of Dibley view of the church, the priests are also seen dealing with more usual church matters, from christenings, weddings and funerals, to coping with declining congregations, balancing the books and looking after their historic buildings. Even that reveals the reality behind the idyllic rural façade: in the first episode, one vicar has to tackle the aftermath of one of his churches being targeted by thieves. In Hereford, vicars have to cover large areas and run many parishes at the same time. Rural dean Nicholas Lowton oversees the most picturesque patch and is responsible for 24 parishes. He says the days when people in country areas are fully involved with the church are long gone: “The majority of people in this country don’t go to church. We have to change our approach,” he said, explaining that his area will soon have a priest focusing on the “missing generation” – people between the ages of 21 and 50 who have never been churchgoers. Lowton’s comments are borne out by national statistics. The latest British Social Attitudes Survey showed that the number of people calling themselves Anglican has halved in less than two decades. In 2000, 30% of people said they were members of the C of E, but the most recent survey showed a slump to 15%. Yet A Vicar’s Life exposes a paradox: while Anglican church attendance is declining, the C of E is increasingly depended on as a place of last resort when public services are cut and red tape surrounding welfare benefits increases. Government statistics suggest one in six people in rural areas live in poverty, and the series shows priests answering pleas for help from people struggling with homelessness and extreme poverty. Curate Matthew Cashmore and his parish organise for the church to pay for a bed and breakfast for a woman who has nowhere to go. She is told she cannot sign on for benefits because she has no fixed address but does not get help with housing either. “The safeguards people think are there are not there,” said Cashmore. “Then people turn to the church for help. The key difference is that we are capable of having long-term relationships with people.Someone with problems go from meeting to meeting with different people with government agencies. But you can’t solve homelessness in a meeting. It takes months.” Cashmore studied for the priesthood after many years as a media executive and moved to Herefordshire in the past year. “I have been surprised by the scale of the poverty,” he said. “Rural poverty has been around for a long time, and people in the countryside have helped one another in an ad hoc way. Now the scale of it makes that more difficult.” The bishop of Hereford, the Rt Rev Richard Frith, said: “In these times of austerity cuts and a reduction in the voluntary sector, the church is often the only organisation left helping those in need, particularly in our very rural parts where the church building itself is the only focal place where a community can gather together. Our clergy are there for each and every one of us. But we are a lot more than an alternative social service. What we do must be an expression of our Christian faith.” Religious organisations have long been involved in providing help for the poor in England, since the time of medieval Catholic monasteries. After their dissolution by Henry VIII, Church of England parishes would distribute funds to the poor. Creation of the welfare state lessened the church’s role, but A Vicar’s Life highlights how vital it is today for people in dire need. The series also exposes the extent of social isolation in rural areas. Another vicar featured, Ruth Hulse, said: “Our churches are natural gathering places. In one of the villages, Breinton, there is nowhere else for people to go.” Other rural problems highlighted are those of tenant farmers, faced with eviction when the council sells off land, and resentment of migrant workers working in orchards. Cashmore said concerns over migration were reflected in a strongly pro-Brexit vote in the area. “There are some people here who are overtly unwelcoming. We’ve heard very negative things being said. The church must stand as a bulwark against these views.” But people in Herefordshire make a distinction between migrants and the plight of refugees. In one episode, the makers of A Vicar’s Life show local residents travelling to refugee camps in France, with produce from Herefordshire gardens and orchards, including apples from the bishop’s trees.

It serves us to remember that only a small percentage of students cheat; and that there was also a rise in teachers and school staff involved in exam malpractice. However, when students did cheat, in most cases it involved taking “unauthorised materials” into the exams, which were generally mobile phones or other electronic devices. Admittedly, I’m speaking as a parent who is still not over her shock and bitterness at discovering that students are allowed to use calculators for homework. Crikey. In my day, as a young whippersnapper, we had to descend from our penny farthings to gormlessly count on our fingers to get sums wrong. Still, it seems a bit odd that pupils can’t be made to hand their phones in – couldn’t they be placed in little labelled bags and kept in a big wicker basket at the entrance to the hall? After all, what innocent or compelling reason could students have for retaining their phones – in case a 16-year-old is urgently needed by MI5, or the babysitter rings? Short of unpleasant frisking that could result in lawsuits, it seems that something could be done to successfully remove the phones and iPads from students. If all else fails, there’s always the option of cutting off the supply at the source. Indeed, perhaps educational establishments should just do what anybody does when they wish to stop something like this happening. The way to potentially thwart modern exam cheats, as well as simultaneously reduce everybody else in the vicinity to hopeless crumbling wrecks unable to function?

As in: they wouldn’t have dreamed it possible, formerly so sluggish, surprisingly tasty, never before so clear-headed, 10 kilometres feels like nothing, great to be reducing methane emissions, really you should try it. That new journalistic genre – the born-again dieter/faster runner/meat-renouncer’s/non-drinker’s confession – would be nothing without its implicitly, or not so implicitly, admonitory edge: how can you lot live with yourselves? January is now also Veganuary, in which the soaring number of vegan converts urge us to “take the pledge”, the temperance movement having, you gather, no monopoly on quasi-religious oaths of renunciation. We will, its organisers promise, “feel fantastic”, while knowing that we’re reducing animal suffering and helping the planet. But it’s fine, too, to go vegan for purely selfish reasons, as “the healthiest start to the year”. Why not, in fact, combine it with one of the latest diet innovations, like raw water, or Dr Michelle Braude’s “eat carbs lose weight” regime, or Prof Tim Spector’s plan for enhancing “good” gut bacteria, and evacuating the bad ones? In 2018, the professor tells the Daily Mail, a healthy gut is all about eating like the Hadza, “an indigenous group of people in Africa”, whose “gut bacteria is about 30% more diverse than in western nations”. It was in the midst of this seasonal surge of physical idealism that Michael Wolff brought the world, in Fire and Fury, further details about Trump’s patent “eat more, move less” regime. The Hadza were not the only indigenous people to be completely appalled. It was already known, of course, that the president binged on junk food and overdone steak. His favourite dinner – two Big Macs, two Filet-o-Fish, chocolate malted shake – comes in, at 2,530 calories, over the approved daily intake for an adult male. Now, thanks to Wolff, we learn that, when not endangering his health where his preferences can be witnessed by fellow junk food enthusiasts, he still favours a cheeseburger, eaten in bed, at 6.30pm. Even Bill Clinton, now a vegan but once famed for his prodigious appetite and with a similar predilection for bolting Big Macs, liked to jog healthily to a local provider as opposed to masticating alone, between sheets that the president prefers to strip himself (not the only way in which Trump recalls the hero of John Kennedy Toole’s Confederacy of Dunces). As much as a gluttonous leader sets a dreadful example, and must cause a good deal of unnecessary anxiety to Melania, the cheeseburger evidence is probably less problematic, and not just for the president’s critics, than if Trump were suddenly revealed to be so dedicated, privately, to bodily purity that he could teach Gwyneth Paltrow a thing or two about mind and spirit detox. An unhinged belligerent who refused meat would not, of course, be the first leader whose behaviour tested any alleged correlation between vegetarian diets and benevolence; it could nonetheless challenge the increasingly popular view of food preferences as spiritually meaningful. Perhaps it consoles clerics who miss Lenten observance, and fish on Fridays, that this type of exercise has not so much vanished as migrated, complete with puritanical homiletic, to the lifestyle, occasionally political, pages. It’s become virtually impossible to separate, for instance, Jeremy Corbyn the incorruptible politician from Jeremy Corbyn the incorruptible food-group-excluding teetotaller who drank apple juice for a treat on Christmas Day. Admirers of Mr Corbyn’s gut now watch in awe as he treads the narrowing path from vegetarian to vegan, already assured that we will, if he is ever elected, be represented by some of the best-kept intestines in British political history. In one of his earliest dietary bulletins he confirmed that some issues, unlike Brexit or regime change in Iran, lie too deep for constructive ambiguity. What was his favourite biscuit, Mumsnet members asked him, in 2016. “I’m totally anti-sugar on health grounds, so eat very few biscuits,” he said. Then – perhaps mindful of the fruit bowl that once made such a statement in Tony Blair’s den – “but if forced to accept one, it’s always a pleasure to have a shortbread”. That this special perspective on visible Hobnobs – as a species of late capitalist torture – did not lastingly affect Corbyn’s reputation is just one measure of how far the public has come to accept food-group renouncers at their own (often high) estimation. In The Road to Wigan Pier George Orwell wrote the commonest socialist was not working class but “a prim little man with a white-collar job, usually a secret teetotaller and often with vegetarian leanings, with a history of Nonconformity behind him”. That was alienating, he thought, to decent people. “And their instinct is perfectly sound, for the food-crank is by definition a person willing to cut himself off from human society in hopes of adding five years on to the life of his carcase; that is, a person out of touch with common humanity”. What Orwell couldn’t have anticipated is what last week’s vegan-spiking scandal confirmed: that vegetarians and vegans would so far advance as to establish themselves as the decent people and their critics as the ones devoid of common humanity. And, as gut-maintenance and veganism attract influential followers, it is undiscerning, junk-food consumers who find themselves the object of media derision and pity. Reporters instructed to try Trump’s meals have reported, like so many grossed-out Zellwegers, on their low, Bridget Jones-like ordeals. How could anyone eat like this? Ask the patrons of a million chicken shops and McDonald’s. While the reasons for all this junk consumption must – assuming they’re not simply cash-, class- and time-related – remain mysterious, it seems unlikely their customers are as disgusted as are many opinion-formers by people who’ve never tried kimchi. Trump’s unmindful intake of impure food is surely not, unless the plan is to impeach him on the deadly sins, among his graver offences. Like steady weight gain, it’s an attribute he shares with many underprivileged supporters. So it could be counterproductive – and arguably insensitive – to make too much of it. As vegans showed last week, and Jamie Oliver’s stubborn chip-eaters did before that, people can get very indignant when their diets are disrespected. Anyway, if public figures are rightly damned for lax food choices, it follows that they ought to be admired whenever they advertise control over their appetites; whether by religious fasting, or by pledging secular abstinence from meat or biscuits. Though there are probably thousands of food bank users who do that the entire time, and without earning anything like the acclaim bestowed upon the indigenous Hadza people of Africa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2018/jan/05/insidious-the-last-key-review-horror-prequel-fails-to-unlock-scares","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T20:51:15Z","webTitle":"Insidious: The Last Key review – horror prequel fails to unlock scares","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/05/insidious-the-last-key-review-horror-prequel-fails-to-unlock-scares","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jan/05/insidious-the-last-key-review-horror-prequel-fails-to-unlock-scares","fields":{"headline":"Insidious: The Last Key review – horror prequel fails to unlock scares","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"All horror films, whether their creators or fans wish to admit it, trade a little bit in cruelty. At some point we’ll watch, from the safety of our voyeur’s perch, someone writhe in agony as they are stabbed or bludgeoned or strangled. Yet the cruelest thing in Insidious: The Last Key doesn’t happen to anyone on screen. After a reasonably well-executed prologue, one with good acting, dramatic moments, a genuine eerie tone and a visual landscape crafted with care, the rug is pulled from us. We move from the 1950s to “now”, and with that we exit a warm bath of sincere film-making to an icy tub of cliche. You can scream, but no one will save you. This is part four of the Insidious saga, but it’s actually the sequel to a prequel (3, 4, 1, 2, should you ever feel the need to screen these in chronological order.) But one need not have seen any of the others to follow the plot, and the few in-jokes for completists are broadly telegraphed as such. The Last Key’s prologue gives us the early backstory of Elise, Lin Shaye’s specter-sensitive psychic who appears in the other films. Her childhood home is nextdoor to a prison’s death row and her father, a corrections officer, is a brute who tries to beat her supernatural sensitivities away. Her mother ends up hanged before her eyes by forces from beyond. It wasn’t a pleasant upbringing! In the present (well, 2010) Elise gets a call from a spooked man currently living in her old house. Despite hesitation she agrees to visit him and confront the haunting spirits. Her two dorky ghost-catching buddies Tucker (Angus Sampson, doing some light Danny McBride schtick) and Specs (the awkward Leigh Whannell, the co-creator of the Saw films and writer of this one, if you were wondering how he got the gig) get in their Scooby-Doo-esque van with the intent to do what they always do: wander around a basement with night vision glasses and have people in creepy makeup jump out of nowhere just as the music goes SCREEEEEEECH. I can’t stress enough just how tiresome it is once the gang gets to the eerie homestead. (A street sign pointing to Old Dirt Road gets a laugh, but that’s about it.) Cold basements, blank stages representing “the other side”, some smoke, some dust. It’s all really low rent, and made worse with a flat video sheen. An otherworldly villain with keys in lieu of fingernails has the potential to be interesting, but other than that image it goes nowhere. A recurring motif of men locking up nurses in a basement for Brie Larson-in-Room purposes is all too unsettling for what could otherwise be a fun spookhouse picture. Moreover, The Last Key squanders its opportunities to get interesting. The violence is gore-free and no one dies in an inventive manner. The two younger women (Elise’s nieces) who show up for scream queen duty don’t get to do much more than smile. This film is all the more unfortunate in that this is probably the only franchise film we’ll see this year, next year or the year after in which the star is a 74-year-old woman. Lin Shaye’s line readings are as flat as the rest of the film, and I can’t misrepresent and call this a “good performance”. But she does have a presence, and during the film’s climax (or what passes as a climax) her reaction shots to seeing the spirit of someone once close to her is surprisingly touching. Beneath all this babble, the ghost of a tender moment.

By December, a whopping 14% fewer cars were being sold than at the same time a year ago. As a barometer of economic and consumer confidence, as well as a pointer to the fortunes of one of the UK’s major manufacturing industries, the dip in sales would be troubling news for any government – let alone one set on a Brexit course that the motor industry views as potentially calamitous. Furthermore, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) makes it clear that it also blames ministers for one particular trend: the 17% drop in diesel cars sold, 200,000 fewer in 2017 than the previous year. Yet neither the overall fall, nor diesel’s accelerated plunge, should be laid at the door of government. The preceding boom owed much to cheap credit, with 90% of private car sales coming via the personal contract purchases (PCPs) that have caused concern at the Bank of England. If consumer confidence in such deals has been knocked by the prospect of higher interest rates, a dose of reality could avert the greater worry of growing, unsustainable debt sparking a second crash. Meanwhile, it is hard to play anything but the tiniest violin for the industry as it whinges about the “demonisation of diesel”. The minor tax incentives announced by the chancellor in his November budget went only a small way to addressing a public health crisis in air quality. When tens of thousands of premature deaths are being directly attributed by health experts to burgeoning levels of NOx pollution from diesel cars, a little perspective is needed. The direct, deliberate cheating exposed in the Volkswagen scandal has led to prosecutions, massive corporate fines and jail sentences in the US, yet virtual inaction in Europe. The motor industry has still a long way to go to make the public believe its claims that new diesel engines are clean; indeed, independent tests have shown that even those manufactured to the latest Euro 6 standards continue to fall short. Instead of showing their determination to clean up, car bosses have preferred to finger-point at wood-burning stoves, and resist the mild nudges of the Treasury. Years of issuing lab test figures – whether for petrol consumption or NOx emissions – that bore little relation to the real world have earned the industry the public’s distrust. Despite all that, and given the recent history of diesel, the SMMT should be heard when it talks about unintended consequences. It was, after all, the government’s desire to cut CO2 emissions that saw tax breaks given to diesel over petrol, bringing diesel from the margins to become the most popular fuel for new cars in little over a decade from 2001. Now, the SMMT says, the government risks deterring people from buying cleaner, newer cars because consumers are reluctant to invest in diesel – even though diesel may, in certain circumstances, be the preferred environmental alternative. Potential buyers are sitting on their hands, the industry claims, rather than switching to alternative fuels; older engines chug on and spew out NOx rather than get replaced. This is all too plausible, if uncomfortable, territory for the motor industry, which can only ever hope to limit its negatives in the environmental debate: even if electric cars have zero emissions at the tailpipe, there is still the environmental cost of power generation and their batteries to consider. The SMMT praised Angela Merkel for backing diesel manufacture, as Germany pursues an awkward path between protecting industry and public health by simultaneously promoting clean air zones. If the British industry really believes in cleaner diesel, it needs to embrace transparency and push solutions to tackle the errors of the recent past and the highly polluting cars on our roads – and not simply denounce attempts to force change. Otherwise, the public will indeed see only demons in diesel. UK productivity is rising – but not always for the right reasons British workers are renowned for putting in extra hours at the office to no great effect while their counterparts in France, Germany and the US clock off at 5pm with the job done. The relative productivity of workers across the developed world is a matter of huge debate, but if the figures from the OECD are taken as a guide, a US worker produces $68 each hour worked, compared with the $52 that a UK worker can generate. In France and Germany the figure is around $67 an hour. That means the average UK worker must slave away for a third more hours to achieve the same level of output as his or her rivals. So it is encouraging that the latest estimate of labour productivity by the Office for National Statistics shows a 0.9% increase in the three months to September 2017. Britain needs to play catch-up. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the UK’s average output per hour worked has remained flat. If, as most economists believe, productivity is the key that unlocks more generous pay, then it is easy to see why some number-crunchers believe pay rises are about to become more generous. Almost zero productivity gains over the past 10 years has restricted pay rises to an average between 2% and 2.5%. Before 2008 the average increase in productivity was 2%, with wage rises of between 3% and 4%. Sadly, the jump in productivity is not due only to expansion by the manufacturing industry. Weaker jobs growth in the services and construction sectors is another reason why, since the Brexit vote, the UK economy has generated broadly the same amount of output for fewer hours worked. Producing the same output with fewer workers is not most people’s idea of a healthy rise in productivity. But if higher investment in machinery and technology is the knock-on effect as EU workers become more scarce, that at least will rebalance the economy away from unskilled jobs to higher-paying roles. Dark side for Disney if Star Wars fails to take off in China Star Wars: The Last Jedi has been a force to be reckoned with at the global box office since its release, comfortably reaching $1.1bn (£810m) before its arrival in China this weekend. But there are early signs that it has been unable to clone its success in the world’s second-largest film market, with domestic comedy The Ex-File 3 outperforming the sci-fi epic, according to preliminary figures. If The Last Jedi fails to replicate its stellar worldwide performance in China, it represents a further cautionary tale for a Hollywood studio system that is grappling with waning powers. Successive Star Wars films have struggled in the Middle Kingdom but there were hopes that Walt Disney Studios, the all-conquering Disney division behind the franchise, would reverse that with a big marketing campaign. Hollywood needs success in China to shore up its long-term future.

Joe Dunthorne’s eagerly awaited third novel, The Adulterants, comes a full 10 years after his acclaimed debut, Submarine, established him as a worthy successor to Hornby and Amis. Early readers are already hailing its “subversive joy”, and celebrating the dyspeptic take on life of its protagonist, Ray. In his first interview ahead of the book’s publication, Dunthorne, 35, told the Observer why creating the darkly funny story took so long. “It seems to be getting harder each time, which is really disappointing,” he said. “It took more out of me than the others have done.” Dunthorne’s second novel, Wild Abandon, came out in 2011, but the progress of The Adulterants, which is about “stalled masculinity” and facing up to parenthood, was slowed further by a change to his lifestyle. He became a father to his first child, Lorne, last summer. “The birth of my son ousted me from my study and then up until just before Christmas I was really on the edge. Now he seems to be sleeping.” Richard Ayoade’s 2010 film of Submarine raised Dunthorne’s profile exponentially. “Although there are a lot of people who know me through Submarine, I certainly think that book would not have made me well-known on its own,” he said. “I am famous through my connection to the world of the film.” The novel told the story of an unpopular Welsh schoolboy, Oliver Tate, and his growing feeling for his friend Jordana. “People have asked me to write a sequel,” said Dunthorne. “Maybe a prequel might be possible one day, if I could make a younger boy the centre of that kind of story.” The Adulterants marks something of a minimalist turn in his career. “The novel was twice as long at one point. But the final thing is so short it is almost not a novel. I don’t know if this is just my life, but everything seems to be narrowing. Things generally seem to be getting more modest and more destructive.” In the narrative, Ray keeps up a critical internal commentary on the world around him, targeting estate agents, open marriages and the threat posed by sensitive men. So what is the appeal for Dunthorne of the deadpan, misanthropic voice of such anti-heroes? “It is very easy to believe in someone who has a million ways in which they feel superior to their surroundings, especially when you know they are wrong,” Dunthorne said. “But it requires judgement, as you try to find an engaging voice to offer the reader fresh-seeming ways to hate the world. Catcher in the Rye is the model, I suppose. It is tricky to get an unreliable narrator right. You have to enjoy their sense of their own rightness inside their own sheltered world.” Dunthorne is already working on a television adaptation of the new book but said he did not write it with a screen version in mind, despite the cinematic success of his debut. “Submarine had been written in a style that was very unsuitable for filming and that did not stop it from being seen that way. The TV version of The Adulterants will probably be more about the other characters in the ensemble. There is a lot I didn’t use in the final book.” Dunthorne, who grew up in Swansea, has also written video games and finds the layering of subplots intriguing, whether in a game or a novel. He is also a published poet, particularly admiring the work of the German-born American poet and novelist Denis Johnson, who died last year. His own collection of poems will be published next year. Even his new anti-hero’s voice contains moments of poetry. “I like having a character who is both stupid and lyrical within the same paragraph, even if it can seem inconsistent. A lot of the book is deliberately not offering a consistent way of seeing. It is a memory after all.” Four years into his struggle with The Adulterants he found he was to become a father. “It was already happening in my friendship group. The change in the lives of my closest friends meant I was asking them what it was like to become a parent. At the beginning of writing the book I was interviewing them, as it seemed amazing and incomprehensible to go from being able to service your ego 24 hours a day to not having even half a day a week to do that.” The idea for Ray’s story began as a short story, which became a rough draft of the first chapter. “I felt the voice taking on something interesting, yet I did not set out to write about ‘becoming a man’. It is more about the enormity of what is expected and how, when you become a parent, you feel you are going to be a better person.” The comic form comes naturally to Dunthorne but he knows it is potentially “reductive”. “I would self-identify as a comic novelist, but that suggests all I do is make jokes. “I could make some highbrow justification for my literary project: in the end, though, it’s a question of whether the reader feels pulled to spend some time with a white, privileged douchebag.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/jan/06/tommy-fleetwood-win-majors-ryder-cups","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T12:00:12Z","webTitle":"Tommy Fleetwood: ‘I want to win majors and play in multiple Ryder Cups’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/06/tommy-fleetwood-win-majors-ryder-cups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jan/06/tommy-fleetwood-win-majors-ryder-cups","fields":{"headline":"Tommy Fleetwood: ‘I want to win majors and play in multiple Ryder Cups’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Tommy Fleetwood had precious few reasons to relish 2017 reaching its end. If there was one, then surely the biennial meeting of Europe and the United States falling this year provided the 26-year-old with valid cause to look forward rather than back. Fleetwood ticks so many boxes that his appeal is both obvious and underplayed. As the son of a Southport lorry driver, he – like Rory McIlroy – provides an ideal antidote to the notion of golf as a playground for little rich kids. Fleetwood, every ounce the unaffected boy next door yet among the world’s leading golfers, should be admired. When a serious career slump, which reached a point during the summer of 2016 when Fleetwood was scared to tee off in competition play, is factored in then his stunning past 12 months is worthy of high praise. What looks a key step in the next, logical path for Fleetwood arrives in Malaysia next weekend. He will form part of the European contingent at the Eurasia Cup, with the fact the captaincy is held by Thomas Bjorn highlighting what the event is intended to be a precursor for. It would be a surprise if Fleetwood does not qualify automatically for September’s Ryder Cup, at Le Golf National outside Paris, but he can still use three days in Kuala Lumpur to make a lasting impression on Bjorn. “I wanted to be at the last two Ryder Cups but didn’t come close,” Fleetwood says. “As soon as I got to the level where I was one good year away from playing in a Ryder Cup, I wanted to do it. I’m starting off now with a much bigger building block in place. “It is the biggest sporting occasion in the world when it comes around so I want to be there, I want to play multiple Ryder Cups. I just want to be part of that whole thing. Race to Dubai winner, playing in Ryder Cups, winning majors – these are all great parts of a career you want to have.” The last time Europe faced the US, Fleetwood was trying to piece his golf back together from a low point of No188 in the world. “I had just started getting a little bit better,” he recalls. “I had a couple of top 15s, my game was coming round but I was in no place to be playing in a Ryder Cup.” What happened next borders on a fairytale. Fleetwood won in Abu Dhabi, where he will defend his trophy this month, to kickstart a run that featured a runners-up position in a World Golf Championship, a tilt at the US Open, victory again in France and fatherhood for the first time. Fleetwood emerged from a titanic battle with Justin Rose to claim the European Tour’s Race to Dubai crown, just weeks before getting married. “I’d have taken it … I’m not so sure I would have believed it,” says Fleetwood when asked if he would have accepted such a scenario if it had been offered 12 months ago. “Race to Dubai was never a goal at the start of last year. It’s funny because when you are doing it, you just keep going, keep playing. You don’t think about other things and you don’t want the run to stop.” The joust with Rose looked like going against Fleetwood when he made a Sunday 74 to hand the Masters runner-up a position from which most onlookers expected him to convert. Instead, with Fleetwood watching from the scoring hut, Rose stumbled over the back nine. In hindsight, what would it have been like had he not prevailed? “I would have felt like shit,” Fleetwood admits. “When we walked off 18, it was completely out of our control. It was Justin’s to win over nine holes. I had a bad Sunday, Justin had a bad back nine so it’s shown up that way but we were the top two golfers throughout the year. “It was a bit of a weird day because I was disappointed with how I played on the Sunday. Then I ended up winning it, which felt great, we all had a few beers then I got on a flight for Hong Kong and you start on a new tournament week. “I’m not going to tournaments for no reason or just for a party. I had a few moments in Hong Kong, the odd minute where you sit down and reflect more than anything of having that ticked off in your career. It’s something special. I want to do it again now. It is a massively recognised thing, it isn’t just like winning a tournament. I went to the Bahamas [for the Hero World Challenge] and Tiger Woods comes in: ‘Tommy, awesome. Great stuff.’ Tiger Woods. It showed massive consistency in my game.” For Fleetwood to become that modern-day rarity of an English major champion – Rose at the 2013 US Open and Danny Willett at the 2016 Masters are the only men to achieve this since Nick Faldo – short-game improvements must continue. There is also the continuing pushing of comfort-zone boundaries when in the company of major champions. “Stuff like WGCs and majors, playing more in America, the more you put yourself up against these guys, I feel like the majors – still the biggest events in the world –are just another tournament in a way because you have been playing in these fields,” Fleetwood explains. “The more comfortable you are there, it is just about winning a golf tournament. The US Open was something I loved. You only gain that experience by being up there and doing it as much as you can. “I had a massively consistent year and won twice. I want to win a lot more, wherever those tournaments are; winning is a habit I want to keep up. I didn’t win in Hong Kong straight after Dubai and was annoyed by it. Majors would be a nice natural progression. In my career I want to win multiple major championships.” Plus, of course, achieve that Ryder Cup goal. Fleetwood raises a smile but delivers a firm “I don’t think so” when presented with the theory that the USA – Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas et al – seem destined to dominate. “I mean, the Americans are having one of the best times ever and they’ll have one of the best teams ever but Europe is by no means weak,” he says. “When you talk about the Ryder Cup being a massive goal for me, you realise how hard it is to get into the team. It is going to be really difficult to get there, which shows the strength of European golf. I think it could be a brilliant Ryder Cup.” And one with Fleetwood, surely, as a component."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/05/house-of-fraser-seeks-cutbacks-after-a-difficult-christmas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T19:51:49Z","webTitle":"House of Fraser seeks to cut store size and rent bill after tough Christmas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/05/house-of-fraser-seeks-cutbacks-after-a-difficult-christmas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/05/house-of-fraser-seeks-cutbacks-after-a-difficult-christmas","fields":{"headline":"House of Fraser seeks to cut store size and rent bill after tough Christmas","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"House of Fraser is seeking to cut the size of stores in an effort to slash its rent bill after a tough Christmas. The department store group, which was bought by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in 2014, wants to cut its high street footprint by 30% over 10 years. It is understood the group does not want to close individual stores, other than the two closed last year in Leicester and Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. “We are shaving off surplus space such as a basement or top floors,” a source close to the business said. There have been widespread rumours that House of Fraser will seek to close stores and cut its rent bill via a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency. But the source said: “There are no discussions about a CVA.” One property expert said House of Fraser would struggle to persuade landlords to reduce rents on a piecemeal basis without a formal CVA process. “History shows that it is everyone in or nothing. They won’t get landlords to move unless they do it together [via a CVA],” the expert said. A spokesperson for the company, which will update the market on festive trading next week, confirmed it had “contacted some of our landlords asking for their support as we drive forward with our transformation programme”. One source with good knowledge of House of Fraser said that the company had been forced to take action on its rental bill, as first reported by Sky News, after a tough Christmas marked by heavy discounting, particularly on clothing and festive gifts. Rival Debenhams said it was considering closing stores and cutting jobs after it was forced to issue a profits warning earlier this week following dire Christmas trading that wiped about £20m off its anticipated annual profits. House of Fraser is battling to cut costs and secure funds for investment amid heavy debts. In September Sanpower put in £25m of extra cash to see the company through Christmas but the group had been expected to invest far more at the time of buyout. In December, credit ratings agency Moody’s downgraded House of Fraser’s debt to junk status as weak trading and disruption caused by the launch of the company’s new website was compounded by poor sales of its own-label ranges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/07/new-high-street-cant-save-town-jobs-trains-commuters-employment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"A new high street can’t save a town – but jobs and trains will","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/07/new-high-street-cant-save-town-jobs-trains-commuters-employment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/07/new-high-street-cant-save-town-jobs-trains-commuters-employment","fields":{"headline":"A new high street can’t save a town – but jobs and trains will","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"If Christmas showed us anything, it is that the high street is dying in most of our towns and many of our cities. Figures emerging from the main high-street shops covering the Christmas trading period show that a combination of falling disposable incomes and internet shopping seriously dented sales. Next was one of the first fashion retailers to reveal that its festive cheer had all been online, where sales rose 13.6%. Its high-street stores suffered a 6.1% slump. It’s a trend seen by all the major retail chains in recent years that appears to be accelerating – especially when “smart speakers” such as the Amazon Echo were among the must-have presents under the tree. The Echo and its rival Google Home can be purchased in major stores, but it is almost counterintuitive to buy a gadget from a shop when that gadget is designed to help consumers avoid buying any goods or services from a bricks-and-mortar business. Debenhams was among the worst-hit chains. The department store saw its share price fall 20% after it announced a steep drop in December sales. Marks &amp; Spencer will tell all this week, but a better than expected performance – which is possible following improved reviews for its women’s clothing – won’t disguise a shop empire in decline. M&amp;S bosses are still planning to close 30 stores, among them prominent outlets in Portsmouth, Slough, Warrington, Wokingham and Worksop. This trend poses a huge problem for town councils and the government, and yet there remains a head-in-the-sand attitude that could condemn hundreds of towns to a long slow death. If profit margins – or profits of any kind – are in jeopardy, then the value of commercial town centre land becomes a fraction of what it once was. So rents will need to come down, and business rates – which account for £27bn of government income – will have to fall. Former prime minister David Cameron acknowledged the danger when he commissioned the Portas review of Britain’s high streets in 2011. Mary Portas, known as the queen of shops following her popular retail-makeover TV programmes, was deeply concerned that some 25,000 stores had closed since the turn of the century. At the time she said: “Many [high streets] are sickly, others are on the critical list and some now are dead. They have reached a crisis point. Unless urgent action is taken much of Britain will lose, irretrievably, something that is fundamental to our society.” But the Portas review and the recommendations that it spawned were based on an approach that deemed shops to be the heart of a town. Bring back the shops with a mixture of tax cuts and a spruced-up environment, went the argument, and the town should be saved. Town councillors, landlords and HMRC tax collectors would be thrilled if that were true. The hundreds of millions of pounds spent tarting up dilapidated shops and watering hanging baskets wouldn’t have been wasted. Unfortunately, a town’s success is really based on something else: jobs, access to amenities and transport links. Contrast Newbury and Coventry. Newbury spent millions giving its high street a facelift and tackling parking problems. The aim was to keep shoppers from heading to nearby Reading and Swindon (or, more likely, the brand-tastic retail phenomenon that is Bicester Village). Yet the town thrives more because of its transport links to London than the council’s spending, however much the townspeople appreciate the sensitive upgrade. As with so many commuter towns, a reliable train service is the key to prosperity; the shops follow. Coventry has done things the right way around. It saw that its newly thriving university presented the city with an opportunity. Rather than have students based on a campus near the outskirts, it invited expansion on the city’s central square, knocking down its own worn-out buildings to make way for new university towers. Students are a shock to any town not used to them, but they bring employment and spending that generates private-sector investment, including revamped shops – saving council cash. Bradford has pinned its hopes on the new Westfield Broadway shopping centre, when the magnificent arcades in Leeds town centre are only a stone’s throw away. Other councils have borrowed vast sums to spend on ageing retail parks in the forlorn hope that they can maintain or even increase their value. Andrew Carter, from the thinktank Centre for Cities, said when the Broadway opened that shopping could not save any city, “even those cities which have a really thriving, bustling retail offer like Manchester, Leeds or London”. Retailing is not the draw that councillors believe it to be. Employment, cinemas, parks, libraries and swimming pools are a better bet. It’s these things that draw people in – and then they go to shop, says Carter. An attractive town or city needs to invite people with safe streets (those that demote cars and accommodate cycle lanes) and offer space for the things people want – cultural events, markets or new parks. This is only possible when the value of land declines, making it available for a wider range of activities. It shouldn’t need cities to be destroyed, like Detroit, for them to reinvent themselves. Yet that might be how it happens."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/05/the-guardian-view-on-john-worboys-release-verdict-on-a-system-in-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T18:56:50Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on John Worboys’ release: verdict on a system in crisis | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/the-guardian-view-on-john-worboys-release-verdict-on-a-system-in-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/the-guardian-view-on-john-worboys-release-verdict-on-a-system-in-crisis","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on John Worboys’ release: verdict on a system in crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The release of the “black cab” rapist John Worboys, a man who drugged, sexually assaulted and raped perhaps as many as 200 women is incomprehensible. It is shocking. It is one more unbelievable development in a case already marked out by historic levels of cruel incompetence. At every turn, decisions have been taken that might have been choreographed to demean his victims and diminish every woman’s faith in the system. First there was the litany of errors by the Metropolitan police investigation. The willingness to disbelieve his accusers, and to believe him was accompanied by an incompetence that rendered evidence inadmissible and left obvious connections unexamined. Dozens of women may have been assaulted or raped because the police missed chances to stop him. This disaster was compounded by the most callous disregard for his victims; an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission reported officers lying to and laughing at victims. Some of them were on a squad set up to create a safe environment for the reporting of rape. The IPCC recommended no disciplinary action. The court process equally beggars belief. The average sentence for a convicted rapist in 2009, when Worboys was sentenced at Croydon crown court, was eight years. And that was what he got. But there was nothing average about John Worboys. Posing as a trustworthy older man with all the confidence lent by being at the wheel of a London black cab, he appeared to take pity on women going home on their own late at night. Then he lied to them, and drugged them, and assaulted or raped them. By the time he was convicted, the police said almost a hundred women had made allegations against him. Yet he was charged and convicted of just one rape and 14 sexual assaults. The judge at the trial, Mr Justice Penry-Davey, sentenced Worboys to an indeterminate sentence for the protection of the public. That meant that he had to serve a minimum of eight years and then, as the judge said in court, he would be assessed by the parole board to ensure he no longer posed a threat to women. More than 180 other similar sentences were handed down that year. The attorney general could have appealed. She did not. More charges could have been brought after the initial convictions. They were not. No explanation has been given. There is just a grubby row about who took the decision. Now comes the parole board decision to release him on licence. That means that three experienced people, which included one woman, are satisfied on the basis of expert evidence that he will not be a threat to women again. Yet their reasons remain confidential, and some of the victims – who are entitled to submit a statement to the board explaining how they feel about the impending release – were not even told that parole was imminent. Rightly, the chair of the board, Nick Hardwick, has apologised to them. That is not enough. Outrage, fury, despair – these cannot bring change on their own. But they can help beat down the brambles in its path. The question now is how to reinvent a system so catastrophically flawed. Failure of process is failure of justice, whatever the charge. In December, two separate rape cases collapsed because the police had failed to disclose evidence that might have helped the defence. That was taken as licence to reignite that easy, sleazy, familiar claim: “women lie.” Some of the factors that may have played a role in this case have already changed. Indeterminate sentences, where prisoners have no idea how long they must serve beyond the set tariff, are no longer used; in a lecture in November, Professor Hardwick underlined his eagerness to release offenders who are still imprisoned because of them. Other factors may change soon: he also campaigns for greater transparency in the parole process along the lines of the Canadian model. Yet other factors seem unchangeable. The number of reported rapes has doubled, the number of convictions has not. Victims still fear being disbelieved. They still feel shame for a crime perpetrated against them. They fear being judged. They fear the degradation of a court case. John Worboys’ release tells them they are right to be afraid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/14/why-are-there-still-so-few-female-doctors","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-14T14:43:18Z","webTitle":"Why does America still have so few female doctors? | Elisabeth Poorman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/why-are-there-still-so-few-female-doctors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/14/why-are-there-still-so-few-female-doctors","fields":{"headline":"Why does America still have so few female doctors?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When my friend was in her fourth year of medical school, she and her boyfriend sat down with their dean to discuss their residency applications. They were entering a “couples’ match” where partners rank programs together in order to end up in the same city. The match is a nerve-racking and opaque process. Both have since gone on to have successful academic medicine careers, but on that day in the dean’s office, they were nervous. My friend asked the dean for reassurance. “I’m sure it will all work out,” she recalled the dean saying. “After all, in 20 years your boyfriend will be running his department and someone has to take care of your kids.” Medicine has long been a career path in the US for women in science, with women entering the field in nearly equal numbers to men for 20 years. But along the way, many women fail to advance and to earn the same recognition and salaries as their male counterparts. These differences are often framed as “individual failures”, in spite of the robust evidence of gender discrimination. Women are told to advocate for themselves, to be better negotiators, and, in private, not have children if they are going to succeed. The medical profession must confront this sexism if we are to address why women have double the rates of burnout as male colleagues, and among the highest levels of suicide in the country, at 2.5 to 4 times the rate of the general population. As a culture and a profession, medicine continues to systematically disadvantage women physicians at every stage of their careers, causing many to leave. As a result, we are losing some of our most talented doctors. When I decided as a young girl to become the first in my family to go to medical school, the road ahead was daunting, but no more intimidating because of my gender. Since 1992, women have made up at least 40% of medical school students, peaking this year at more than 50%. Back then, many ascribed to a theory of “critical mass” where women would transform a culture created by and for male physicians through numbers alone. But the top leadership positions in medicine remain predominantly male. Only 15% of department chairs are women, and 16% of medical school deans are female. For the past 10 years, according to an Association of American Medical Colleges report, women in academic medicine have received only 30% of new tenured positions. If female doctors were on even playing field with their male colleagues, we should have reached parity long ago. As Dr Julie Silver, associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told me: “Medicine should be leading the way” in gender equity. Instead, women are at a disadvantage beginning in medical school. The most important part of our education involves interacting with patients and winning their trust. If patients do not wish to talk to us because they mistrust women or minorities, this has serious consequences for our education. According to a survey by Stat News and Medscape, 41% of women in medicine reported a patient making an offensive remark about their gender, compared with 6% of men. About 1 in 5 physicians reported a patient making an offensive remark about their race. As Dr Huma Farid, a South Asian obstetrician at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, explained: “When people look at a white woman, they think she’s a nurse. When they look at me, they think I’m there to collect their tray.” We are rarely given any forum to discuss that doubt or even open bias and discrimination. Our medical educators are also affected by gender bias. Male medical students are more likely to be labeled as “quick learners” than women, and that gap actually grows through medical training Dr Vineet Arora, associate professor at the University of Chicago, says that “because we don’t talk about gender bias openly, students may not believe that it exists.” They will therefore interpret their individual failures and successes as due to their hard work and merit alone, ignorant of the ways some students are at an inherent disadvantage because of who they are. Evaluations in residency also favor men. One study found that at the beginning of the residency, women residents were rated as slightly better on average than their male peers, but by the end of training were on average 3 to 4 months behind their male counterparts. Differences in residency evaluations have real consequences for physicians’ careers. They affect their selection in competitive fellowships, research awards, and even the licensing process. Nonetheless, I am aware of no systematic effort at any institution to address bias in these evaluations and help evaluators give trainees a fair shake. Gender also plays into our ability to work with other professionals in the hospital. Dr Andrea Christopher, a physician at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Boise, Idaho, noted that in residency nurses were more likely to help her male colleagues, but did not know how to address the discrepancy. “I would put in orders, and the male residents would put in orders, and theirs would be done and mine would not,” she said. “And a senior nurse came over to me and said: ‘You just have to do your own EKG, set up your own IV, and collect urine, and eventually they’ll notice.’ I was afraid to discuss this with my superiors because I thought if I complained, it would reflect poorly on me.” Though we rarely address this prejudice head on, studies have found that in simulated cases, nurses were less likely to help women physicians with procedures, and more likely to view women physicians negatively than male physicians for the same mistakes. Of course, nurses are dealing with their own issues of gender discrimination. Nurses report rates of sexual harassment of around 70%, comparable with rates reported by female physicians. Male nurses are also paid more than female nurses for comparable work, and are more likely to be promoted. After residency, institutions continue to overlook women physicians’ accomplishments. From the portraits hanging on an institution’s walls to the names of medical societies to the number of women giving lectures, women are consistently under-represented. Pay is the clearest indication of whom institutions value. One study of academic medical centers found women physicians earn $51,315 less, on average, than their male colleagues. With adjustments for factors such as faculty rank, years in practice and graduation from a top medical school, women still earned $19,878 less. This salary gap appears to be widening. Many have asked women to become better negotiators to overcome this disparity in pay, but this discrimination is an institutional choice, and institutions have to be responsible for solving it. Dr Jen Gunter, a San Francisco based obstetrician gynecologist, left academic medicine in part because of persistent gender discrimination that she faced in her career. After years working at a Midwestern institution, she found out that her male colleagues were “making more money for doing less work.” When she spoke with administrators, they told her that the men “had families to support and she didn’t.” Later, at a different institution, she had a complicated triplet pregnancy with her children requiring medical care in the ICU. “I was the primary breadwinner,” she said in an interview, “but my children needed a mom and a doctor.” She found herself overwhelmed by her family responsibilities as she was applying for tenure, and under-supported by her institution. Though she had spent her entire career in academics and had four different board certifications (when most physicians have one), when she asked for help she was told “maybe academics are just not for you.” She found herself overwhelmed by her family responsibilities as she was applying for tenure. When she asked for help, she was told by her dean “maybe academics are just not for you.” Reproductive choices weigh heavily on women physicians, who face opaque, inflexible and generally abysmal maternity leave policies. These policies range from 12 weeks of paid leave to only 6 weeks of federally mandated partial pay for new mothers, to no separate maternity leave for trainees. Nearly one in three physician mothers reported experiencing discrimination because of pregnancy or breastfeeding. Many have trouble following the same recommendations they give to new mothers because of these policies. More open forms of sexism and sexual harassment are rampant in this profession. Many were afraid to go on the record, but a few women did agree to speak about harassment they had experienced. Dr Meredithe McNamara, a pediatrician at the University of Chicago, told me that in medical school, a surgical fellow told her to “get on your knees and suck my dick” during a surgical case when she couldn’t answer his question. She was asked to write up the incident when the rotation ended, but did not, in part because none of the other half dozen people in the room reported it. Dr Sarah Candler, an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine, told me a prominent colleague groped her during a dinner at a leadership conference. She tried to get the help of a male peer who remained oblivious. He continued to touch her bottom until she got away, and apologized the next day “if he did anything wrong.” “I didn’t even know who to report it to,” she told me. Gunter had a similar experience at a different national leadership meeting.” A few years ago, a very prominent person in academics, at a medical conference, I could not get his hands off of me,” she said. “Literally, I’m peeling his hands off of me. I asked two male colleagues for help, and they said, ‘What should we do? We can’t control him.’” Sexism can be overcome, but it must happen at an institutional level. All of these issues of discrimination, from sexual harassment to paltry maternity leave policies to salary discrepancies are an institutional choice. Leaders who make a concerted effort to combat gender discrimination can advance women, and in the process, retain the widest pool of talent in their organization Discrimination, from sexual harassment to paltry and penalising maternity leave policies to salary discrepancies are institutional decisions which institutions are responsible for changing. Female medical leaders like Silver and Dr Luanne Thorndyke at the University of Massachusetts Medical School are tackling discrimination by promoting and mentoring women and minorities. Their efforts are more effective when they are explicitly supported by their institutions. At Massachusetts Medical School, for example, women now make up 26% of the faculty, compared to 17% at Harvard Medical School. Like other professions, we need to address sexual harassment head on and not place the burden on victims to speak out. We need policies to promote and pay women and minorities so that we can continue to benefit from their talent and professional dedication. Think of the patients that we could treat, the diseases we could cure, the innovations in our dysfunctional healthcare system women could innovate if institutions stopped thwarting our talents.

On Sunday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that the real estate empire run by the family of Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting information. Separately, the Kushner real estate company has reportedly entered into business relationships with Israeli financial institutions since Jared Kushner sought to establish himself as the administration’s Middle East peace broker. According to the New York Times Kushner’s company received an investment nearing $30m from Menora Mivtachim, one of Israel’s largest insurers, in the spring of 2017, shortly before the president and his son-in-law visited the country. According to the report, the funds were directed into a Maryland development. Kushner, who has been charged with brokering peace between Israel and Palestine, has taken out at least four loans from Bank Hapoalim, Israel’s largest bank and currently under a US Department of Justice criminal investigation. A White House spokesperson denied that government ethics laws had been broken in the Menora Mivtachim deal. “We have tremendous confidence in the job Jared is doing leading our peace efforts and he takes the ethics rules very seriously and would never compromise himself or the administration.” Both developments contribute to concern that Kushner’s White House role is compromised by the family’s foreign business dealings. In August, the Journal also reported that federal prosecutors in New York were looking for information about development projects financed in part by an EB-5 program – which allows foreign investors to gain US residency by investing in the US and creating American jobs. While neither body has commented on the investigation, a spokeswoman for the Kushner company has previously confirmed that while the company has used EB-5 to fund the development, “it fully complied with its rules and regulations, and did nothing improper. We are cooperating with legal requests for information”. Last year, the Guardian reported on an event staged by the Kushner family in China to woo wealthy investors into luxury developments, including One Journal Square, two skyscrapers currently being built in New Jersey, with the prospect of receiving US green cards in return. Almost 85% of EB-5 allocations come from China – the program has ballooned in recent years as the wealth of China’s middle class has grown. In 2005 just 350 visas were granted under EB-5; by 2015 the number was 9,500, according to figures cited by the FBI. Members of the audience at the Kushner Cos presentation were reportedly told that if they stumped up at least half a million dollars for the project they could become US residents under a controversial cash-for-residency program that is known in China as the “golden visa”. The Kushner company later issued an apology on behalf of Nicole Kushner Meyer, Jared Kushner’s sister, for using her brother’s name during her pitch for more than $150m from wealthy Chinese for the New Jersey real estate project now believed to be the focus of the SEC inquiry. “In the course of discussing this project and the firm’s history with potential investors, Ms Meyer wanted to make clear that her brother had stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project,” the firm said. “Kushner Companies apologizes if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. That was not Ms Meyer’s intention.” Under the terms of EB-5, which was developed and authorized by Congress to fund developments in economically disadvantaged regions, green cards are offered to aspiring immigrants who invest at least $500,000 in certain US businesses determined to be capable of creating at least 10 jobs per investor. But the program has been coming under increased scrutiny and often described as open to abuse. In April, the FBI conducted raids in the San Gabriel Valley in California on the California Investment Immigration Fund, a business allegedly connected to EB-5 abuses. The number of applicants vying for the annual allotment of 10,667 visas roughly doubles year-on-year. The program’s popularity comes despite warnings that it has grown far beyond its intended use. A paper submitted by Texas lawyer Shae Armstrong to the Center for Immigration Studies alleged that secret commissions paid from US projects to Chinese state-run EB-5 agents may violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. According to Armstrong, EB-5 abuses are not confined to individual investor abuse but now include entities under foreign-government control. Confirmation that the SEC is looking into Kushner’s New Jersey development comes as federal prosecutors have requested documents from the company pertaining to a $285m loan the firm received from Deutsche Bank. Last March, the company was forced to abandon a project with Chinese insurance giant Anbang to convert its 666 Fifth Avenue flagship building into luxury residential units using EB-5 financing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/07/mesmerised-by-the-mole-that-dug-up-my-garden","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T19:15:47Z","webTitle":"Mesmerised by the mole that dug up my garden | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/07/mesmerised-by-the-mole-that-dug-up-my-garden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/07/mesmerised-by-the-mole-that-dug-up-my-garden","fields":{"headline":"Mesmerised by the mole that dug up my garden","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"We had a mole a few years ago that made 17 molehills on our back lawn in as many days (Country diary, 4 January).

The publication of the list, which also includes a well-known Jewish anti-occupation group and a Nobel peace prize-winning US Quaker group, had been threatened for months by Israel. The organisations were singled out by Israel’s rightwing strategic affairs and public security minister, Gilad Erdan, for advocating boycotts of Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. Erdan said on Sunday that the groups “operate consistently and continuously” against Israel using a “campaign of incitement and lies”. Human rights groups condemned the move as an assault on free speech. A number of individuals have been refused entry into Israel in recent months, including a prominent African theologian and official of the World Council of Churches. While most of the organisations listed by Erdan are local branches of the BDS movement around the world, others include Jewish Voice for Peace, which has 13,000 members, the US group Code Pink and the American Friends Service Committee, which won the peace prize in 1947. As well as War on Want, the list names a second British group, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, of which Jeremy Corbyn is a patron. Erdan said Israel had “shifted from defence to offence” with the publication of the list. “The boycott organisations need to know that the state of Israel will act against them and not allow [them] to enter its territory to harm its citizens,” he said. “No country would have allowed critics coming to harm the country to enter it.” The interior minister, Arye Dery, whose ministry is responsible for barring those listed, said: “These people are trying to exploit the law and our hospitality to act against Israel and to defame the country. I will act against this by every means.” The travel ban is the latest in a series of populist moves by the Israeli government, the most rightwing coalition in the country’s history. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he intends to remove 40,000 African migrants from Israel and expressed support for making it easier to carry out the death sentence on people convicted of terrorism. Rebecca Vilkomerson, the executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, criticised the publication of the list, saying it was “disconcerting but not surprising given the further erosion of democratic norms and rising anxiety about the power of BDS as a tool to demand freedom.” She wrote on Facebook: “As someone with considerable family in Israel, this policy will be a personal hardship. But I am also heartened by this indicator of the BDS movement’s growing strength, and hope that it will bring the day closer when just as I go to visit my friends and family in Israel, so will Palestinian friends and colleagues be able to return home.” Hassan Jabareen, of the Legal Centre for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, said the travel ban was draconian and arbitrary. “This ban is an overt violation of the constitutional rights of Israeli citizens and the rights guaranteed to Palestinian residents of the OPT [Occupied Palestinian Territories] under international humanitarian and human rights law. This move is reminiscent of South Africa’s apartheid regime which also prepared blacklists in order to punish people and prevent the entry of those opposed to its racist policies.” In November Israel denied entry to a US employee of Amnesty International as part of its anti-boycott offensive under the same rules. Amnesty is not on the list of 20 groups published on Sunday. • This article was amended on 10 and 12 January 2018 to correct a reference to the death penalty, and to amend the picture caption which contained a mistranslation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/07/shrewsbury-town-west-ham-united-fa-cup-third-round-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T16:20:31Z","webTitle":"Shrewsbury take insipid West Ham to replay on Joe Hart’s return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/07/shrewsbury-town-west-ham-united-fa-cup-third-round-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/07/shrewsbury-town-west-ham-united-fa-cup-third-round-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Shrewsbury take insipid West Ham to replay on Joe Hart’s return","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"West Ham United will not relish a replay against Shrewsbury Town, and not only because of the imposition on their schedule. The League One side proved vexing opponents for the Premier League strugglers, who never looked superior to Paul Hurst’s team. Quite the contrary. “Shrewsbury were better so we’re fortunate to still be in the Cup,” said David Moyes, who did not try to dress up a performance devoid of class and even of more basic traits. “I don’t think we showed any quality,” he said. “The bigger thing and more disappointing thing for me was we didn’t show enough steel. “When you come to these places you have to show you’re up to it physically and you can battle and compete, but that was probably for me the worst thing about it. It’s a mentality thing – you’ve got to show that whatever players you’re up against you’ve got to recognise it’s going to be tough whether it be Tottenham or Shrewsbury. For the first half especially, we didn’t compete at all.” Joe Hart, the only goalkeeper required to make any saves here, agreed Shrewsbury were superior. The England goalkeeper had hoped to make a triumphant return to the town of his birth and the club where he started his career, but a clean sheet was the extent of his success. It seemed symptomatic of West Ham’s slipshod approach that Hart arrived without appropriate headwear to shield his eyes from the low-hanging sun and found himself having to don a cap thrown to him by one of the travelling fans. “I think the fans could see I was impeded and someone threw one on and I was very grateful for that,” he said before revealing that naff banter was partly to blame. “We have one [cap] in the kit but Aaron Cresswell’s hair is that bad that apparently after the last game he took it and he is rocking the Umbro cap. I would have taken a hat, sunglasses and all sorts, I couldn’t see a thing.” Hart is perhaps Shrewsbury’s most famous son after Charles Darwin and a theory quickly evolved here that if this clash was to be about the survival of the fittest then the underdogs would prevail. Shrewsbury were by far the more vigorous side. This was, in fairness, West Ham’s third match in six days and Moyes redeployed seven of the players who drew with Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday, the only non-regulars being Reece Burke and Josh Cullen, a pair of 21-year-olds recently returned from loans at Bolton Wanderers. Moyes later said Cullen was West Ham’s best player on the day, but the Irishman was not around to hear that as he had already left for hospital to see whether the two teeth that he lost in a second-half collision could be reinserted. Cullen aside, most of Moyes’s troops looked reluctant to meet the challenge laid down by Shrewsbury. After Cheikh Kouyaté failed to get a telling touch to a dangerous cross by Cullen in the ninth minute, any whiff of a breakthrough by the away team vanished. Javier Hernández, West Ham’s lone striker, got only a few more touches than anyone in the 9,535-strong crowd before being substituted in the second half. Hurst’s men were not only more committed and compact, they also showed themselves to be nimble passers and movers. And they forced Hart, at least, into earnest action. The keeper’s first save, admittedly, was more straightforward than it might have been, the goalkeeper needing only to fall on the ball to snaffle a scuffed effort by Ben Godfrey after West Ham failed to deal with a free-kick by Shaun Whalley. Mat Sadler’s shot in the 35th minute packed more power and demanded a solid save from Hart, who had to repeat it moments later when Alex Rodman let fly from a similar position at the left-hand corner of the West Ham box. The Premier League team managed to secure slightly more possession in the second half but it would be going too far to suggest they enjoyed it. Shrewsbury looked to be their equals, at least, and for that caps must be doffed to Hurst and his team. Jon Nolan, the most elegant performer on the day, nearly crowned the hosts’ display by nicking a winning goal near the end, but he was unable to keep his shot down from eight yards out. Hurst agreed that Shrewsbury were the better side but rued the fact that they did not produce their best. “I’ve seen us to do better,” he said. “We’ve had tougher games and that’s why I thought the game was there to be won. “I don’t mean that being disrespectful to West Ham but I really felt the game was there to be won. But we can’t be too disappointed. I’m sure the chairman will be happy, he spoke about a replay a while ago and has got his wish.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jan/07/theresa-may-urged-to-drop-auditors-kpmg-from-grenfell-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T18:35:11Z","webTitle":"Theresa May urged to drop auditors KPMG from Grenfell inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/07/theresa-may-urged-to-drop-auditors-kpmg-from-grenfell-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jan/07/theresa-may-urged-to-drop-auditors-kpmg-from-grenfell-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May urged to drop auditors KPMG from Grenfell inquiry","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Seventy-one academics, writers and campaigning organisations, as well as two Labour MPs, Clive Lewis and Emma Dent-Coad, have sent an open letter to the prime minister calling on her to cancel the appointment of auditors KPMG to assist with the Grenfell Tower inquiry. They said that KPMG has a clear conflict of interest and should not be in this role, and that if the prime minister wants the public inquiry to have the confidence of the local community this is not the way to do it. They said that KPMG audits Celotex, the parent company that produced the insulation on the building, alongside its role as auditor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), and Rydon Group, the contractor that refurbished Grenfell Tower. The signatories include academics from LSE, Leeds and Lancaster universities, Green party politicians, writers, activists and the singer and actor Lily Allen. They argue that there are serious concerns about KPMG and its ability to define and serve the public interest and that these concerns make KPMG unsuitable to advise the Grenfell inquiry. KPMG’s reputation has already been affected by the failed HBOS and Cooperative Bank audits in the UK, as well as its flawed auditing of overseas banks including Wachovia, New Century Financial, Wells Fargo, Countrywide and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (for which it has paid out millions of dollars in fines and settlements). The government’s Grenfell Tower inquiry is already facing criticism from survivors of the fire and other victims for a lack of inclusivity and diversity, and a failure to consider the consequences of decades of deregulation. The letter stated: “Government must recognise that appointing advisors so closely associated with firms under inquiry can only further fuel rumours of a deliberate cover-up and erode public trust. “The big four accounting firms actively lobbied the Conservative party in the lead-up to the 2010 general election to close the Audit Commission, which audited and investigated public bodies such as the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation.” It added: “The Audit Commission was shut by Government in April 2015, leaving an accountability vacuum in local government audit and fraud investigation, into which cases like Grenfell ultimately fall. “We question why the Cabinet Office only chose to announce the appointment of KPMG to the controversial Grenfell advisory role in December, when the decision was made in August? “It is entirely inappropriate to reward RBKC auditors KPMG with Grenfell Tower inquiry work and we urge Government to reverse the decision and to cancel the KPMG contract. “How does the Government’s covert appointment of KPMG as Grenfell advisor chime with public statements about the need to repair trust with the Grenfell Tower Community?” A KPMG spokesman told the FT it has “policies and procedures in place to identify and manage any potential conflicts of interest when taking on new work”. “We are satisfied that no conflicts exist in this case, given the nature and scope of our work for each client,” said a spokesperson for the firm. A spokeswoman for the Grenfell inquiry team said: “KPMG has provided the inquiry with limited planning and programme management support during its start-up phase in order to help the inquiry make rapid progress in its work. KPMG has had no role in the inquiry’s investigations or decision-making processes and its contract contains strict confidentiality clauses to ensure there can be no conflicts of interest. However, the inquiry has asked KPMG to provide further assurance about any relationships with organisations linked to the inquiry’s work.” Joel Benjamin, a researcher and campaigner at Research for Action, said: “I was shocked to learn KPMG had been appointed by Government, uncontested, to advise the Grenfell inquiry, given known and previously undisclosed conflicts of interest. We do not claim to speak for, or on behalf of Grenfell Tower victims, but are deeply concerned about the obvious conflict posed by KPMG’s involvement with the Grenfell inquiry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/07/nikki-haley-trump-kim-nuclear-button-tweet-toes","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T20:14:44Z","webTitle":"Nikki Haley: Trump aimed to 'keep Kim on his toes' with 'nuclear button' tweet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/07/nikki-haley-trump-kim-nuclear-button-tweet-toes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/07/nikki-haley-trump-kim-nuclear-button-tweet-toes","fields":{"headline":"Nikki Haley: Trump aimed to 'keep Kim on his toes' with 'nuclear button' tweet","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s tweet taunting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un over the size of his “nuclear button” was meant to “keep Kim on his toes”, the US ambassador to the United Nations said on Sunday. Rare progress has recently been made over the Korean standoff, with North and South agreeing to begin their first talks for two years on Tuesday in the South Korean side of the village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone. The forthcoming Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang will dominate the agenda but officials have indicated other issues may also be discussed. Trump, however, showed a characteristic disregard for diplomatic niceties when he wrote on Tuesday: “North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times’. “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” The tweet was written the day before the Guardian published extracts of a book in which White House staffers question the president’s mental capacity for his job, setting off a political firestorm. In an opinion piece for the Guardian on Sunday, Bandy Lee, an assistant clinical professor at the Yale School of Medicine who has briefed members of Congress on the risks associated with the president’s behaviour, wrote: “Trump views violence as a solution when he is stressed and desires to re-establish his power. “Paranoia and overwhelming feelings of weakness and inadequacy make violence very attractive, and powerful weapons very tempting to use – all the more so for their power. “His contest with the North Korean leader about the size of their nuclear buttons is an example of that and points to the possibility of great danger by virtue of the power of his position.” Asked on ABC’s This Week if Trump’s tweet was a good idea at a time of high tension between the US and Pyongyang, Haley said: “I think [Trump] always has to keep Kim on his toes. It’s very important that we don’t ever let [Kim] get so arrogant that he doesn’t realise the reality of what would happen if he started a nuclear war.” Host George Stephanopoulos countered that even senior Senate Republicans Corey Gardner and John Cornyn said Trump’s tweet was reckless. “You know, everyone’s going to have their opinion,” Haley said. “What I can tell you is I’m dealing with the diplomats on the ground, I’m dealing with all the actors in this situation. “It is a serious situation and [Kim] can’t sit there and imply that he’s going to destroy the United States without us reminding him of the facts and the reality that if you go there, it’s not us that’s going to be destroyed, it’s you.” The CIA director, Mike Pompeo, also defended Trump, telling CBS’s Face the Nation the tweet was “consistent with US policy”, which seeks the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Pompeo also said he believed North Korea was months away from being able to put a US city at risk of nuclear attack. He declined to be more precise. Trump has regularly taunted Kim on social media and in speeches with the name “Rocket Man” or “Little Rocket Man”. He has also consistently implied that only military action will work. In August, he said threats from Pyongyang would “be met with fire and the fury like the world has never seen”, a statement that gave Michael Wolff’s book its title. In October, the president said talking to the North Koreans would be a “waste of time” for his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. On Saturday, though, Trump told a press conference at Camp David he would be open to phone talks with Kim. “There is no turnaround,” Haley told ABC. ‘What [Trump] has basically said is ‘Yes, there could be a time when we talk to North Korea but a lot of things have to happen before that actually takes place. They have to be willing to talk about banning their nuclear weapons.’” That would mean Pyongyang suspending its tests of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, an unlikely step. At Camp David, Trump also appeared to take credit for the scheduled talks between North and South. The president said: “A lot of people have said and a lot of people have written that without my rhetoric and without my tough stance – and it’s not just a stance, I mean this is what has to be done – that they wouldn’t be talking about Olympics, they wouldn’t be talking right now.” Haley said it was not her “understanding” North and South Korea would “talk about anything further” than the Olympics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/media-blog/2018/jan/07/what-rupert-murdoch-thinks-donald-trump-fire-fury-michael-wolff","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-07T15:43:20Z","webTitle":"Never mind what Rupert Murdoch really thinks about Donald Trump | Jane Martinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2018/jan/07/what-rupert-murdoch-thinks-donald-trump-fire-fury-michael-wolff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/media-blog/2018/jan/07/what-rupert-murdoch-thinks-donald-trump-fire-fury-michael-wolff","fields":{"headline":"Never mind what Rupert Murdoch really thinks about Donald Trump","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There are many reasons to want to go back to early 2016 – not least the fact that Rupert Murdoch was still tweeting his views of the world rather than leaving it to the minions in his global media empire. In these intervening bleak years, Twitter has been enlivened by the almost constant posts of a man Murdoch has called “my friend, Donald J Trump”. In power, Trump has favoured Murdoch’s media outlets, granting interviews to his Fox News TV channel and his first post-election foreign newspaper interview to the Times. But now, thanks to Fire and Fury, the explosive new book on the Trump White House by Michael Wolff, we know a bit more about what Murdoch really thinks of his fellow billionaire. After a call in which they discussed immigration and Silicon Valley, Murdoch is reported to have put the phone down on Trump and said: “What a fucking idiot.” I defy anyone to read Wolff’s account of that conversation (Wolff has previously written a biography of Murdoch) without thinking that somehow an Alec Baldwin sketch from Saturday Night Live had snuck into the author’s interview notes. After Murdoch asks how Trump’s meeting with Silicon Valley executives went, Trump drawls: “Oh, great, just great. These guys really need my help. Obama was not very favourable to them, too much regulation.” You can almost hear the splutter as the president praises Murdoch’s corporate enemies before going on to try to explain how he could approve visas for tech executives but ban them for everyone else. But this section runs counter to most of the book, which shows that, at 86 and after four decades in the US, Murdoch has the sort of access to the White House he has long enjoyed in Downing Street. There are the frequent, often daily, calls and advice. In a line hard to dislodge from the mind, Roger Ailes, the late Fox News chief, says: “Trump would jump through hoops for Rupert. Like for Putin. Sucks up and shits down. I just worry about who’s jerking whose chain.” Suggestions that Trump’s admiration for Murdoch wasn’t entirely reciprocated date from before Trump’s selection as the Republican nominee for president. In July 2015 after Trump had questioned John McCain’s war heroics, Murdoch tweeted that he should stop “embarrassing his friends, let alone the whole country”. A memo from Murdoch’s sons saying 21st Century Fox was “founded by – and comprising at all levels of the business – immigrants” was seen as criticism of the president’s plan to ban travellers from Muslim countries. However, Murdoch’s US papers, particularly the Wall Street Journal, have been solidly pro-Trump. Meanwhile, the president lent his support for the proposed Disney-Fox merger, calling it good for jobs, while threatening to block a merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. The men have a long history and Murdoch’s relationship with Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, is close enough to have led to Ivanka being appointed trustee of a fund for Murdoch’s youngest children. This episode proves once again that Murdoch never lets his personal feelings get in the way of good business. Facebook’s dictatorial policies Questions about deals between political leaders and the Murdoch media empire have been around for decades. But in recent weeks attention has also been focused on deals between Facebook and the state. In the latest case, Facebook deleted the accounts of Chechnya’s leader, Ramzan Kadyrov. Although Kadyrov is on the US sanctions list, having been accused of extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses, so are lots of despots, including Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. Yet the latter’s grinning face still beams out from his Facebook page, as does that of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, who was hit with sanctions by the US treasury department last summer. Asked why different rules applied, Facebook told the New York Times it had a “legal obligation” to disable Kadyrov’s accounts. But there is no public record to explain the definition. A lack of transparency has bedevilled old media, but it seems true that the more things change, the more they stay the same. It’s time for social media to grow up It was no surprise to read the warnings about the possible impact of social media on young children’s mental health from the children’s commissioner last week. Researchers heard from eight- to 12-year-olds who worried about losing friends if they didn’t respond quickly enough to “streak” messages on Snapchat, which would end the “streak”. Many children said they felt ugly compared with the people they followed on Instagram. The problem is what to do about it. Like most social media, WhatsApp has a minimum age of 13. Yet my 10-year-old daughter wants it, and her friends and many other children her age already use it. I could ban her from social media. But in the real world who would do that? Holding out until Christmas to buy her a phone like “everyone else” in year 6 was hard enough. The 2017 Ofcom report found that 28% of 10-year-olds and three-quarters of 12- to 15-year-olds have a social media profile. The children’s commissioner concluded last week that while parents play a role, so do the social media companies. After all, they made the apps as addictive as possible without any regard to the possible impact on children. In recent months we have heard Facebook’s founding president, Sean Parker, admit he was worried about the impact of technology designed to create addicts. Even Justin Rosenstein, the engineer who created the Facebook “like”, is so worried about his own desire to constantly check his status updates that he got his assistant to set up parental controls on his phone. Social media groups can do something: one click doesn’t have to lead to constant YouTube videos, for example, while there should be the equivalent of a social media out-of-office. The government has been asked to make both media and digital literacy compulsory in schools so pupils will learn about not just stranger danger online but also what fake news is and how to resist the siren call of the like button. The children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, wants to see the introduction of compulsory digital literacy and online resilience lessons for pupils in year 6 and 7, and the government should listen. The technology industry would argue that education and self-regulation is the answer, and there is some truth to that. The criticism Logan Paul received from his own fanbase, as well as elsewhere, for posting a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim led the millionaire YouTuber to apologise. Yet change has to happen, and fast. At eight years old, WhatsApp is younger than my daughter. Its owner, Facebook, is a teenage parent at 14. Social media has been one of the most exhilarating, transformative tools invented, but, in dealing with the consequences of its use, all of us need to grow up a bit faster. As kids are having to."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-windsors-homelessness-a-parable-of-modern-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T19:21:16Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Windsor’s homelessness: a parable of modern Britain | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-windsors-homelessness-a-parable-of-modern-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-windsors-homelessness-a-parable-of-modern-britain","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Windsor’s homelessness: a parable of modern Britain","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Forcibly removing rough sleepers from the streets is one way to maintain an illusion of affluence, but not one that politicians with a conscience should countenance. That such a device looks cruel is obvious even to one who advocates it: Simon Dudley, the Conservative leader of Windsor and Maidenhead borough council, describes homelessness as “completely unacceptable in a caring, compassionate community” in a letter to Thames Valley police, while urging action to remove the evidence from public view. Mr Dudley focuses his displeasure on a sub-category of the homeless whom he accuses of “aggressive begging and intimidation” and whose plight he sees as “a voluntary choice”. This distinction between deserving and undeserving poor is as old as it is bogus. It is probably true that some of Windsor’s homeless offend the council leader’s sense of propriety and make choices other than the ones he would recommend. But genuine compassion reaches beyond such narrow parameters. It is also true that extreme poverty changes the character of a town that attracts millions of tourists and will be a focus of international attention when Prince Harry marries Meghan Markle in Windsor Castle in May. A local politician’s interest in removing social decay from the scene is obvious. It needn’t even be a despicable ambition if the royal wedding were set as the deadline for genuine action to address destitute people’s needs with resources allocated accordingly. But that would indicate different priorities, a different moral outlook. It would require seeing homelessness as a source of collective national shame and not a quasi-criminal act best referred to the police. This obtuseness reaches the top of the Tory party. Theresa May has said she disagrees with Mr Dudley’s approach but she shows no willingness to accept that, under her government, homelessness is becoming an emergency. In one prime minister’s questions session last month, Mrs May asserted that “statutory homelessness peaked under the Labour government and is down by 50% since then”. The statistical lens deployed there was so warped as to present a reversal of reality. The peak that Mrs May described was in 2003, reflecting the persistence of a problem that had become entrenched under the Tory government that lost office in 1997. Labour got to grips with the issue and numbers fell until 2010, when Downing Street was recaptured by the Conservatives. Progress then went into reverse. Government statistics put the number of homeless households in the third quarter of 2017 at 15,290 (up from 14,930 at the equivalent point in 2016). But the “statutory” definition is narrow and misleading, covering those getting help from local authorities. Many who sleep rough or drift in and out of precarious private accommodation fall below statistical radars. And the evidence of an acute problem is visible to anyone with their eyes open to it. Homelessness, the big failure caused by a series of lesser ones, is often the visible symbol of social policy under stress. The Tories can only obfuscate for so long before majority opinion recoils in horror at a government that treats abject destitution as a tolerable side-effect of its economic policies. Mrs May is on this trajectory. She might reject the terms used by the leader of Windsor council, but she seems to share his instinct for seeing extreme poverty more as a source of political embarrassment than a spur to action. Her dodgy statistics are a subtler device than police intervention, but both testify to the false belief that a social calamity can simply be swept aside."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/04/sam-allardyce-everton-liverpool-fa-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T22:30:07Z","webTitle":"Sam Allardyce will play his strongest Everton team at Liverpool in FA Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/04/sam-allardyce-everton-liverpool-fa-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/04/sam-allardyce-everton-liverpool-fa-cup","fields":{"headline":"Sam Allardyce will play his strongest Everton team at Liverpool in FA Cup","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Sam Allardyce has said he will field Everton’s strongest side at Liverpool on Friday night despite not knowing what his best team is after nine games in charge. The Everton manager has often rested players in the FA Cup third round but having been drawn against his new club’s fiercest rivals this season, accepts that is not an option for his second visit to Anfield inside four weeks. The defender Michael Keane is expected to miss out with a foot injury suffered against Manchester United on Monday but Cenk Tosun could feature, albeit only from the bench, should he complete a proposed £27m move from Besiktas in time. “You can’t not go with your strongest side to Anfield,” said Allardyce, who has suffered back-to-back defeats against United and Bournemouth in the run-up to the 230th Merseyside derby. “We’ve had a few days’ rest and are getting ready to give it our all before getting back to the Premier League the following weekend. “We want to pick the best team we can to compete against Liverpool but I can’t honestly tell you what my best team is just yet. Sometimes its looked like it but in other games it hasn’t looked quite right. There have been one or two glitches in the last few games that I didn’t expect and I need to iron out. We will pick the strongest team from what is available to me and give it our best shot.” Everton’s ultra-defensive approach to the recent Premier League draw at Anfield was roundly criticised, not least by his Liverpool counterpart, Jürgen Klopp, and Allardyce admits improvement will be necessary to achieve a first win across Stanley Park since 1999. He added: “While I was delighted we got a point at Anfield last time I wasn’t happy about the number of times we wasted our possession. The players have to deal with the possession they get much better on Friday to get more chances to get to the next round.” Everton have until noon on Friday to register Tosun for the FA Cup tie. A fee rising to £27m has been agreed for the Turkey forward, who has still to complete a medical and finalise a four-and-a-half-year contract at Goodison Park. Allardyce said: “There is going to be a massive pressure on him if we do clinch the signing that he is successful straight away, which I’m cautious about. But we can’t have researched any more and can’t have looked at the qualities of the player more, not just from a talent and goalscoring point of view but from the mentality side too. “He’s a bit of an all-rounder. He has got some good movement, he’s two-footed, he’s not the biggest but he’s efficient in the air in the box. We will try to break him in gently but I don’t think you break anyone in gently in January transfer windows. It is more a case of sleeves rolled up and get on with it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/04/latte-result-is-an-early-win-in-cup-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T19:23:28Z","webTitle":"Latte result is an early win in cup campaign | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/04/latte-result-is-an-early-win-in-cup-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/04/latte-result-is-an-early-win-in-cup-campaign","fields":{"headline":"Latte result is an early win in cup campaign","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rafael Behr (On second thoughts, 3 January) says “Jeremy Corbyn’s supporters correctly understood that his candidacy represented a total rupture from the party’s past”.

In the Britain he grew up in, that used to mean the male retirement age. Bring it on, many will say. But these once-immovable milestones no longer exist. They certainly do not apply to the former prime minister. For Blair has made it crystal clear in his new year intervention on Brexit that he has absolutely no intention of quitting the public stage any time soon. This of course appals many people for serious reasons that do not need to be re-rehearsed here. Even those who continue to think well of him have their doubts. Blair is a permanently damaged figure. Whenever he enters the public arena, he always risks making himself, not what he says, into the issue – John Humphrys’ self-important aggression against Blair on the Today programme on Thursday showed this process at its most depressing. But there are three serious reasons why the rest of us should make the effort to focus on what he says, rather than on him. The first of these is that Blair articulates the case against Theresa May’s Brexit strategy more clearly and more devastatingly than anyone else in British public life. If that is anyone’s fault, it is not Blair’s. He is putting into words things that no one else is managing to do so well, so succinctly or with such urgency. If Jeremy Corbyn made the same case – which is backed by an overwhelming majority of Labour party members, research has showed – things would be very different. But he isn’t. If only the TUC’s Frances O’Grady could be persuaded to take up the mantle of spearheading the opposition to Brexit, many things would be possible. Please read Blair’s new article on Brexit nevertheless. His arguments are a wake-up call for the political year. As Blair says, 2018 is when real decisions must be made – about the terms, about soft or hard Brexit, and about a referendum on the final deal. The pivotal decision about Ireland – on which so much else hinges – has merely been postponed. The four options that Blair sets out for Britain – remain and reform, leave but stay in the single market and customs union, exit all structures but make a bespoke deal, and make a virtue of leaving – are the only choices facing Britain. Twelve months from now, Britain will have embarked on one of them. This matters, massively. Blair accepts that securing continued EU membership involves a task of persuasion and good timing. Gordon Brown said much the same a few weeks ago. But the trigger for this particular article is his frustration with the Labour party for its caution and equivocation on Brexit. Though Blair does not mention Corbyn by name, he is explicitly critical of Labour for having its own cake-and-eat-it strategy. The final few paragraphs in particular read like a primer from Blair to Corbyn on how to move beyond that. As so often, Blair can give the impression that a highly ambitious political goal is achievable by an effort of will, his own leadership skills and by well-honed political messaging. This over-optimism has always been one of his faults. Read his article closely, however, and it is actually more equivocal about the options than it may appear. Blair keeps his views open on a second referendum. And he comes close to saying that the ultimate test of policy is about single-market membership – in other words a soft Brexit rather than no Brexit at all. This puts him quite close to the current stance of Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. There is a second reason why the new year is a good moment to be more open to what Blair and those like him are saying. Britain faces several domestic political crises at the start of 2018, all of them made worse by Brexit. Labour is within sight of winning power, but still some way off. Its chances will depend in significant part on how it behaves as a party between now and what may be a distant election, and upon its ability to persuade those who were unpersuaded in June 2017. That means a clear programme, credibility and party unity are paramount. This in turn means showing that Labour can be a tolerant coalition of traditions and ideas. There is much more to this than bringing a wider group of talent into the shadow cabinet. Labour needs to prove, from top to bottom, that its left respects its right and that its right respects its left. That wasn’t so in much of Blair’s time – with eventual dire consequences – and at times there is not much evidence of it in Corbyn’s either. But the current armistice is better than a civil war. The longer it holds, the better. To say this is not to ask the Labour left to embrace Blair or everything he says. But it is to suggest that the left acknowledges that the soft left (to use a pre-Blair term) and the Labour right are legitimate alternative traditions within the Labour coalition, which have achievements and principles to contribute. Likewise, it is to suggest that any Blairites who simply dismiss the achievements, principles and, at times, heroism of the left are making the equal and opposite error. As the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik puts it in a review of John Bew’s biography of Clem Attlee this week, it is possible to hold to moral absolutes while at the same time displaying a prolific appetite for conciliation. This leads to the third reason why Labour supporters should make a New Year resolution to allow a place for Blair’s ideas to be heard. For 15 years, Blair has provided an excuse for some in the Labour party – on the right as much as the left – not to think about the large and difficult questions that face 21st-century Britain, and which would face any Labour government of whatever ideological stripe. Blair and accusations of Blairism have been cynically and very successfully exploited to advance the left’s cause. I’m not saying that aspects of Blair’s career and the approach of some Blairites did not provoke some of this. They did. There were big New Labour mistakes. But it is time to move on. Labour needs, in another Gopnik phrase about Attlee, to be “radicals of the real”. No issue is more real and more pressing than Brexit. It is time for Labour to stop refighting ancient wars and focus ecumenically on the radical and real task in hand. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2018/jan/04/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-04T21:00:05Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/04/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jan/04/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• An opinion piece referred to the population of Yorkshire as being nearly double that of Northern Ireland.

Lovely. It is rare that I actually switch off Today, but I’ve had two weeks of the kids bickering and, to be honest, any more “so you mean this/ no I never/ but you said you did”, and I’ll be reaching for the bleach. It’s hard to stay interested in the news when compromise is seen as lily-livered. Also when everyone on there is such a plum. Still, there’s news and there’s news, isn’t there? Radio 4’s PM understands this. Its longstanding feature, Your News, has listeners send in a single sentence of their own personal news, and then gets a famous person to read a few out. Sometimes those single sentences develop into bigger stories, for the excellent weekly iPM podcast. I meant to mention iPM before Christmas for its wonderful mid-December episode on deathbed promises but, well, I forgot. However, over the break I went on a huge iPM binge, and God, it was great. There are several episodes worth checking, such as the two about sexual assault, or the short series about kids and drugs, but two of the most fascinating are also the most recent: After the Affair, the Wife and After The Affair, the Husband. Here’s the backstory. Around 18 months ago a listener wrote into Your News with the sentence: “I found out this year that my husband has been having an affair for three years; I’m diminished, on the floor, I still love you, husband.” iPM followed this up and, over Christmas 2016, broadcast a compelling Eddie Mair interview with the wronged wife, followed by an equally gripping Manveen Rana interview with the woman’s husband. (iPM has provided a catch-up episode.) Now, a year later, the wife and husband, who are still together, have been interviewed separately again, and the new interviews are even more absorbing than the first. The break caused by the affair was real and, though it’s healing, it seems to be setting a bit wonky. Both wife and husband are looking to the future, but things are not what they were… Their voices rattle around your brain long after you stop listening. New Year, New You? Hardly, but perhaps you’re embarking on a new fitness regime. There are plenty of podcasts to help you with your admirable aims, and Audible’s Mo-Joe is one. Presenter George Lamb has committed to running a marathon in April, and Mo-Joe is the weekly podcast that follows his progress. He has two major assets to help him: Sir Mo Farah, who’s his running coach; and healthy YouTuber Joe Wicks, who’s sorting out Lamb’s exercise regime and nutrition. Farah only pops up briefly each week, to give Lamb his thrice-weekly run regime. Wicks is more of a presence, though as he admits he messed up his own marathon attempt, finishing “behind a man dressed as a pair of testicles”, having knackered his hip, I’m not sure that he’s quite the expert for the job. Still, his recipes sound nice. Each episode also features Lamb meeting relevant people such as a New Balance shoe expert, or Dame Kelly Holmes. I like Lamb as a presenter – he’s funny and engaging – but I wonder how long this podcast can sustain interest. I suppose if you listened every week while out for your own run it might make sense, but otherwise it may well go the way of all New Year resolutions. Finally, just room for a surprisingly fab gaming podcast. The Retro Hour comes from three Nottingham gaming enthusiasts, Dan Wood, Ravi Abbott and Joe Fox, who – this is the surprise – understand how to make podcasts interesting and engaging. They can interview too, as their recent chat with Atari founder Nolan Bushnell shows. There are more than 100 episodes to choose from, and I’ve enjoyed every one I’ve heard. Which is a lot, coming from someone whose gaming chops never progressed past Pac-Man."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/05/virgin-trains-misogynist-disdain-scorn-twitter-account","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"Virgin Trains treated me with misogynist disdain.

Sadly, it’s hardly unusual","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s rather disconcerting to find yourself at the centre of a Twitter storm – especially for someone who barely uses Twitter, let alone corresponds with the media. But that’s what happened to me after I complained about a train attendant calling me “honey” in a patronising, demeaning manner, only to find the insult compounded by a sexist response from the Virgin Trains Twitter account. Let’s get one thing out of the way to begin with. The manager was Scottish, as am I, and I understand the difference between “honey” as a friendly term of endearment and a word used to put women in their place. The other passengers on board who heard were also clear about that – and I certainly would never have tweeted about it had I doubted my own feelings on this. There’s nothing wrong with honey/sweetie/pet as a general rule, but when they’re used in such a demeaning manner it’s not OK. It’s intimidating and misogynistic. Respect – being seen to be of worth, to not feel belittled, patronised or put down – is what we all want. It’s what led to my complaint, and it’s also at the root of the complaints that many men are sending my way. Such messages have been filled with obscenities and accusations, as well as others (from men and women) simply objecting to a “snowflake generation” and “PC crap”. Just as I and many other women felt patronised by the Virgin social media team’s response, my sense is that the attendant I spoke to originally felt the same way. I think he reacted with anger, albeit passive, to my wanting to complain about an unrelated service issue because he felt disrespected – he received my complaint as an attempt to undermine his authority. Words are powerful; they are not merely passive vehicles through which information is conveyed. In adding “honey” to the end of his retort, he asserted his dominance as a man and my inferiority as a woman. Similarly, the intended action hidden in the social media team’s response in suggesting “pet” and “love” as an alternative to “honey” was to belittle – to put me, a woman who dares to call out misogyny – back in my place. And have a good laugh while doing so. This is nothing new. And that’s the crux: this is a society-wide issue, not one of individual wrongdoing. Of course, the attendant shouldn’t be demonised and neither should the person who posted the insulting tweet that followed. They should be supported by the company that employs them – both emotionally in what is probably a difficult time given the public response – but also practically, in providing training in how to ensure all customers are treated with respect. We must move towards a society in which everyone is valued and values others in return, regardless of our differences and our gender. And that includes getting to a point where a man doesn’t feel disrespected by a complaint by virtue of the fact that it’s coming from a woman. This is one of the many ways in which the patriarchy effects men. In shunning values traditionally deemed to be “feminine” (empathy, vulnerability, intuition, patience), many men are left feeling that they must battle to be on top – that they need to be tough and dominant not only to be worthy of respect, but also to be of any worth at all. And because women operate (professionally and otherwise) in this same value system, we often feel and act that way too – because it’s the way of being that is socially accepted. We could make a start on changing this by tackling the systematic disparagement of traditionally “feminine” values and those who embody them, and addressing the damaging elevation of traditionally “masculine” traits. We all suffer from toxic masculinity, regardless of gender. We should try to hear each other and to embody those same values of patience and empathy and have the courage to be vulnerable.

I was a bit lost among the excited adults all around me and the tea and sandwiches and smell of smoke (pre-ban), but I could tell from the tone of the chairman’s voice this was a very serious business. “I think you know what it would mean to this club to go on a proper Cup run,” he told my dad, Leroy, who was the manager of the then Southern Premier League team. For Gloucester City “a proper Cup run” means making it to the first round and beyond; a chance to play against a professional club where you might just get to the start of one of those magical campaigns which sees you in the spotlight and playing at the likes of Old Trafford or Anfield if you progress. I remember the Gloucester players just focusing on what might happen if they got out of the preliminary rounds and the opportunity to get spotted by a full-time club and a chance to make a career in the professional game. It’s easy (and fashionable) to be cynical about the oldest club competition in the world, but the FA Cup is the place where teams from every league in our country are afforded the opportunity to dream of making their own little bit of history. Over recent years I have heard more and more that the “magic” of the FA Cup has been lost, that the top teams no longer see the competition as relevant as they used to due to the importance of the financial benefits of making the top four and qualifying for the Champions League. That argument, when looking at the top level, holds weight but misses the point for most clubs who don’t have huge resources. They are just as important to their fans and the pyramid system we all operate in, and a “proper cup run” cannot only sustain them financially for years but also give the opportunity to their supporters to live the dream of competing with the big boys and tell stories to grandchildren about the day they were there. Tell me that’s not what football is all about? As a sport it’s a rare vehicle for all of us to forget our day-to-day worries and that’s why we all love a good underdog story – just look at Lincoln and Plymouth over the last few years, among many – and for that reason the FA Cup will never lose its appeal. As the third round kicks off this weekend, there will be many young boys and girls going to watch their local teams play against a bigger club. Indeed the FA Cup was one of the major inspirations in motivating me to become a professional footballer. Watching Ryan Giggs’s solo effort at Villa Park against Arsenal or Steven Gerrard’s incredible shot against West Ham to take the 2006 final to extra-time, every single football fan has a personal moment and connection to this competition and I guarantee there will be plenty more to come. What will stay with me for ever was the surreal moment in May 2014 when I was on the Hull City team coach heading to Wembley for our final against Arsenal, looking out of the window and seeing a helicopter crew filming us. I used to lie in bed dreaming of that moment as a 10-year-old boy. It’s inevitable changes will be made to teams who have the luxury of rotating after a hectic schedule of league fixtures, but come kick-off I have never heard of or seen a team not 100% committed to going as far as they can in this competition. In fact, the players who come in to play are hungry and determined to show their worth and see the Cup as a fantastic opportunity to make their names and achieve something special by winning a trophy that we’ve all seen held aloft when we were young. In the last few years, with the crazy amount of money that is being spent on players and levels of investment into football clubs, I feel that the true essence of football, 11 players against 11 with any result possible, is being lost. The FA Cup is a reminder that we were all kids or underdogs once and that with an outstanding performance and sometimes even an element of luck, it is not too naive or romantic to dream of “doing the impossible”. This weekend, up and down the country there will be supporters of clubs who deep down believe their team can do it this year and either beat a club a division or two above themselves or go all the way and win the Cup itself. That’s what football is all about – the opportunity to dream – and the FA Cup is the best and most magical way of living it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/ng-interactive/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-episode-4-a-potted-history","type":"interactive","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T12:00:10Z","webTitle":"Made in Stoke-on-Trent – Episode 4: A Potted History","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-episode-4-a-potted-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-episode-4-a-potted-history","fields":{"headline":"Made in Stoke-on-Trent – Episode 4: A Potted History","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/ng-interactive/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-episode-3-prevail","type":"interactive","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T12:00:10Z","webTitle":"Made in Stoke-on-Trent – Episode 3: Prevail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-episode-3-prevail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-episode-3-prevail","fields":{"headline":"Made in Stoke-on-Trent – Episode 3: Prevail","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/ng-interactive/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-episode-1-we-have-lift-off","type":"interactive","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-08T12:00:10Z","webTitle":"Made in Stoke-on-Trent – Episode 1: We Have Lift-off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-episode-1-we-have-lift-off","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jan/08/made-in-stoke-on-trent-episode-1-we-have-lift-off","fields":{"headline":"Made in Stoke-on-Trent – Episode 1: We Have Lift-off","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/06/roberto-firmino-liverpool-everton-mason-holgate","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T13:09:15Z","webTitle":"FA to investigate racism allegations after Firmino and Holgate flare-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/06/roberto-firmino-liverpool-everton-mason-holgate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/06/roberto-firmino-liverpool-everton-mason-holgate","fields":{"headline":"FA to investigate racism allegations after Firmino and Holgate flare-up","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Football Association has confirmed it will launch an investigation after allegations by the Everton defender Mason Holgate that he was racially abused by Roberto Firmino during Liverpool’s FA Cup win at Anfield. “The FA can confirm that referee Bobby Madley was made aware of an allegation during the Liverpool versus Everton game at Anfield last night and has subsequently reported this to the FA, which will now begin making enquiries into the matter,” read an FA statement. Holgate clashed with the Liverpool forward after pushing him over the advertising hoardings in the first half of the home side’s 2-1 victory. Firmino reacted furiously and ran towards the Everton defender, who erupted after something was said by the Brazil international. Holgate had to be restrained by several team-mates and appeared to complain to the referee, Robert Madley, that a racist term had been used. The match official reported the allegation to the fourth official, Jon Moss, and spoke to the 21-year-old again after the game. A Liverpool spokesperson said: “The club and the player will fully co-operate with the relevant authorities to ensure the facts are established in a thorough manner if deemed necessary or requested. While that process is ongoing we will not be making any further comment.” Firmino was not asked to give a statement after the match. Sam Allardyce refused to comment on the incident but Everton’s director of football, Steve Walsh, was involved in discussions with the club’s media department after the Cup tie. “I’m telling you nothing until whatever systems are used to find out exactly what happened or didn’t happen,” the Everton manager said. “I am here to talk about football not controversial incidents, because football is my life and anything outside the game has to be dealt with by the authorities. Even if I had or I hadn’t [spoken to Holgate] I wouldn’t tell anyone in this press conference. That is for others to deal with. I have left that with the director of football and told him to sort that one out.” Jürgen Klopp admitted: “I heard about something but I can’t say anything so far. The fourth official said something to me. I never heard the words so I thought they were going to investigate the Holgate foul. That’s how I understood it at first. Then after the game the fourth official informed me but it wasn’t that I really got what it was about.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jan/05/virgil-van-dijk-dream-liverpool-debut-fa-cup-everton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T23:08:24Z","webTitle":"Virgil van Dijk’s dream Liverpool debut could not have gone any better | Paul Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/05/virgil-van-dijk-dream-liverpool-debut-fa-cup-everton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jan/05/virgil-van-dijk-dream-liverpool-debut-fa-cup-everton","fields":{"headline":"Virgil van Dijk’s dream Liverpool debut could not have gone any better","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A sledgehammer to crack a nut was the expression that came to mind as Liverpool’s new £75m defender made his debut against a side with only one goal in their last four games and no shots on target in either of their last two home matches. Everton supporters were clinging to the slender hope that Jürgen Klopp might have taken a risk in throwing Virgil van Dijk straight into the heat of a Merseyside derby. There were few worries on that score, even before the centre-half scored the winning goal five minutes from the end. Joël Matip and Van Dijk had only Dominic Calvert-Lewin to look after between them and the latter towered over the Everton centre-forward in every sense, invariably getting to the ball first whether in the air or on the ground. The former Southampton player even found time to launch a few attacks in the first half, sometimes carrying the ball to the halfway line, sometimes sending out 50-yard passes in search of team-mates further forward. Van Dijk looks the part, in short, but then he always did. It was in the other half of the pitch that Liverpool looked unusually disjointed until Everton came to their aid with a couple of defensive blunders. First was a penalty as soft as the one that earned them a point in the league derby at Anfield last month. With only two of the Fab Four on the pitch Liverpool were making hard work of breaking through Everton’s two banks of defenders before Mason Holgate made his first misjudgment of the evening. The defender made the error of laying his hands on Adam Lallana as the Liverpool forward attempted to turn on the ball just inside the area. There was no question of throwing him to the floor or ripping the shirt from his back but Lallana felt the contact and went to ground anyway. It was almost an exact replica of the challenge Dejan Lovren made on Calvert-Lewin for the penalty in the league game, and as Sam Allardyce fully backed that decision he could have no complaints here. “Don’t raise your hands, don’t touch the opponent, don’t mess with him” was the gist of Allardyce’s advice last month, so he probably needs to have a word with Holgate about keeping his hands to himself to avoid undoing half an hour’s worth of otherwise doughty defending. Allardyce would have been reasonably pleased with that first half- hour too, because not only had Everton been keeping Liverpool at bay; they had won two corners to the home side’s none. There were no shots on target, needless to say, but as far as Allardyce is concerned corners are the next best thing. Everton must have been hoping to make it to the interval without conceding, to at least raise the tension levels, though in the event they were lucky to make it to half-time with a full complement of players on the pitch. At first sight it seemed ludicrous that Holgate should make his second misjudgment of the evening by deliberately shoving Roberto Firmino over the perimeter fence into the crowd and get away with it, though the Everton player lost his head to such an extent that it appeared likely he had been verbally abused or provoked. There was no other explanation for such a blatant transgression under the nose of the referee, and the fact that Robert Madley failed to produce a card – not to mention the amount of time he spent talking to the fourth official and discussing the matter behind his hand with various interested parties on the pitch – suggested this was a complex incident that even VAR might not have been able to clear up. Whatever the provocation, Holgate was lucky to get away with using his hands again so soon after conceding the penalty. With Everton chasing the game in the second half Allardyce permitted Liverpool supporters their biggest cheer of the night by withdrawing Wayne Rooney well before the hour mark. Ademola Lookman was sent on in his place, but it is debatable whether Allardyce was trying to boost his attack. More likely he was protecting Rooney, who had picked up an early booking for a foul on Joe Gomez and had looked in danger of collecting a second when he clattered into Emre Can. Nevertheless Lookman played his part in helping set up an unlikely equaliser, moving the ball neatly upfield to find Phil Jagielka, of all people, hovering close to the Liverpool penalty area, ready to lay off to Gylfi Sigurdsson. One shot on target, one goal. Set up by a substitute and a centre-half it may have been, but for just a few minutes it appeared Everton under Allardyce might have a charmed life in Merseyside derbies, especially after Lallana and Gomez wasted good chances to put the game to bed. Any Allardyce team has to be able to defend corners, however, and Everton were ultimately undone by a lapse of concentration almost as big as a £75m Dutchman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jan/06/abdelhak-nouri-family-existing-heart-condition-ajax","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T16:07:00Z","webTitle":"Abdelhak Nouri’s family say they were not told of existing heart condition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/06/abdelhak-nouri-family-existing-heart-condition-ajax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jan/06/abdelhak-nouri-family-existing-heart-condition-ajax","fields":{"headline":"Abdelhak Nouri’s family say they were not told of existing heart condition","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Abdelhak Nouri’s family have responded to reports the 20-year-old had a heart condition that was detected by the Dutch FA in 2014 and documented on the player’s medical file at Ajax by saying they are shocked and greatly regret neither the governing body nor the club told the player’s parents at the time “to jointly agree on a follow-up process”. Abdelhak, who was one of the most talented young players in the Netherlands, collapsed on the pitch during a pre-season friendly in Austria against Werder Bremen on 8 July and remains in a low level of consciousness in a hospital in Amsterdam after suffering serious and permanent brain damage. The Nouri family say they had not suspected or been aware of any pre-existing condition at the time of the incident and discovered the apparent heart defect – identified by the Dutch FA (KNVB) during routine screening in April 2014 – only when they obtained the medical file that Ajax provided “after repeated and explicit requests”. That document was passed on as part of an investigation being carried out on the family’s behalf by John Beer, a personal injury lawyer. Beer is looking at all aspects of the incident in Austria, including the level of care that Abdelhak received on the pitch after he collapsed. The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad claimed on Friday the KNVB informed Ajax in writing that there was a problem with Abdelhak’s heart. KNVB doctors reportedly evaluated the heart condition as harmless. However, the Nouri family say they were not told either verbally or in writing about the result of the heart screening. The NRC report does not specify the condition. In a statement released on Saturday morning, the family say had they known about the problem with Abdelhak’s heart – he was only 17 when it was picked up by the KNVB on an echocardiogram – they “would have immediately insisted on thorough follow-up examinations, a second opinion and regular follow-up tests, in order to assess the nature and risks of such a condition in combination with his intensive sporting activities”. NRC goes on to report that “according to one person involved, it was communicated verbally” to Abdelhak that he had a heart defect, although the Nouri family in their statement say they “give no credence to this”. It is unclear whether there is any connection between the pre-existing heart defect and Abdelhak’s collapse. He was able to play for Holland age-group teams at European championships in 2016 and 2014, so the KNVB told NRC it “may be concluded” there was no danger to the player’s health. The KNVB responded to the family’s statement by saying the player was told in 2014 and 2016 about his medical results. The governing body said it had complied with protocol and insisted it was under no obligation to tell Abdelhak’s parents. “We have informed Nouri of the results, in writing and verbally, as well as his club Ajax,” said a spokesperson for the KNVB, who claimed a medical specialist was present at both meetings with the player. “Since Nouri was over 16 years old at the time it was sufficient to inform only the footballer himself.” The KNVB added: “We cannot say whether we have found a heart defect in him. We cannot make a statement about that. This is covered by medical professional confidentiality.” Ajax did not want to comment on NRC’s report and a club spokesman said: “No substantive information is to be shared as it is a medical, and therefore confidential, file. In addition, our doctor has to adhere to professional confidentiality/doctor-patient privilege. We communicate directly with the Nouri family about matters concerning Abdelhak and not through the media.” However, the club issued a statement in the wake of the Nouri family’s comments. “The Nouri family would like, just as Ajax do, to know precisely what happened with Abdelhak. It has been known to us for some time that they have engaged a lawyer, just as we have, to investigate further. We naturally fully cooperate with this. Everything that we have and know is available to them.” The full statement from the Nouri family said: “Over the past six months, the family has heard from various doctors – mostly on an informal basis – that there may not have been an adequate response after Abdelhak collapsed on the football pitch. Before taking any further positions or drawing any conclusions, the family will await the investigation that is currently being carried out by personal injury lawyer Mr John Beer. “The family would like to express, however, that it is very shocked by the news that a heart condition was detected as early as 2014 during a medical examination of Abdelhak by the KNVB. The family only recently learned about this when they read the medical file that Ajax provided to them – after repeated and explicit requests. “The family is convinced that Abdelhak himself had no knowledge of this condition. If the family had been aware of the heart condition at an earlier stage, they would have immediately insisted on thorough follow-up examinations, a second opinion and regular follow-up tests, in order to assess the nature and risks of such a condition in combination with his intensive sporting activities. “The NRC Handelsblad article states, quoting a ‘person involved’, that Abdelhak was informed of the heart condition in 2014. In the light of the information currently available, the family attaches no credence to this and notes that the parents of Abdelhak, who was 17 years old at the time, were never informed, either in writing or orally. In the family’s opinion both the KNVB and Ajax could have been expected to explicitly inform the parents about this and to jointly agree on a follow-up process. The family greatly regrets that this never happened. “The family is also awaiting the results of the investigation and the outcome of the ongoing discussions with Ajax. No further statements will be made in the meantime. The media are requested politely but firmly not to contact the family.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jan/06/women-told-about-new-partners-abusive-past-police-powers-theodore-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-06T21:00:16Z","webTitle":"Women should be told if new partner has abusive past, say victims’ groups","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/06/women-told-about-new-partners-abusive-past-police-powers-theodore-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jan/06/women-told-about-new-partners-abusive-past-police-powers-theodore-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Women should be told if new partner has abusive past, say victims’ groups","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Victim support groups are calling on MPs to back a new law allowing police to take proactive measures to establish whether a serious offender has a new partner, and if so to inform them of his previous convictions. The call comes after the jailing of serial killer Theodore Johnson, 64, who strangled and battered his ex-girlfriend, Angela Best, 51. He was sentenced to life with a minimum of 26 years on Friday. Johnson was first convicted of manslaughter in 1981 after throwing his then wife, Yvonne Johnson, off a ninth-floor balcony in Wolverhampton. In 1992 he strangled a second partner, Yvonne Bennett, and pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility because of depression and a personality disorder. He was detained in a psychiatric hospital for just two years before being released back into the community. He kept his past secret from his partner and was let out by a mental health tribunal in 1997 on condition that he agree to supervision in the community and to alert doctors and social workers if he formed any new relationships, something he repeatedly failed to do. Johnson’s lawyer, Annette Henry, said the mental health tribunal’s condition on Johnson’s release was flawed as it relied on “self-reporting” any new relationship. “This was a dilemma and the tribunal found it was fraught with difficulty in trying to monitor,” she said. Johnson is not an isolated case. Liliya Breha, the mother of a five-year-old boy beaten to death by her boyfriend, Marvyn Iheanacho, was never warned by probation officials that he had a history of domestic violence and had once tried to strangle a child. Harry Fletcher, of the Victims Rights Campaign, which is leading calls for change to the laws on domestic violence disclosure, said he knew of many cases where women were unaware of the violent histories of their partners. In 2016, according to the latest figures available, 113 women were killed by men in England, Wales and Northern Ireland – and 90% knew their killer, according to the latest Femicide Census. The British Crime Survey estimates 1.3 million women suffered domestic abuse in the year to March 2016. Over the same period there were just over 100,000 domestic abuse prosecutions. Under “Clare’s law”, the domestic violence disclosure scheme introduced in 2014, police can inform a woman of a new partner’s past, but this depends on a woman making an inquiry. “In a number of recent disturbing cases, women entering into new relationships have found out in tragic circumstances that their new partner has previous convictions for violence, even murder,” Fletcher said. “Victims can refer to Clare’s law and ask the police in specific circumstances if the potential partner has any relevant criminal convictions. However, not surprisingly, that power is rarely used.” Under the new law that Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts hopes to introduce via an amendment to the government’s domestic violence bill, police would be duty bound to create a database holding the convictions and cautions of anyone found guilty of offences including manslaughter, murder, rape or repeated instances of domestic violence or coercive control. Officers could make unannounced visits to offenders, who would face prison if they failed to inform the authorities they were in a new relationship. Police would then have the right to inform the woman of a new partner’s convictions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/05/donald-trump-twitter-no-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T22:31:58Z","webTitle":"Twitter makes it clear: Donald Trump will not be banned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/05/donald-trump-twitter-no-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/05/donald-trump-twitter-no-ban","fields":{"headline":"Twitter makes it clear: Donald Trump will not be banned","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Just days after Donald Trump’s Twitter taunting of Kim Jong-Un over nuclear war reignited calls for the company to ban the president from its platform, the social media company obliquely addressed the controversy in a statement defending its decision not to to censor “world leaders”. “Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,” the company wrote in a blogpost published Friday. “It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.” The statement does not name Trump or state any new policy, but instead offers a defense of the company’s current practice, which takes into account whether a tweet that might otherwise violate the company’s rules is “newsworthy” or in the “public interest”. “We review Tweets by leaders within the political context that defines them, and enforce our rules accordingly,” the company wrote. “We work hard to remain unbiased with the public interest in mind.” Twitter’s defense of its treatment of world leaders comes at a time when its rival social media platform Facebook is facing criticism for a lack of transparency and coherence around its own treatment of political figures. In December, Facebook deleted the social media accounts of Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic. The company told the New York Times that the deletions were due to the US government’s imposition of economic sanctions on Kadyrov, but other world leaders named on US sanctions lists, such as the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, have not been banned from Facebook. Trump’s frequent and reckless use of Twitter defined him as a presidential candidate, but has elicited increased concern since his inauguration. From the White House, Trump has continued his use of the platform to attack political opponents (and allies) and journalists, and also to threaten North Korea and share anti-Muslim videos posted by a leader of a far-right British hate group. Many Trump critics have called for the president to be banned from the website – both because his tweets can often be construed as violating the platform’s rules and out of fear that his outbursts could actually spark a war. In August, the former CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson launched an unsuccessful effort to crowdfund the purchase of Twitter in order to ban Trump. In November, Trump’s personal account was briefly deactivated. The company attributed the outage to the actions of a contractor on his final day of work, and the contractor later claimed that he had made a mistake. Some critics have suggested that Twitter’s reluctance to censor Trump’s Tweets stems from its understanding that Trump’s predilection for the platform provides outsize importance to a company that has failed to achieve the popularity of social media behemoths such as Facebook and YouTube. But the company appeared to dismiss that criticism in the statement, writing: “No one person’s account drives Twitter’s growth, or influences these decisions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/17/country-diary-ancient-enclave-where-walkers-roam-cadson-bury-lynher-valley","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-17T05:30:45Z","webTitle":"Country diary: ancient enclave where walkers usually roam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/17/country-diary-ancient-enclave-where-walkers-roam-cadson-bury-lynher-valley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/17/country-diary-ancient-enclave-where-walkers-roam-cadson-bury-lynher-valley","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: ancient enclave where walkers usually roam","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Just below the summit a shaggy-coated cow with long, curving horns gazes into the greyness of this dull afternoon. The sound of rushing water carries up from the river, now swollen with run-off from Redmoor and Tresellern Marshes, the Withey Brook and other boggy headstreams on the eastern side of Bodmin Moor, as well as little tributaries from intermediate waterlogged land. Up here, on this precipitous hill, topped with defensive earthworks of ditch and rampart, a dozen or so highland cattle of varying age (owned by the Crago family of the nearby Cadson Farm) mooch about, graze and thrive on heather and the coarser vegetation that would otherwise smother this iron age hill-fort and the adjoining hillside. Yellow gorse flowers and the silver bark of birch gleam in the murk and, below, in the Lynher Valley and on the Newton Ferrers estate, the leafless tree canopy (dominated by lichen-encrusted alder and oak) is tinged pale green and purple. Inside the eastern entrance, the encampment of some six acres is a spongy oval space of trampled bracken and mossy turf. This enclave was once a secure area for early farmers, where they and their animals were relatively protected from marauders and wild creatures lurking in the dense woodland below. Now owned by the National Trust, this ancient site is a destination for local walkers but on this gloomy day, expansive views from the bank around the edge are restricted. Westwards, beyond undulating fields, copses and isolated farmsteads, Kilmar and Sharp Tor merge with rolls of cloud. Red lights on Caradon’s communications mast are part obscured in the mist, as is the monumental stack on the top of Kit Hill to the north. Higher land prevents sight of the distant sea to the south, and Dartmoor to the east is hidden by Viverdon Down, which intervenes between here and our home parish of St Dominic with its own much smaller iron age enclosure – Bury Camp, which adjoins Berry farmhouse. As darkness encroaches, colours fade to monochrome; crows fly downhill towards sheltered roosts and the valley’s dimness is pricked with lights from commuters’ cars, crossing the medieval Newbridge and processing uphill, past Pencrebar towards Callington."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/oct/30/crossword-blog-a-vintage-mystery-with-a-bizarre-twist","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T10:46:55Z","webTitle":"Crossword blog: a vintage murder mystery with a bizarre twist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/oct/30/crossword-blog-a-vintage-mystery-with-a-bizarre-twist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/oct/30/crossword-blog-a-vintage-mystery-with-a-bizarre-twist","fields":{"headline":"Crossword blog: a vintage murder mystery with a bizarre twist","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Observer’s first crossword setter, Torquemada, published a collection of puzzles in 1934. Its title read: The Torquemada Puzzle Book. A miscellany of original crosswords, acrostics … etc., &amp; Cain’s Jawbone. A Torquemada mystery novel. Compiled by “Torquemada.” Among its “telacrostics” and “triple cricket acrostics” was an intriguing puzzle in the form of a story. Its solution was sadly lost ... until recently. I spoke to Patrick Wildgust of Shandy Hall, home to the Laurence Sterne Trust, about a new edition of the tale – which comes with a £1,000 prize. Right, so what is Cain’s Jawbone? Cain’s Jawbone is perhaps Torquemada’s crowning glory. A murder mystery that asks for the identification of the victims as well as the murderers – but only after the pages of the novel have been put into the correct order. Tell us more. Opposite the story’s epigraph “How easily murder is discovered!” (Titus Andronicus) and the name of the dedicatee, Dorothy L Sayers, is this introduction: Cain’s Jawbone, the bald narrative of a series of tragic happenings during a period of less than six months in a recent year, has met with an accident which seems to be unique in the history of the novelette. The pages have been printed in an entirely haphazard and incorrect order, a fact which reflects little credit on somebody. The author assures his readers, however, that while it is now too late for him to remedy the ordering of the pages, it is quite possible for them, should they care to take the trouble, to reorder them correctly for themselves. Before they attempt to do this, they may care to be assured that there is an inevitable order, the one in which the pages were written, and that, while the narrator’s mind may flit occasionally backwards and forwards in the modern manner, the narrative marches on, relentlessly and unequivocally, from the first page to the last. A space for notes is provided at the bottom of each page. And you recently acquired a copy: how did that come about? I was given it by Geoffrey Day, who is a Trustee of the Laurence Sterne Trust and a Sterne scholar. He had had the book for years but had not been able to solve the puzzle. I could see a link (‘only connect’) to Sterne, who said that writing “when properly managed (as you may be sure I think mine is) is but a different name for conversation”. I thought that the 100 pages of Cain’s Jawbone would require some concentration but that the solution would surely be found. I showed it to friends. I showed it to visitors to the museum. I used it with students and writers and it became more and more fascinating and more and more complex. Someone did manage to solve it, or so the Observer’s archives suggest. But we didn’t print a solution. Was your call for help in these pages last year helpful? You don’t have to be coy if our readers were no use. Yes, thanks to that message a contact was made. A significant contact, as it turns out. OK. And how satisfied are you that you now know the correct solution? Completely satisfied. That’s a short response but I can’t really go into the details. Understood. Tell us a little about how Torquemada’s work moved between literature and puzzles. Edward Powys Mathers first came to the attention of the literary world with the publication of his translations and versions of Asiatic love poems. Even at this early stage, there was an element of masquerade, as he introduced poems that were not translations but composed by Powys Mathers himself. He was heartened by the eager acceptance of his own poems; he created alter egos (Mr J Wing and Mr John Duncan) and disguised his authorship under their names. Powys Mathers also loved detective fiction and his background knowledge (from the name of Sherlock Holmes’s tobacconist to the reason Father Brown disliked hat-pegs) was matched only by his memory for tales of the supernatural. His Observer crossword persona, Torquemada, was created in 1926 and he created more than 670 puzzles using the name of the feared Spanish Inquisitor. Plus Cain’s Jawbone. And now the competition is re-opening? I kept showing the book to friends and writers who came to Shandy Hall. The conceptual writers Christian Bök and Craig Dworkin were particularly interested, and I set my mind to find a way to bring it a wider audience. The Laurence Sterne Trust is an independent museum and we couldn’t afford to publish a new edition but the winds of chance blew John Mitchinson [QI producer and founder of the publisher Unbound] and his father into the museum one day. I was already a subscriber to a couple of Unbound books and had great admiration for this reinvention of the idea of a book’s subscription list (Sterne published A Sentimental Journey with 16 pages’ worth of subscribers); the decision was made to give it a go. Subscribers to Cain’s Jawbone will receive its 100 pages unbound in a box. This means that they can be spread out and placed next to each other – so much easier than when pages are bound, as in the original publication. A space for notes is provided as well as a page to submit with the answer. Only solutions submitted on a page from the box will be eligible. The Trust had a happy success a couple of years ago when Tom Gauld created another nonlinear narrative – a “Myriorama” or “Endless Landscape”. Beautifully executed and mathematically incredible, the game is now in its third issue and bringing income to the Trust. Cain’s Jawbone is as much a game as Sterne’s Tristram Shandy: a game of words to entertain and amuse. Hopefully, we will reach the target and the book will become a reality. I hope so, too.

He smokes a doobie’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Hi Jennifer. What does that say on your necklace? “Chucky’s Back.” I had it made for Seed of Chucky, when I had no idea how many times Chucky would come back. At the end of every movie he’s burned or decapitated, but I’d say the only thing that could kill him is bad box office. Were you aware of the negative associations of the Child’s Play series when you made your first Chucky film? (1) The studio said: “We think we should warn you, some people blame this Chucky movie for this terrible murder.” I’m trying to think when they told me. Let me see, who was my boyfriend back then? Oh, I know! I was dating an Essex boy named Peter. Or [assumes Essex accent] Pee’ah. We were over here a lot because he was a big Chelsea fan. We went to the games. He knew all the songs. Should children be allowed to watch horror films? I don’t know, but any time I have fans under eight, it’s always because of Chucky. Someone asked me: “What movies have you made that are good for kids?” And I said: “None of ’em!” Only ones where you can’t see my face: Stuart Little, Monsters Inc. Maybe kids could see Liar, Liar, though there’s strong language and sexual situations. My sister Meg took her boy to see it – Colin Firth’s kid (2), Will – when he was six or seven. Jim Carrey is yelling: “You stuffed her like a Thanksgiving turkey!” And Will said: “Did he really, Mummy? Did he really stuff her?” What sets Cult of Chucky apart from the other Chucky films? Universal decided they wanted Chucky to be scary again. It’s like Trump – “Make America great again!” But didn’t the series get more comical with your arrival? (3) They’re romps. How frightening can Chucky be? He smokes a doobie. You’ve starred as yourself in some of the Chucky films. What’s the secret to playing Jennifer Tilly? You can’t be precious about it. I wanted to be a selfish, narcissistic diva. The studio said: “Why does she have to be a spoilt movie star? Why can’t she be a nice girl whose friends are being killed?” We had to reshoot the scene in Seed of Chucky where I’m caught up in the murders and I’m just so thrilled to be in the spotlight again after a long, dry period. They said I was too dislikable. You were Oscar-nominated for Bullets Over Broadway and Woody Allen called you a great improviser. Woody loves it when things get fucked up. You just have to keep going even if a chandelier falls from the ceiling. Chazz [Palminteri] and I improvised a lot. “It’s called improvising!” “You can’t say that, it’s not in the script.” That was ours. He told me afterwards that when he raised his fist, he thought it would shut me up. Then he said: “But nothing shuts you up, does it?” Surely the Wachowskis didn’t put up with improvising on Bound? No, they were the opposite. So precise. I told them: “You didn’t let me ad-lib anything.” They said: “Yes, we did. When the cop came in, you said ‘Hi’. That wasn’t in the script.” You’re a hugely successful poker champion. (4) Do you have any tells? I’m fortunate because I’ve been able to eradicate them. I did a seminar with an FBI profiler who said I’m one of the most tell-free people he’s ever met. But he said: “You do have one tell, Jennifer. You swallow.” I said: “Everyone swallows.” He said with me, it’s more of a gulp. Does acting make you a better poker player or vice versa? They’re both about reacting to nuances. If I want to bluff, I just pretend like I have the hand. I can slow down my heartbeat, convince myself I’ve got aces even when I don’t. There’s this psychic energy involved. If I’m looking at someone and I’m super tuned in to them, I can tell exactly what hand they’ve got. You know when they (5) say: “Use the Force, Luke”? That’s what it’s like. Cult of Chucky is released on DVD and Blu-ray on 23 October. Footnotes 1) Child’s Play 3 was believed at first to have been watched by one of the killers of three-year-old James Bulger in 1993, though no direct link was ever established. 2) Firth was in a relationship with Tilly’s younger sister, Meg, star of Psycho II and The Big Chill, between 1989 and 1994. 3) Tilly starred as devil-doll Tiffany in Bride of Chucky in 1999, followed by appearances as herself and/or Tiffany in Seed of Chucky (where she uttered the immortal line: “I’m an Oscar-nominated actress, for God’s sake. Now look at me, I’m fucking a puppet!”), Curse of Chucky and Cult of Chucky. 4) She won a World Series of Poker Bracelet, and the accompanying $158,625 pot, in the $1,000 Ladies’ No Limit Hold’em, as well as the third World Poker Tour Ladies Invitational Tournament. Her poker winnings are estimated at more than $900,000. 5) “They” being Jedis, presumably."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/23/balkans-cycle-tour-holiday-dubrovnik-bosnia-montenegro","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-23T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"A cycling tour of the Balkans: two wheels, three countries, four days","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/23/balkans-cycle-tour-holiday-dubrovnik-bosnia-montenegro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/23/balkans-cycle-tour-holiday-dubrovnik-bosnia-montenegro","fields":{"headline":"A cycling tour of the Balkans: two wheels, three countries, four days","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rocking my bike from side to side, I crested the final rise and the landscape opened out before me. A high-altitude meadow freckled with cows rolled down into a shallow bowl surrounded by savagely contorted, parallel slabs of limestone sticking straight up from the earth. Beyond was 2,523-metre Bobotov Kuk, the highest point in Montenegro’s wondrous Unesco-listed Durmitor national park. Behind me were yet more staggering views, across glacial lakes to rows of mountain peaks, deep river gorges and pine forests populated by wild cats, bears and wolves. We, eight middle-aged men in slightly bulging Lycra – yes, derided mamils – were at the high point of our four-day tour of the Balkans. Having had our fill of Surrey’s Box Hill, damp British sportives and Alpine cols, we were looking for a new adventure, on roads rarely cycled. We wanted to pore over paper maps again, take wrong turns, eat strange foods and leather our tongues with local vino. In short, we wanted to recapture some of the joy we knew when we were young of touring by bike. Starting and finishing in Dubrovnik, we cycled a loop through a corner of Croatia, across Bosnia-Herzegovina and from the top of Montenegro to the bottom. By the end, we had clocked up 635km, with a hefty 8,650 metres of ascent. We rode in late September, to avoid the heat of summer and the winter snows, and had clear skies and sunshine for three and a half of the four days. On the first and last nights we stayed at Hotel Kompas beside the sea, a kilometre from Dubrovnik; in Mostar we stayed in an Airbnb flat, and the other nights at small hotels in Montenegro. Everywhere, the food was simple, freshly cooked and good. We rode a variety of bikes between us, from “adventure” or “gravel” machines to conventional, metal road frames. We travelled light, carrying tools and clothes in small panniers and “bikepacking” bags, navigating with a combination of digital and paper maps. Cycling out of Dubrovnik was hectic. When we left the coast and crossed the border into Bosnia-Herzegovina, however, the traffic tailed off. Some 40km after that, heading west towards Mostar, there were almost no cars to be seen. Instead, we rode past tractors chugging out of the woods with trailers full of coppiced oak and hornbeam, herdsmen ambling along the verges to the sound of goat bells, donkeys and conical haystacks in fields. It felt like we had vaulted back in time, to the beginning of the 20th century. All sense of pastoral reverie was punctured, however, by occasional reminders of the civil war that ripped through the region in the early 1990s. We pedalled past roadside graveyards and deserted farmhouses still pock-marked with bullet holes. We weren’t war tourists, though. Rather, we had come to enjoy open roads and big panoramas. Leaving Mostar, we climbed 1,000 metres over 15km out of the Neretva valley, past the crumbling, medieval walls of Blagaj fort, to reach a vast, bare upland plain. In Sutjeska national park we flew down through a beautiful, deep canyon beside the Sutjeska river, through pools of dazzling sunlight, beneath hillsides covered in ancient forests of pines and beech. The descent to Kotor, the ancient city on the Montenegrin Adriatic fortified by the Venetians, was spellbinding: the 25 hairpin bends afford some of the best views I have ever enjoyed from a saddle. As we pedalled round the aquamarine Bay of Kotor, and crossed from Montenegro back into Croatia, storm clouds blew in off the Adriatic. It hardly mattered… Dubrovnik, the hotel and the bar were close but we, a bunch of middle-aged men, were already intoxicated on a cocktail of hard riding, wondrous scenery and adventure. Box Hill would never be the same again. • Hotel Kompas has doubles from €118.

Iannucci and Soviet Russia: on paper, it’s a match made in heaven – both an opportunity to capitalise on anti-Russia sentiment and a chance to jab one of history’s most notorious autocrats in the ribs at a time when dictatorial, power-drunk figures are actually in power. A shame, then, that it doesn’t jab hard enough. The film is adapted from Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin’s graphic novel, in which Stalin’s sudden death in 1953 serves as a catalyst for action, with neurotic acting general secretary Nikita “Nicky” Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) and comrades Georgy Malenkov (Jeffrey Tambor, deliciously vain and making fine use of a girdle) and foreign affairs minister Vyacheslav Molotov (Michael Palin) each trying to manoeuvre his way into a position of more power. Depending on your existing knowledge of the Soviet Union, it can be a little hard to keep up (“I can’t remember who’s alive and who’s dead!” one character jokes), though the film is transparently more interested in the broad comedy of morbid sight gags and set pieces than it is in cross-examining the particularities of the period’s politics. Still, the ensemble cast is mostly very good; Jason Isaacs is especially fun to watch as the macho Georgy Zhukov, reimagined with a Yorkshire accent. Andrea Riseborough as Stalin’s daughter, one of the film’s scant female characters, is the weak link, though her Svetlana is not quite funny enough on the page. The stakes are higher in Stalin’s universe, with verbal blunders met by bullets rather than Iannucci’s favoured (and very English) punishment of stinging, crippling embarrassment. The tone ends up being oddly serious, the comedy bleak rather than black, and the final product is somehow both more sombre and less caustic than Iannucci’s sharpest, silliest work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/oct/21/phone-dwp-universal-credit-benefits-heartache","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T09:24:19Z","webTitle":"I take your calls to the DWP about universal credit - I feel your heartache","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/oct/21/phone-dwp-universal-credit-benefits-heartache","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/oct/21/phone-dwp-universal-credit-benefits-heartache","fields":{"headline":"I take your calls to the DWP about universal credit - I feel your heartache","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"I’m a call handler for the DWP, where empathy isn’t a trait that’s valued very much. But I’ve been on benefits and I know how difficult it can be looking for work while trying to survive on a minimal amount of money. I wish I was the one who made the rules, especially after dealing with universal credit claimants for more than two years. From day one, I’ve been told by long-standing colleagues and managers that it’ll get easier to deal with calls, that I should “shut off” and “not get involved”, but that isn’t the case. I want to say to the claimants: I do empathise with you when you explain to me what’s happening to you, and how hard it is. To the young lady I spoke to a few weeks ago regarding her childcare costs, I’m sorry the process wasn’t explained to you properly when you started your claim. I’m sorry you had to speak to four other people before me who all gave you the wrong information. I tried to explain the process to you by using my own knowledge, since I am a working mother myself. But I was told by my manager I can’t use my personal situation to relate to you, I must keep myself detached from anyone I deal with. To the gentleman I spoke to recently regarding his claim, I’m sorry you lost your home because of the way the system works and lack of information. I’m sorry your landlord wasn’t more understanding about the seven-week delay on your housing benefit payment. You needed to hand in an up to date tenancy agreement so your housing benefit is calculated correctly, but this wasn’t made clear. It happens a lot in the department, and affects a lot of people. In the office, call statistics are a massive focus and this feeds into our personal performance record. We’re constantly monitored at work, including how often we go to the toilet, and for how long. We’re asked to explain ourselves if managers think we are taking too long. It creates unnecessary extra pressure on the staff, who are already dealing with a highly stressed group of people who are put under extremely stressful circumstances a lot of the time. We used to have time allocated at the end of each call to process anything that couldn’t be done during the call such as sending information over to other departments or making payment calculations. But this has now been stopped. We are now told to put the caller on hold instead, adding even more time and expense to what is already a very lengthy call. It isn’t fair to keep you on the phone and make you pay more for the call. I do my best not to extend it any longer than I have to and still do work after the call, but we’re always being scrutinised. I know that not contacting us can cause a sanction to be imposed. I am a person, and I care. I follow the rules because I need to keep my job and provide for my child. It makes me sad that so many people have lost their homes, and many their lives, due to the changes that have occurred since universal credit started. Please believe me when I say, I do not take the least bit of pleasure in feeling like I’m causing heartache for so many people in doing my job.

Ӯ замоне дар Душанбе мезист ва соли 1995 шаҳрро тарк кард. Аз ҳудуди даҳ сол пеш дубора ба пойтахт рафтуомад мекунад. Ӯ аз дигаргуниҳое, ки то ҳол дар Душанбе рух дода, шигифтзада аст. Аммо нисбат ба ин тағйирот назари мусбат дорад. Мегӯяд, - “Душанбе бакуллӣ иваз шудааст, сокинонаш бояд ба ин ифтихор кунанд.” Душанбе рустое бо чанд ҳазор ҷамъият буд, ки соли 1924 пойтахт эълом шуд. Аз он замон пайваста дар ҳоли тавсеъаю тараққӣ буда ва дар ин авохир ба суръати бештаре рушд мекунад. Бар асоси тарҳи нави бозсозии Душанбе, ки батозагӣ аз сӯи мақомоти тоҷик тасвиб шуд, интизор меравад қаламрави шаҳр то соли 2030 се баробар ва ҷамъияташ аз болои 800 ҳазор то ба 1,2 милюн нафар афзоиш ёбад. Ҳамакнун шаҳр ҳам ба боло қад мекашад ва ҳам ба атроф доман паҳн мекунад. Дар ин шаҳр, ки замоне Истолинобод (ё шаҳри Истолин) ном дошт, акнун биноҳои сохташуда дар даврони Шӯравӣ тахриб ва ба ҷои онҳо имратҳои баландошёна ва осмонхарош бунёд мешаванд. Боғҳо тармим ва роҳҳо васеътар мешаванд, бозорҳои қадимӣ ҷои худро ба фурӯшгоҳҳои наву замонавӣ медиҳанд. Ҳафтае пеш бозори Шоҳмансур, ки бо номи “Зелёний” маъруф буд, ба дастури шаҳрдорӣ баста шуд. Дар фосилае наздик ба он фурӯшгоҳи Ашан мавҷуд аст, ки моҳи июни соли гузашта боз шуд ва нахустин маркази харид дар Душанбе маҳсуб мешавад. Бозори “Баракат”, ки аз куҳантарин бозорҳои Душанбе ба шумор мерафт, чанд сол пеш бар замин ҳамвор шуд ва дар ҷои он сохтмони нави Осорхонаи миллӣ қомат афрохт. Чанде пеш мақомот ба тахриби бинои собиқи шаҳрдорӣ оғоз карданд, то ҷои он пойдевори бинои нави порлумонро гузоранд. Ин сохтмон дар хиёбони Рудакӣ ва дар наздикии майдони “Дӯстӣ” воқеъ буд – ҷое ки муҷассамаи Ленин дар тазоҳуроти зиддишӯравии соли 1991 вожгун карда шуд. Ҷанубтар аз он, осмонхароше ба ҷои бинои собиқи почтаи марказӣ қад алам мекунад. Тибқи нақшаи ислоҳшудаи шаҳрсозӣ, як “шаҳри нави” бузурге дар ҳаволии ҷануби пойтахт, дар миёндуоби рӯдҳои Варзоб ва Кофарниҳон, бунёд хоҳад шуд. Бо бурҷҳои осмонхароши беш аз 30 ошёна ва хеле баландтар аз бурҷи дуқулуи 23-табақае, ки дар хиёбони Рӯдакӣ воқеъ аст ва ҳоло баландтарин сохтмон дар Душанбе маҳсуб мешавад. Дар қисмати ғарбии шаҳр сохтмони нахустин фарозроҳ ё эстакада идома дорад. Қарор аст ин тарҳ то поёни соли 2018 ба анҷом бирасад. Мақомот мегӯянд то соли 2025 сохтмони 20 адад аз чунин фарозроҳҳо дар Душанбе дар назар гирифта шудааст. Ҳамон сол сохтмони нахустин истгоҳҳои метро ҳам оғоз хоҳад шуд. Бисёре аз ҷавонон, бавижа донишҷӯёне, ки аз манотиқи дигар барои таҳсил ба Душанбе омадаанд, мегӯянд, ки аз тарҳи нави бозсозии шаҳр розиянд. Хонуме, ки худро бо номи мустаъори Чаманоро муаррифӣ кард, мегӯяд, ки Душанбе бояд навсозӣ шавад, то худро бо воқеъиятҳои қарни 21 вифқ бидиҳад. Ӯ мегӯяд: “Баъзе аз ин биноҳо хеле куҳна шудаанд ва таъмирашон ҳам имконпазир нест – онҳо арзиши торихӣ ҳам надоранд. Беҳтар аст вайрон кунанду ба ҷояшон биноҳои наву замонавӣ ва зебо созанд. Шаҳр бояд тароват ва ҷони тоза бигирад.” “Муҳим аст, ки шаҳр иваз мешавад ва биноҳои баландошёна қад мекашанд,” – ин ҳарфест, ки Кароматулло, донишҷӯи яке аз донишгоҳои Душанбе, мегӯяд. “Аҳолии кишвар афзоиш меёбад ва мо бояд пешрафт кунем,... мисли кишварҳои дигар. Ин сохтмонҳо нишонаи пешрафту тараққиёт ҳастанд.” Аммо на ҳама бо ин назарот мувофиқанд. Бархе аз сокинони Душанбе - бавижа бузургсолоне, ки дилашон барои гузаштаи шаҳр танг мешавад, ва ё касоне, ки аз тавсеъаи иқтисодии кишвар баҳраи чандоне оидашон намешавад, - тарҳи нави шаҳрсозиро талоше барои сутурдани осори меъмории Шӯравӣ аз хотирот медонанд. ‘Шаҳри Сталин’ Нависанда Абдуқодири Рустам бар ин бовар аст, ки ин ҳама шитоби сарсомовар дар сохтусоз ношӣ аз ҳирси сарват аст, ҳарчанд ба гуфтаи ӯ, ин дигаргуниҳо асароти нумодине ҳам дорад. “Фикр мекунам, ҳадаф шустани хотираи мардум аст,” - ӯ мегӯяд. ”Бар наслҳои оянда ин тасаввур даст хоҳад дод, ки торих аз ин давра оғоз мешавад, гӯё мо қаблан чизе надоштем. Яъне мехоҳанд гӯшзад кунанд, ки ‘ҳарчи ҳаст, чи шаҳру чи кишвар, мо сохтем, пеш аз ин чизе набуд.” Дарвоқеъ, нахустин санади шаҳрсозии Душанбе соли 1927 тасвиб шуд, замоне ки ҳанӯз рустое бо шаш ҳазор ҷамъият буд. Ду сол баъд, ин рустои табдилшуда ба шаҳр номи Истолинободро гирифт – номе, ки то соли 1960 бо худ дошт. Бархе аз сохтмонҳои умдаи Душанбе дар даҳаҳои 1930 ва 40 бунёд шудаанд. Аз ҷумла Теотри уперо ва болеи Айнӣ ва Кохи раёсати ҷумҳурии пешин. Ин кох замоне қароргоҳи кумитаи марказии Ҳизби кумунисти Тоҷикистон буд ва ҳоло дафтари муваққатии Рустами Эмомалӣ (писари бузурги президент Эмомалӣ Раҳмон), шаҳрдори Душанбе, аст. Нигарониҳое аз тахриби эҳтимолии ин бино ҳам вуҷуд дорад. Ҳарду бино дар нақшаи нави бозсозии шаҳр то ҳадде таҳти ҳифозат қарор гирифтаанд. Онҳо аз ҷумлаи 15 сохтмоне ташхис дода шудаанд, ки дорои аҳаммияти торхию фарҳангӣ буда ва ба ҳеч ваҷҳ набояд тахриб шаванд. Ин феҳрист бинои чойхонаи «Роҳат», толори Филормунии давлатӣ (ки ҳоло ба телевизиюни “Сафина” таъаллуқ дорад), ва Кохи «Ваҳдат»-ро низ, ки ҳамагӣ дар замони Шӯравӣ сохта шудаанд, дар бар мегирад. Бо ин ҳол, биноҳои дигаре, чун теотри Маяковскӣ ва синемо (кинотеатр)-и Ҷомӣ бо вуҷуди мухолифатҳои густарда ба замин ҳамвор карда шуданд. Дар як тумори онлойнӣ, ки аз сӯи садҳо нафар дар баҳори 2016 имзо шуд, чунин омадааст: “Имрӯз, ҳангоме ки тамоми мардуми ҷаҳон барои ҳифзи қисматҳои торихии шаҳрҳо кӯшиш мекунанд, мо ҳақ надорем ончи падарону падарбузургонамон сохтаанд, аз байн барем. Инҳо иморатҳои холӣ нестанд, балки торихи мо ҳастанд.” Яке аз мушкилоти умда ноҳамгуниест, ки байни феҳристи биноҳои торихии зикршуда дар нақшаи шаҳрсозӣ ва феҳристи миллии мероси фарҳангӣ вуҷуд дорад. Аз понздаҳ бинои ҳифозатшуда дар нақшаи бозсозии шаҳр танҳо чаҳор бино дар феҳристи мероси миллии Вазорати фарҳанг сабт шудаанд. Ин феҳрист охирин бор соли 1971 таҳия шудааст. То замони истиқлоли Тоҷикистон дар соли 1991 бештари аҳолии Душанберо русҳо ва муҳоҷирони русизабоне ташкил медоданд, ки аз дигар манотиқи Иттиҳоди Шӯравӣ ба ин гӯшаи дуруфтодаи ин имперотурии бузург ҳамчун мутахассис фиристода мешуданд. Пас аз фурӯпошии Шӯравӣ аксари онҳо Тоҷикистонро тарк карданд. Пас аз он, ки ҳукумати нав зимоми умурро дар даст гирифт, мардуми зиёде аз манотиқи рустоӣ – бавижа аз вилояти Хатлон – ба Душанбе кӯчиданд. Ин мавҷи тоза аз муҳоҷират ба шаҳр таркиби ҷамъиятии онро бакуллӣ тағйир дод. “Масъала ин аст, ки ҷамъи касире аз аҳолии шаҳр аз инҷо рафтанд,” – пажӯҳишгари торих, Ғафур Шерматов, мегӯяд. ”Барои навомадагон, бавижа касоне, ки зимоми умурро дар даст доранд, шаҳр аз чандон аҳаммияте бархурдор нест. Онҳо дар инҷо бузург нашудаанд ва ин эҳсосро надоранд. Моиланд фақат мероси худашонро боқӣ гузоранд.” Исфандиёр Одина дар шӯъбаи форсии ББС кор мекунад."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/22/brennivin-iceland-black-death-cocktail-reykjavik-new-york","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"Iceland’s burning wine: a taste of the ‘black death’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/22/brennivin-iceland-black-death-cocktail-reykjavik-new-york","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/22/brennivin-iceland-black-death-cocktail-reykjavik-new-york","fields":{"headline":"Iceland’s burning wine: a taste of the ‘black death’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Brennivín, Iceland’s signature drink, was never intended as a slow-sipping tipple. The caraway-spiced aquavit’s name translates literally as “burning wine”, and the colourless 37.5% ABV spirit looks more like vodka than a mellow aperitif. Traditionally, brennivín was shot quickly at the pagan midwinter festival Þorrablót, for the purpose of washing down hákarl – a rotting shark speciality that American Anthony Bourdain once said was the worst thing he’d ever put in his mouth. The brand of brennivín most often seen in bars, Egill Skallagrímsson, was introduced in 1935, after Iceland ended 20 years of prohibition. To discourage consumption, the bottle featured a government-mandated matt-black label and a skull warning, earning it the nickname “black death”. That label essentially survives (though a map of Iceland has replaced the skull) and bottles are now popping up in bars outside Iceland. Brennivín arrived in the UK and US in 2015 and bartenders have begun experimenting with its notes of rye bread, searing moonshine pungency, velvety texture, aromas of liquorice and pumpernickel, and a kick that will warm you during sunless winters. In Reykjavik, the B5 nightclub mixes it with Chambord (raspberry liqueur) and lime; at bar-restaurant Slippbarinn it is mixed with local crowberries, or rhubarb bitters and egg white. The signature cocktail at Scandinavian bar Aska in Brooklyn mixes brennivín with gin, vermouth, baltic amber syrup and sea salt. Egill Skallagrímsson has begun releasing limited sherry- and bourbon-barrel-aged editions and even Iceland’s premier whisky distillers are making their own version now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2017/oct/20/theatre-director-max-stafford-clark-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behaviour","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T17:00:02Z","webTitle":"Theatre director Max Stafford-Clark was ousted over inappropriate behaviour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/20/theatre-director-max-stafford-clark-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behaviour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2017/oct/20/theatre-director-max-stafford-clark-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behaviour","fields":{"headline":"Theatre director Max Stafford-Clark was ousted over inappropriate behaviour","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"One of the most influential directors in British theatre was forced to stand down from the company he founded after being accused of inappropriate, sexualised behaviour, the Guardian has learned. Renowned director Max Stafford-Clark – the former artistic director of London’s Royal Court theatre – was forced out of the Out of Joint theatre company after a formal complaint that he made lewd comments to a member of staff. When Stafford-Clark left Out of Joint last month, the company’s board released a statement which did not reference the complaint, stating that he had departed to “focus on his international freelance career” and he was feted at the time as one the most successful theatre directors of his generation. But a staff member told the Guardian that she had made a formal complaint about the director in July 2017. Gina Abolins, 29, told the board that he said to her: “Back in the day, I’d have been up you like a rat up a drainpipe but now I’m a reformed character. My disability means I’m practically a virgin again.” Stafford-Clark, 76, has been a leading figure in theatre since the mid-1970s. He was the artistic director of the Royal Court from 1979 until 1993, when he set up the theatre company Out of Joint. In 2006, he suffered a stroke, which left him using a walking stick and wheelchair. A statement by a spokesperson for Stafford-Clark said he “wholeheartedly” apologised for “any inappropriate behaviour that made some former colleagues feel uncomfortable”, adding that it was never his intention to bully or harass. Abolins said her complaint referred to a number of incidents. She said Stafford-Clark had previously asked her to try on a bikini she had bought and told her she should have casual sex and tell him about it. Abolins, who joined the company in August 2016 and runs the company’s education programme, said she was left embarrassed and shocked after the comment that provoked her complaint. “I didn’t know what to say,” she said. “And I felt really victimised actually – that was him exerting his power over me in a crude manner. I felt really bullied and objectified. To me, it felt that he was saying, ‘I’m going to tell you exactly what I would have done to you and there is nothing you can do about it’. ” Abolins said that because of Stafford-Clark’s ill health, she did not initially think he could make her feel uncomfortable. “What I’ve learned from this experience is that appearances can be deceiving and you don’t have to be a fighting fit person to make someone feel bullied,” she said. A spokesperson for Stafford-Clark said the director had suffered from pseudobulbar palsy and “occasional disinhibition” since a stroke and brain injury in 2006. “Mr Stafford-Clark’s occasional loss of the ability to inhibit urges results in him displaying disinhibited and compulsive behaviour and his usual (at times provocative) behaviour being magnified, often causing inappropriate social behaviour,” said the statement. “Whilst this is an explanation it isn’t an attempt to dismiss his behaviour and he apologises for any offence caused.” Abolins made a formal complaint to the company in July, who gave her leave and suspended the director during an investigation. She said Out of Joint took her seriously and had been “kind and supportive”. In August, she was told that Stafford-Clark had been subsequently asked to leave. But she said she was left feeling “upset, frustrated, a little angry” at how his departure was announced without any reference to the complaint. “I did feel like he’d got away with it,” she said. Sources inside Out of Joint said there was “unhappiness and unrest” over some aspects of how the matter was dealt with, but said there was confidence that staff in the company had acted “swiftly and correctly”. Other women who have worked with Stafford-Clark said he also made lewd comments to them. Three women, including Abolins, told the Guardian that Stafford-Clark asked them about losing their virginity. Abolins said the director asked her and another woman the question during auditions for Rita, Sue and Bob Too, in which two 15-year-old girls have a sexual affair with a married man. The playwright Rachel De-Lahay said she was asked this question in reference to the play on a separate occasion and had “found herself over-talking and rambling through this story”. Later she said she was angry “not because he asked me but because I had answered”. A woman who worked for Stafford-Clark as a personal assistant in 2016 said the director asked her about losing her virginity several times. Steffi Holtz, 25, told the Guardian the director had a reputation for always being “outrageous”, which allowed him to get away with making inappropriate comments. Like Abolins, Holtz said Stafford-Clark had made comments about her appearance. On another occasion, as she was leaving his office he said “You’ve got a really nice arse” and tapped her on her bottom, she said. Holtz said: “The worst thing he said, I was sat at his desk and he said, ‘If you were sat on the desk there in front of me I would eat you out.’ Coming from a 75-year-old man, I was in absolute shock. You feel so uncomfortable … It makes me feel so uncomfortable to even say that.” Holtz did not make a complaint and left the role after about 18 months. “I didn’t feel brave or confident enough at that time of my life to challenge that authority.” Stafford-Clark’s spokesman said the director did not remember all of the incidents put to him and denied any physical contact “of a sexual nature”. Holtz, like Abolins, said she wanted to speak out to help other women with similar experiences feel that they could come forward. “One of the most important things to me in my life is being a feminist, working towards equality and allowing women the same voice as men and to not have repercussions when they use that voice,” she said. Abolins said: “We are at an important time, where people are standing up and telling their stories. If more people can find the strength to speak out, hopefully we can make a real difference.” A spokesperson for Out of Joint did not comment specifically on the reasons for Stafford-Clark’s departure but said: “Out of Joint is a responsible employer taking our duty of care, and that of maintaining confidence, extremely seriously. This applies to existing and former employees, and to people engaged by our organisation. “In any environment, providing a forum for calling out inappropriate conduct is key, or it risks going undetected. We admire, support and act swiftly, and effectively, to protect those who bravely use their voice to report wrongdoing concerns.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/21/miguel-frank-ocean-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-21T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Miguel: On his 'crazy' ego, beefing with Frank Ocean and Trump sex jams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/21/miguel-frank-ocean-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/21/miguel-frank-ocean-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"Miguel: On his 'crazy' ego, beefing with Frank Ocean and Trump sex jams","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Miguel is currently stripped off, right down to his pants. I’m aware there are people who would pay good money to be in the position I’m in right now, although I should point out that there’s nothing overly sexy about the scene. “Almost there!” calls out the diminutive R&amp;B star when I interrupt what appears to be a frantic wardrobe session. Our photographer has been waiting almost an hour at this point, but getting the outfit right is important business for Miguel. He turned up wearing a baggy white jumper, after all, and so an epic transformation is clearly in the works. Another 20 minutes pass before Miguel finally emerges, resplendent in ... um, the same baggy white jumper and a pair of brightly coloured Gucci shorts. “OK, ready,” he grins, before wandering off again to have his hair and makeup done. That turns out to be another lengthy process that doesn’t appear to make any perceptible difference to his appearance, although the devil will almost certainly be in the detail. After spending a couple of days with Miguel, I soon realise he’s a guy who thrives on perfectionism. Earlier in the day, when we met for a morning coffee, Miguel expressed a desire to talk to me about a “taboo” subject. This turned out to be a nagging dissatisfaction with his own career so far. “You’re not supposed to say: ‘I wanted it to be better, or to perform better,’” he said. “But we all want our shit to win. So for artists to pretend they’re OK with their shit not being the best ... I mean, that’s not real.” Miguel’s negative appraisal of his success to date might come as a surprise to some, seeing as his last album, Wildheart, a critically acclaimed fusion of pop, soul, funk and rock, went to No 2 on the US chart and earned itself two Grammy nominations. Yet its creator was not content. He had poured everything into Wildheart – and was especially proud of the album’s underlying message about outsiderdom and self-acceptance – but when he went out to tour the album, not enough people knew the songs or connected to the deeper messages he was hoping to convey. “Apart from in the US,” he points out. “Oh my God, there it was magic. I felt like I was really helping, really contributing. People were telling me how powerful and life-changing it was. But then we came to Europe and … ” He pauses for a moment. “Actually, here in the UK, it was amazing too, I love playing here. But when I got to the non-English speaking countries …” Hang on, you’re basically saying that you’re disheartened because your Grammy-nominated album wasn’t making a big enough impact in Denmark? He smiles: “I’m pretty tough on myself, I guess.” To be fair on Miguel, Wildheart didn’t sell in the same numbers as his previous breakthrough album, 2012’s Kaleidoscope Dream; it had great songs but lacked a single as killer as his Sexual Healing-esque Adorn. It was this failure, Miguel says, that led to a period of self-doubt that started to worry his friends and family. “I lost touch with my emotions,” he admits. “It was a down period. I was just … quiet. Real quiet. And also putting up a front, like I was OK with everything when I really wasn’t. I put up a wall so it was hard for my friends and family to help. I was there, but not really present. We just did small talk – yeah, everything’s good – without getting to the meat.” What he really needed was to talk it through, and eventually he did. “It’s like any player of a sport, they’re like: ‘I don’t know how we just lost!’ You have to go study the tapes and work it out. So that’s what we did, so that when I’d built up the energy to do this again, I didn’t repeat the mistakes.” Miguel changed his management, built a new team around him and resolved to make a more upbeat album that nevertheless spoke to these troubled times. The title of the record, War &amp; Leisure, sums it up: an album of party tunes laced with an unsettling undercurrent. “You see us on the brink of nuclear war over Twitter,” he says. “Or the rise of the far right in Germany and France. So my whole mindset for the album is: what are we supposed to do caught in the middle of this? We’re at the brink of complete war and complete pleasure, at all times, every day.” Later that day, over lunch, there’s a pretty perfect example of what Miguel means. He’s wearing the kind of ludicrous fluffy Gucci loafers that only a pop star could consider pulling off, and tucking into a salmon fillet on a bed of aubergine, when an alert on his phone distracts him. “Oh, Donald Trump, why are you such a schmuck?” he says, shaking his head. “There are a million better things to be tweeting about right now than ESPN’s ratings.” He returns to his food, and tries to shake his disquiet away by changing the subject. “I think one day I will write a children’s book about my cats,” he declares, before showing me pictures of two outrageously cute creatures that resemble living, breathing Gizmos: “This one is called Munchie,” he says with fatherly pride, “and this is Vanity.” The unwelcome intrusion of brutal reality into people’s previously comfortable lives is a theme that pops up on the album, never more so than on the video to Told You So – previewed for me on his manager’s laptop – where Miguel’s dance routine is rudely interrupted from time to time by ballistic missiles. On first listen the song appears to be your standard amorous R&amp;B track (“I am gonna show you the world and all that you desire”), but Miguel says he loves the fact it has layers of meaning: “It’s really about the times,” he says. You’ve made the world’s first Trump sex jam?He spits out a mouthful of coffee at this: “Now that would be really multi-layered.” Elsewhere, War &amp; Leisure is dotted with references to darker things: 9/11, Columbine, the building of walls. “It’s a call to action,” he says. “My generation are the adults now. We hold the responsibility to shape the world we’re now living in for our children. It’s crazy but I feel like I’m a fucking parent.” Miguel’s Instagram hints at these changing priorities: mixed in with fashion shoots and the occasional scantily clad lady, are political statements that reference the current turbulence in the States: “Fuck yo statue,” reads a sign on one, taken from the events in Charlottesville. Has he been surprised to see just how extreme the racial tensions simmering under the surface in the US were? “You would be stupid to live in the United States and think or believe otherwise,” he says. “It’s just that now there’s ways to prove it.” Is there a comfort in having everything out in the open? “That’s how I feel,” he nods. “You have to hit the bottom, you have to feel the pain and take it in ... that’s often how we learn. It’s painful to watch police being let off for heinous crimes that would be punished if they were a different race. But we know now that we can’t continue to deal with it in the way that we had been dealing with it. We need to figure out a different route.” What would he say if he met Donald Trump? “He wouldn’t invite me to meet him,” he says, a little forlornly. “I mean, who am I? A C-list celebrity.” You’re being down on yourself again, I say. “You know what I mean, though. Why would we be in the same room? I don’t have the answers. There’s someone with much better answers than I do.” Instead, Miguel has been learning to protest in more subtle ways. Wearing a jauntily angled policeman’s hat in the artwork for slinky new single Sky Walker, for instance. “That’s kind of a punk thing, reminds me of some Clash shit,” he says, while admitting it’s also a comment on police racism: “I rarely do anything for no reason.” During a recent appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Miguel wore a shirt with the pro-DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] statement “Keep the kids. Deport the racist,” emblazoned on it. He also covered Pussy Riot’s Make America Great Again, a song he says is so simple as to be perfect. “And I just love Nadya. To be an active activist to the point of being incarcerated for two years? That just makes you love her more.” Refreshing as Miguel’s more outre tastes are, you can’t help but worry if they might ultimately thwart him from reaching the kind of global success he craves. His new songs are undoubtedly great (the Marvin Gaye-stylings of Pineapple Skies, in particular, feels like a conscious attempt to please the Adorn faithful and re-establish Miguel’s reputation as a reliable pop hitmaker) but the slightly wishy-washy political message that comes with them seems caught between two places: potentially alienating a mainstream crowd, yet appearing a bit vague compared to the truly politicised likes of Solange and Kendrick. At a show the following night such conflicts are on full show – especially in some meandering spoken-word sections about needing to come together and love each other. Miguel’s music, too, seems caught in a bit of an identity crisis: for all his talk of moving on from Wildheart, he seems to have doubled down on that album’s rockier leanings. The result is a show where all the soulful edges of Miguel’s music are bludgeoned to death by cheesy rock backing, right down to the hair-metal guitar solos and thundering drums. While admiring Miguel’s broad tastes, and restless creative urges, you start to wonder if all this is the answer to connecting with that crowd in Denmark. Maybe they don’t want an obscure Pussy Riot cover, I suggest … He nods: “Maybe they don’t.” The next day, Miguel invites me to Radio 1’s Live Lounge to watch him cover Jorja Smith’s On My Mind. His band are tight and soulful – a much more appealing take on his sound compared to the rock antics of his live show – and Miguel seems relaxed and happy. I wonder where all his self-criticism and competitive instincts come from, and he says it’s his father; he was an athlete who played several sports and instilled a desire to win in his son. What was Miguel’s sport? “Soccer,” he says. “I was really good, had my parents not split up I could have played through school and college.” I get the feeling that wherever Miguel ended up playing, he would have always been on the hunt for a better team. “Right?” he says. Then he changes his mind. “No, no, no … actually I would have wanted to build my own squad wherever I was. And be like, we’re going to win here. I would definitely have wanted to win.” This streak was on display when I first met Miguel in 2013. He was sparky and good company but frustrated that he hadn’t been nominated for a Grammy yet (something he swiftly fixed by winning one for Adorn). He also cheekily boasted about his breakthrough Kaleidoscope Dream being a better album than Frank Ocean’s lauded Channel Orange (for what it’s worth, I agree). The Ocean rivalry was something Miguel returned to in later interviews but, looking back, he says he’s embarrassed by it. “Egos are a crazy thing,” he says. “The version of myself I was two, three, four years ago, even last week, is different to who I am today. That’s not who I am. And I’m a big fan of his music and his creativity; we need more people out there doing that.” He says he has no envy of Ocean’s career, because they want different things. I ask him what he wants that’s different and he pauses. “I want it all,” he decides after a while. “I want to reach the world. To be charismatic, to reach a standard of performance where I connect with people on a real level from a big stage. I don’t know how you really do that, but I wanna do it. And I can’t blame myself for being like that; it’s in my programming.” War &amp; Leisure is out later this year"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/20/wizard-the-magic-of-harry-potter-at-the-british-library","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Wizard!

The magic of Harry Potter at the British Library","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When he wrote a poem for his secretary and lover Betty Mackereth in 1976, Philip Larkin sent it with a note: “Flog it to Texas if it seems embarrassing.” The joke was self-indulgent: Larkin knew libraries and archives – such as the Harry Ransom Centre, in Texas – would hurl themselves off a proverbial cliff just to get his scraps. Even his shopping list could be lucrative, so long as he signed it. The British Library in London currently has a veritable goldmine papering its walls. Its Harry Potter exhibition is an eclectic curation of old books, scrolls and ephemera that have some (occasionally tenuous) connection to JK Rowling’s world. And among the Chinese fortune-telling bones (circa 1000 BC) and garden gnomes (circa 1900) are Rowling’s drafts for some of the bestselling books of all time. While some authors would baulk at showing anyone, let alone hundreds of thousands of museum visitors, their “process”, Rowling is entirely unafraid of sharing even her ropiest Potter ideas in public. She does so at talks, on Twitter and on a website, Pottermore, where she publishes all her unexplored, unfinished plots for a starry-eyed audience. Dumbledore is gay! Harry’s grandfather made hair products! Lupin and Tonks got married in a pub in Scotland! Even for a fan, it is easy to feel suspicious of this seemingly endless post-Potter expansion. There is no hidden significance or justifying quality in Rowling’s titbits that explains their publication. No, we now know Harry’s transfiguration teacher Professor McGonagall had two brothers and a husband who died because Rowling and her publishers believe our appetite for Potter is insatiable – and on that, they’re probably right. What luck then, that Rowling has always written with pen on paper and has produced such a treasure trove, and how lucky too that revealing her failed or abandoned ideas is not an embarrassment to her, even when cushioned by such success. The British Library exhibition shows a lot of them: an early draft of The Philosopher’s Stone in which Voldemort is described as a snort-worthy “red-eyed dwarf”; a deleted part from The Chamber of Secrets, where the Weasleys’ flying car is rescued by mer-people after landing in the lake instead of the Whomping Willow; a clumsy scene from a Philosopher’s Stone draft, in which Hagrid pays a visit to Cornelius Fudge, the magical minister in the books and only an ordinary MP in the draft (“Mrs Fudge and I were thinking of moving to Portugal. We have a villa …”), who also has a colleague called Vernone Dursley, whose son is named Didsbury. There are countless tiny glimpses of characters that would never be: it’s hard not to wonder what Enid Pettigrew, Oakden Hernshaw and Mylor Silvanus, all named, then abandoned, would have been like. Rowling’s scratched out, scrawled pages show the extensive tweaking she performed on her writing, from The Philosopher’s Stone to The Deathly Hallows. There are little annotations scattered everywhere (“[This way],” ends one page, with a backwards arrow, a helpful direction for its author). The short-term brain freezes are visible (“‘Hermione, let me down!’ Harry yelled”, is scrawled out on a page of The Deathly Hallows and replaced with just: “‘X’ yelled Harry”). Perhaps the most interesting writing on the pages is not Rowling’s but that of her editors. Some of their notes read almost as chastisements of her imagination – such as one on a page from The Half-Blood Prince, where Harry notes that a potion his teacher has just shown him takes six months to make (“So Slughorn has some ready prepared for their first lesson, presumably!”), or the abandoned watery end for the Weasleys’ flying car (“I wondered whether the mer-people scene actually works?”). One particularly funny query is found on a draft of The Half-Blood Prince, where an editor circled a “dammit” dropped by 16-year-old Ron: “At this age, swearing would be so much stronger??” (Harry and company are not known for their effing and jeffing). Cynics will view these manuscripts as the miserable dregs from an over-lauded cup of tea. They are actually hugely impressive – because, for all the notes and editor marks, the most amazing revelation is how sure Rowling seemed about her creation from the start. A handwritten draft of the Sorting Hat song has barely any changes, Harry’s class list is exact, and her hand-drawn map of the Hogwarts grounds, complete with a wonky giant squid bobbing in the lake, is the school we know. But with so many proposed alternatives and unfinished ideas made public, both here and on Pottermore, it’s hard not to suspect that Rowling may end up like Nabokov, Kafka or a literary Tupac Shakur: either having her every note pored over posthumously for another book, or cursed into an artistic purgatory with awful output she never intended to release. This is not to suggest Rowling does a Salinger (burn her notebooks, retreat to live on a diet of raw food and I Love Lucy). Perhaps Terry Pratchett had the right idea: take a steamroller to the lot. Still, even his thoroughly squashed computer drive is now on display, in a museum in Salisbury. Harry Potter, a Journey Through the History of Magic, is at the British Library, London NW1, until 28 February, and the New York Historical Society from October 2018.

I was given a number to ring and an operator, who struggled to speak either English or French, assured me that it would be delivered to my lodgings (90 minutes’ drive away) the following day, which was a Sunday. I spent most of the first day of my holiday waiting for it. It turned out that the delivery service employed by BA does not work on Sunday, and that the call centre was based in Madrid, hence the language barrier. I called back on the Monday and was sent a text confirming that the case, containing all my clothes and my camera, would be delivered that day. It wasn’t. On Tuesday, I got through to lost luggage at the airport and was told that Monday had been a public holiday and the courier service did not operate. It took them four full days to restore my missing luggage. I filed a complaint with BA and received no response, so I wrote to the CEO. Three weeks passed with no reply. I then rang and, after hanging on the line for 50 minutes, was told I would be reimbursed for the clothing but that there was no question of compensation for my spoiled holiday. Do you agree that I have a right to that? AC, London A moral right, possibly. But a legal right? No, unfortunately. If it had been you who had been delayed you would have been entitled to a statutory payout under European regulations to make up for the stress and inconvenience. But the stress and inconvenience of four days without clean underwear is not recognised. Airlines are expected to pay for emergency essentials such as toiletries and for expenses if you have to return to the airport to collect delayed luggage. They don’t have to compensate you for lost hours of your holiday, or even a missed onward connection if the missing luggage delays you. Nor will they countenance buying new fashion wear to replace old clothes, or replacements of valuable items if your bag goes astray. This why it’s important to buy decent travel insurance. The airline should, however, reunite bags with passengers as quickly as possible. “When bags are delayed our teams do everything they can to reunite customers with their belongings as quickly as possible,” says BA. “We also provide help with essentials while customers are waiting for their bags to arrive.” It has now refunded you the €190 you spent to tide you over. For any more you would have to approach your travel insurer if you took out a policy.

Yet the mid-century years saw many excellent artists turn to the art of dust jacket design, including John Piper, Edward Bawden and John Minton in the UK, and Ben Shahn and NC Wyeth in the United States. The decades from 1920 to 1970 seem to best cover the full flowering of this art form, when publishers first recognised the potential of the jacket as a “poster” rather than a purely functional wrapper. Dust jackets over this time mirrored the changing movements of art deco, post war neo-romanticism, kitchen-sink realism and 60s psychedelia. With a background as an artist and illustrator, I have occasionally been fortunate enough to be commissioned to design dust jackets myself. In The Illustrated Dust Jacket 1920-1970 I have selected designs by more than 50 artists, mostly from the UK and the US. Many of the books reproduced come from my own bookshelves: I am not a collector in the true sense but over the years I have acquired books from charity shops and second-hand bookshops (sadly now all but gone from our high streets). Selecting artists is a daunting task in which unforgivable omissions are an occupational hazard. As well as the more respected artists, I have a particular affection for many of the “jobbing” illustrators: those who are less well known but whose work was always of a high standard and who had long careers as commercial artists, such as Robert Micklewright, Heather Standring and, in the US, Arthur Hawkins Jr. Hawkins’s son Gill, a sculptor, told me that the proprietor of a New Jersey bookstore once told him: “I bought more bad mysteries because your dad’s covers were so good!” For the writer, however, the first sight of the cover design adorning their latest publication can be traumatic. As Jhumpa Lahiri confesses in her essay, The Clothing of Books: “The right cover is like a beautiful coat, elegant and warm, wrapping my words as they travel through the world, on their way to keep an appointment with my readers. The wrong cover is cumbersome, suffocating. Or it is like a too-light sweater: inadequate.” Ernest Hemingway was less diplomatic in his response to the heraldic figure composition on the jacket for A Farewell to Arms, designed by Cleonike (“Cleon”) Damianakes in 1929: “I cannot admire the awful legs on that woman or the gigantic belly muscles [on the man],” he wrote to his editor. A few years ago, in my capacity as an illustration tutor, I was regularly asked to speak at conferences whose themes were variously related to the death of the paper book. Picturebook apps were going to replace the physical children’s book. A succession of steep graphs would appear on screen, showing ski-slope decline in book-buying and precipitously climbing e-reader sales. Books needed to become more beautiful to compete. And, happily, it seems that appreciation of the physical, aesthetic properties of the book has in recent years returned: in 2016 ebook sales of consumer titles fell by 17% while total physical sales rose by 8%. Designed as objects of desire, books now demand to be picked up and touched: jackets are embossed, debossed, spot-laminated and printed on beautiful papers. The jackets are adorned with the work of many our finest contemporary artists and print-makers, such as Mark Hearld, Carry Akroyd, Jeff Fisher and Bill Bragg. Our bookshops are once again filled with, if not squawking parrots, beautifully plumed songbirds. • Martin Salisbury’s The Illustrated Dust Jacket 1920-1970 (Thames &amp; Hudson, £24.95) is out now.

Jeremy Corbyn has her number","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Misery on misery. If prime minister’s questions was a war zone, it would have been declared a humanitarian disaster by now. Theresa May arrived in the chamber already looking shell-shocked and left an abject wreck. She appears hollowed out both as a person and a politician, a walking dead Maybot for whom every minute spent in the job is complete agony. The prime minister knows she is hopelessly out of her depth and would like nothing more than to be put out of her misery, but is forced to endure the suffering because the Tories have no one better to replace her. Each day she remains in office, she appears just a little more diminished. On her current rate of disintegration, there will be little left of the Maybot by the end of next spring. She is learning the hard way that when everything that can go wrong goes wrong, there is still more that can go wrong. If Brexit doesn’t get you, then the economy will. And if both of them give you a momentary break, there’s universal credit waiting round the corner. Politics works to its own laws of quantity theory. So the worse that the prime minister becomes, the more assured Jeremy Corbyn becomes. Give him a few more weeks and he will look like a natural orator. Not that he needs to get much better as he is already running rings round Theresa. It’s not just that his questions now combine bite and insight with occasional flashes of wit; it’s that most of the country now think he’s on the side of the angels. “I welcome the fall in today’s unemployment figures,” Corbyn began. It’s a measure of just how confident he is feeling that he can afford to bring up the one bit of moderately good news the government has had in recent weeks. Theresa looked taken aback, shocked even. She had been hoping to use the figures as her “get out of jail free” card for every question to which she didn’t have an answer. Now, she was fatally holed below the waterline before battle had even begun. Corbyn went for the kill. Most of the new jobs were rubbish jobs that paid the minimum wage. Could she explain why wages were on average lower than they were 10 years ago? “Are falling wages the sign of a strong economy?” he asked. Strange times indeed. Yesterday Labour had been the voice of business. Today it was the voice of economic competence. The Maybot’s mouth open and closed. Things were basically fine. People weren’t really as poor as they thought they were. This could have been the first time a Conservative prime minister has championed false consciousness. Corbyn wondered if she could go for another first in PMQs and answer a direct question. That was beyond her. With the government having earlier in the day given in to his suggestion that the universal credit helpline be made free, Corbyn tried his luck and asked if Theresa would go further and pause the rollout of universal credit entirely? “Yes,” said Theresa. The Labour benches fell about laughing; the Tories looked appalled. The prime minister had meant to follow the yes with a but, but her voice operating system had failed. By the time it had been rebooted, the damage had been done. All that came out thereafter was pure uncoded Maybot. “We-are-going-to-change-in-relation-to-telephone-charge,” she said, her voice laced with desperation. Universal credit was absolutely great and all the people who said it was a complete mess should ring the helpline to find out just how well it was working. Several Labour MPs were disinclined to take the prime minister at her word. Laura Pidcock wondered whether her refusal to rethink was “gross incompetence” or “calculated cruelty”. Theresa didn’t know – presumably it was too close to call – and merely reiterated her insistence that everything was working near enough perfectly and that if everyone worked just harder then there would be no need for them to claim benefits in the first place. The Tory benches were by now reduced to near silence. Even for the bloodsport enthusiasts this was a bit too much. Many sloped away early, but a few diehard loyalists tried to cheer her up by throwing her a few planted questions that she stood an even chance of being able to answer. It was their way of letting her know that she was a worthwhile person in her own right, that they loved her regardless of how bad she was and that everything was going to be OK. But it wasn’t. It really wasn’t. If Theresa was a pet, she’d have been put down by now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/18/in-armando-iannucci-film-stalin-gets-a-taste-of-his-own-disregard-for-facts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T18:08:57Z","webTitle":"In Armando Iannucci’s film, Stalin gets a taste of his own disregard for facts | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/18/in-armando-iannucci-film-stalin-gets-a-taste-of-his-own-disregard-for-facts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/18/in-armando-iannucci-film-stalin-gets-a-taste-of-his-own-disregard-for-facts","fields":{"headline":"In Armando Iannucci’s film, Stalin gets a taste of his own disregard for facts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Richard Overy’s review of Armando Iannucci’s film The Death of Stalin (Carry on up the Kremlin, G2, 18 October) is splendid, not least in its drawing out of the significance of its historical errors. Nevertheless, his critique omits the following consideration, which points out a positive merit of the film: the film’s sardonic irony implements Stalin’s own psychopathic misuse of facts and interpretation to depict him. In other words, Stalin is given more than a taste of his own disregard for truth. Stalin needs to be immersed in his own shit from an original viewpoint for us to apprehend the film’s fresh exposing aspects of Stalin’s psychotic identities. This film comedy is not only deadly serious – it profoundly encodes in humour the poetics of the tragedy that is Stalin’s evil. Arthur Gibson Cambridge • David Davis’s claim of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 being all about “buying time” (Letters, 18 October) is like similar claims about Chamberlain at Munich – risible historical revisionism. If Stalin was really concerned with buying time while Soviet reforms were completed, why was he still merrily engaged in the wholesale slaughter without trial of anyone who looked at him in a funny way, from top generals to the merest peasant? Why did the Nazi Blitzkrieg on 22 June 1941 take the Soviets completely by surprise (and despite umpteen warnings from other nations)? Why in particular did the Nazis and Soviets between 12 and 14 November 1940 negotiate the Soviet Union’s entry into the axis, which only failed over disagreements over spheres of influence? No, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was nothing more than two bullies coordinating their collective shakedown of their weaker neighbours, who, once there was nothing else left easy to despoil, began eyeing up each other to satisfy their perpetual greed, for there is no honour among thieves. Mark Boyle Johnstone, Renfrewshire • Reading David Davis’s astonishing defence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact (and the Soviet partition of Poland with Nazi Germany), I was inevitably reminded of AP Herbert’s satirical wartime poem Less Nonsense: “In 1940, when we bore the brunt / We could have done, boys, with ‘a second front’. / A continent went down a cataract / But Russia did not think it right to act. / Not ready? No. And who shall call her wrong? / Far better not to strike till you are strong. / Better, perhaps (though this was not our fate) / To make new treaties with the man you hate.” How depressing that, nearly 80 years later, that shabby and cynical pact still has its advocates. Andrew Connell Cardiff • David Davis has a rather rose-tinted view of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact. It is true that it kept a slice of Poland (and the Baltic states) out of Hitler’s hands, at least for 22 months, but why did Stalin insist upon imposing his style of repression upon their populations, with mass deportations to Siberia and the killing of several thousand Polish officers at Katyn – or does Davis still believe Moscow’s wartime lie that the Nazis did it? Yes, the pact did buy time for Moscow, but, in that case, why did Stalin do nothing to build defences in the newly obtained land? And why did Stalin do nothing to prepare for a German invasion, and refuse to act on the numerous reports that an invasion was in the offing? That the Soviet forces were woefully unprepared for the invasion was shown by their confused and largely ineffectual conduct as the Wehrmacht stormed in on 22 June 1941. Had Stalin ordered a proper defensive strategy over the previous months, the Wehrmacht would have been stalled and repelled well before it reached, as it did, the outskirts of Moscow. Stalin squandered the temporal and territorial advantages that the pact offered. Moreover, the execution of 30,000 officers and the jailing and killing of many hundreds of thousands of civilians in Stalin’s purges a few years previously hardly helped guarantee the country’s military, industrial and administrative readiness for war – or does Davis still believe that they were “traitors”, as Moscow insisted at the time?

With the schools budget in England slashed by £2.8bn since 2015 – an average of £53,000 and £178,000 for each primary and secondary school respectively – this is increasingly the reality for teachers. New research from the National Education Union (the newly merged National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers) and TES has revealed that 94% of teachers are having to pay for school essentials such as books, while 73% are regularly paying for stationery supplies, because their schools are underfunded. For some, expenses total £1,000, while two-thirds have made cash donations – and this comes on top of the 42% of parents who were asked to donate to their children’s school this year. Other parents and carers have been asked to supply teaching equipment such as stationery and books, in addition to essentials such as toilet paper. Here, five teachers describe how the schools funding crisis is hitting them in the pocket. Dan, Isle of Wight Staff have always been willing to spend some of their own money for the odd item, such as prizes for children, but the funding cuts are digging deep. This is making it hard for schools to manage without being subsidised by staff and parents. It is wrong to rely on our goodwill to meet the shortfall, when pay has fallen over the past 10 years. The government needs to adequately fund schools so children can enjoy a full curriculum in properly resourced institutions. What used to happen is that if you bought something for your department, you were able to claim it back. But the process today is so arduous and time-consuming that it is simpler just to pay and not claim, rather than ask to be reimbursed only to be ignored. I am constantly purchasing plastic wallets, Blu Tack, staples, sticky tape and card, and even batteries for remotes, because there isn’t enough money in the budget. Or I’ll find an activity where we don’t need to use things such as glue. To save photocopying budgets, I have had to photocopy materials so small that students struggle to read them. We are also forced to buy significant numbers of foreign-language dictionaries. I have had to buy portable hard drives because the school hard drives are so full that I would need to delete older teaching materials if I want to save anything. It is now an unspoken expectation that staff spend their own money to do their job properly. Would we expect a dentist to provide his own drill tips or a policeman to provide his own handcuffs? I hope the answer is no. Martin, north-west England I am a technology teacher and I’ve had to buy resources for my classes on many occasions. Recently, the technician, the head of department and I totalled the receipts of everything we had to buy that the kids needed over the year, above and beyond what the school would give us, and it was £5,500 between us. You don’t show the school the receipts for materials including wood, glue, nails, screws and plastic, because you can’t get the money. Our technology department gets 20p a student per project, even though we teach woodwork, and the budget is gone within a month. I would say that in about 90% of schools, kids have to pay for technology and their parents are asked for a £10-£20 donation each year. That should go to our department, but it doesn’t always; we’ll still have to buy our own equipment. What happens if we don’t buy the required equipment? Then we can’t do the work. We can’t get kids through the project and then they won’t get their GCSE. A lot of schools are binning off technology and vocational subjects because they see it as a financial burden. This means that kids who are better with their hands are getting pushed to one side. At times you are having to do things for the class over your own quality of life. I don’t think you will find a happy teacher in the country. Rachel, north-west England Schools are seriously underfunded and, as a result, massively under-resourced. Staff are not being replaced so teachers are covering subjects they do not specialise in. School trips are practically nonexistent and schools are taking on more students than they can handle in an attempt to secure more money. Therefore class sizes are increasing. All this means that I am unable to do my job properly. I have a teaching and pastoral role, so I have seen the number of students with significant mental health issues increase while resources to support them decrease. Students increasingly have high anxiety and I have seen others self-harm and voice suicidal thoughts. However, there isn’t the pastoral support to help them any more, nor is there external support due to cuts to local authorities. I often buy resources for the class, such as highlighters, notebooks, reading books and magazines. I also buy students their lunch if the school is being awkward about dinner money or they don’t have enough money on their account. My husband and I are both teachers, so the pay freeze has affected our standard of living and things are tough; money is tighter than it has ever been; we both have to make tiny savings to get through the week. Staff morale is the lowest I have ever known it. Teachers are being stretched in so many different directions. Any time teachers might have once had to prep at school and complete the ever-increasing amount of admin is being taken away to cover for staff who aren’t being replaced. The mental health and safety of students is being compromised and staff are angry that they are powerless to support students. Rick, north-east England I have tried not bringing in resources and equipment such as pens for class to see what would happen. The child will sit there and say: “Well, I’m not doing any work then.” And then you have to start taking action against their behaviour, which feels like a massive overreaction. If kids are given £2 for their lunch, then they’re not going to spend 10p on a pen; they’re going to get something to eat. It is incredibly difficult to operate like this. Ultimately, it comes down to the teacher being told: “Just give them a pen.” Nobody ever questions where that pen comes from. The “I haven’t got any” argument quickly gets turned into: “Well, how do you expect the kids to have pens if you don’t?” The same argument goes for books. If you argue that we don’t have the right texts, you just get told: “Well, you’ll have to make do – other schools do.” It’s just the way of the world at the moment. The pressures on most schools mean that there is no excuse and there is very little understanding. If either you or the child need something the school cannot provide, then you either work around it or put your hand in your pocket. We are all careful with the school budget, but I spend £250 of my own money every year. Teachers often have to provide all the extra materials to give kids the opportunity to expand their learning, as with art projects. That often comes from their own pockets, or from their recycling bins, to be quite honest. It is not at all surprising that so many teachers don’t last. On top of that, our pay isn’t keeping pace with inflation and we are getting measured left, right and centre. There’s not a lot left to really keep people in it. Linda, north-east England The school supplies the normal, day-to-day things such as pens, rubbers and books, but that’s it. I spend at least £1,000 every year – that’s a holiday I could have taken my kids on, because we couldn’t afford one last year. We are not well paid to start with and I am the only wage-earner in my household because my husband is medically retired. When I walk in with the shopping each day, my children ask whether it’s for us or the children at school. Every time I go out and buy something for school, that’s taking something away from my children. I have to justify this to myself every day. Funding year-on-year is going down and costs are going up. Something has to give. It’s as if I have a choice between going out and buying equipment myself, or a member of staff losing their job – which is something that’s happening across the county. This week, my primary school children are going to be doing crafts, so I have gone out and bought gems and other bits and bobs, plus gold paint, because there is none in the school. It has definitely got worse over the last couple of years. My class has a high percentage of SEN (special educational needs) children and they really struggle with their maths and literacy; but they deserve to want to come to school, have hands-on experiences and enjoy learning. If I am not prepared to go the extra mile, then they won’t get to have these experiences. I will send a letter home asking the parents to send in stuff that they might have in their house. But you have got to be very aware of the family’s circumstances; children are living in deprivation across the country. It’s ridiculous that we have to ask parents to supply things that should be readily available. All teachers’ names have been changed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/18/too-rude-for-paris-copulating-sculpture-causes-stir-in-french-capital","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T15:26:06Z","webTitle":"Too rude for Paris?

'Copulating' sculpture causes stir in French capital","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"From a vandalised butt-plug to a desecrated “queen’s vagina”, Paris has often been at the centre of rows over whether some public art is supposedly too rude to go on show. But the latest spat over a giant metal sculpture of a box-like figure appearing to copulate with a geometric being on all fours is proof that the label “too rude” can, for some Paris museums, be seen as a badge of pride. Domestikator, a 12-metre-high, 30-tonne rust-red work by the Dutch sculptor Joep van Lieshout, has just been installed in Paris’s prime spot for modern sculpture: the esplanade of the Pompidou Centre modern art museum. But it was only given refuge there after being rejected by the more genteel Louvre museum as too sexual in the city’s latest sculpture spat. The work was initially to be shown in the Tuileries Garden, adjacent to the Louvre – France’s most visited museum – as part of the annual international contemporary art fair in the French capital. But at the last minute the Louvre’s president, Jean-Luc Martinez, backed out of hosting it, fearing controversy. In a letter to FIAC’s organisers, Martinez said that internet posts and social media about the sculpture had created “an erroneous perception of this work that might be too rude for the traditional crowd in the Tuileries Garden”. The Louvre’s decision came after discussion online about whether van Lieshout’s work looked animal or human and whether it was too tacky and lewd to stand outside France’s most prestigious museum. The Louvre only usually shows modern works if they are linked to or commissioned around its own historic collections. The artist van Lieshout insisted his sculpture was in no way explicit, saying it was about highlighting “the questions raised by domestication in our world” and was not intended to elicit a sexual interpretation. “I was surprised first of all, and then of course disappointed, because [the Louvre Museum] couldn’t show the art work,” he told Reuters. “I don’t think it’s very sexually explicit. I mean, I don’t know what I can do to make it less sexually explicit.” He insisted that his work defined the domestication of animals by humans for agriculture and industry, highlighting the ethical issues surrounding that. The Pompidou Centre said the work was in no way obscene, rather that it was funny. Bernard Blistène, the Pompidou director, argued: “Obscene, pornographic? Well, obscenity is everywhere, pornography, sadly, is everywhere – certainly not in this work of art.” The sculpture had been displayed for three years in Bochum, Germany with no controversy. But Paris is fertile ground not just for seeing racy connotations in modern sculpture, but also for vandalism against outdoor works deemed controversial. Three years ago, the American artist Paul McCarthy put up his work Tree – described as resembling a giant inflatable “butt-plug” – near the French justice ministry and Ritz hotel in Paris’s Place Vendôme, only to become the target of a conservative backlash. When McCarthy then had his face slapped in public and vandals cut the inflatable sculpture’s cables, the artist decided to give up on the installation. At the time Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said the incident was an unacceptable attack on artistic freedom. In 2015, the artist Anish Kapoor’s Dirty Installation, a vast steel funnel amid broken stone on the lawns of the Château de Versailles – described as “the vagina of the queen” taking power – sparked rightwing complaints and was twice vandalised with antisemitic graffiti."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/22/i-am-not-a-witch-review-magical-surrealism-margaret-mulubwa-rungano-nyoni","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"I Am Not a Witch review – magical surrealism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/22/i-am-not-a-witch-review-magical-surrealism-margaret-mulubwa-rungano-nyoni","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/22/i-am-not-a-witch-review-magical-surrealism-margaret-mulubwa-rungano-nyoni","fields":{"headline":"I Am Not a Witch review – magical surrealism","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In a remote Zambian village, a nine-year-old girl (Margaret Mulubwa) is accused of being a witch and given a stark choice: to accept her supernatural branding and live a tethered life as a sorceress, or to cut her ties with local tradition and be transformed into a goat that may be killed and eaten for supper. Thus begins this bewilderingly strange yet terrifically sure-footed feature debut from writer-director Rungano Nyoni. Born in Zambia and part-raised in Wales, Nyoni first made international waves with such award-winning shorts as Mwansa the Great (2011) and Listen (2014). Now, this daringly satirical parable of magic and misogyny, superstition and social strictures confirms her promise as a film-maker of fiercely independent vision, with a bright future ahead. Unsurprisingly opting to embrace her supernatural status, the young heroine of I Am Not a Witch is sent to the local “witch camp”, an enslaved tourist attraction. Here, the women offer a sense of community and protection to the all-but-silent newcomer, whom they name Shula (“it means ‘to be uprooted’”). But when government official Mr Banda (Henry BJ Phiri) declares that “you are my little witch now”, a strange form of celebrity looms. Soon, Shula is being paraded around local courts and TV stations, dispensing divine justice and hawking magical eggs – all for the profit of her garrulous keeper. “What if she’s actually just a child?” asks the presenter of the Smooth Talk chatshow, a question that is met with stony silence from her “state guardian”. Nyoni was apparently inspired by real-life reports of witchcraft accusations in Zambia, and her research took her to Ghana, where she became the first foreigner to sleep in one of the world’s oldest “witch camps”. Here, she observed first hand the daily rituals of these women whose fates have been sealed by “nothing more than hearsay”. Yet for all its factual grounding, I Am Not a Witch is also a work of fairytale invention, unravelling the threads of its quasi-mythical narrative with anarchic aplomb. In particular, the motif of women restrained from flight by vast lengths of white ribbon has a touch of Charles Perrault or the brothers Grimm – a magical-realist conceit that brilliantly dramatises the down-to-earth reality of the ties that bind. There’s a hint of the absurdist tragicomedy of Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Lobster too, as Shula faces a Kafkaesque choice between enforced conformity and metamorphosis. Brilliantly, Nyoni keeps her audience wondering whether they’re meant (or allowed?) to laugh or cry at this insane predicament, juxtaposing scenes of poignant despair with sociopolitical existential slapstick. Early accusations of witchcraft have an almost Pythonesque quality, while a sequence in which a show trial is interrupted by a mobile phone is pure farce. Fans of Chilean surrealist Alejandro Jodorowsky will warm to a streak of deadpan humour that is drier than the arid plains upon which Shula dances to summon the rain. Having worked monochrome miracles on Ciro Guerra’s Amazon odyssey Embrace of the Serpent, cinematographer David Gallego here conjures a kaleidoscope of arresting tableaux: lonely Shula listening through a blue horn to the distant laughter of schoolchildren carried on the wind; a huge orange truck with women tied to outstretched reels, like some mobile fairground ride; the open mouth of a giant head looming towards us, while a frightened child huddles within. These images are hauntingly composed and dreamily sustained, the length of the shots heightening comedy and tragedy alike, with heartbreaking results. Meanwhile, music cues swerve from Vivaldi to Estelle, keeping the audience on edge and uneasy. At the centre of it all is a group of nonprofessional players, led by young Margaret Mulubwa, who was discovered during a location recce in Luapula Province. And what a discovery she is! With a face that can transform from innocence to defiance in an instant, Mulubwa is a mesmerising screen presence, her stoical countenance broken occasionally by a radiant smile that lights up the landscape. As for Nyoni, her ability to blend cruel humour, pointed satire and empathetic anger to produce something touched by tragic transcendence is astonishing. In interviews, she has described watching Michael Haneke movies as “my film school” (perhaps those white ribbons are a homage?). Yet she has also talked enthusiastically about her love of the witchy 1996 teen fantasy The Craft. With such wide-ranging influences, who knows what this remarkable film-maker will do next? Having been spellbound by her audacious first feature, I can’t wait to find out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/18/domestikator-public-art-louvre-gallery-obscenity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T15:33:35Z","webTitle":"Domestikator is nasty public art.

The Louvre was quite right to reject it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The other day I walked into a Brussels art gallery where a colossal bronze woman was swooning in sensual ecstasy. In case of any confusion about its sexual content, this new sculpture by Tracey Emin is called All I Want Is You. I couldn’t help telling the artist she should erect it in a London park. “Erect” is the right word, for she jokes that from one angle it looks like a giant cock. Dutch artist Joep van Lieshout’s Domestikator, a model of a modernist building that happens to be shaped like a man penetrating a dog, makes me worry that I offered the wrong advice. Raunchy art in the adult and sophisticated context of a gallery – if necessary with warnings about its content – is one thing. Obscenity in public space where people of all ages will see it without making any choice to do so is another. Domestikator has created a row in Paris involving not one but two of the French capital’s art institutions. At the start of October the Louvre rejected this vulgar architectural joke for an exhibition of public art in the Tuileries Gardens. So now the Pompidou Centre has installed it outside instead. An open-and-shut liberal case, n’est-ce pas? The director of the Pompidou certainly thinks so, claiming this statue is neither “pornographic” nor “obscene”. Well it is certainly not pornographic in any mainstream sense: just a horrible, fatuous work of art whose sniggering elitism is profoundly ugly. Elitist because van Lieshout is making an in-joke about architecture, mocking the Dutch tradition of utopian art and design. In the centenary year of the De Stijl movement, Domestikator resembles a De Stijl design gone badly wrong. It looks as if a socially responsible modernist architect has created a vision of an ideal habitation, only to accidentally make it look like a man penetrating a dog. It is the glibness and complacency of Domestikator’s use of sex that makes it repulsive. Take it seriously, and the image it shows is inherently violent and cruel. Take it even more seriously and it is animal abuse. But of course, we’re not meant to take it seriously. We’re supposed to laugh along and to understand that, obviously, Domestikator is not celebrating bestiality – merely making a clever comment about architecture. To do that in a public space where people of all ages, all religions, all sexualities must see it whether they choose to or not, just by walking past, is profoundly arrogant. The Louvre made the right choice to reject this crass artwork. It was headed for the Tuileries, a completely open public garden where young children would unavoidably see it. Maybe it would mean nothing to them, but why should parents be red-faced as they usher their kids past this horrid artwork? This is not about censorship. It is about politeness. Let’s say you are watching Game of Thrones on headphones on a train and one of its highly effective moments of incongruous modern swearing happens. You laugh. It’s brilliant writing, well acted. Art, even. The next day you’re in the high street, and someone walks by swearing loudly so everyone can hear. Their behaviour is not art or wit. It is ugly, brutal, ostentatiously rude – for that person is communicating a contempt for everyone within hearing range. Public art shapes the culture of our streets and squares. It should try to make them better places, not worse ones. Van Lieshout’s sculpture is an attack on the very idea that art should improve or enrich anything. Mocking the idealism of modern architects, it spreads a cynical nihilism of its own. Artistic freedom means liberating the imagination. It doesn’t mean bullying other people. I think forcing strong sexual content on strangers of all ages is a particularly loutish form of bullying. In Emin’s exhibition in Brussels almost every drawing, painting and sculpture is erotic. There is even a giant enlargement of an old photograph of the artist lying on her front at a party that is probably the most provocative work she’s ever done. Yet no one is made to look at any of this. That’s reasonable and civilised. Art should be a chosen pleasure, not forced entertainment. I’m not putting on a fake smile to defend Domestikator’s loveless aggression, even if I do still dream of seeing that giant nude in a park. • Jonathan Jones writes on art for the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/18/eu-leaders-aim-to-let-theresa-may-down-gently-over-trade-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T07:16:20Z","webTitle":"EU leaders aim to let Theresa May down gently over trade talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/18/eu-leaders-aim-to-let-theresa-may-down-gently-over-trade-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/18/eu-leaders-aim-to-let-theresa-may-down-gently-over-trade-talks","fields":{"headline":"EU leaders aim to let Theresa May down gently over trade talks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"European Union leaders at a crunch summit dinner are set to rebuff Theresa May’s appeal for trade talks while they seek to publicly talk up her efforts in the Brexit negotiations because they fear that the prime minister’s domestic weakness will leave her unable to make vital concessions on Britain’s divorce bill. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will lead European leaders in Brussels on Thursday in seeking to put the best gloss on their refusal to widen the talks, according to diplomatic sources. “There are ways to say it kindly and encouragingly or less kindly and less encouraging,” said one senior EU diplomat. The member states are acutely aware that the prime minister needs to come out of the summit with her dignity intact if she is to get her cabinet and party to accept concessions on the divorce bill, estimates of which vary from about €60bn to €100bn (£54bn to £90bn). One diplomat said they feared it was “50-50” whether there would be an agreement at the next key European council summit in December that sufficient progress had been made in the Brexit talks, amid some concern in Brussels about the stability of May’s premiership. May has asked to take the floor at a dinner at the European council summit on Thursday evening where she will emphasise the concessions made in her Florence speech, including the €20bn pledge to ensure no member state loses out in the years immediately after the UK leaves the bloc. She will call for both negotiating teams to show greater ambition in the coming weeks. However, she is not likely to make any additional offer. A Downing Street source said: “The PM will reiterate her commitment to a successful Europe with the UK as a strong and committed partner. She will urge fellow leaders to focus on the shared opportunities and challenges ahead and encourage them to move the conversation on to focus on the future partnership and implementation period so that they are ready to engage in that discussion as soon as possible.” May’s address is unlikely to receive an immediate response from the leaders around the table, who are determined to maintain their position that the Brexit talks must go through the the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Draft conclusions insisting that there has been insufficient progress, in particular on the financial settlement, are also unlikely to be changed by the leaders. However, the member states believe the instability of the British government makes it vital for them to soften the blow for the prime minister, who will need to take the political risk of further major concessions on the financial settlement in the weeks to come if she is to unlock what Barnier described as a deadlock in the talks. It is believed the Dutch government, led by Mark Rutte, has particularly championed a warm welcome for May. On Wednesday it emerged that Downing Street had once again been forced to delay bringing the EU withdrawal bill back to the House of Commons as it struggles to respond to hundreds of hostile amendments, which are said to have sufficient support among Tory MPs to potentially inflict a defeat on the government. Aleš Chmelař, the Czech state secretary for European affairs, told the Guardian the EU needed a strong negotiating partner and that recent signs of economic instability in the UK, which could affect the political situation, were particularly concerning. “We have been looking at the economic news, that looks quite worrying,” he said. “Economic growth is behind that of the eurozone. We want a strong partner in the talks. It is not in our interests for the political situation to get more difficult. We need stable leadership so we can have clear statements in the negotiations. And someone who can convince the political sphere as well as the public.” In unusually candid remarks on British political uncertainty, a Finnish state secretary, Samuli Virtanen, admitted this week that May’s position was “one of the things that makes this [Brexit] process more difficult because it seems at the moment the EU27 is more unanimous than UK one”. A London-based EU diplomat said: “It is Germany not France that is taking the toughest line. It is partly they have a more legalistic approach, but they also think British politics is so unstable, concessions at this stage are premature. They think Theresa May’s position is not very strong.” The sources confirmed they feared the dynamic of any Conservative leadership battle would lead to a push for a harder line on Brexit, and a new Tory prime minister would pocket any concessions and then demand more. Phil Hogan, the Irish commissioner for agriculture at the EU, warned on Wednesday of the malign influence of the Brexiters within the Conservative party. “What becomes more obvious day-by-day is that the Brexiteers are hooked on brinkmanship – and have been since the beginning. Unfortunately, their only approach is the tough-guy approach. The hardliners cannot get out of their head the idea that if they bully their way towards the wire, the ‘Union’s nerve will crack’,” he said. “I fear that in the UK debate, common sense left the building a long time ago. Unfortunately, facts and details are derided by the Brexiteers.” The comments came as four Tory former cabinet ministers – Lord Lawson, Owen Paterson, John Redwood and Peter Lilley – called on May to walk away from the talks with no deal if the EU continues to refuse to discuss trade. In a letter organised by the Leave Means Leave campaign, they said the UK should “concentrate our resources on resolving administrative issues” before leaving with no deal in March 2019. Officials in Berlin and PaOn Wednesday, officials in Berlin and Paris were already seeking to talk up May’s efforts to break the impasse in the negotiations. A German government source said: “We believe that a whole lot has already happened and, regarding an issue which is of particular importance to us, that of the rights of citizens, we’ve advanced considerably. “I believe that the big questions about the future relationship between Britain and the European Union are of far more importance than the current dispute about finances.” A French source said of Emmanuel Macron’s attitude: “We must not give in to a confrontational mindset. We are not in a mood for punishment or presents. Our goal is that the requirements are met before moving to phase two. Keep calm and maintain the mandate. It is in the interest of the British and the 27. We will be a demanding partner, transparent and predictable.” A summit on 14 December is now the deadline when EU leaders will judge whether the UK has made sufficient progress on the divorce issues that will allow talks to progress to trade. Between this week’s European council summit and then, the EU member states are set to prepare their vision for a transition period and a mandate for Barnier to talk trade with the UK should sufficient progress on citizens’ rights, the Irish border and the financial settlement be made. EU’s collective hope and expectation is for a deal in December, but diplomats insisted this need not be the end of the road. “If not, no one will be ready to throw in the towel, but we will be ready to think of another milestone, another threshold of time to move on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/18/rose-mcgowan-tweet-harvey-weinstein-blake-poem-poison-tree","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T14:35:56Z","webTitle":"Rose McGowan’s tweet suggests a poetic justice for Weinstein’s poison | Peter Bradshaw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/18/rose-mcgowan-tweet-harvey-weinstein-blake-poem-poison-tree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/18/rose-mcgowan-tweet-harvey-weinstein-blake-poem-poison-tree","fields":{"headline":"Rose McGowan’s tweet suggests a poetic justice for Weinstein’s poison","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"As the Weinstein scandal begins to look like a red pill moment for the film industry – revealing the widespread abuse that was there all along – the most startling intervention came from Rose McGowan, a defiant survivor of Weinstein’s alleged assault. Without comment, she tweeted the text of William Blake’s poem A Poison Tree, a stark, mysterious work whose complex meanings McGowan may actually have done more to reveal than anyone else in modern times. It begins with “I was angry with my friend/ I told my wrath, my wrath did end” and ends with a poison tree being grown, created by and feeding on the dammed-up rage and hurt at a powerful enemy that is not expressed, and watered by the false smiles that the victim has been compelled to put on, and eventually bringing forth an “apple bright”. I once studied that poem at university – but never understood it the way I do now, in McGowan’s fierce retelling: Eve’s revenge against the smug serpent-Adams of this world. From now on, English students reading Blake will also have to study McGowan’s exegesis of this poem, and the light it sheds on an aggressor’s poison entering the ecosystem and finally returning to its originator. All about her mother I’m in Lyon, for the Lumière film festival, run by the Cannes director Thierry Frémaux, a festival for classic cinema, where special guest Tilda Swinton has rousingly declared: “There is no such thing as an old film.” It is named in honour of the Lumière brothers, Auguste and Louis, the great 19th-century pioneer film-makers of Lyon, who are considered to be the inventors of cinema itself. Their portraits hang in the very grand press room in the Institut Lumière. Maybe the most interesting event is the presentation of work by Lyon film-maker Diane Kurys, a supremely intelligent director who in the 1980s and 1990s had to endure mealy-mouthed pundits deciding whether or not to defend her against the charge of being a feminist. Her Coup de Foudre in 1983 is a personal film about her mother, starring Isabelle Huppert as a woman who doesn’t realise how unfulfilled she is in her marriage until she befriends another woman. Their subversive intimacy supersedes every other relationship in their lives. This is the film that shows Huppert at the moment of transforming from ingénue into the devastatingly sophisticated performer we know today – and, certainly, a celebration of something other than patriarchy. Zipping the wink Another day, another strange and creepy moment from the film business. Woody Allen has stated that he thinks it would be a shame if men were no longer allowed to wink at women on film sets. Yeeeech. Winking, like whistling in the street, is something that surely died out with a previous generation. I remember that grownups would wink at me when I was a child – when they had said or done something that was supposed to be funny. It was the older-generation physiological equivalent of holding up a sign for a TV studio audience that said: “Laugh.” Some people could only do it while scrunching up the entire wink side of their face – like George Formby. Others could eerily do it while keeping the rest of their face immobile. I was aware of some people doing it instead of saying hello. It was insufferably condescending. And the thought of people doing it in a leery sexual way is too awful to be borne. The only people that can get away with winking are the paradoxically supercool young people on the front of i-D magazine. Otherwise, please. Winking went out with cardboard bus tickets. • Peter Bradshaw is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/18/new-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-reveals-frontbench-lineup-jane-collins-peter-whittle","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T16:31:15Z","webTitle":"New Ukip leader Henry Bolton reveals frontbench lineup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/18/new-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-reveals-frontbench-lineup-jane-collins-peter-whittle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/18/new-ukip-leader-henry-bolton-reveals-frontbench-lineup-jane-collins-peter-whittle","fields":{"headline":"New Ukip leader Henry Bolton reveals frontbench lineup","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukip’s new leader, Henry Bolton, has unveiled a front bench lineup which retains two of the candidates he defeated last month to take the job, as he seeks to unify a party riven by grievances and splits. Bolton has also named as one of his deputies Mike Hookem, the MEP involved in the scuffle last year with a colleague, Steven Woolfe, which saw the latter end up in hospital. However, there is no place among the 34 jobs announced for four of the other candidates who stood against Bolton, including David Kurten, who finished third. The second-placed candidate, anti-Islam activist Anne-Marie Waters, is also not among Bolton’s team, but she has now left Ukip to form a new party, called For Britain. Waters, who has close links to some far right activists, launched the party on Sunday, where she was pictured with Stephen Lennon, who as Tommy Robinson set up the extremist anti-Islam street group the EDL. Waters is not the only candidate to since leave Ukip. John Rees-Evans, who came fourth, announced earlier this month he was quitting to start his own party. Announcing his new team, Bolton – whose highest-profile intervention since becoming leader was to talk jokingly about throttling a badger – said the party had “a moral obligation to hold the government to account for taking us out of the European Union”. “Together, my team and I will now commence the urgent work of projecting our party firmly and decisively into British politics with the purpose of securing our nation’s interests through Brexit and beyond,” he said. Bolton faces a tough task reinvigorating a party which won almost 4m votes at the 2015 general election but under the leadership Paul Nuttall slumped to fewer than 600,000 in June. His main deputy is Margot Parker, one of Ukip’s MEPs, while two other MEPs become so-called assistant deputies – Jim Carver and Hookem, who allegedly confronted Woolfe after the latter disclosed he was thinking about defecting from Ukip. Hookem also speaks on fisheries and on veterans issues. One of Bolton’s fellow candidates, Jane Collins, is the spokeswoman for home affairs. Another, Peter Whittle, is demoted from deputy leader to spokesman for London affairs. While Waters is no longer in the party, another member with vehement anti-Islam views has remained on Bolton’s front bench. Gerard Batten, another Ukip MEP, stays as spokesman on Brexit, despite arguing that non-Muslims should have a “perfectly rational fear” of the faith, which he described as a “death cult” steeped in violence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2017/oct/24/changing-media-summit-sponsors-and-partners","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-24T14:24:33Z","webTitle":"Changing Media Summit sponsors and partners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/oct/24/changing-media-summit-sponsors-and-partners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2017/oct/24/changing-media-summit-sponsors-and-partners","fields":{"headline":"Changing Media Summit sponsors and partners","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"2018 sponsors and partners AppNexus AppNexus is an internet technology company that harnesses data and machine learning to power the world’s open digital audience platforms.

We may never discover how many people watch any of its shows. For all anybody knows, The Get Down’s entire audience consisted of a single confused child watching distractedly in a shed. We have no way of proving otherwise, so for now we must accept that this is true. However, Netflix will still occasionally throw us the odd bone, and that’s what it did this week. We still have no idea of total viewership, but it has told us which of its shows are watched the fastest by US viewers. The term “Binge-racers” applies to people who smash through an entire series within 24 hours of it appearing on the service. Apparently 8.4 million subscribers like to binge-race their shows, most of whom live in Canada. Netflix is at pains to point out that the speed at which a series is consumed bears little correlation with its overall viewing figures, but it has listed the top 20 most binge-raced shows in the US nonetheless. Here they are: 1. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life 2. Fuller House 3. The Ranch 4. Marvel’s The Defenders 5. The Seven Deadly Sins 6. Trailer Park Boys 7. Santa Clarita Diet 8. F is for Family 9. Orange is the New Black 10. Stranger Things 11. Friends from College 12. Grace and Frankie 13. Wet Hot American Summer 14. Atypical 15. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt 16. House of Cards 17. Master of None 18. Luther 19. GLOW 20. Arrested Development Now, although this doesn’t offer anything in the way of concrete numerical statistics, we can still draw a lot from the list. Here are four theories about Netflix viewership. 1. Shorter shows are more easily bingeable Almost three-quarters of the shows on the binge-race list are half-hours, which makes sense because they have shorter running times. Gilmore Girls is the obvious exception – its shortest episode was an hour and a half long – but there were only four episodes, so it was only about a six-hour commitment. In that time, you’d bore yourself senseless on House of Cards 10 times over and still only be halfway through a season. Similarly, Luther’s inclusion is probably down to its paucity of episodes. The most recent one was only two episodes long, which barely even counts. 2. You can binge comedies Again, 14 entries in the list are comedies – or nebulous light dramas – which comes as a surprise. I assumed that it would be dominated by twisty dramas that suspended themselves across a series of cliffhangers but – unless The Ranch is far more gripping than I ever gave it credit – that doesn’t seem to be the case at all. 3. Critical acclaim counts for nothing Without audience figures, there’s a tendency to gauge a show’s popularity by its level of critical adoration. Apparently that was silly of us. Many of Netflix’s critical darlings – Bojack Horseman, The Crown, Easy, Lady Dynamite, Dear White People, any non-Defenders Marvel shows – are nowhere to be seen. But Friends From College, which was all but booed off the internet for being awful and witless, is. Clearly nobody listens to critical consensus, and I’d have more professional influence if I gave up journalism and spent the rest of my life farting in a cupboard. 4. Netflix subscribers enjoy punishing themselves The alternative theory, though, is that Netflix subscribers don’t like to cut their losses, instead choosing to plough through terrible shows as quickly as possible just to get things over with. That’s what I did with Kimmy Schmidt’s flaccid last season, for example, so maybe that explains a lot of the list. Perhaps there are 8.4 million eternal optimists in the world, each convincing themselves anew on a half-hourly basis that The Ranch will miraculously become borderline watchable. I salute these people. I think they’re stupid and I fear for their sanity, but I salute them nonetheless. 5. Netflix subscribers don’t like change Gilmore Girls is a revival of an old show. Fuller House is a revival of an old show. Arrested Development is a revival of an old show. Wet Hot American Summer is a revival of an old film. The Defenders is the culmination of three older shows. Stranger Things and GLOW want to be from the 1980s so badly it hurts. It seems like Netflix shows get more bingeable if they remind you of things you already know about. This might explain the inclusion of The Ranch, which reminds me about the time I had a nightmare about headless children while under general anesthestic during root canal surgery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/30/100-best-nonfiction-books-91-book-of-common-prayer-1662","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-30T05:45:48Z","webTitle":"The 100 best nonfiction books: No 91 – The Book of Common Prayer (1662)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/30/100-best-nonfiction-books-91-book-of-common-prayer-1662","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/30/100-best-nonfiction-books-91-book-of-common-prayer-1662","fields":{"headline":"The 100 best nonfiction books: No 91 – The Book of Common Prayer (1662)","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"In anticipation of English prose after the Commonwealth, I had initially found the temptation to include Robert Hooke’s extraordinary Micrographia (1665) next in this sequence almost overwhelming. This, after all, was a Restoration publishing sensation described by Samuel Pepys as “the most ingenious book that I ever read in my life”. But, with this series approaching its conclusion, space is at a premium and Hooke must join my list of regrets. Besides, The Book of Common Prayer is, arguably, the most influential and widely read book in the English literary tradition, from Cranmer to the Beatles. The Book of Common Prayer emerged from medieval religious practice as a vernacular aid to devotion. The first prayer books with the Litany in English (probably the work of Thomas Cranmer) appeared in 1544, with decisive new editions in 1549 and 1552, both largely owed to Cranmer. In the words of one commentator, this book “has one of the most complicated textual histories of any printed book anywhere in the world... There were more than 350 different imprints before the date often referred to as the ‘first’ edition of 1662.” This, the definitive version of Common Prayer, which established uniformity of worship and also renewed the old liturgical tradition, occurred with the restoration of Charles II and was widely seen as an integral part of the Stuart settlement, an assertion of the vernacular traditions of the common man. From this moment on, the magnificent cadences of this simple volume became indistinguishable from the expression of the English language, wherever in the world it took root. Over more than four centuries, countless millions of English-speaking people – believers and unbelievers – have been baptised, married or laid to rest to the sound of its sonorous periods: “… we therefore commit his body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile body, that it may be like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself”. The vernacular prayer book also sponsored a new confessional spirit: “We have left undone those things which we ought to have done: And we have done those things we ought not to have done; and there is no health in us.” By some estimates, such passages have enjoyed a wider, and larger, audience even than the works of Shakespeare. Perhaps The Book of Common Prayer’s only rival is the King James Version of the Bible (1611). Like the Bible, this prayer book was scattered far and wide by empire, trade and Anglicanism through a process that we would now describe as “soft power”. Its most famous lines have reverberated round log cabin, quarterdeck and field of battle: Almighty God, who seest that we have no power of ourselves to help ourselves; Keep us both outwardly in our bodies, and inwardly in our souls; that we may be defended from all adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul. The music of such passages might seem almost untranslatable, yet The Book of Common Prayer has indeed been translated into many languages, including Gaelic, Urdu, Hausa, Latin – and three varieties of Inuit. In its English version, it has never been out of print in 500 years, and its age-old rhythms have punctuated the experience the Anglo-American community: Wilt thou have this Woman to thy wedded wife, to live together after God’s ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live? What might we take from these pages today? Most notably, for a modern audience, The Book of Common Prayer is, in some ways, quite secular or, at least, humanistic in spirit. Its language expresses an everyday reconciliation to loss and sorrow, pain and despair, as well as love, joy, childbirth and marriage. The Anglican God is here, but almost co-equal with a belief in the quasi-sacred texture of the well-led life. The book promotes a narrative for everyday experience and implicitly asserts the place of ritual in the conduct of a meaningful life. Although this is a text that continues to enjoy an afterlife within the Anglican communion, it bears the marks of its beginnings. The 1662 version was a self-conscious act of nostalgia for a golden age under Elizabeth I and James I. And its backward-looking instinct was reinforced by the antique appearance of “black-letter” or gothic script, reminiscent of a bygone age. It was also a force for modernisation, marrying strands of Catholic and Protestant faith into the work in progress that was Anglicanism, and executing a national ecclesiastical compromise. Its language, now rare, even special, to a modern audience, was the ordinary vernacular of its day, the speech of the people. Wherever you look in the best moments of the English tradition, you tend to find the language of the common man and woman predominant and irrepressible. On this account, the Normans did English culture and society a huge favour. A signature sentence O merciful God, who hast made all men, and hatest nothing that thou hast made, nor wouldest the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted and live; have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, Infidels and Hereticks, and take from them all ignorance, hardness of heart, and contempt of thy word; and so fetch them home, blessed Lord, to thy flock, that they may be saved among the remnant of the true Israelites, and be made one fold under one shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end.

But for the potential victims of a disorderly Brexit, time is the one thing they don’t have. Businesses say this week’s failure to make progress on on either EU exit talks or domestic Brexit legislation means they are increasingly forced to assume the worst when planning for the final year of British membership. Airlines, for example, have told their suppliers that they could soon be legally unable to sell annual advance tickets because the lack of a transition deal means they cannot guarantee regulatory approval to fly after March 2019. “If we don’t get [a transition deal] sorted quickly after Christmas, it will be squeaky bum time for lots of businesses,” said one aviation executive in receipt of such warnings. In the City, leading financiers argue that the political brinkmanship is failing to take account of how quickly many such commercial deadlines will be upon them. “A week may be a long time in politics, but in business it is nothing at all,” said Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, in an impassioned piece for the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday. He echoed the warnings of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that the value of any transition deal to the British economy will decline quickly if it is not in place before business leaders are forced to make irreversible decisions on future investment and employment. “Any exit fee will earn something in return as we enjoy continued membership benefits for a defined period,” wrote Rolet, in a last-ditch plea for Britain to open its cheque book to unlock talks in Brussels. The Brexit secretary insists Britain should hold its nerve in the face of such threats. “They are using time pressure to get more money out of us,” Davis told MPs on Tuesday after a private dinner with the European commission failed to break the deadlock. “That is what’s going on. It’s obvious to everybody.” Yet, even Britain’s chief negotiator acknowledges that this leaves little room for manoeuvre. “We are reaching the limits of what we can achieve without consideration of our future relationship,” he added. On top of this deadlock in Brussels, the government now also has to contend with growing opposition to its EU withdrawal bill in the House of Commons. Reports that Tory whips have had to delay its committee stage for a second time in the face of a slew of hostile amendments point to a bumpy road ahead even if they can cut a deal. Yet without smooth passage of the withdrawal bill, all sorts of other crucial Brexit legislation risks being held up, including bills intended to set out Britain’s new immigration and customs laws. This only intensifies the uncertainty for exporters and employers about the terms under which they will soon be expected to trade. With EU workers in Britain unsure whether they will be able to work at all, firms report that many are looking at long-term personal decisions on schooling and housing and deciding not to risk sticking around in the hope there will be a deal. “Businesses we are speaking with are stressing the huge importance of EU staff to their operations, with real worry that Brexit will result not only in a smaller pool to recruit from but also skills and talent shortages,” said Darren Seward, at NFU Mutual. Yet he argues the onus should also now be on employers to brace themselves for whatever Brexit might bring. “Some businesses already have plans in place for addressing these challenges – such as working more closely with schools and colleges – but in general, very few businesses appear to have done much planning and preparation for Brexit,” added Seward. “While it’s difficult to prepare for an unknown, businesses should at the very least start thinking about how they would manage a changed employment landscape.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/20/stranger-things-best-tv-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T10:01:27Z","webTitle":"This week’s best TV: Stranger Things is back to turn your world Upside Down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/20/stranger-things-best-tv-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/20/stranger-things-best-tv-this-week","fields":{"headline":"This week’s best TV: Stranger Things is back to turn your world Upside Down","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Stranger Things Get ready for the world to turn Upside Down as the geeks of Hawkins, Indiana prepare to tackle the four horsemen of the apocalypse with slingshots and baseball bats.

In late August, according to researchers with the World Health Organization (WHO), a 31-year-old man was visiting the island’s central highlands when he developed what appeared to be the symptoms of malaria. A few days later, travelling on one of the island’s crowded taxi-brousses (minibus taxis) en route to Toamasina – a journey that took him via the capital, Antananarivo – the unnamed man’s condition worsened, and he died. No one realised he had been infected by the plague, and his body was prepared for burial without precautions. In the space of a few days, 31 people who had come into contact with him – either directly or indirectly – were infected. Four of them subsequently died. Since that first “case zero”, the outbreak of the highly contagious strain of plague has claimed 74 lives over two months, infecting more than 800 people. Marking the outbreak as doubly dangerous, many cases have also featured the most virulent form of what was known in the Middle Ages as the Black Death – pneumonic plague. It is initially caused when advanced bubonic plague spreads to the lungs: this slower acting and relatively less contagious form of the disease attacks the patient’s lymphatic system. Pneumonic plague spreads very easily and is deadly if untreated. Of the 684 cases reported as of 12 October, 474 were pneumonic plague, 156 bubonic and one septicaemic. A further 54 were unspecified. Although plague outbreaks in Madagascar have been an annual occurrence in recent decades, this outbreak has, unusually, affected urban areas where plague is not normally endemic. This further increases the risk of transmission. Another feature of the outbreak that is out of the ordinary has been the timing. Whereas past cases of the disease have generally occurred during the rainy season, between November and March, and were typically of the bubonic variety, this predominantly pneumonic outbreak began in August. All of this has provoked a climate of fear, even as WHO officials have rushed to attempt to contain the outbreak, delivering 1.2m doses of antibiotics. The organisation’s efforts have been backed by interventions from health officials, who have set up medical inspections at transport hubs and banned jail visits and public gatherings. The pneumonic plague outbreak has also hit sectors of society outside impoverished communities, who are typically most at risk. “Normally, the people who catch the plague … live in poor areas, but in this case we find the well-to-do, the directors, the professors, people in every place in society, catching the disease,” said Dr Manitra Rakotoarivony, Madagascar’s director of health promotion. As residents of the capital and elsewhere have queued to buy masks or self-medicate, the grim mood was summed up last week by the mayor of Toamasina, which has been affected by the outbreak. “It is a dangerous moment,” Elysée Ratsiraka told the NewsMada website. “You can leave your house today and catch the plague tomorrow. What are we supposed to do today … and tomorrow? That’s the question facing us.” Others dealing with the outbreak, however, have tried to instil a sense of calm. “Plague is curable if detected in time. Our teams are working to ensure that everyone at risk has access to protection and treatment. The faster we move, the more lives we save,” said the WHO’s Madagascar representative, Charlotte Ndiaye. The WHO calls plague a “disease of poverty” caused in part by unsanitary living conditions. Over the course of less than a decade, the country’s plague problem appears to have intensified, driven by a combination of economic and environmental factors. Madagascar has a per capita GDP of about $400 (£300), and national programmes to control the disease have been “hampered by operational and management difficulties”, according to a report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Plague was first introduced to the island in 1898, when steamships from India brought rats infected with the disease. Within two decades or so, it virtually disappeared from Madagascar for 60 years, only to re-emerge in recent decades. The black rats that carry plague in the highlands have gradually developed resistance to it. Burial practices that involve touching corpses are another reason the disease spreads, according to a 2015 study by scientists at Madagascar’s Pasteur Institute. • This article was amended on 20 October 2017.

Side by side with original manuscripts and illustrations for the Harry Potter books, in an exhibition that opens on Friday and has already sold a record 30,000 tickets, there are dragons’ bones, a mermaid, a step-by-step illustration (on a scroll six metres long) of how to create a philosopher’s stone, a black crystal ball owned by a 20th-century witch known as Smelly Nelly, and a broomstick on which another west country witch regularly startled Dartmoor walkers. Even JK Rowling, on a preview visit to the exhibition combining a history of magic with her creations, was astonished to come face to face with the tombstone of one of her characters. She tweeted the image, writing: “Guess what this is? I’ve just seen it and was mesmerised …” The lead curator, Julian Harrison, explained that it was a memorial to the alchemist and suspected wizard Nicolas Flamel, who died in 1418 and whose grave, when opened centuries later, contained no trace of a body. His tombstone, borrowed from the Musée de Cluny in Paris, is said to have been rediscovered in a Parisian grocery in the 19th century, upside down and being used as a chopping block. The curators have borrowed from national and international collections and from the archives of JK Rowling and her publishers, including her fanatically detailed plotting for the books, with grids of every character on every day. There is also a scrap of paper that proved as magical as any potion: the pencilled opinion of Alice Newton, the eight-year-old daughter of the founder of Bloomsbury, after eight other publishers had rejected Rowling’s proposal. Alice wrote: “The excitement in this book made me feel warm inside. I think it is possibly one of the best books an 8/9 year old could read.” The consequence was 400m books sold in 68 languages, and still rising daily. There are several pages that never made it into the final version of the first Harry Potter book, where Ron and Harry were to have crashed the flying car into a mermaid-infested lake rather than the Whomping Willow. “Not as pretty as they look in books, are they, mermaids,” Ron remarks – which is certainly true of the neighbouring mermaid on loan from the British Museum, ingeniously stitched together centuries ago in Japan from a monkey and a fish. The exhibition includes the oldest objects in the British Library: scorched, cracked bones used for fortune-telling in China more than 3,000 years ago, when they were widely believed to come from dragons. A book from the collection records a more recent sighting: a “monstrous dragon” that crash-landed in a field in Bologna, Italy, on 13 May 1572, and was on display in a local museum for a century after. Visitors will be offered a chance to have their fortune read through a set of digital tarot cards. When the co-curator Tanya Kirk consulted them on the eve of the exhibition, she was told: “You’ve been working very hard towards a goal.” “So that was obviously completely convincing,” she said. Kirk admits to “a very soft spot” for Smelly Nelly, a witch from Paignton who believed the spirits would be attracted to very, very strong perfumes. However, she admits to having been slightly spooked by a cauldron, thickly coated with an unpleasant black gunk, recovered from a Cornish beach after three local witches attempted to conjure up a demon but fled in terror when it exploded. “Do I believe?” Harrison mused. “That’s not entirely a straightforward question.

Kevin Wilshaw, 58, has promoted white supremacism since he was a teenager and worked with a number of extremist groups for decades. He joined the National Front during the group’s heyday in the late 1970s, and later the British National party, before becoming a “freelance extremist” who flirted with a string of violent fringe groups such as the Racial Volunteer Force. Wilshaw was arrested this year on suspicion of online race hate offences and was referred to the Prevent deradicalisation programme. Currently on bail, he has admitted to acts of violence and racism including smashing a chair over a man’s head in Leeds and vandalising a mosque in Aylesbury in the early 90s. In an interview with Channel 4 News, he said he had decided to publicly renounce the far right, which he claimed to have joined because he “didn’t have many friends at school” and “wanted to be a member of a group” that had an aim. He said: “Even though you end up being a group of people that through their own extreme views are cut off from society, you do have a sense of comradeship in that you’re a member of a group that’s being attacked by other people.” Wilshaw said he had decided to quit after receiving abuse from within the far-right movement over his sexuality. “It’s a terribly selfish thing to say but it’s true,” he said. “I saw people being abused, shouted at, spat at in the street. It’s not until it’s directed at you that you suddenly realise what you’re doing is wrong.” Despite having a Jewish mother, Wilshaw wrote about his hatred of “the Jews” on his National Front application form. He told Channel 4 News he now recognised this was “the sort of generalisation that results in six million people being deliberately murdered”. “I feel appallingly guilty, I really do feel guilty,” he said. “This is also a barrier between me having a relationship with my own family. I want to get rid of it, it’s too much of a weight. “I want to do some damage to the people propagating this sort of rubbish. I want to hurt them, I want to show what it’s like to actually live a lie and be on the receiving end of this sort of propaganda.” Matthew Collins, a former National Front and BNP member, now part of the anti-fascist group Hope not Hate, said they had received “a cry for help” from Wilshaw. Collins has written about having known Wilshaw since the 80s. He said Wilshaw’s wife left him in 1996, citing Adolf Hitler as “the other man” in their relationship. Home Office figures released on Tuesday show that the number of hate crime offences recorded by the police rose by a record 29%, to 80,393 incidents, in the 12 months to March 2017, the largest rise since the official hate crime figures started to be published five years ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/18/doctors-to-breathalyse-smokers-before-allowing-them-nhs-surgery","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T12:54:48Z","webTitle":"Doctors to breathalyse smokers before allowing them NHS surgery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/18/doctors-to-breathalyse-smokers-before-allowing-them-nhs-surgery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/18/doctors-to-breathalyse-smokers-before-allowing-them-nhs-surgery","fields":{"headline":"Doctors to breathalyse smokers before allowing them NHS surgery","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Smokers in Hertfordshire are to be breathalysed to ensure they have kicked the habit before they are referred for non-urgent surgery. The measures have been brought in by East and North Hertfordshire clinical commissioning group (CCG) and Hertfordshire Valleys CCG, which together are attempting to save £68m. They said the changes were being brought in after 85% of people who responded to a public consultation agreed that smokers should be required to quit before being referred. The proposals, revealed by the Health Service Journal, require smokers to have given up for at least eight weeks. They will have to prove this by undergoing a breath test, which will check for levels of carbon monoxide. The CCGs also require obese patients to reduce their weight by 10% over nine months or reduce their BMI (body mass index) to less than 30, whichever is greater, before being referred for non-urgent surgery. A report by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) last year said that more than a third of areas in England had similar policies but this is believed to be the first time patients will be breathalysed to ensure compliance. Ian Eardley, the senior vice-president at the RCS, condemned the policy as “discriminatory” and short-sighted. “Singling out patients in this way goes against the principles of the NHS,” he said. “While it is right that patients are supported to lose weight or stop smoking, this should not be a condition of them receiving surgery. This goes against clinical guidance and leaves patients waiting long periods of time in pain and discomfort. It can even lead to worse outcomes following surgery in some cases.” He said that by introducing “increasingly harsher policies” CCGs might believe they were alleviating financial pressure but they could actually cost more in the long term because of the risk of complications and the cost of healthcare in the interim. The CCGs said no financial savings were expected as a result of the measures, which they claimed were aimed at improving the long-term health of residents. They also stressed that if at any time the harm of waiting for surgery outweighed the benefit of losing weight or stopping smoking, then the patient would be referred. Dr Hari Pathmanathan, a Hertfordshire GP and chairman of East and North Hertfordshire CCG, said: “These decisions haven’t been taken lightly and our conversations with the public have demonstrated that many people understand the challenges faced by the NHS in Hertfordshire and beyond. “We understand that some of our patients will have to make changes and they will be supported to do so, for example with the free weight-loss and stop-smoking advice sessions already on offer.” The CCGs also announced that gluten-free food, female sterilisation, IVF and other specialist fertility treatments would only be funded in exceptional circumstances. Dr Nicolas Small, the chair of Herts Valleys CCG, said: “Although we are asking people to take more responsibility for some aspects of their healthcare where possible, we won’t be withdrawing any support from people who are not able to do this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/gardens-japanese-aralia-rhubarb-monty-don","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-04T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Gardens: what to do this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/gardens-japanese-aralia-rhubarb-monty-don","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/04/gardens-japanese-aralia-rhubarb-monty-don","fields":{"headline":"Gardens: what to do this week","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Plant this Japanese aralia (Fatsia japonica) is a bold architectural plant that does well in shadier spots.

Staff Sgt Thomas Kent Fogarty, a 30-year-old father of two, was killed in Afghanistan in May 2012 by an improvised explosive device. “I was very comforted. I actually felt like I could have picked up the phone and said ‘look, my son died … and I need to talk to President Obama.’ I kind of feel like I might have been able to get a hold of him,” Fisher said. “I felt like my son got lots of respect.” Donald Trump painted a contrasting picture of Barack Obama and his predecessors this week. Asked in a news conference on Monday about his silence regarding the four special forces soldiers killed during an ambush in Niger on 4 October, Trump said: “If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls. A lot of them didn’t make calls”. He modified that claim when questioned: “President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes he didn’t. I don’t know. That’s what I was told.” Obama’s standard practice appears to have been to write to bereaved relatives of military members and meet with many of them in person, and to make occasional telephone calls that the White House did not publicise. Regardless of the contact method, Trump’s implication was clear: that Obama disrespected the families of fallen soldiers by a lack of personal effort. Such a claim surfaced in conservative media during his presidency and was also levelled at George W Bush in 2003, though the Washington Times reported five years later that Bush spent considerable time contacting bereaved families. On Tuesday, Trump told Fox News Radio: “I don’t know what Bush did. I don’t know what Obama did.” But he again took a swipe at his predecessor, suggesting it would be worth asking Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, if he received a call from Obama after Kelly’s son died in Afghanistan in 2010. As a candidate, Trump was widely condemned for a verbal attack on the parents of Humayun Khan, a soldier who died in Iraq in 2004, after his father, Khizr Khan, gave a speech at last year’s Democratic national convention. Trump insisted that he writes letters and calls the families of military members killed in action. Several former Obama and Bush aides and supporters reacted angrily to his comments, denouncing them as false, and retired general Martin Dempsey, a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said on Twitter that Obama, Bush “and first ladies cared deeply, worked tirelessly for the serving, the fallen, and their families. Not politics. Sacred Trust.” Fisher, the bereaved mother, said that Trump’s assertion did not ring true to her. “Obama’s administration seemed to me to be very much engaged with the families,” she said. “Constantly, everything that he gets criticised for, President Trump, he immediately puts it on previous presidents, especially President Obama. He misses no opportunity to deflect.” Michelle DeFord’s son, Army Sgt David Johnson, was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2004, aged 37. She met Obama when she went to Washington to lobby for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Trump appears intent on undermining. “I have pictures of Obama giving me a hug when he found out that I was a Gold Star mother,” she said, adding that she was touched by a letter from the former first lady, Michelle Obama, inviting her to contribute to a Christmas tree that paid tribute to deceased armed forces members and their families. “You had a sense of their appreciation and their acknowledgement of your sacrifice,“ DeFord said. “I kind of think of soldiers as being in the employ of the federal government, so I would think it would be just standard procedure when you lose an employee to send a letter of condolence to the family, that’s the president’s job in my opinion.” Karen Meredith’s son, 1st Lt Ken Ballard, was killed by small arms fire in Iraq on 30 May 2004 – Memorial Day. “I can assure you that nobody is sitting around waiting for a letter from the president to move on with their grief. The contact comes among numerous letters of condolence that you get from members of the military, members of Congress, members of your community,” she said. Still, Meredith finds it surprising that the White House seemingly did not promptly send letters to the families of the soldiers killed in Niger. “Especially with General Kelly, the chief of staff, who’s a Gold Star father who would have known that it’s part of your job as the commander-in-chief to console grieving families. I’m just shocked that nobody on the staff took care of it for him,” she said. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Tuesday evening that Trump had spoken with the families of the four soldiers and “offered condolences on behalf of a grateful nation and assured them their families’ extraordinary sacrifice to the country will never be forgotten.” Meredith recalled that her letter from the White House arrived within a week or so. No fan of Bush, she said that had he tried to call she probably would have declined to speak with him. “I almost returned [my letter] without opening it because I didn’t want to hear from Bush,” she said. “When I opened the letter it was very casual and very familiar, as opposed to being a formal letter of condolence. He addressed me as Karen not Ms Meredith and that was not what I expected from the president, I expected it to be more formal … it was ‘Dear Karen, Laura and I are real sorry about this’.” Meredith met Obama and the former vice-president, Joe Biden, at her son’s grave in Arlington National Cemetery. “He was very sympathetic and empathetic, as was Mrs Obama, and so were the Bidens,” she said. “Trump doesn’t have an empathetic bone in his body and doesn’t understand the importance of hearing from the commander in chief. This is ultimately his responsibility.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/18/david-gauke-universal-credit-working-well","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T16:43:08Z","webTitle":"In David Gauke's world, universal credit is working well","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/18/david-gauke-universal-credit-working-well","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/18/david-gauke-universal-credit-working-well","fields":{"headline":"In David Gauke's world, universal credit is working well","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Anticipating tough questioning from MPs, the work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, got his concession in early: even before the first question was asked, he had announced that from next month the universal credit helpline would be free and claimants would no longer be faced with the prospect of 55p-a-minute call charges. But that welcome sop to the massed critics of the government’s flagship welfare reform was all that Gauke was prepared to give away. He dug in on more substantive issues such as the 42-day wait for a first benefit payment, and sidestepped related concerns about rising rent arrears, debt and food bank use. Gauke was clear: while he was prepared to look at the evidence and make changes where necessary, his decision last month to accelerate the universal credit rollout was the right one. There would be no pause or unplanned “firebreak” to review progress: he was determined, he said, to deliver universal credit successfully. A letter Gauke sent to the work and pensions committee on Tuesday explained why he had opted to press ahead. The government had stress-tested the system against criteria including whether claimants received an acceptable level of customer service, and whether payments were made on time. Universal credit, it concluded, was “safe to proceed” and “operating within acceptable parameters”. This was interesting, because the committee has a mountain of evidence – more than 100 written submissions from claimants, councils and landlords – suggesting universal credit is not safe and that it is driving thousands into debt, eviction, destitution and mental distress. A fifth of claimants are not paid on time. These, it seems, are “acceptable parameters” for a social security system to operate within. The Labour MP Neil Coyle said that in his Southwark constituency the total rent owed by tenants claiming the new benefit stood at £5m, and 1,242 households had eviction-level arrears. The committee chair, Frank Field, noted that his local food bank in Birkenhead was stockpiling 15 tonnes of food to deploy during the Christmas period, when universal credit arrives in town. Gauke and the DWP’s director of universal credit, Neil Couling, seemed at times baffled to hear of calamities like this. Perhaps these were “acceptable parameters”. Gauke said he was aware of just eight universal credit evictions nationally. Coyle was disbelieving: two of his constituents alone had been evicted. Landlords across the UK report increasing evictions. The slightly detached Whitehall world of universal credit was a feature of the committee hearing. If universal credit was meant to mirror the world of work, why was it necessary to wait a minimum 42 days for a first payment, asked the Tory backbencher Heidi Allen: “Six weeks is not the world of work. I know nobody who waits six weeks to be paid.” Gauke said it would cost money to shorten the length of the first payment period (the bill is said to be £140m); there were, he suggested, more pressing priorities for public money. Asking low-income claimants to go into debt via loans repayable to the DWP over six months is, it seems, the best way of paying for the design problems of universal credit. MPs were unconvinced. To qualify for a loan, claimants have to show they are penniless – unable even to get a loan from family and friends. They can receive up to 50% of their expected first payment but, as the written evidence to the committee shows, this is rarely enough to cover rent, food and fuel bills over the long waiting period. Gauke suggested it was a success that the latest figures showed 50% of new claimants were taking up an advanced loan. Allen was having none of it, arguing that this was “just papering over the fact that the six-week wait doesn’t work”. Field agreed: “What you [Gauke] are really saying is that the transition is too big for some people, from their known world to your world of universal credit.” Allen pointed out that universal credit still faced “massive hurdles”. Jobcentre staff had told her universal credit was still “only 60% built”; there remained serious problems with childcare payments, eligibility for free school meals, housing payments, and the onerous bureaucracy faced by self-employed claimants. Gauke was implacable. His world of universal credit seemed to be working well. His rosy vision of a reform under control and suffering mere teething problems was later repeated by Theresa May at prime minister’s question time. They pressed the idea – based on slender, dated evidence – that universal credit gets more people into work. That universal credit is a bureaucratic nightmare has now captured the public’s imagination; that it has become a vehicle to deliver benefit cuts to working families is still yet to be fully appreciated. Ministers may believe the problems lie within “acceptable parameters” but they aren’t going away. As Allen put it: “They [the problems] are going to come and bite us on the whatsit if we are not careful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2017/oct/20/i-remember-you-review-icelandic-nordic-noir-horror-supernatural","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-20T11:30:06Z","webTitle":"I Remember You review – Nordic noir goes a step too far","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/20/i-remember-you-review-icelandic-nordic-noir-horror-supernatural","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2017/oct/20/i-remember-you-review-icelandic-nordic-noir-horror-supernatural","fields":{"headline":"I Remember You review – Nordic noir goes a step too far","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here’s what feels like a slightly unnecessary addition to the Nordic noir canon, tacking on an element of scary-kid horror to the genre’s usual ingredients – a tortured detective figure, distracting knitwear, frozen landscapes and the stench of corruption.

The only doctor available to examine the corpse is a beardy psychiatrist (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson), whose eight-year-old son vanished a few years earlier. Meanwhile, a young couple renovate a creepy old house in the western fjords, planning to open it as a B&amp;B. But just when you think you’ve stepped into a page-turning procedural thriller, the clues linking the three storylines begin to point to an unearthly culprit.

The company was planning to announce the new rules later on this week, but they leaked in an email to Wired magazine, which published the changes on Tuesday. “We hope our approach and upcoming changes, as well as our collaboration with the Trust and Safety Council, show how seriously we are rethinking our rules and how quickly we’re moving to update our policies and how we enforce them,” a Twitter spokesperson said. The company had launched its Trust and Safety Council in February 2016, with membership of more than 40 organisations including the US Anti-Defamation League, Samaritans and the Internet Watch Foundation to help Twitter “more efficiently and quickly” canvass for opinion from experts. The changes come a few days after Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, acknowledged the company’s failings in a short series of tweets posted on the day of the #womenboycotttwitter protest. The protest was sparked by the company locking the account of actress Rose McGowan, after she sent a series of tweets attacking those she claimed had enabled the abuse of Hollywood mega-producer Harvey Weinstein. “We see voices being silenced on Twitter every day. We’ve been working to counteract this for the past 2 years. We prioritized this in 2016. We updated our policies and increased the size of our teams. It wasn’t enough,” Dorsey wrote. “In 2017 we made it our top priority and made a lot of progress. Today we saw voices silencing themselves and voices speaking out because we’re *still* not doing enough.” As part of the changes, Twitter’s rules on non-consensual nudity (sometimes called “revenge porn”) and unwanted sexual advances have been strengthened, with the former expanding to include imagery that isn’t explicitly nude, such as “upskirt” pictures, and the latter ban being extended to cover bystander reports, rather than only being actionable if the target complains. Users who are the original posters of non-consensual nudity, or those who share it explicitly to harass someone, will also receive an immediate permanent ban, rather than a temporary account lock for first offenders. The raft of rules concerning hate symbols and violent groups are completely new, although the email acknowledges that their “exact scope” is still being determined. Hateful imagery and hate symbols will now be treated as “sensitive media”, similar to how pornography is already flagged and blockable, while the company says it will “take enforcement action against organisations that use violence as a means to advance their cause”. Twitter will also begin to take action against tweets that glorify or condones violence, as well as simple threats. “We realize that a more aggressive policy and enforcement approach will result in the removal of more content from our service. We are comfortable making this decision,” the leaked email says. The company’s proposed changes have already been criticised as addressing the wrong problems, however. Brianna Wu, a US congressional candidate who made her name as an anti-harassment campaigner, told Dorsey that the changes “require trusting the reporting process. Your reporting outcomes are very uneven - I can report the same behavior one day and it’s acted on. The next day it’s not. “Unless you are investing more in personnel and training staff in subjects they may not understand, this isn’t going to solve it.” Uneven enforcement was ultimately the reason for the #womenboycotttwitter protest in the first place. McGowan’s account was locked, Twitter said, because one of her tweets contained an image private phone number. When Twitter cited this as the reason for McGowan’s suspension, others noted that they had reported similar tweets and seen no enforcement action taken."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/19/orchestre-les-mangelepa-last-band-standing-review-esteemed-african-big-band-goes-international","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T17:15:31Z","webTitle":"Orchestre Les Mangelepa: Last Band Standing review – esteemed African big band goes international","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/19/orchestre-les-mangelepa-last-band-standing-review-esteemed-african-big-band-goes-international","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/19/orchestre-les-mangelepa-last-band-standing-review-esteemed-african-big-band-goes-international","fields":{"headline":"Orchestre Les Mangelepa: Last Band Standing review – esteemed African big band goes international","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It starts with a horn fanfare, then eases into lilting Congolese rumba, Kenyan-style, with three singers backed by a rock-solid rhythm section, intertwining guitars and horns.

May is due to phone the Élysée Palace on Monday afternoon, it is understood, as the prime minister seeks to convince European leaders that talks on a transition phase should be approved at a European council summit on Friday. She will also call the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, before departing for Brussels for an early dinner with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Downing Street’s efforts are unlikely to be rewarded, however, unless May is willing to offer concrete guidance on how many of the UK’s financial commitments to the EU budget she is prepared to honour. May has already sought to convince the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, of the need for talks on a transition phase during a call on Sunday, without any success, it is understood. The EU leaders have concluded that insufficient progress has been made in the first phase of talks to open negotiations on the future trading relationship or discuss a transition period, a judgment they will formally deliver at the summit later this week. The mood before the dinner with Juncker – to which the commission president’s chief of staff, Martin Selmayr, and May’s Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, have also been invited – was struck earlier on Monday when the commission president gave a hint of his feelings about the forthcoming event. “I’m going to see Mrs May tonight. And, yes, you will have a postmortem report,” he told reporters. It is understood that May will spend only 90 minutes in Brussels before returning to London. The last meal between the two leaders, in Downing Street, was heavily leaked to the newspapers, with Juncker allegedly describing the prime minister as “deluded”. A senior EU source all but dismissed the prime minister’s hopes of pushing transition talks, claiming that European leaders had overruled Barnier when he suggested opening talks on a transition phase, and were in no mood to offer May any succour. “The problem is not in the commission so you will not find the solution in the commission,” he said. The source said European capitals were insistent that phase one of the negotiations, taking in citizens rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border, needed to be settled first. “What the British have in mind is some sort of stage one and a half. Not sufficient progress but you can start talks on negotiations on the transition,” the source said. “That is not going to happen because I think in the capitals they are very much in touch with this idea that we have a staged approached. We were very specific when it came to the guidelines what we meant by the first phase.” The source said May was doing her best to get the best possible outcome from the EU27 meeting on Friday. The best the UK could hope for, however, was for the group to offer to scope out among themselves how a transition period would work, in the hope that Britain would have delivered concrete proposals on the financial settlement by the next European council summit in December. In her speech in Florence, May announced that the UK would “honour commitments we have made during the period of our membership”, without spelling out what those commitments were. “Until the speech in Florence, the feeling in the capitals was that it was going nowhere and the no-deal scenario was the most likely one’, the source acknowledged. “Since Florence, Theresa May did manage to change this assumption. The message from Florence was: ‘I mean business, the UK is in the negotiating business,’ which was not so clear before.” The source added, however, that without additional firm commitments on the financial settlement, there would be limited reward for May’s efforts. “I have to admit they [the British] are not happy with the conclusions,” the EU official said. “They would like to go further but that will be the landing zone with the current input.” A leaked statement drafted by the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, for agreement by leaders, had suggested last week that the EU would promise to scope between themselves how a transition phase would work now and give Barnier a mandate to talk trade in December, if sufficient progress was made by then. France and Germany were reluctant even to go that far, however, arguing that while talking between themselves about a transition period was acceptable, the EU should not bind its hands in terms of what it gives to Britain should sufficient progress be made by Christmas. It is understood, however, that Tusk has persuaded Macron and Merkel during phone calls in recent days to stick to his original plan, which will be agreed by EU ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday and announced by the leaders on Friday. “If we end with the conclusions that Tusk proposed it will be a very nice reward and a fair one – that’s where we are,” the source said. “That is the only scenario I can see.” The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who hosted senior European politicians from eight member states at his grace and favour country house, Chevening on Sunday, claimed it was in the EU’s interests to move the negotiations on. Before a meeting for EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, Johnson told reporters: “We think in the UK that it’s time to get on with these negotiations, it is ready for the great ship to go down the slipway and on to the open sea and for us to start some serious conversations about the future and the new relationship, the deep and special partnership we hope to construct. “I think that will work very much in the interests of both sides. People say to me: ‘Look we want to reassure the 3.2 million EU nationals in the UK and one-and-a-bit million UK nationals in the EU’ and so do we. We have made a very good offer. We have made a very fair ... We think it is a reasonable point of view that we are outlining. “Let’s give them that reassurance, let’s give a tiger in the tank, lets get these conversations going and stop letting the grass grow under our feet. So we hope our partners will take that message and begin some serious negotiations.” May is expected to leave the EU council summit on Friday morning, before talks on the progress of the Brexit negotiations get under way between the EU27. Her early departure makes it all the more crucial that she is able to speak to as many EU leaders as possible before the summit. Asked if May had sought assurances that the contents of the dinner would remain private, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “The prime minister has had a number of constructive conversations with Jean-Claude Juncker. We expect this to be a constructive dinner.” He said the dinner was part of a “wider programme of engagement” with EU leaders. “They will be talking about a range of issues of importance to the EU, ahead of the council. Over the course of the past month or more there has been engagement with the prime minister and European leaders. You can expect her to have conversations with other European leaders today and going forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/17/so-solid-crew-how-we-made-21-seconds-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"So Solid Crew: how we made 21 Seconds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/17/so-solid-crew-how-we-made-21-seconds-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/17/so-solid-crew-how-we-made-21-seconds-interview","fields":{"headline":"So Solid Crew: how we made 21 Seconds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Lisa Maffia, singer As a kid, I’d record myself singing when music came on the telly, but I never thought of being a pop star. I never planned to be anything, having had a baby so young. By the time I was 19, I was working 10-hour shifts in an off-licence with my 18-month-old daughter. I’d known the boys from So Solid Crew since I was 13. I started a relationship with G-Man. He said he and Megaman were making a track called Oh No and they wanted me to sing. I was like: “No way, that’s embarrassing, I can’t sing.” But they made me, and I was so glad. Me and G-Man sold Oh No out of the back of a Ford Transit – we got thousands of copies out there. We got put in the album charts – with a single! – because we had one too many songs on the B-side. We were so stupid. Luckily, Oh No was big in the underground scene. An A&amp;R rep flew to Ayia Napa, in Cyprus, secretly watched us on stage and offered to sign us. We were out at raves with champagne, then going home to council flats. Oh No featured just me, Mega and Romeo, but now we had a crew of producers, rappers and singers. G-Man suggested that if each artist had just 21 seconds that would add up to the length of a single. The most difficult thing was editing it for the radio, because people had to be removed. My daughter was still very small; she’s the baby you hear at the beginning of the track. I had a great mum and sister helping to raise her. They helped me become Lisa Maffia, not Lisa, Chelsea’s mum. They and the crew put me on this pedestal when I wasn’t able to put myself on one. We didn’t have to search for a solo deal for me – they came to us. Megaman was first down there: “Right, you want Lisa, how much? You know she’s worth more than So Solid!”I must have been told 21,000 times that we inspired others to get into music or to do what they believed in. We were nobodies on an estate, living in poverty, able to become millionaires, famous, respected. So 21 Seconds not only gave hope to musicians, it gave hope to young, black Britain. A guy in Birmingham recently said he opened his own car wash because of us. He has five now. Megaman, rapper and producer My dad used to fix up rich people’s houses, and I worked with him until I was 16. Marble bathrooms, wallpaper that matched bedcovers – I used to say: “Dad, why can’t we live like this?” I had holes in my trainers and wanted more money, so we could live happier. I was in a group called Too Hot Too Young and used to toast over reggae and dancehall. I’d direct the crowd, hype them up. At a house party, jungle songs would get played and I’d spit a lyric. My friend’s brother had a studio in his bedroom, and we’d mess about in there, making silly beats. We just wanted to be stars. The song is an introduction to the crew: Asher D, the actor-MC; Face, the vampire character; Harvey, the hype man; Romeo, the ladies’ man. The lyric came from the frustration that nobody wanted to go on it first. “Megaman, up first and he won’t second no shit, I ain’t got the time to smoke this” – because I was smoking cannabis at the time – “Hold this, yo G.” It was freestyle, written on the spot in the studio. We were the first UK garage crew to go to No 1. The label was supporting members who weren’t signed to them – paying for cars, food and clothing. Sometimes the label said they weren’t going to pay for something, but I was like: “You are, or I’m not leaving my house.” I was looking at the Puff Daddys and rappers of the world who were doing million-dollar videos, and I didn’t want to be any less cheesy than them. I loved the journey, but not as much as I could have. If we went to a resort, with 10 members crashing mopeds, it was always me who got the phone call. I also wasn’t that great at enforcing So Solid as a business – a Def Jam or Virgin – and I wasn’t looking after myself in the streets. I got caught up in silly activities [Megaman was acquitted of murder in 2006, after being charged with inciting the killing of 24-year-old Colin Scarlett]. But coming through that, with my clothing lines, the events I’m putting on, I’m fortunate. That dream I had when I was 17, it’s now a real thing. • Lisa Maffia’s single Old Habits is released in November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2017/oct/16/leicester-city-v-west-brom-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T20:55:49Z","webTitle":"Leicester City 1-1 West Brom: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/oct/16/leicester-city-v-west-brom-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2017/oct/16/leicester-city-v-west-brom-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Leicester City 1-1 West Brom: Premier League – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Well, the first half was dreadful. The second half was a bit better, featuring two good goals, some needle and West Brom parking their not insubstantial bus. One team was trying to play football, but their chief problem was that they weren’t very good at it. Iheanacho was totally anonymous and Okazaki will perhaps feel aggrieved he didn’t feature instead. Thanks for joining me for this, you terrible, terrible masochists. Fuchs launches a long ball to Slimani in the box, but he can’t get a header on target. And with that, Mike Dean puts this out of its misery. 90 min + 4: West Brom are frustrating Leicester as they attempt to burst forward, getting feet in and stopping their fluency. But eventually Mahrez has a burst into the box - but sees only West Brom players waiting. He can’t find space for a shot. 90 min + 3: Barry and Ndidi have another tussle, which Barry gets the better of. Free kick to West Brom. King on for Iborra. 90min + 2: Vardy miscontrols the ball out on the left wing, allowing it to roll under his boots and into touch. There will be a last throw of the the dice from Shakespeare, he’s bringing on Andy King. 90 min +1: Krychowiak finds McClean in the box, all on his own. He fires a shot at goal but Chilwell arrives to get in its way. 90 min: Leicester attempt to fizz the ball forwards, but there’s the usual resilience from West Brom. Five added minutes here, news of which is greeted with a cheer by the Leicester fans. 89 min: Mahrez plays a slide rule ball into Vardy int the box, but he can’t control it. The move breaks down with a Fuchs foul. It gives West Brom the chance to slow things down - they take a good minute over the free-kick. 86 min: Leicester patiently build, using their new 5-3-2 formation to attack West Brom with width. It’s patient buildup play before Mahrez finally puts in a wonderful ball for Slimani, but Hegazi is there to clear. If anyone is going to score a winner now, it feels like will be Leicester. 84 min: The mood at the King Power has changed completely. The crowd are loud and excited as their side pile on the pressure. Pulis responds by bringing on McAuley and McClean, the well known detective duo. Rodriguez and Chadli make way. 82 min: Fuchs rakes a long cross into the box and Slimani is close to getting on the end of it. Myhill leaps to claim though. A moment later, he is tested again as Vardy races onto a through ball. But the keeper is so injured, he can only roll the ball out for a throw in rather than kick long. Scenting blood, Maguire fires a long shot at him, which is punched behind for a corner. Real urgency to Leicester now. Slimani nods back a cross to Mahrez, who is 12 yards out. He strokes the ball home with his right foot for his first goal of the season. 77 min: Gibbs crosses from theleft and Rondon sticks his head in down low and is perhaps lucky that Maguire’s boot doesn’t catch him as the defender clears. Leicester immediately counter, but the move ends with Ndidi scuffing a shot wide from distance. 74 min: The ball falls to Ndidi on the edge of the box. “SHOOT,” shout the crowd, but he doesn’t and eventually Albrighton clumps a cross long and into touch. Icheancho off for Slimani, Simpson off for Chilwell as Shakespeare switches formation. 72 min: Leicester launch the ball into the box, prompting a bout of head tennis. Eventually, one of the Leicester attackers gets himself offside and Myhill, struggling to punch the ball clear, blows a sigh of relief. 70 min: Albrighton and Fuchs combine well down the left, before finding Mahrez on the edge of the box. He can’t turn, though, and eventually has to settle for a corner. 69 min: Schmeichel looks rattled. He makes a good claim from a West Brom cros from the left wing, but then rolls the ball out badly to Albrighton, leaving the wing short. He has to dive into to a tackle and earns a yellow card. Chadli tkes a cunning, disguised free-kick, passing the ball to Krychowiak who hammers a shot into a defender. 67 min: Albrighton sets Mahrez free up the right but Hegazi cuts out the ball. Leicester, by hook or crook, plug away up the right wing before Ndidi puts in a loose ball and West Brom counter. “Ha, ha! Yes!! There it is! Shot on target! Boom! Told you they could do it! Though I have to admit I never thought it would result in a goal! Good things come to those who wait. It’s times like these I feel sorry for all the non-Baggie supporting football fans,” JR in Illinois there. 64 min: That was a brilliant free-kick from Chadli: whip, flight and bend. He struck it from five or 10 yards outside the box, in a central-ish position. He cleared the wall with ease, but there may be a few questions to ask of Schmeichel who might have felt he could have done more. The goal it may not bode well for the rest of the match: cue West Brom going even deeper. From the free-kick, Chadli lifts the ball over the wall and Schmeichel simply stands and watches the ball go into the net. 61 min: It’s a West Brom corner, but it’s delayed by Fuchs and Rondon getting to know each other fairly intimately on the goalline. When the ball does come in, Leicester clear. But with half a chance to counterattack, Iheanacho overstretches and clatters Krychowiak. The striker is having a poor game - and now has a yellow card to remember it by. 59 min: Iborra wraps his legs around Rodriguez’s and knocks him flat on the ground. Frmo the free-kick, near the centre circle, West Brom meander around aimlessly, before Rodriguez crosses for Gibbs who can’t connect. 58 min: It’s gone a bit end-to-end, this - not in a quality way, but in a desperate, frenetic, hard-running but no real skill kind of way. Which is great! Myhill, though, is in trouble. He hoofs a clearance and limps off afterwards. It looks like he’s injured a hamstring, 56 min: Iheanacho tries to find Vardy in the box, when Mahrez was free on the right wing in space. There’s a pleasing amount of needle and edge to the match now, with a few tasty challenges going in. Morgan goes in on Rondon before Barry and Ndidi resume their bout. Needle is good. “A while back you Guardian chaps and chapettes had the idea of anyone with less than a point a game should go down. Add less than a goal a game and I reckon we are in business. Nine of this current dross going down on that basis and two more hanging by the skin of their teeth,” emails John Little. 54 min: Ndidi takes a large chunk of Gareth Barry while also getting a bit of ball. Mike Dean shows him a yellow card. 52 min: This looks worrying for West Brom. Myhill is down on the ground receiving attention from the physios. It looks like it was as a result of that collision with Vardy. He’s already their second choice keeper, and third choice keeper Palmer is as green as they come. For now, though, he’s OK to carry on. 50 min: Albrighton goes on a lovely jinking run into the box, then pulls the ball back to Mahrez on the penalty spot. He takes aim! And he fires it MILES over the bar while completely unmarked! GAH! No changes to either team in the second half, incidentally. 48 min: On seeing the Vardy and Myhill incident again, the keeper clearly realises he’s not going to get the ball so just runs into the striker. Yellow fair enough. 47 min: Mahrez rattles in the free-kick and the ball loops up into the air off a defender’s head. Maguire shoves Rondon out of the way, which takes some doing, and aims a header at goal - but Myhill tips it around the post. 46 min: Myhill comes rushing off his line as Vardy attempts to latch onto an underhit back pass. The pair collide nastily and both go down in a heap, just outside the area. It looked accidental to me, but Myhill gets a yellow card for it. Oh god! There’s a second half. And it’s starting now. WHY? What we have done to deserve this? West Brom get the torture under way. “Based on the first eight games I figure there’ll be lots of competition for the bottom three this season. Some years I wish four or five teams would go down. Who are your early favourites?” asks Mike MacKenzie in London, Canada. As long as one of this lot goes down, so we’re not subject to this again, it’ll be fine. “I’m looking forward to the possibility of a shot on target by the Baggies in the second half,” writes a hopelessly optimistic JR in Ilinois. “I really think there’s a good chance they could pull it off. Possibly Rondon could be the man for the job. Or maybe Phillips if he comes on as a sub. Hey, a guy can dream, right?” Here’s something better: sign up here and we’ll send our best stories of the week, every Friday: That half of footbal was awful. Absolutely awful. Forty-five minutes of sheer meh. That scarf below is the only thing that has happened. Corrie is on the other side. Watch that instead. Discuss: PEEP, PEEP! Mahrez passes to Albrighton, who whisks a low cross across the face of goal. But Vardy can’t get a touch. Briefly, things light up at the end of the first half as Leicester sniff a goal, but just as quickly they peter out as Vardy commits a foul. And that’s half time. Simpson with the best chance of the half. 42 min: Simpson crosses deep into the West Brom box and finds Iborra. He mishits a shot into the ground, but it bounces up for Vardy four yards out. He’s jumps! He heads it! He nods it high! And Myhill knocks it behind for a corner. Oh. 40 min: Dawson has a chance to cross, with men waiting in the box, but instead passes backwards to Krychowiak, who splatters the ball high over the bar. If it comes off, it will be the most exciting thing that’s happened so far. 38 min: Mahrez is awake! He finally has a run, cutting inside past Krychowiak, before being closed down. Still, it was something. 37 min: Rondon picks out Rodriguez, who is cantering into the box. But Harry Maguire is with him, matches him stride for stride and clears from around the penalty spot. 35 min: Simpson latches onto a ball headed clear by Hegazi. He catches it perfectly, hammering a shot through a crowd of players from the edge of the box - but Myhill is equal to it. That’s the closest we’ve come to a goal. Meanwhile, it’s windy in Whitchurch. 33 min: Chadli strides down the left, finds the overlapping Gibbs who rattles a low cros into Rodriguez in the area, but Fuchs is alert and removes the danger. Leicester go on the attack, with Mahrez shaping to shoot a couple of times but not finding the space before West Brom can eventually clear. 31 min: A rare burst of activity from West Brom ends with Livermore hoofing a high ball straight into touch. 29 min: Leicester counter after a rare WBA attack. Albrighton strolls forward with the ball but then plays a long, hopeful pass to Iheanacho that he can do little with. A moment later Vardy attempts to find Iheanacho again, but is ‘fouled’ by Evans in the process (there was minimal contact). From the free-kick, Fuchs crosses and Myhill claims comfortably. 28 min: The Vardy and Iheanacho combination is also pretty flat, with the former Manchester City striker largely anonymous so far. 26 min: Pulis has switched Hegazi and Evans, incidentally, given how much joy Vardy was having against the former earlier in the match. Seems to be working as Vardy has quietened down a bit now. 25 min: That’s a pretty awful passage of football. West Brom lose possession from a throw-in - twice - then Leicester hoof the ball forward, lose possession, and West Brom pass back to Myhill. Best league in the world. 23 min: Simpson tries his luck with a long ball into the box, it falls for Albrighton, now on the right, but he can’t get a good cross or shot in. 22 min: Ndidi carts a cros into the box, but he hits it behind Vardy who can’t arrange his body to deal with it. A better ball from the Leicester midfielder and that would have been dangerous. 21 min: Leicester have had 60% of the ball - rare for them - but West Brom are so deep, and so determined just to ruin things, that they’re struggling to find a way through. 20 min: Albrighton does finally win a foul as Dawson goes through him. Somehow, Leicester lose possession from it and West Brom go on the attack. Chadli finds himself with the ball having popped up on the right, but his cross is a tame one. 19 min: Albrighton finds himself on the receiving end of Chadli’s boots, but Mike Dean waves play on and the Leicester wing is back on his feet soon enough. Leicester continue to pass the ball about between themselves, never quite looking like they’ve got a plan for how to get it through the West Brom back four. 17 min: Rondon finds himself with the ball near the corner flag. He pulls it back to Gibbs, who fizzes a pass To Chadli. He has a crack, but mishits it. Still, was the most dangerous West Brom attack so far. 16 min: The early pattern is that Leicester are very much on the front foot, with West Brom sitting back and happy to let them have the ball. Fuchs finds Vardy after a spell of Leicester passing, but he loses the ball as he attempts to turn into the box. 14 min: Iborra finds Iheanacho, who picks out Albrighton. He clatters a shot at goal - but it’s blocked by a West Brom defender a long way out. 12 min: Leicester pass the ball around the back, before Maguire steps into midfield and finds Mahrez outside the area. He tries to fashion an opening for Albrighton to cross, but West Brom shut things down. Leicester build again. 10 min: Chadli and Gibbs work well up the left, crossing into the middle. There’s a brief shout of handball, from the Leicester players against Rodriguez, but Mike Dean is unconcerned. 8 min: Mahrez takes it again, and it’s a much better cross - the ball fizzes between keeper and the West Brom defenders, inviting someone to stick head or toe on it. Nobody does, however, and West Brom can breathe again. 8 min: Vardy and Hegazi tussle again, this time in the form of a hand-off in the Leicester striker’s face. Hegazi gets a yellow card for his troubles. Another free-kick just outside the area. 7 min: But Vardy gets the better of Hegazi the next time they clash. The Leicester striker goes scootling up the left at pace and the West Brom defender lunges in to hack him down. Free kick 10 yards from the touchline, taken by Mahrez and cleared with ease by West Brom. 5 min: Vardy attempts to put Hegazi under some pressure, but the West Brom centre back holds him off well and the ball rolls out for a goal kick. Myhill, starting in place of the injured Foster, hoofs it forward 3 min: Rondon and Rodriguez ping the ball about between them on the edge of the D, but Leicester City have four men around the ball and can clear. 2 min: Schmeichel takes a free kick a long way out of his area, pumping the ball forward to Mahrez who cannot control it. West Brom get hold of the ball, allowing Wes Morgan to scythe Kieron Gibbs down for a free kick on the halfway line. We’re off! Leicester, in blue, get things started and more or less immediately lose possession. They win it back eventually and attempt to build from the back - to no avail. The players are in the tunnel, the mascots re looking around nervously, and various people are clapping their hands exuberantly and bellowing ‘Come on boys!’. All of which means we’re about four minutes from kick-off. So Shakespeare plays a 4-4-2 with Vardy and Iheanacho up front together. He says the onus is with his side to be attacking, but to watch for West Brom counterattacks. Pulis appears to be playing 4-3-3 and Chadli seems fit to start. Pulis says he has been desperate to get him in the team and is hoping he’ll work well with Gibbs up the left. Leicester City: Schmeichel, Simpson, Maguire, Morgan, Fuchs, Ndidi, Iborra, Mahrez, Albrighton, Iheanacho, Vardy. Subs: Chilwell, Gray, King, Hamer, Amartey, Slimani, Okazaki. West Brom: Myhill, Dawson, Hegazi, Evans, Gibbs, Livermore, Krychowiak, Barry, Chadli, Rodriguez, Rondon. Subs: Nyom, Yacob, Phillips, Brunt, McClean, McAuley, Palmer. Ref: Mike Dean There are those managers who use their pre-match pressers to get into the mind of the opposition. There are those who use the platform as an excuse to mouth off, to lay traps, or simply to sell the game. And there are managers like Tony Pulis who, well … don’t. The best he managed in the buildup to this match was this: “On Monday night I’m looking forward to going over there to play in what we know will be a competitive game.” Thanks Tony. Still, he must have something as West Brom are firmly mid-table despite not having won a match in their past five league games. They’ve been very Pulissy. This season they’ve scored six goals in seven games which keeps them bang on their just-shy-of-a-goal-a-game trend: in their last 317 Premier fixtures, they’ve scored 316 goals. This may not be a goal-fest. It’s unlikely to be a possession-fest either, these two sides have the lowest stats for possession in the Premier League this season. What we’re about to feast upon may simply be two sides furiously passing the ball to each other, then getting it straight back again. Leicester have only won once in the Premier League this season (a 2-0 win at home to Brighton midway through August) in amongst a run of tough fixtures that has included Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool. They’ve picked up a couple of points with draws to Huddersfield and Bournemouth but know that matches against teams like West Brom offer them a chance to get out of the bottom three and go on something of a run. Their next league matches are against Swansea, Everton and Stoke and they could do with going into them in something approaching form. “The school report will say we could do better, I don’t hide behind that,” said the manager Craig Shakespeare. “I see our quality and commitment every day in training. The hardest thing is sometimes translating that into the game, but the work ethic I will never doubt.” Shakespeare made over 100 appearances for West Brom as a player and spent nearly 10 years there as a coach, however Leicester haven’t beaten WBA at home for 23 years. “Maybe I won’t tell the lads,” honked Shakespeare over the weekend. “Sometimes you have these little quirks against teams. Centre forwards have these quirks where they always score against a certain team. Who knows what it’s about?” Jamie Vardy, Wilfred Ndidi and Ben Chilwell are all available but Robert Huth and Matty James remain out. Nacer Chadli, James Morrison and Hal Robson-Kanu are all doubts for West Brom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/16/how-was-your-weekend-running","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T07:46:19Z","webTitle":"How was your weekend running?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/16/how-was-your-weekend-running","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2017/oct/16/how-was-your-weekend-running","fields":{"headline":"How was your weekend running?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of my favourite autumn races took place yesterday - the Cabbage Patch 10 miler. I can’t say I did it much justice on very weary post-marathon legs, but as always it was a great run, through Twickenham, Ham and Richmond, along the river and past some rather bemused dog walkers and startling innocent bystanders. Usually, by mid-October, there is a slight snap in the air, and a warm up top clutched until just before the start. This year it was more like summer - I might not have been racing it, but after about two miles I was feeling like I’d got stuck in a sauna. True to form, the race was won in the sprightly times of 49min 42sec and 54min 46sec. Yes, for 10 miles. I missed the awards ceremony, which is a shame as the look on the winners faces (if they’ve not done it before) when they are presented with an actual cabbage is usually worth staying for. The prize money for this local race is very generous, and the times always impressive - one Mo Farah is a former winner - but my own particular congrats to my teammates Stephen and Nick, who both came in under an hour. Meanwhile there were races galore happening yesterday - from Amsterdam to Melbourne marathons, and on Saturday the cross country season kicked off, at least for my team. I had an excuse note signed by my youngest, who turned six that day, but I’ve seen the photos - and there is not one drop of mud to be seen. That has to have been one of the warmest cross country races on record ... So over to you - what did the weekend hold?

Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the BBC that while it had not yet reached crisis levels, it was worrying that debt among young people was growing. He talked about a shift in the generational pattern of wealth and income. “There is a pronounced buildup of indebtedness amongst the younger age group,” Bailey said. “We should not think this is reckless borrowing. This is directed at essential living costs. It is not credit in the classic sense, it is [about] the affordability of basic living in many cases.” The number of 18- to 34-year-olds becoming insolvent jumped by nearly a third (31.3%) between 2015 and 2016, according to the Insolvency Service. Seaside towns in England and Wales have the worst levels of debt among young adults in the UK, led by the Isle of Wight, Torbay and Scarborough. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said: “The under-40s, in particular, are suffering financial hardship because of the worrying accumulation of debt in the UK. The Conservatives have forgotten about their manifesto pledge to create a ‘breathing space’ scheme so that people in serious difficulties can have legal protection from interest, charges and bailiffs for six weeks. For the head of the FCA to make this intervention shows how urgently this must be introduced.” Bailey added: “There are particular concentrations [of debt] in society, and those concentrations are particularly exposed to some of the forms and practices of high-cost debt which we are currently looking at very closely because there are things in there that we don’t like.” He said he would like to see “more focus on what is sustainable, affordable credit provision”, with action being taken to reduce long-term credit card debt and high-cost payday loans. The regulator is also scrutinising the rent-to-own sector, which can charge high levels of interest for white goods such as washing machines, he said. The FCA’s clampdown on payday lenders, with a cap on charges introduced in 2015, severely curtailed the market and meant that there were fewer than 1 million people using payday lenders, compared with 10 million previously, said Kit Malthouse, a member of the treasury select committee. “It’s a question of where those people go,” he told BBC Radio 4 on Monday. Unsecured household debt in Britain, which includes credit cards, overdrafts and car loans, recently topped £200bn for the first time since the financial crisis, up 10% in the past year. Bailey said: “There has been a clear shift in the generational pattern of wealth and income, and that translates into a greater indebtedness at a younger age. That reflects lower levels of real income, lower levels of asset ownership. There are quite different generational experiences.” The shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, Jonathan Reynolds, said: “There is a lot of human tragedy in these stories … People have no choice but to get into debt.” Labour has proposed a cap on credit card interest charges, which means people would have to pay back no more than twice the amount of their borrowings. Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said: “Andrew Bailey is absolutely right to highlight the growing debt burden on young people – often to meet basic livings costs. “While this trend may not yet be considered a risk, on its own, to the economy as a whole, debt problems at such an early age can have a huge impact on the individuals involved. Debt advice can make all the difference, but worryingly, far too few young people are seeking advice when they fall into difficulty.” The charity’s Borrowed Years report found that 37% of 18- to 24-year-olds are already in debt, owing an average of £2,989 – excluding student loans and mortgages. About half say they regularly worry about money and one in five sometimes cannot sleep as a result. Hannah Maundrell, the editor-in-chief of money.co.uk, said people should check their bank account daily, the interest rates they are paying once a month and shop around for cheaper options unless they are locked into a contract. They can cut the cost of interest by doing a balance transfer or use savings to pay down their balance, move from standard energy tariffs to cheaper fixed rates and should always compare insurance policies before renewing, she advised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2017/oct/16/ex-hurricane-ophelia-landfall-tropical-storm-ireland-red-weather-warning-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T22:36:11Z","webTitle":"Storm Ophelia: second person killed in Ireland, police confirm - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/oct/16/ex-hurricane-ophelia-landfall-tropical-storm-ireland-red-weather-warning-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2017/oct/16/ex-hurricane-ophelia-landfall-tropical-storm-ireland-red-weather-warning-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Storm Ophelia: second person killed in Ireland, police confirm - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’re closing this live blog now. Thanks so much for joining us and do stay safe out there. Three people have been killed as tropical storm Ophelia battered Ireland with winds of more than 100mph. Clare O’Neill was killed when high winds brought down a tree on her car in Aglish, Waterford. Michael Pyke died after an accident with his chainsaw while trying to clear a fallen tree in Ballybrado, Tipperary. Another man, who has not yet been named, died in Ravensdale, near Dundalk, when a tree struck his car. At least 360,000 electricity customers are without power amid scores of reports of fallen trees and power lines. The network operator warned that the majority of those already affected would be without power tonight and 5% to 10% could be without electricity for up to 10 days. Northern Ireland was also affected, with 18,000 customers suffering a loss of power, including the Stormont parliament. The force of Ophelia was such that it blew roofs off buildings in Cork. Douglas Community school saw the roof of its gym ripped off and the roof of Cork City football club’s stadium collapsed. A gust of 118mph was recorded off the coast of Ireland. All schools across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are to remain closed on Tuesday as the authorities deal with the aftermath of Storm Ophelia. The decision was taken to “avoid any potential risk to life for children and staff” after severe winds caused widespread damage to the electricity network, structural damage and uprooted trees. The Met Office has extended an amber weather warning to parts of Scotland, Wales and northern England with winds threatening power cuts and falling debris. A series of flood alerts and warnings are in place for south west and north west England. Planes have been grounded at Manchester airport, with 50 flights cancelled and passengers warned to check ahead before travelling to the airport. The remnants of the Ophelia hurricane are due to batter the western parts of Scotland from around midnight tonight although effects are already being felt. The Met Office has an an amber warning covering Dumfries and Galloway, Lothian and Borders, and Strathclyde, with winds up to 80mph expected. People are being advised to check weather and traffic reports before travelling, or to stay indoors if possible as the storms begins to make landfall. Two of the storm’s victims have been named Michael Pyke from County Tipperary and Clare O’Neill from County Waterford. Pyke was killed after he went to cut up a tree which had fallen on a road in the Ballybrado area. The 31-year-old died at the scene. Independent politician Mattie McGrath, who knows the family, said: It’s a devastating tragedy for the family of this young man. They’re a hard-working family and for his life to be taken like that is just shocking. It would bring home to us the dangers of going out into the wind. O’Neill, who was due to celebrate her 59th birthday tomorrow, was killed after a tree fell on her car near the village of Aglish. It is believed the oncology nurse and mother of one, who was driving a car with a woman in her 70s in the passenger seat, when the branch of a tree fell on the vehicle and went through the windscreen. The passenger was taken to University Hospital Waterford with non-life threatening injuries. Local shopkeeper Richard Hurley, who knew O’Neill, told the Irish Mirror: She was a very jolly woman, very helpful. It’s a big shock, it’s a miserable morning, a young woman like that in such a tragic accident. A third male victim died in Ravensdale, Dundalk after a tree struck the car he was in. In case you missed it, here’s a photo gallery from earlier, which mostly shows how Ireland was battered by the storm. The remnants of the Ophelia hurricane are due to batter the western parts of Scotland from around midnight tonight although effects are already being felt. The Met Office has an an amber warning covering Dumfries and Galloway, Lothian and Borders, and Strathclyde, with winds up to 80mph expected. Other parts of Scotland have a lower yellow warning. People are being advised to check weather and traffic reports before travelling, or to stay indoors if possible as the storms begins to make landfall. Although the strongest winds are likely overnight they may last into the morning’s busy travel period across the central belt of Scotland and in the north-east of England. Here is a live animated map showing where Storm Ophelia is now. It is currently heading towards the west coast of Scotland and forecasters have warned that Scotland is “in for a rough night”. The Police Service of Northern Ireland have helped rescue a number of people from apartments on the Belfast Lough shore. The residents from Rodgers Quay in Carrickfergus were evacuated out of the complex following fears of tidal surges tonight. They have been taken to a local council hall for the evening, the PSNI said. A pub in Carrickfergus has also had to be evacuated tonight. In a tweet from the JD Wetherspoon-owned Central Bar, staff said: “Folks on advice from the PSNI we have had to evacuate the pub due to a possible and I must stress possible storm surge coming up Belfast Lough. They added: “Stay safe, do not attempt to come to the pub at this time. We will keep you posted.” People in the Republic of Ireland are being advised that there may be some disruption to health services over the next few days. Health minister Simon Harris released a statement asking those who do not have GP or hospital appointments to stay home unless it is urgent. He said: I want to thank all those who came to work today and went above and beyond. We do expect some continued disruption over the coming days but we can expect a gradual return to normal services. The message for tomorrow is if you have an appointment turn up as planned, unless you hear otherwise. The main focus of our community services tomorrow and in the coming days will be dealing with the most vulnerable patients. I would ask if you don’t have an appointment and if it’s not urgent please don’t attend your GP or hospital. Locals on Ireland’s most northerly point have braved Storm Ophelia for a first-hand view of its impact on the Atlantic, the Press Association reports. As the ex-hurricane swept north, huge waves crashed into clifftops and blew the roof off a caravan at Malin Head. Local man Kevin Farren said: I was sitting in my house looking out the window when I saw the roof of one of the caravans near us blow clean off. It just got lifted by the storm and blew along. There are boats all along the pier here which the fishermen haven’t taken in. I’m not sure they’ll still be there when they come back tomorrow. The wind is always rough here, it’s certainly not the worst we’ve ever seen. Unless things get much worse overnight it won’t have been too bad. Malin Head previously held the record for the highest wind speed recorded on the island of Ireland at 113mph in 1961. It is thought that record has now transferred to Cork following Ophelia. Meteorologists with Met Éireann measured winds of 34 knots, or 40mph, at Malin Head as the storm swept over. Another local, who declined to be named, said he lived nearby but had driven up to the clifftop at Banba’s Crown out of curiosity to see the storm as it passed. It’s the first time we’ve ever had a red weather warning round these parts, so I came up to see what it would be like. It’s not that different to what we’d be used to the rest of the time because we have strong winds round here all the time as it’s so exposed. I think we’ll be safe enough. Many businesses in the surrounding area, including shops and cafes, were closed as a precautionary measure following warnings from authorities that people should not make unnecessary journeys. Trafficwatch NI has an interesting up-to-date figure on how Ophelia is causing chaos on Northern Ireland’s roads tonight. As of 6pm this evening there were 179 fallen trees or branches across the region’s roads. South Down is the area hardest hit by the storm on Monday evening and Trafficwatch NI points out that out of that 179 figure, 83 are roads in coastal parts of the county. Meanwhile there are now 18,500 customers without electricity due to felled and damaged power lines. And while schools and further education colleges will shut for a second day on Tuesday, both Queen’s University and Ulster University will reopen. Here’s a video Jon Williams of RTÉ News has posted on Twitter showing trees felled by the storm in Cork. Age UK is urging people to check on older family members and friends during the storm and make sure they are safe and comfortable. Although the Irish Defence Forces have been deployed through the day to help with flood defences and rescue missions across Ireland one of its units had to cancel training due to Ophelia. Its 11th Infantry Battalion has had to call off an exercise to prepare them for UN peacekeeping duties in Lebanon. Their mission readiness exercise puts commanders and soldiers through a series of scenarios based on threats in the South Lebanon region. Troops were to be asked to secure, extract and evacuate personnel involved in a complex attack. However due to the storm, tomorrow’s exercise in the Glen of Imaal has been cancelled. A charity has warned those with severe asthma to check forecasts and stay indoors where possible to avoid the dust. Sonia Munde, head of the helpline at Asthma UK, said: We are deeply concerned about the toxic air from Saharan dust that Hurricane Ophelia has churned up, as this could pose a severe risk for the 5.4 million people in the UK who have asthma. Winds picking up dust and particles in the air could trigger potentially fatal asthma attacks. About 16,000 customers are without electricity in Northern Ireland. That number is expected to rise as winds continue to strengthen. Here is a map Northern Ireland Electricity has produced outlining the areas where there are power outages this evening. A member of the ruling Fine Gael party in the second chamber of the Irish parliament believes Ireland will be entitled to financial aid to help with reconstruction in the aftermath of Ophelia. Senator Neale Richmond said the EU Solidarity Fund should be accessed. The fund was established by the EU in 2002 following severe floods in Central Europe. Since then it has been used to help out in disasters such as forest fires, floods and even earthquakes. Richmond said: Given the huge amount of damage inflicted across the country by Hurricane Ophelia, Ireland will be eligible for such funds. Any application has to be received by the European commission within 12 weeks of any disaster occurring. This not a rapid response tool but it will be vital to the post storm recovery and I have no doubt the government will apply to draw down these funds once the initial emergency and relief measures are attended to. The interesting question will be whether Northern Ireland could apply to the same European fund via the Westminster government even as Theresa May negotiates the UK’s exit from the EU. All schools across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are to remain closed on Tuesday as the authorities deal with the aftermath of Storm Ophelia. The decision was taken to “avoid any potential risk to life for children and staff” after severe winds caused widespread damage to the electricity network, structural damage and uprooted trees. Richard Bruton, Ireland’s education minister, said over 350,000 businesses and homes are already without power, severe winds continue to cause damage and many roads are closed due to fallen trees. He said: It is also the case that school authorities will in very many cases not have had an opportunity to check their buildings and confirm they are safe, have power and water, and that routes to the school are safely open. Bruton admitted that the decision to close schools “will have a major impact on families and on the workforce.” He added, however: “This decision has been taken in the interests of safety for children and to provide clarity for everyone concerned.” He said his department will issue guidance to schools in relation to making up lost days. In relation to further and higher education Bruton said it was up to individual institutions to decide whether to open. In Northern Ireland, the education department said schools have been advised to remain closed. The decision was taken following a meeting of the Civil Contingencies Group, after the Met Office advised it on “the prolonged nature and potential severity of the storm”. Derek Baker, permanent secretary, said: I fully appreciate this decision will impact on the work of the schools and indeed on other businesses and services but the decision has been taken to avoid any potential risk to life for children and young people as well as staff. The Irish government have announced emergency measures to keep the street homeless safe during Storm Ophelia. Homeless people in Dublin are being picked up by buses and brought indoors and over 200 emergency bed spaces have been sourced in the city area. MerrionStreet, the Irish government’s news service says the priority across Ireland continues to be ensuring that any homeless person will have access to shelter during Storm Ophelia. Across the country rough sleepers are being supported by charities and local authorities who are picking them by taxi and taking them to shelter. A statement said: Additional facilities providing shelter and supports to those who need them have opened up across the country today. Notices have been posted in relation to the extra facilities, cafes and emergency beds that are available in the system. There have been over 100 calls to the emergency lines and to the rough sleeper email address from concerned members of the public in relation to homeless individuals. These have all been followed up on. Eoghan Murphy, minister for housing, planning and local government, indicated that he will continue to keep matters under review and confirmed that he is making all the required supports and resources available to local authorities to ensure the safety of Ireland’s homeless and rough sleepers. This is Nicola Slawson taking over from Haroon. Thanks for joining us. I’ll be keeping you up to date throughout the evening. A number of flights to UK airports have been diverted after “smoke smells” were reported on board, the Press Association reports. EasyJet said four of its flights were diverted due to “atmospheric circumstances” while a British Airways spokeswoman said the carrier has had “some reports of smells on board” but the aircraft continued to their destinations. Liverpool John Lennon Airport stated that “atmospheric conditions” are believed to be causing flights to divert. An easyJet spokeswoman said: “EasyJet can confirm that four of its flights flying in the west of the UK have reported smoke smells in the cockpit today, believed to be linked to atmospheric circumstances due to storm Ophelia. Two flights returned shortly after take-off and two flights requested an expedited landing as a precaution only. We understand other airlines have experienced similar events and we continue to liaise with the Met Office as to the likely cause. The safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by the diversions. BA said in a statement: The safety of our customers and crew is always our priority. Our flights have been operating and landing normally, but we have been liaising with the Met Office about atmospheric conditions. What we know so far: Three people have been killed as tropical storm Ophelia batters Ireland with winds of more than 100mph. Waterford council said a woman was killed when high winds brought down a tree on her car in Aglish. A man in his early 30s died after an accident with his chainsaw while trying to clear a fallen tree in Ballybrado, Tipperary. Another man died in Ravensdale, near Dundalk, close to the border with Northern Ireland, when a tree struck his car. At least 360,000 electricity customers are without power amid scores of reports of fallen trees and power lines. The network operator warned that the majority of those already affected would be without power tonight and 5% to 10% could be without electricity for up to 10 days. Northern Ireland was also affected, with 18,000 customers suffering a loss of power, including the Stormont parliament. The force of Ophelia was such that it blew roofs of buildings in Cork. Douglas Community school saw the roof of its gym ripped off and the roof of Cork City football club’s stadium collapsed. A gust of 118mph was recorded off the coast of Ireland. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, issued a personal appeal for citizens of the Republic to remain indoors. He described the impact of Ophelia on Ireland as a “national emergency”. All schools in the Republic of Ireland will remain closed tomorrow in the interests of “child safety”, the education minister announced. The Northern Ireland department of education followed suit. Cork airport said no more flights would be departing today, while public transport in the Republic of Ireland will not be resuming until 5am on Tuesday at the earliest. Bill Clinton’s visit to Belfast was cancelled because of the storm. The former US president was due to meet political parties represented in the Stormont parliament to urge them to find a way to restore the power-sharing government. Government buildings in Northern Ireland have been closed. The Met Office has extended an amber weather warning to parts of Scotland, Wales and northern England with winds threatening power cuts and falling debris. A series of flood alerts and warnings are in place for south west and north west England. Planes have been grounded at Manchester airport, with 20 flights cancelled and passengers warned to check ahead before travelling to the airport. Waves of up to 27ft high were recorded at sea as a rare warning for hurricane-force 12 winds was issued for shipping areas south of Ireland. Parts of the UK were covered by an eerie red/orange sky. Experts said the hue was caused by Hurricane Ophelia dragging in tropical air and dust from the Sahara. The number of customers without electricity in Northern Ireland has soared. The department of education in Northern Ireland has followed in the footsteps of its southern Irish counterpart by instructing all schools to close tomorrow. The latest official update warns that storm Ophelia will “bring further violent and destructive winds for a time, with gusts of 120 and 150km/h”, as well as flooding, posing a threat to life and property. The Gardai have confirmed that another man has died in Ravensdale, near Dundalk, close to the border with Northern Ireland, as a result of a falling tree. Ahead of her dinner in Brussels this evening, Theresa May spoke with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar this afternoon. She expressed her condolences over the loss of two lives so far in Ireland (since up to three) connected with storm Ophelia. A Downing Street spokesman said: On storm Ophelia, the prime minister expressed her sympathies for the loss of life and said the UK government stood ready to provide any support if requested. A person in Dundalk, near the border with Northern Ireland, has died after a tree fell on their car, taking the death toll in Ireland as a result of the storm to three, Dublin-based station 98FM and others are reporting. Schools in Ireland will not reopen tomorrow, the Irish minister for education has announced, citing the need to ensure child safety. Unsurprisingly, Cork airport has said there will be no more flights today, with a video illustrating why. Northern Ireland Electricity has announced that 1,300 customers are without power as Storm Ophelia starts to batter the region this afternoon. NIE is reporting what it describes as “widespread damage” across Northern Ireland. As the storm system rolls over the north of Ireland, the rail link between Belfast to Dublin has been temporarily shut down. The Associated Press reports that the wind speed off Cork has reached 118mph. Meanwhile wind speeds in Wales are also increasing, hitting 77mph. Coastal defences in Galway, on Ireland’s west coast, have been overwhelmed. Readers around Ireland and the UK have been getting in touch to share their experiences of the storm as it passes by where they live. Crawford Deane, in Timoleague, south-west of Cork, shared images of trees strewn across local roads, which he said were mostly deserted: Deane added: “I’m safely home, although had to abandon my van and walk home through fields near Farnivane. Since then the local mast and electrical substation are out.” Conor Graham, in Cork, has described missile-like tiles flying off buildings and implores other readers to stay safe. There are also multiple reports of that red-tinged sun – as experts have said debris from the storm is causing a haze in areas as far away as Chesterfield, Solihull and Surrey.

The Irish Republic’s Electricity Supply Board has said that 360,000 customers are now without power due to Storm Ophelia. The energy supplier warned that more outages are expected and that repair operations could take several days. Meanwhile, power cuts are starting to happen in Northern Ireland, including at the Stormont Parliament, where Bill Clinton was meant to be visiting today. An international photojournalist has contacted the Guardian with a graphic account of what it was like to be in an aircraft trying to land in Dublin in the middle of Storm Ophelia. You can see footage of another plane’s precarious landing in Dublin in an earlier update. Writing from an Aer Lingus plane after it just touched down a few minutes ago, Paulo Nunes Santos wanted to praise the female pilot who guided flight EI483 from Lisbon safely home. Santos, originally from Portugal but who has lived in Dublin for 15 years, said: I’ve been in hundreds, if not thousands of flights, but never experienced this level of turbulence. We only started feeling it more or less as we started approaching via Cork. The pilot was great. The plane shook like mad and the approach to the runway was the worst I have experienced. But the pilot, she was brilliant. Oddly there was no panic among the passengers. Every clapped and applauded the pilot, we were told her name is Niamh Jennings. You feel the huge sense of relief in the plane. Irish police have confirmed that a man in his 30s was killed while clearing a tree with a chainsaw in Ballybrado, Tipperary. There are reports of a second death from the storm. A man was killed trying to clear a tree with a chainsaw in Tipperary, according to the Irish Daily Mirror.

The Environment Agency has three flood warnings and 13 flood alerts in place for south west and north west England. Cumbria council has closed the Ford bridge in Burneside, near Kendal More strange light is being reported across the UK. There are several reports of a strange dark orange light in northern England. Earlier today a red looking sun was seen in many parts of England. The light is caused by particulates thrown up by the storm, according to experts. Irish Rail has cancelled all trains for the rest of the day. All schools in Pembrokeshire on the west of Wales coast have been closed, as disruption from Ophelia spreads to the UK. At least four downed trees are causing traffic problems in the county, the council said. Around 200 homes are without power in the Eglwyswrw area, including the school which had to close early. The council decided to close all of its schools at 1pm. The number of homes and businesses without power has almost doubled to 230,000, according to RTE. Power cuts are no longer confined to the south-west of Ireland. Around a thousand homes are without power in Cong in County Mayo. The violent winds caused by Storm Ophelia has affected the filming of Game of Thrones. Set building for the cult television series, a large part of which is filmed in Northern Ireland, has been suspended due to the storm. Filming on the new Superman prequel series Krypton, which is also being shot in the region, has also been halted for the day due to safety fears. The storm has ripped off roofs in Cork, according to dramatic footage and photographs. The fatal accident occurred in Aglish in west Waterford around 11.40am. The victim is a woman in her 20s and was travelling in the car with another woman who was also hurt. Reports from the county say the limb of a tree pierced the windscreen of the vehicle during the storm. The woman was taken to Waterford University hospital but was pronounced dead before arriving.

In its latest update the electricity supplier ESB said 120,000 customers are without power. It said: 120,000 customers, predominantly in southern counties are left without power Majority of customers currently without electricity will be without supply overnight Crews across the country are in the process of responding to electricity outages, once it is safe to do so Customers who use electrically powered medical devices should contact their healthcare professional An increase in hurricane-force winds wreaking havoc across the Britain and Ireland is entirely consistent with global warming, according to scientists. A warmer world means more energy in the climate system, especially in the oceans, which is where big storms derive their energy from. “There is evidence that hurricane-force storms hitting the UK, like Ophelia, will be enhanced in the future due to human-induced climate change,” said Dr Dann Mitchell, at the University of Bristol. “While tropical hurricanes lose strength when they travel north, they can re-intensify due to the nature of the atmospheric circulation at UK latitudes. It is the rise in temperatures over most of the Atlantic that is a primary driver of this, a clear signature of human-induced climate change.” In May, a report found that even the minimum global warming expected - an increase of 1.5C - is projected to increase the cost of windstorm destruction by more than a third in parts of the UK. If climate change heats the world even further, broken roofs and damaged buildings are likely to increase by over 50% across a swathe of the nation, the report found. Northern Ireland, facing Hurricane Ophelia on Monday, is the worst affected region of the UK. However, the high winds battering the west coasts are not highly unusual, according to Julian Heming, tropical prediction scientist at the UK Met Office, said: “Wind gusts of up to 80mph are expected over the UK from ex-hurricane Ophelia. This kind of wind strength is not unusual for an autumn/winter storm in the UK. For example, four of the five named storms affecting the UK in 2016 recorded wind gusts in excess of 80 mph.” The Met Office said that while unusual for hurricanes to impact the UK, it’s not unprecedented with Gordon impacting the UK in 2006 and Grace in 2009. The broadcaster RTE is reporting that a woman has been killed by fallen tree in Waterford Waterford council confirmed one fatality in Aglish in the south-west of the county. Government buildings in Northern Ireland are to close at 1pm, PA reports. The head of the Northern Ireland civil service, David Sterling, held an emergency meeting with the permanent secretaries from all government departments on Monday morning. It was decided that all government buildings providing non-essential services close at 1pm and all non-essential civil service staff will leave work at that time. Guidance is to be issued later about school opening arrangements for Tuesday. Here’s our news story rounding up the latest on the storm. These before and after stills show trees uprooted by the storm. Anglesey county council, in north Wales, has instructed all schools to close after lunch because of the threat posed by Ophelia. This video, from Sky News’s Dublin correspondent, vividly illustrates the storm’s force: A series of flood alerts and flood watches are in force for south-west and north-west England. Red sky in the morning, shepherds warning… A red sun being seen in parts of the UK has been caused by particulates thrown up by Ophelia, according experts. Belfast international airport has confirmed that it has cancelled 24 flights, most of them to or from the UK. A spokesman said the airport is on standby to take diverted flights destined for Dublin including a number of transatlantic flights. Up to 100,000 homes and businesses in Ireland are now without power, according to Derek Hynes, operations manager of the electricity supplier ESB. He warned a news briefing that more homes will be without power by the end of the day. He said: We have, and we will have had, trees falling on our network over the course of this morning. We do have, and we have more, live electrical wires on the ground. Please stay safe by staying clear of all fallen electricity wires. We are approaching 100,000 homes and businesses without electricity. They are predominantly in an area from Cork city west and north up as far as Tralee. That currently comprises a total of about 400 individual outages. Each one of these individual outages is a potential threat to members of the public in terms of fallen wires on the ground. Storm watchers reckon Ophelia is making landfall in County Kerry. Broadcaster RTE also reports the storm making landfall Met Éireann has issued a new warning for “violent and destructive gusts” of up 93mph (150 kmph) across Ireland and even strong gusts in coastal and hilly areas. It repeated a warning to life and property, with the strongest winds in the provinces of Munster and south Leinster. Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has appealed to the Irish public to stay indoors as Storm Ophelia batters Ireland. Referring to the biggest storm recorded in Irish history, Debbie in the 1960s, he said: “The last time we had a storm this severe 11 lives were lost so safety is our number one priority.” Speaking in Dublin before a cabinet meeting to co-ordinate Ireland’s response to the storm, Varadkar reminded the public that the red weather warning applied to all cities and all counties across Ireland. And he warned that the danger to public safety was not over even after the storm had passed the island as there would be fallen trees and felled power lines, many of which could still be live, all across the country in the aftermath of Ophelia. A media briefing by the Northern Ireland Office at Stormont today has been cancelled. Former US president Bill Clinton was scheduled to speak in the city today and deliver an address urging Northern Ireland’s political parties to find a solution that would restore devolved government in the region. During his trip Clinton was to hold talks with the parties represented at the Stormont assembly. Clinton was due to be in Ireland to receive an award from Dublin City University later on Monday evening. Kevin Moran, minister for flood relief, warned that the storm will bring flooding and widespread structural damage. Speaking at that press conference in Dublin he said: “This storm is over 120km in width so it is going to do an awful lot of structural damage to the whole country. There is going to be flooding in some parts of the country, but we don’t know the level. This is unprecedented. “What we are seeing happening in Cork at the present time and the amount of electricity that’s out, if that is to ripple right through then we’re faced with an awful problem tomorrow and right into the weekend.” Asked whether the Irish government had done enough to prepare the country, Moran said: “That’s an unfair question. We have spoken to every local authority in the country.” Varadkar said homeless people will be allowed to stay in hostels throughout the day to protect them from the storm. Engineers from the UK are to travel to Ireland to help restore power, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told that press conference. He said: “So far we don’t have any reports of any injuries, but we do have trees down and power outrages. About 15,000 are without power ... in Cork. “Staff are ready to come in from Northern Ireland and Britain to assist in the coming days in restoring power. We can only restore the power lines when it is safe to do so.” He added: “While in some parts of the country the storm is not yet that bad it is coming your way and this is a national red alert. It applies to all cities all counties and all areas. “Even after the storm has passed there will still be dangers. There will be trees on the ground. There will be power lines down.” Wind speeds of more than 77 mph (124kmph) were recorded at Cork airport at 10am, while an offshore speed of more than 109 mph was recorded on Fastnet Rock. Varadkar urges people to stay indoors as the storm passes. He said the government’s priority is to avoid injury. So far no injuries have been reported, he said. He urges people to work from home where possible. Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, is giving a TV address. There are now 22,000 customers hit with power cuts as lines are knocked down, according to the Electricity Supply Board in the Irish Republic. An ESB spokeswoman appealed to the public to stay away from fallen power lines as many of them are still live. Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, is due to give a live TV address in the next few minutes. Gust of more than 100mph were recorded as Tropical storm Ophelia approaches the southern coast of Ireland. A speed of of 165kmph (103mph) was recorded at an amateur station in Durrus, in county Cork. A speed of 92 was recorded at an official station on Fastnet Rock. Here’s satellite imagery from the National Weather Service Ocean Prediction Center. And this is the latest forecast track from the Irish Met office, Met Eireann. The storm has yet to make landfall. Here’s a map showing the forecast path of the storm. There are already 5,000 homes without electricity due to power lines coming down as Storm Ophelia hits the south and south-west of Ireland. Most of the power outages so far are in Cork and Kerry, where police said trees and power lines have already been brought down. With the red weather warning now extended to the entire Irish Republic, Gardai have advised people to stay indoors and only go out for essential journeys. Dublin Bus has withdrawn all its services in the Irish capital from 10am to 6pm tonight. In Northern Ireland meanwhile the lord chief justice has ordered all courts to be shut by 12.30pm. The Department of Agriculture has announced the closure of all forest parks in Northern Ireland for the day. The closure of all schools and colleges including universities is unprecedented for Northern Ireland. Here’s the stormy scene in Ballyrisode, in Cork south-west Ireland. The Met Office has extended an amber weather warning to parts of Scotland, Wales and northern England threatening power cuts and falling debris. It said: A spell of very windy weather is expected today in association with ex-Ophelia. Longer journey times and cancellations are likely, as road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected as well as some bridge closures. There is a good chance that power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage. Flying debris is likely, such as tiles blown from roofs, as well as large waves around coastal districts with beach material being thrown onto coastal roads, sea fronts and properties. This leads to the potential for injuries and danger to life. This warning has been updated to extend it into parts of north and west Wales and into the extreme south-west of Scotland. The storm has already brought down trees and power lines in south-west Ireland, according to the Irish police. In a video appeal, assistant commissioner Michael Finn said: This storm has arrived. Speaking to colleagues down in the south west this morning we have trees down in County Kerry, we have trees and power lines down in west Cork already this morning. This is just the start of the storm. I would appeal particularly to motorcyclists, cyclist and drivers of high-sided vehicles – you are particularly vulnerable out there this morning. So unless your journey is absolutely essential we don’t want you to put yourselves or indeed the emergency services at risk by being out in the road. We want to appeal also to people in the coastal areas, while it might be attractive to go to see some of these sights, you are putting yourself at serious risk by being in those areas ... We have gusts of up to 150 kmph arriving right now on our coasts, so be prepared. We’d like to hear from you if you’ve been affected by Ophelia or any of the associated disruption. You can share your pictures, videos and stories with us via this callout, or you can also message the Guardian on WhatsApp by adding the contact+44(0)7867825056. We’ll use a selection of your responses as part of our reporting. Please think of your safety first before recording or sharing any content with us. It’s a rapidly moving picture on the island of Ireland. In the last few minutes the Met Office in Northern Ireland has said the storm will now start battering the region around 12pm and adverse conditions will continue right up to midnight. The Met Office said there would be “short, sharp bursts of winds” of up to 80mph in Northern Ireland but the mean wind speed for the whole day could be up to 50mph. The wind is whipping up a sandstorm on a beach in Ballinspittle on the Cork coast, according to RTE’s Stephen Murphy. The Met Office in Belfast has said conditions will be at their worst from around 3pm today across Northern Ireland. It added that the storm will continue across the region until around 10pm tonight. So far 11 flights have been cancelled from Belfast City airport due to the storm. And in central Belfast, St Patrick’s soup kitchen will open later this afternoon to shelter the city’s homeless from Storm Ophelia throughout the day. In Derry some shops in the Foyleside shopping centre, including Debenhams, have closed for the day as the public in the city have been urged to stay indoors and not travel if at all possible. The coming storm seems to have spooked the crows in Cork. As Storm Ophelia barrels towards Ireland, the Irish president, Michael D Higgins, has issued an appeal for people to heed the warnings about the dangers it poses. Speaking from Australia where he is on a state visit, Higgins said he hoped everyone “took the necessary precautions” to protect life and property when the storm reaches the Republic from the middle of the morning onwards. Ireland’s transport minister, Shane Ross, has warned of huge disruption to the country’s transport network today. Ross said he was urging the public not to travel if at all possible on Monday. There are 140 flights cancelled from Ireland, Bus Éireann has announced all its school services are shut and the Garda Siochana have urged cyclists not to go out on their bikes today. Colleges and schools in the Republic and Northern Ireland are all closed for the day, with the Irish weather service, Met Eireann, warning again today on RTE radio that Ophelia still has the “potential for hurricane force winds and hurricane force gusts”. Ophelia is expected to the south and south-west of Ireland around 10am. People in many parts of Ireland have been warned to stay indoors at various times of the day while the storm passes. A general warning not to cycle today is also in force from Transport for Ireland. The bus service in Dublin has warned that all buses in the city will be withdrawn from 10am. Waves of almost 27ft high have been recored south-west of Ireland as the storm heads towards landfall, Dave Throup a seasoned storm watcher from the UK’s Environment Agency notes. No sign of any such waves near the Irish coast yet, but the wind is picking up according to RTE’s Brian O’Connell in Portmagee, on Ireland’s south-west coast. This is Matthew Weaver with live coverage on the impact of ex-hurricane Ophelia which is due to make landfall in the next hour. It is expected to batter Ireland and Northern Ireland with gusts of up to 80mph, threatening widespread disruption and life-threatening conditions. The weather system has weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm, but Ireland’s Met Office has issued a red weather warning, meaning potential danger to life. Schools in Ireland have been closed along with many government buildings and courts. Southern and western coasts are set to bear the initial brunt in the morning before it moves north. A rare warning of hurricane force 12 winds was issued in Monday’s shipping forecast for areas south and west of Ireland. It said: “Severe gale nine to violent storm 11 occasionally hurricane force 12 at first in North Fitzroy, Sole, Fastnet and Shannon.” An amber warning is in place for Northern Ireland, with the UK Met Office warning of potential power cuts, and disruption to transport and mobile phone reception. Flying debris such as roof tiles could be a danger to life, it said. The storm has arrived 30 years and a day after the Great Storm of October 1987."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/17/sugar-farmers-poised-to-win-senate-victory-over-david-leyonhjelm","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T17:00:05Z","webTitle":"Sugar farmers poised to win Senate victory over David Leyonhjelm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/17/sugar-farmers-poised-to-win-senate-victory-over-david-leyonhjelm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/17/sugar-farmers-poised-to-win-senate-victory-over-david-leyonhjelm","fields":{"headline":"Sugar farmers poised to win Senate victory over David Leyonhjelm","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Queensland’s sugar cane growers appear to have won a major battle against the New South Wales Liberal Democratic senator, David Leyonhjelm. The Senate will be voting on a controversial motion on Tuesday, moved by Leyonhjelm two months ago, to disallow the Coalition’s mandatory code of conduct for the sugar industry. The code was introduced in April in a bid to prevent sale agreements between sugar growers, millers and marketers from breaking down completely, following a toxic years-long dispute that affected Queensland and federal politics. But in August, Leyonhjelm moved a disallowance motion to torpedo the code of conduct, arguing it was imposing free trade. The Turnbull government will need the support of One Nation and the Greens to defeat the motion. One Nation will support the government, and the Greens’ party room resolved on Tuesday to support the government too. Labor will be voting with Leyonhjelm to disallow the code of conduct, arguing it was cobbled together at the last minute and a better code of conduct needs to be written after proper consultation. Last month, the peak lobby group for sugar farmers, Canegrowers, called on all major parties to defeat Leyonhjelm’s motion in the Senate, saying the code of conduct was a “vital safety net” for sugarcane farmers. “We need all parties to reinforce their support and defeat Senator Leyonhjelm’s misinformed attempt to confuse the issue and put misguided ideology ahead of what is needed in the real world,” said the chairman of Canegrowers, Paul Schembri. “We’ve written to Senator Leyonhjelm inviting him to Queensland to meet with growers to hear how important this code is but, as yet, he has not made any contact with grower representatives while pursuing this disallowance motion.” When Leyonhjelm first said he would be moving the disallowance motion in August, the canegrowers slammed the NSW senator for attacking Queensland farming families. “We are affronted the Senator David Leyonhjelm would do that from across the border without talking to growers and their representatives,” Schembri said. Leyonhjelm has argued the code of conduct restricts the rights of sugar marketers to sell sugar as they see fit. “This idea that after I’ve sold something I can still have some say over it, you know it’s ridiculous, and I don’t know of any other commodity where the farmers think they control it after they’ve sold it,” Leyonhjelm told the ABC at the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2017/oct/17/first-home-buyers-get-their-foot-in-the-door-but-will-it-slam-shut","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T17:00:05Z","webTitle":"First-home buyers get their foot in the door – but will it slam shut? | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/oct/17/first-home-buyers-get-their-foot-in-the-door-but-will-it-slam-shut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2017/oct/17/first-home-buyers-get-their-foot-in-the-door-but-will-it-slam-shut","fields":{"headline":"First-home buyers get their foot in the door – but will it slam shut?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"For most of this year the housing market has looked to be slowing but the past two months has seen a big surge in first-home buyers in Sydney and Melbourne taking advantage of policies that have cut stamp duty. As yet there has not been a resultant boost in house prices, something for which first-home buyers will be grateful, as they look to become one of those homeowners who, due to low interest rates, is finding it easier to pay off a mortgage than ever before. For much of the housing boom of the past five years, investment buying has been the name of the game. Right now it is owner-occupiers who have taken the lead. The latest housing finance data from the ABS shows owner-occupier finance growing annually by 16% – the fastest it has for nearly two years, while investor finance rose by just 1.4% in the past 12 months – well down on the 21% annual growth that occurred during 2016: The combination of slowing investment growth and improving owner-occupier growth has meant total annual growth of housing investment has stayed pretty steady at 9%. That continues to suggest that housing prices should moderate in the next six months, given the flow-on from housing finance growth to house price growth is around that length of time. And while the relationship is not exact, there is no real sense from these figures that house prices on average should start to grow any faster than they are now: But as is often the case with house prices, we need to break down the figures because the picture is not the same across the nation, and currently New South Wales and Victoria are driving growth. That in itself is not surprising, but it is partly coming from an usual source – first-home buyers. In August, the percentage of owner occupiers who were first-home buyers reached a four-year high of 17.2%. While the rolling 12-months average figure of 14.3% is less exuberant and suggests some caution is needed before assuming the tide has turned, it is clear that in the past two months first-home buyers have surged into the market: But that surge is mostly restricted to two states – NSW and Victoria – and this is due to first-home buyer concessions that came into being in July. In NSW, among other initiatives, the state government abolished stamp duty for first-home buyers on all homes up to $650,000 and cut it for homes up to $800,000, and gave a $10,000 grant for builders of new homes up to $750,000 and purchasers of new homes up to $600,000. In Victoria the government abolished stamp duty for first-home buyers of homes valued up to $600,000 and cut it on homes valued up to $750,000, and doubled the first-home buyers grant to $20,000 in regional Victoria. And it is abundantly clear that these policies have had an impact. In the first two months of this financial year, first-home buyers in NSW and Victoria have come back to the market in droves: That doesn’t truly mean that first-home buyers have been driving the growth in housing finance, but they have been punching above their weight. In June in NSW, first-home buyers accounted for just 8.8% of all owner-occupier loans – in August it was up to 12.9%. In Victoria the jump was from 14.4% to 18.3%: Of the other states, only WA had a higher proportion of first-home buyers in August than in June, suggesting that the surge is not so much a factor of younger people being able to come into the housing market due to general economic conditions as it is a direct response to the NSW and Victorian government policies. As such, it is questionable how sustained it will be. The massive jump does suggest a backlog of people desperate to get into the market. It may be that the backlog all came at once, or there may be enough to sustain the level for more months to come. As yet, there is no suggestion that this surge of first-home buyers has caused an equivalent jump in prices. In NSW in unadjusted terms, the average home loan taken out by first-home buyers was actually lower in August than it was 12 months ago, whereas the number of such buyers was 80% higher: You can certainly understand why people are wanting to get into the housing market. Data released by the ABS last Friday showed that the cost of a mortgage as a proportion of income is lower now than it ever has been while the affordability of rent has stayed much the same: This of course is not surprising – if you have record low interest rates, paying a mortgage is always going to be easier than it was – especially if you bought your house before the boom in house prices. But that affordability only works for those already in the housing market. For those waiting, the increase in prices makes the entry hurdle ever higher. And while you could choose to voluntarily lower the hurdle by paying a smaller deposit and higher monthly repayments, that can be a tough ask – especially if you are prudently planning for a time when interest rates do eventually rise. But the combination of lower deposits and higher house prices has led to Australia’s owner occupiers now being less likely than ever before to own their home outright, and more likely than ever before to still be paying a mortgage: In the early 2000s, the re-introduction of the first-home buyers’ grant by the Howard government – notionally to offset the introduction of the GST – helped cause a massive boom in house prices. But that boom was also accompanied by a surge of investors. So far, investors have not been the ones to respond to the new measures for first-home buyers in NSW and Victoria. The housing market does appear to be moderating and with continuing low interest rates, getting into the market remains as good as ever. But first-home buyers – especially in Sydney and Melbourne – will be hoping their renewed appearance at housing auctions does not lead to yet another increase in prices fuelled by government policies that bolster demand but do little to assist supply."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/17/wallabies-rugby-league-converts-out-to-prove-they-are-a-risk-worth-taking","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T17:00:05Z","webTitle":"Wallabies' rugby league converts out to prove they are a risk worth taking | Bret Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/17/wallabies-rugby-league-converts-out-to-prove-they-are-a-risk-worth-taking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/17/wallabies-rugby-league-converts-out-to-prove-they-are-a-risk-worth-taking","fields":{"headline":"Wallabies' rugby league converts out to prove they are a risk worth taking","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Could the Wallabies be on the cusp of a rugby league-led recovery? Should Karmichael Hunt be selected alongside Israel Folau and Marika Koroibete for the third Bledisloe Cup Test against the All Blacks in Brisbane on Saturday night, it will be the first time three high profile rugby league converts have played together for the Wallabies since Wendell Sailor, Lote Tuqiri and Mat Rogers. And it would not be a coincidence. Like former Wallabies coach Eddie Jones, who recruited Sailor, Tuqiri and Rogers, current Australia coach Michael Cheika is fascinated with rugby league. Cheika loves watching the game and incorporating NRL team plays into the Wallabies’ attack. He would be itching to get Folau, Koroibete and Hunt onto the field at the same time. Folau, of course, is an automatic selection at fullback, while Koroibete seems to have cemented his place on the wing after scoring three tries in his three Tests against Argentina and South Africa, providing the Wallabies with the finishing they have been looking for. Hunt, who was ruled out of the Rugby Championship with an ankle injury, has been recalled to the Wallabies training squad and his match fitness will be assessed to determine whether he will be considered for the All Blacks. If the former Brisbane Bronco proves himself at training, it would be unlikely he would start against the All Blacks, but he could secure a place on the bench at the expense of centre Samu Kerevi or specialist winger Henry Speight. Even if Hunt is not ready for the All Blacks, the chances of seeing the ex-rugby league trio together in the Test squad in the near future are good – given that Hunt can play anywhere from five-eighth to fullback there is a strong possibility the three of them could start alongside each other. While Folau is a supreme athlete, Cheika will be looking to Hunt and Koroibete to inject the uncompromising attitude of rugby league into the Wallabies. Koroibete and Hunt in particular defend with the physical aggression and intimidation that code is known for. There is also a synergy between the three of them, which Cheika would be keen to tap into. Folau and Hunt both played for the Broncos and the Queensland State of Origin team and were exposed to the same culture and influences. Similarly, Folau and Koroibete both spent time under the guidance of Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy, albeit six years apart. Their formative years in football have much in common, meaning they are in a strong position to work together. But as the great rugby league convert experiment of the early 2000s showed, there are rewards and risks with players from the 13-a-side code. The Wallabies reached the 2003 World Cup final with Sailor, Tuqiri and Rogers in the back three, but some still believe they would have beaten England if the natural rugby players, Chris Latham and Joe Roff, had started ahead of Rogers and Sailor respectively. There is an argument that union and league are such different games that it is not wise to recruit too heavily from the rival code. Union is not second nature to ex-league players, although Hunt and Koroibete played the 15-a-side game as schoolboys. Having three league converts on the field at the same time could expose the Wallabies to costly errors, particularly against the All Blacks. One of the biggest potential liabilities of Hunt and Koroibete is also one of their major strengths – their defence. Both players like to rush out of the defensive line and put big dominant hits on opposition players, rugby league-style. But old habits die hard. Sonny Bill Williams had not played rugby league for nine years, but was red-carded in the All Blacks’ loss in the second Test against the British and Irish Lions for a shoulder charge which connected with an opponent’s head. If you have two or three ex-league players in the team, there is the risk of increasing chances of bad habits creeping in at crucial times, something which may not be able to afford in a Bledisloe Cup Test or a World Cup knock-out match. But this is a risk that Cheika may feel he has to take to build a physically and mentally tough team that can finally win back the Bledisloe Cup and contend for the 2019 World Cup in Japan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/16/bruce-billson-cleared-of-breaching-standards-over-lobbying-salary","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T07:18:42Z","webTitle":"Bruce Billson cleared of breaching standards over lobbying salary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/16/bruce-billson-cleared-of-breaching-standards-over-lobbying-salary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/16/bruce-billson-cleared-of-breaching-standards-over-lobbying-salary","fields":{"headline":"Bruce Billson cleared of breaching standards over lobbying salary","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The former small business minister Bruce Billson has been cleared of breaching ministerial guidelines despite receiving undeclared payments from a business lobby group while still in parliament last year. A separate inquiry is still considering if Billson will be found in contempt of parliament. Malcolm Turnbull asked the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to investigate Billson in August this year after it was revealed the former Liberal MP had begun drawing a $75,000 a year salary from the Franchise Council of Australia before he left parliament in 2016. Billson had been dumped from cabinet in September 2015, after Turnbull took the Liberal party leadership from Tony Abbott, and six months later – in March 2016 – he announced that he had taken a job at the FCA. But he failed to disclose to the parliament’s register of interest that he had started drawing a salary from the lobby group. He also failed to disclose that he had been appointed a director of the council. He didn’t leave parliament until 9 May 2016, when both houses were dissolved for the 2016 federal election. It is a rule of parliament that MPs must declare all sources of income and directorships to the register of interests. On Monday Turnbull revealed that PM&amp;C had cleared Billson of breaching ministerial standards and the lobbying code of conduct. He tabled a letter in parliament from the PM&amp;C secretary, Martin Parkinson, dated 4 September. “Mr Billson has assured me that he both understands and has complied with his post-ministerial obligations under the standards,” Parkinson said in his letter. “Mr Billson has also assured me that he understands the requirements of the Australian government lobbying code of conduct. “On the basis of the information available to me, I have no reason to conclude Mr Billson has breached either the statement of ministerial standards or the lobbying code of conduct.” Turnbull was asked in question time on Monday if Parkinson had interviewed current ministers about the matter, as opposed to former ministers. “I’m advised he did not,” Turnbull said. Billson has also been referred to the parliamentary privileges committee to see if he should be found in contempt of parliament. MPs can be found in contempt of parliament if they fail to declare all sources of income and directorships to the register of interests. Billson told the ABC last month that he had made an “administrative failing” by failing to disclose his job with the FCA last year. “[It] was a discourtesy to the House of Representatives and an administrative failing of my behalf not to lodge a timely formal disclosure statement before the parliament was prorogued,” he reportedly said. “I have contacted the clerk of the house to convey my apologies for this error.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/18/new-zealand-library-auckland-hiding-cracks-case-missing-books","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T01:00:19Z","webTitle":"New Zealand library cracks case of the missing books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/18/new-zealand-library-auckland-hiding-cracks-case-missing-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/18/new-zealand-library-auckland-hiding-cracks-case-missing-books","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand library cracks case of the missing books","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A library in New Zealand has solved a longstanding mystery as to why books were going missing and reappearing in strange and hidden places. Auckland library staff grew increasingly puzzled when books kept turning up in unusual places, tucked under tables and chairs and hidden in hard-to-find spots around the library. “It was really odd and we couldn’t quite figure it out, we were finding books delicately tucked under shelves with a proper bookmark, no pages folded over or anything” said Auckland Libraries manager Rachael Rivera. “We thought someone was playing with us or it was bored kids.” The mystery was eventually solved when the library called a meeting with the city’s rough sleepers, and it was revealed many of them – who were unable to get library cards because they didn’t have a home address – had been hiding their books so they could come back to them the next day, and not risk losing their place. According to the latest figures from Auckland council there are more than 23,000 homeless people in New Zealand’s largest city, and more than 700 sleeping rough each night. Rivera said some members of the homeless community did have a card as the library allowed them to use the local City Mission as their residential address, but others were wary about damaging or losing library books if they took them out onto the streets. “That community really values the services we offer and treat the books with a great deal of respect,” said Rivera, who added that around 50 rough sleepers frequent the library daily. “A lot of the guys that come in are extremely well-read and have some quite eccentric and high-brow literary tastes ... people are homeless for so many different reasons, and being intelligent and interested in literature doesn’t preclude that.” Since discovering the cause of the missing books the library have dedicated a shelf for the homeless to safely store their books behind the main counter. The library also shows “discretion” with its homeless clients regarding overdue fines or late books. “We’ve seen a real increase in people using the library as a space to just be,” said Rivera. “And that’s a mix of people who are sleeping on the street as well as people living in tiny apartments in the CBD. It is surprising in this modern age we are in, but we actually feel like there are more people coming to the space then ever before.

There were also claims same-sex marriage was part of a grand plot to undermine the family; leading to the legalisation of polygamy, bestiality and paedophila. None of these scare-mongering predictions have come true. British life has carried on as before; the only difference being that LGBT people can now marry the person they love. It is sad to see these same scare-mongering tactics being used in Australia today. I heard some of them from the pastor of my mother’s church in Queensland. When I challenged him about all the terrible things he claimed had happened since European countries equalised marriage, he could not provide a single scrap of evidence. Yet I know that his preaching has impacted on members of his congregation and encouraged some of them to vote no in the postal survey in the belief that very bad things will happen if equal marriage becomes law. What some Christian opponents of equal marriage say has fuelled intolerance and prejudice; reinforcing the notion that LGBT people are inferior and not deserving of equal rights. Their attitude seem far removed from Christ’s teachings of love and compassion. As I said to my mother’s pastor: Discrimination is not a Christian value. Bizarrely, critics of equal marriage claimed in Britain, and claim now in Australia, that banning same-sex couples from marriage is not discrimination. They point to states where LGBT people can have a registered partnership or a civil union/civil partnership. Hang on! If any group of people are denied access to an existing law for any reason, that is discrimination. In a great democracy like Australia, everyone should have equal legal rights and responsibilities, including in marriage law. Opponents of marriage equality in the UK used to argue that they were defending “the traditional definition of marriage.” Oh, really? I now hear the same arguments being voiced by conservative politicians and some people of faith in Australia. Marriage has been redefined, for the better, dozens of times over the centuries. The traditional Biblical-era marriage treated women as the property of men, allowed rape in marriage, included men having multiple wives (but not the other way around), forbade divorce and remarriage, and involved the often arranged or forced marriage of 12- to 13-year-old girls to much older men. The churches supported these traditional versions of marriage for hundreds of years. It was only gradually, and often reluctantly over many centuries, that they accepted the redefinition of marriage to end these evils. Since they’ve conceded the redefinition of marriage in the past, why can’t they do so now, in order to include loving same-sex couples? In Britain, many traditional marriage advocates today admit, against their own expectations, that far from weakening or undermining marriage, extending it to same-couples has given marriage, which was previously declining among heterosexuals, a boost and renewed popularity. Despite objections to equal marriage by church leaders, 55% of people of faith in the UK in 2012-13 supported the right of same-sex couples to marry in civil ceremonies in register offices. The percentage is now thought to be even higher. I am heartened to learn that 54% of Australian Christians also support marriage equality. Same-sex marriage has become part of the taken-for-granted fabric of British life. The weddings of two men or two women hardly merit a second glance. The vast majority of people are totally relaxed about marriage being inclusive. Their only anxieties are what to wear on the big day and what presents to buy the happy couple. Most religious leaders in the UK now accept that equal marriage is here to stay and have ceased campaigning against it. Some, such as the Archbishop of Canterbury, have conceded that Anglican opposition to marriage equality made the church look bigoted. He has since expressed regret at the church’s historic ill-treatment of LGBT people; in particular the way it often endorsed homophobic discrimination and resisted LGBT equality. To the critics and doubters, I say: Take heart my fellow Australians. In a few years, you’ll look back and wonder what all the fuss was about and why marriage equality took so long to become law.

No free fruit or free haircuts and prawns and sea cucumbers are off the menu as the Communist party congress, set to usher in a second five-year term for president Xi Jinping, promises to be an austere affair. In a break with previous years, officials attending the meeting will not be welcomed by large banners and extravagant flower arrangements, according to Wang Lilian, who managed delegate hospitality for the three previous party congresses. “There won’t be any more fruit put out in rooms, whereas previously there were for delegates and staff. There’s none of that this time,” he told state radio. “There’s no sea cucumber, prawns or anything like that. It’s all buffet style,” he added, promising simple home-style cooking. This year’s party congress, held twice a decade, will open on Wednesday and see a reshuffle at the highest levels of power in China. Since Xi came to power at the last meeting in 2012, he has worked to rein in the excesses of government officials and launched a far reaching anti-corruption campaign that has punished more than 1.3m party members. China’s propaganda machine has worked fastidiously to portray Xi as a man of the people, often reporting on the simple meals he eats while on trips around the country. A surprise visit by Xi in 2013 to a Beijing steamed bun restaurant celebrated for its cheap prices was widely seen as an attempt to cement his frugal credentials and send a signal to officials to temper their taste for expensive banquets. The party congress will open with Xi delivering a major policy speech, and the meeting is largely about securing his grip on power. The roughly 2,300 delegates will also be forced to forgo complimentary facials, haircuts and tailoring services. Gift shops set up to sell souvenirs to those travelling from across the country will also be absent. “We will strictly not have any of these services this time,” Wang said. But inconveniences are not limited to the party faithful, and a host of activities have been banned in the Chinese capital for the week-long congress. Airbnb cancelled all rentals for the second half of October within a 20km radius of downtown Beijing. “Due to external circumstances, homes in certain areas in Beijing are unavailable through October 31,” the company wrote in an e-mail to hosts. Even hotels in cities thousands of kilometres from Beijing cancelled reservations for foreigners. Police have stepped up random ID checks in the Beijing subway, looking to snare any wanted criminals or illegal workers. Another bizarre requirement is a halt in all home renovations and sales of knives and scissors have also been temporarily banned. Flying model airplanes and drones have also been banned for a 200km wide blanket, according to the Financial Times, spilling into neighbouring provinces."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/17/coalition-balks-on-finkel-target-but-will-unveil-energy-and-emissions-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T17:00:06Z","webTitle":"Coalition balks on Finkel target but will unveil energy and emissions policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/17/coalition-balks-on-finkel-target-but-will-unveil-energy-and-emissions-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/17/coalition-balks-on-finkel-target-but-will-unveil-energy-and-emissions-policy","fields":{"headline":"Coalition balks on Finkel target but will unveil energy and emissions policy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Turnbull government is poised to unveil a new energy investment framework that will impose obligations on the electricity sector to reduce emissions consistent with the Paris agreement. It will also create new reliability obligations to ensure there’s enough dispatchable power in the system. Cabinet, and the government’s backbench committee on environment and energy, considered the government’s new policy on Monday night before a party room debate slated for Tuesday morning. Government sources have confirmed the Coalition will not adopt the clean energy target recommended by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the national electricity market. The vociferous internal critics of Finkel’s proposal, led by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, have made it clear for months they will not accept any policy that contains new subsidies for renewable energy. The existing renewable energy target peaks in 2020 and will run out to 2030. It is understood the new obligations for reliability and emissions reduction will be imposed as part of an overhaul of the national electricity market rules recommended by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the new Energy Security Board, established by the Council of Australian Governments to drive the recommendations of the Finkel review already endorsed by state and federal energy ministers. While key details of the policy are not yet clear, government sources claim the required emissions reductions in electricity will be consistent with the Paris framework, and the new policy approach will have a more positive impact on power prices than the clean energy target, which Finkel said would lower energy prices compared with business as usual. The government is also expected to keep the emissions reduction fund and it flagged the potential use of international permits to help meet Australia’s emissions targets at lowest cost in its review of the Direct Action policy, launched in March. The government’s efforts to resolve its energy policy comes as the new Guardian Essential poll finds a clear majority of voters support the now dumped clean energy target to help drive the transition to low emissions power sources. The new poll shows support for a clean energy target at 65%. It also suggests Coalition conservatives who have campaigned against the Finkel proposal are out of step with the views of their own supporters. While the total approval for the clean energy target is 65% in the new survey, 68% of Coalition voters in the sample of 1,845 voters said the government should implement a clean energy target. And while Coalition conservatives have railed for months against subsidies for renewable energy – Australians are on a different page. Australians are overwhelmingly supportive of incentives for low-emissions technologies, with 74% of the sample backing ongoing support for renewables, and 75% of Coalition supporters endorsing that view. A majority of voters, including a slim majority of Coalition voters, also support Labor’s policy goal to source 50% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 – a policy regularly attacked by the Coalition. Labor’s policy was supported by 62% of the sample, and 52% of Coalition voters said they approved of it. At the beginning of a critical week for the government on energy, voters are inclined to see the government in Canberra underperforming on a key issue, although they are not as frustrated with the Coalition as they were in February. The Turnbull government is not doing enough to ensure affordable, reliable and clean energy for Australian households and businesses, according to 61% (down from 71% in February). Only 15% think it is doing enough, and 19% (up 5%) say they don’t know. More than half (56%) of Coalition voters think there has not been enough action, and 22% think it is doing enough. With Tony Abbott spending the past several months front running the government’s energy debate, and leading the opposition to the Finkel recommendation, 42% think the former prime minister should resign from parliament (down 1% from April), while 30% think he should stay in parliament in some capacity (down 2%). Liberal/National voters were more likely to think Tony Abbott should stay in parliament (38%) than Labor voters (27%) and Greens voters (17%). Labor is still in front in the new poll, leading the Coalition on the two-party preferred measure 52% to 48%, but that is an improvement on the government’s fortunes from a week ago, where Labor led 54% to 46%. The major parties traded blows over energy in parliament on Monday, when Labor asked a series of questions about why the prime minister had given early public endorsement to the clean energy target when the government now intended to dump it. Labor has signalled it is highly unlikely to support an energy policy which abandons the core Finkel recommendation but the shadow climate minister, Mark Butler said on Monday the opposition held out “some hope” that the government would produce something sensible. A major business group, the Business Council of Australia, urged the ALP to “stop, pause, and look at the detail” before forming a position on the government’s plan, because stakeholders needed bipartisanship for investment certainty. “The worst thing that could happen now is that we go into another round of never ever, pure politics or this won’t work or it’s not our scheme, so it’s not a good scheme,” said the BCA’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott. Westacott said it was “hugely important” for the government to set a trajectory for emissions reduction, and a establish a clear trigger, so businesses understood how emissions would be treated, because “if you’re trying to do a major project you want to price risk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/16/chipocalypse-potato-shortage-in-new-zealand-sparks-crisp-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T02:52:04Z","webTitle":"Chipocalypse: potato shortage in New Zealand sparks crisp crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/chipocalypse-potato-shortage-in-new-zealand-sparks-crisp-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/16/chipocalypse-potato-shortage-in-new-zealand-sparks-crisp-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Chipocalypse: potato shortage in New Zealand sparks crisp crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A year of heavy rains has devastated New Zealand’s potato crop, prompting fears of a “chipocalypse”. The rainfall, which included two “weather bombs” and two serious floods in both the North and South Island, has wiped out 20% of New Zealand’s annual potato crop, and 30% in the regions most affected, with the “crisping” varieties for potato chips taking the biggest hit. The news has sent some New Zealanders into a spin with concerns that the shortage might affect their Christmas feasts and favourite rugby snack. Some supermarkets have put up signs in their crisp sections alerting customers to the shortage, and although no panic buying has yet been reported, the shortage has been well raked over on social media. Chris Claridge, the chief executive of Potatoes New Zealand, said it was concerning for such a serious shortage to hit a staple food product that many New Zealanders relied on to bulk up their meals, and supermarkets had begun to report shortages of North Island-produced crisps. “You can go for a week without politics but try going for a week without potatoes. It is a food staple and this is becoming a food security issue as the effects of climate change take their toll on our potato crop,” said Claridge, who said access to farming land was also becoming scarce as urbanisation ramped up. “Potato farmers have been severely impacted. If they can’t harvest and process, they are not getting their income so there is that monetary impact. It is also quite distressing to be digging up rotting potatoes. It is a very important part of New Zealand psyche having potatoes.” Potato crops planted last year have either rotted in the soil due to the heavy rains, or had to remain unharvested because of the torrential downpours. Next year’s crop will also be affected because the ground has not been dry enough for planting. Potato-growing regions particularly affected by the weather include areas around Auckland and the Waikato, which have already experienced about 25% more rainfall than the annual average. Foodstuffs, which owns New Zealand’s largest supermarket chains, said farmers had made them aware that potato products such as crisps and packaged, frozen chips might soon be affected, and the shortages could last into the new year. “The grower community is highlighting a potential future potato shortage due to bad weather,” said Antoinette Laird, head of external relations for Foodstuffs. “This has not impacted our business as yet, and we are working with our suppliers to minimise any potential impact.” New Zealand produces 500,000 tonnes of potatoes a year and is the ninth-biggest exporter of potatoes in the world. About two thirds of the annual crop are destined for processing, with 250,000 tonnes being made into chips (as in fish and chips) and about 75,000 tonnes into crisps. Bharat Bhana’s family have been farming potatoes for 60 years in Pukekohe, which is south of Auckland. He said the heavy rains meant his business would run at a loss this year, with about a third of his potato crop destroyed. “This year has been very unusual, we haven’t experienced anything like it and it has really caught a lot of us out,” said Bhana. “I don’t know how we can prepare for climate change. We could dig the spuds out earlier but then we wouldn’t have enough space to store them and we’d have to pay more to keep them cool.” “We’ll do what we can, but what can we really do?” Potatoes have been grown in New Zealand for 250 years, according to Potatoes NZ, and were introduced by Captain Cook who gave potatoes to two Māori chiefs in Mercury Bay. The vegetable was quickly adopted as a staple part of the local diet because it could be grown in much colder areas than kumara, which was already a staple food in New Zealand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/16/clinton-says-wikileaks-is-now-a-subsidiary-of-russian-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T01:53:29Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump's Twitter use is a risk to global security, Hillary Clinton says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/16/clinton-says-wikileaks-is-now-a-subsidiary-of-russian-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/16/clinton-says-wikileaks-is-now-a-subsidiary-of-russian-intelligence","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump's Twitter use is a risk to global security, Hillary Clinton says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s Twitter account represents a “clear and present danger” to world security, Hillary Clinton has argued. In an interview on Australian television aired on Monday night Clinton said the Trump’s presidency “certainly is” a risk not just to the US but also “the rest of the world, including Australia”. Because, she said, of his “use of Twitter”, and his “conducting diplomacy or the lack thereof on Twitter”. In a wide-ranging interview with ABC Four Corner’s Sarah Ferguson, Clinton said she believed Trump was the most dangerous president the US had ever had. “I think he is, because he is impulsive, he lacks self-control, he is totally consumed by how he is viewed and what people think of him,” she said. “So his behaviour traits and his lack of knowledge about how government works and his very, you know, limited curiosity about how to educate himself to actually make better decisions, are quite worrisome.” Asked whether Australians should be worried, Clinton said “I think the whole world should be concerned”. During the interview Clinton has repeated her claim that the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, colluded with the Russian government in the lead-up to the 2016 US election, describing him as a “nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator”. She alleged that Assange cooperated with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to disrupt the US election and damage her campaign for president. “WikiLeaks is unfortunately now practically a fully owned subsidiary of Russian intelligence,” Clinton told the ABC’s Sarah Ferguson. Describing Putin as a “dictator”, Clinton said the damaging email leaks that crippled her 2016 candidacy were part of a coordinated operation against her, directed by the Russian government. “Our intelligence community and other observers of Russia and Putin have said he held a grudge against me because as secretary of state, I stood up against some of his actions, his authoritarianism,” Clinton told the ABC. “But it’s much bigger than that. He wants to destabilise democracy, he wants to undermine America, he wants to go after the Atlantic alliance, and we consider Australia an extension of that.” WikiLeaks received thousands of hacked emails from accounts connected to the Democratic campaign allegedly stolen by Russian operatives. The emails were released during a four-month period in the lead-up to the US election. Emails from the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, were leaked on the same day – 7 October 2016 – the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security released a statement concluding the Russian government had been attempting to interfere in the election. It was also the day the Washington Post published the 2005 Access Hollywood recording of Donald Trump’s lewd comments about sexually harassing women. Clinton told the ABC she believed the email leak was coordinated to disrupt the influence of the Access Hollywood tape. “WikiLeaks, which in the world in which we find ourselves promised hidden information, promised some kind of secret that might be of influence, was a very clever, diabolical response to the Hollywood Access tape,” she said. “And I’ve no doubt in my mind that there was some communication if not coordination to drop those the first time in response to the Hollywood Access tape.” Clinton is promoting her election memoir, What Happened, in which she details her thoughts on her unsuccessful campaign for president. In September she told David Remnick from the New Yorker that she believed the Australian founder of WikiLeaks may be “on the payroll of the Kremlin”. “I think he is part nihilist, part anarchist, part exhibitionist, part opportunist, who is either actually on the payroll of the Kremlin or in some way supporting their propaganda objectives, because of his resentment toward the United States, toward Europe,” she said. “He’s like a lot of the voices that we’re hearing now, which are expressing appreciation for the macho authoritarianism of a Putin. And they claim to be acting in furtherance of transparency, except they never go after the Kremlin or people on that side of the political ledger.” Assange has denied the emails came from the Russian government or any other “state parties”. In response to Clinton’s comments, Assange said on Twitter there was “something wrong with Hillary Clinton”. “It is not just her constant lying,” he wrote. “It is not just that she throws off menacing glares and seethes thwarted entitlement. “Something much darker rides along with it. A cold creepiness rarely seen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/15/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-paris-saint-germain","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T22:59:22Z","webTitle":"José Mourinho heaps praise on the ‘special’ ones at Paris Saint-Germain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/15/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-paris-saint-germain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/15/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-paris-saint-germain","fields":{"headline":"José Mourinho heaps praise on the ‘special’ ones at Paris Saint-Germain","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"José Mourinho has ruled out spending the rest of his career at Manchester United while talking up the “special” project at Paris Saint-Germain. The Portuguese, who came under fire for United’s defensive approach at Liverpool on Saturday, suggested he will not finish his career in Manchester during an interview with a French broadcaster. After winning the Europa League and the League Cup last season Mourinho has set his sights on the Premier League title with United but, following the 0-0 draw at Anfield, his side now trail free-scoring Manchester City by two points. The 54-year-old, who last season admitted his life in Manchester was a “disaster” because he was living out of a hotel in the city, has done nothing to suggest he intends a long stay. He told TF1’s Telefoot programme: “The only thing I can say is that I’m still a coach with worries, with ambitions and with the desire to do new things. And I don’t believe ... no, I’m sure that I won’t end my career here.” Asked if that meant at United, Mourinho said: “Yes.” Mourinho responded to the question of whether he might one day join PSG by revealing his son had taken the club to his heart. “The other day my son who lives in London went to Paris and not to Manchester to watch the match,” Mourinho said. Asked why his son chose that option, the United manager added: “Because at the moment in Paris there is something special. Magic, quality, youth, it’s fantastic.” Mourinho has never spent more than four years in one spell as manager at any of his seven clubs and has yet to work in France after success in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain. He signed a three-year contract with United in 2016 and negotiations on an extension are expected in the coming months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/16/children-of-disabled-or-single-parents-more-likely-to-claim-welfare-themselves-report","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T02:15:01Z","webTitle":"Children of disabled or single parents more likely to claim welfare themselves – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/16/children-of-disabled-or-single-parents-more-likely-to-claim-welfare-themselves-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/16/children-of-disabled-or-single-parents-more-likely-to-claim-welfare-themselves-report","fields":{"headline":"Children of disabled or single parents more likely to claim welfare themselves – report","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Parental disability and single parenthood are the “clearest pathways” for the transfer of disadvantage from one generation to the next, a new report finds. The report, authored jointly by the universities of Sydney and Melbourne, has called for a greater policy focus on “leveling the playing field” for children in vulnerable families. “Disparities in young people’s outcomes are not simply the result of their – or their parents’ – differential efforts; unequal opportunities also play a critical role,” the report says. The findings, released on Monday, relied on an analysis of 18 years of Centrelink records and more than 124,000 “unique matched youth-parent pairs”, where the children were born between October 1987 and March 1988. It found the children were almost twice as likely to receive social security payments in later life if their parents had received benefits. Young Australians had a 58% chance of receiving welfare between the ages of 18 and 26 if their parents received social security while they grew up, compared with 31.8% where there was no family history of receiving welfare. But the report suggests this intergenerational relationship is most intense where parents are either receiving disability, carer, or single-parent payments, rather than unemployment benefits. Children whose parents were on disability, carer and single-parent payments were 1.6 times more likely to claim social security than others. In comparison, children whose parents were on unemployment and partnered-parent payments were 1.3 to 1.4 times more likely to receive social security, the report found. “Parental disability and single parenthood are the clearest pathways through which disadvantage is being passed from Australian parents to their children,” the report found. “In contrast, other forms of disadvantage, in particular those stemming from parents’ poor labour market outcomes, seem to be easier for young people to overcome. “This suggests that parental disadvantage may be more harmful to children’s later life outcomes if it is more strongly driven by circumstances rather than personal choice.” The report’s release comes as the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth warned Australia’s welfare system is letting children and families down. The alliance cited a 2016 report, produced by the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss), which showed 731,300 Australian children under the age of 15 lived below the poverty line. That represents 17.4%, or one in six, of all Australian children. The proportion had increased by two percentage points between 2003-04 and 2013-14. But the increase was particularly pronounced for single-parent families, where poverty rates increased from 36.8% to 40.6% between 2012 and 2014. Alliance chief executive, Stephen Bartos, said the poverty-level Newstart rate ($38 per day) and parenting allowances were inadequate to help families deal with the rising costs of living. “On top of low welfare payments, we also see an increase in the number of kids living in poverty,” Bartos said. “This is putting major obstacles between these children and happy, productive lives,” he said. Last month, the alliance released a report that suggested a strong link between poverty and problems in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life. “In the face of this evidence, governments must do more to prevent families falling into poverty, and assist more quickly and effectively when they do,” Bartos said. The Greens, meanwhile, have called on the federal government to end its “attacks on our social safety net”. Senator Rachel Siewert called for increases to the Newstart and youth allowance payments to alleviate pressure on the most vulnerable Australians. “Both old parties have refused to increase income support payments which have not gone up in real time for years,” Siewert said. “The government continues their insidious attacks on income support, making it more and more difficult for vulnerable people to use the system, and it was the Labor government that dumped single parents onto the Newstart payment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/16/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekend-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T07:38:48Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/16/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekend-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/16/premier-league-10-talking-points-weekend-football","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1) Hughes lauds ‘clinical’ City and joins De Bruyne fan club Mark Hughes was in no doubt he had witnessed the favourites for the title. “Clearly I would say that after being beaten 7-2 but they do look significantly better than anybody else in the league in terms of our experience,” he said.

Handed a rare start in the league, the Belgian lasted 57 minutes before Conte decided to chase an equaliser against Crystal Palace without a recognised striker. Batshuayi, who was overlooked when Morata tweaked a hamstring against Manchester City a fortnight ago, reacted angrily when replaced by Pedro, but he could have few complaints about being substituted. He posed Mamadou Sakho and Scott Dann few problems and there was little to suggest that he is capable of meeting Chelsea’s expectations. Conte did not want to talk about Batshuayi after the defeat by Palace, choosing to focus on a collective failure by his team. But he was also vague when asked if he trusted Morata’s understudy. The suspicion is he is not a fan of the 24-year-old and that is a big problem for Chelsea given their lack of depth up front. Jacob Steinberg Match report: Crystal Palace 2-1 Chelsea 3) Klopp fed up with Mourinho’s tactics A truly tedious encounter between two fierce north-west rivals flirted with controversy only when Jürgen Klopp claimed it was “OK for Manchester United” to play so negatively but that would not be acceptable at Liverpool. A brief flirt was as good as it got. Klopp later expanded on his comment: “José obviously did what he thinks is right, or what he wants to do, and that is OK. It doesn’t make life easier for us but I can’t moan and say: ‘Come on, open up a little bit.’ That’s not how it is. They want to win the league and I am sure we couldn’t play like this at Liverpool after 125 years without the title. We cannot sit back and say: ‘Let’s wait’ – that is not possible. We have to do whatever is necessary and we will be challengers. We will be challengers for the next few years, no problem. We showed big heart, we were brave, I thought we were smart in doing the right thing at the right moment but in the end it didn’t work out.” It didn’t work out for anyone except Mourinho. Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 0-0 Manchester United 4) United in danger of losing momentum after Anfield bore In the context of a season a goalless draw at Anfield is usually a decent result. But in the context of this particular season, in which the league will probably be won with a high points tally, would-be champions must pursue all those available with equal zeal. On Saturday United did not do this and now will probably have to beat Spurs and Chelsea who they play in the next three weeks, to stay within a game of Manchester City. Though José Mourinho knows his association football, sitting back against a team with a good attack is dicier than getting after one which can’t defend, and but for an unreal save from David de Gea, United might well have lost. Pre-match they were flying and Liverpool were struggling, which is to say that the away side were good enough to come to Anfield, play an open game and win. Daniel Harris 5) Pochettino promises Spurs will play the Spurs way in Madrid Mauricio Pochettino set the tone for Tottenham Hotspur’s Champions League trip to Real Madrid after this scratchy Wembley win over Bournemouth. “We are going there to play and be Tottenham,” the manager said. “We will try to dominate them – to press high and play in their half. If they push us back, then we may have to adapt to their quality. But at the beginning we will be brave and aggressive, and play to win.” Spurs will need to impose themselves more effectively than they did against Bournemouth when, not for the first time at Wembley, they laboured when the onus was on them to unpick deep-sitting opponents. The national stadium continues to feel a long way from White Hart Lane, where Pochettino described his team as being “invincible” last season. He has to hope that the result against Bournemouth, rather than the performance, can unlock something. David Hytner Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Bournemouth 6) Cleverley scoffs at thoughts of England return Tom Cleverley’s 13 England caps were crammed into a 15-month period that ended almost exactly four years ago. It would be premature to suggest he is likely to add to them but against Arsenal he was excellent both at winning the ball in midfield and at distributing it; his impressive display was crowned by the late winner. “I think you guys will link every English player who’s playing with the national team but that is not a thought,” he told the press. “It is the pinnacle of every player’s career but I am far off it.” He is not a fashionable player but has become a vital one at Watford. Marco Silva said: “He’s a fantastic professional.” Saturday was a reminder of his qualities but also of his frailties: after letting Per Mertesacker, almost a foot taller, elude him to score a free header it may be best not to ask him to mark giant centre‑halves at set pieces in future. Simon Burnton Match report: Watford 2-1 Arsenal 7) Knockaert finally makes his mark for Brighton Anthony Knockaert had a humdinger of a season in the Championship for Brighton. His pace, strength, close control and unfailing delivery put him head and shoulders above much of the division. The opening months of the Premier League have proved more challenging, however. The Frenchman has less time and more opponents able to match his physicality. Chris Hughton has said a period of adjustment for Knockaert was only to be expected and that he had faith in the winger to make the necessary improvements. Sunday was a case in point. After a quiet start Knockaert grew into the game and began to dictate play as it opened up. He celebrated his goal by looking to the heavens. Knockaert has made his first impact in the division and Albion will need him to kick on from here. Paul MacInnes Match report: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 1-1 Everton 8) Zabaleta voices frustration at West Ham’s indiscipline Pablo Zabaleta has forged a reputation as a great competitor on the pitch and a great diplomat off it. His committed approach has occasionally got him into trouble with referees but he is one who tends to earn the affection of everyone at a club and rarely criticises team-mates. It was striking, therefore, that the right-back, who defended valiantly in a vain bid to earn West Ham a first away win, voiced his frustration at the needless way Andy Carroll collected two cautions in 99 first-half seconds. “Andy’s challenges were a bit nasty from my point of view,” said Zabaleta. “It looks aggressive, especially the second one when he knew he was on a yellow already.” West Ham’s repeated indiscipline is irritating the Argentinian. “It is the second time we have had a player sent off in the first half, Marko Arnautovic against Southampton and Andy. We need to be more clever.” Richard Jolly Match report: Burnley 1-1 West Ham 9) Pellegrino still struggling to find Southampton’s identity The Southampton manager, Mauricio Pellegrino, talked before this match of the importance of creating an “identity” for the club. In the end he was grateful for a defender’s lapse as Southampton scraped a draw with Rafael Benítez’s rapidly improving Newcastle United. Were it not for Florian Lejeune’s rush of blood, needlessly bundling over Shane Long to concede a penalty, the pressure on Pellegrino would be building, with supporters still unconvinced at progress under the new manager. Pellegrino should at least be credited for restoring Manolo Gabbiadini in the starting lineup. Southampton had failed to score in eight of their past nine Premier League home games but Gabbiadini’s double denied Newcastle, who are carving out their own Premier League identity under Benítez: disciplined, gritty and hard to beat. Next up for Southampton, a televised date with West Bromwich Albion. Let the goals flow. Mark Dobson Match report: Southampton 2-2 Newcastle United 10) Mounié’s return cannot come quickly enough for Huddersfield The honeymoon seems to be over for Huddersfield. They have not won since taking maximum points from their opening two matches and, while nobody can fault their energy, the question is whether they have the quality to match. They faced Crystal Palace and Newcastle at opportune times but have largely come up short since. At Swansea they struggled without Aaron Mooy in the first half, the midfielder dropping to the bench after an enervating week with Australia. David Wagner was happier with their display after his introduction but the game was lost from the 48th minute and they need to avoid over-reliance on their fulcrum. The return of the striker Steve Mounié, who made a dazzling impact against Palace but has been injured for the past month, will be welcome and he may soon need to dig them out of a hole. Defeats by Liverpool and Manchester United, their next two opponents, could precipitate freefall.

On Monday night, Spain’s national court denied bail to Jordi Sánchez, the president of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), and Jordi Cuixart, the president of Òmnium Cultural. Both men are being investigated for alleged sedition in the run-up to the regional independence referendum two weeks ago. Sánchez and Cuixart are accused of using huge demonstrations to try to stop Spanish police officers following a judge’s orders to halt the independence referendum that had already been suspended by the country’s constitutional court. The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, quickly denounced the move and described both men as “political prisoners”. “Spain jails Catalonia’s civil society leaders for organising peaceful demonstrations,” he tweeted on Monday night. “Sadly, we have political prisoners again.” The following day, the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, tweeted: “Catalonia has woken up saddened and worried today. The imprisonment of [Sánchez and Cuixart] is a threat to everyone’s rights and freedoms.” Thousands of people crowded into the Plaça Sant Jaume in the Catalan capital at midday on Tuesday to demonstrate against the ruling. Similar demonstrations were held in Tarragona, Lleida and Girona. About 500 students abandoned their classrooms in one of Barcelona’s main universities to join the demonstrations. On Monday night police said around 200,000 people gathered in Barcelona for a candlelit vigil, filling a vast stretch of Diagonal, the six-lane thoroughfare that cuts across the city. “We want our own state and if we have to wait, we will,” said Pere Robles, who was among the huge crowd at the junction of Passeig de Gràcia and Diagonal. “Here in Catalonia we survived 40 years under Franco and we continued to be Catalonia. We’ll put up with whatever we have to put up with and we have to keep fighting.” “Despite all the pressure from Madrid I think we’ll end up talking because this isn’t going to stop, people aren’t going to give up,” said Salvador Prieto, who is pro-independence. “This is a very rightwing government, which I think will even ban political parties. Everything Rajoy does creates more secessionists. Listen, what a lot of people don’t realise is Rajoy is the independence movement’s mole,” Preitor added with a wink. “We slipped him into the government to make sure we get independence.” His wife, Esther, said she wasn’t pro-independence but had come to the rally in defence of democracy. “I don’t feel the same as him, I don’t feel a need for independence but we have to defend our rights. Rajoy’s government is a disaster.” The protests came as the constitutional court announced that it had annulled the Catalan law that had paved the way for the referendum. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, the court said its 12 judges had unanimously declared the referendum law unconstitutional, adding that the right to “promote and enact the unilateral secession” of a part of the country was not recognised in the Spanish constitution. Despite Puigdemont’s assertion that the detentions were politically motivated, the Spanish government’s senior representative in Barcelona said the judge’s decision had been made independently. “There is a separation of powers here,” Enric Millo told Catalunya Radio. The view was echoed by Spain’s justice minister, Rafael Catalá. “We can talk of politicians in prison but not political prisoners,” he told reporters. “These are not political prisoners because yesterday’s prison ruling was due to an [alleged] crime.” On 20 and 21 September, police raided Catalan regional government offices and arrested 14 senior officials in an attempt to head off the vote. The raids brought thousands of Catalans out to protest. Guardia Civil officers found themselves trapped inside the buildings they were searching and three of their vehicles were vandalised. In her ruling, Judge Carmen Lamela said the events of 20 and 21 September “did not constitute an isolated, casual or peacefully convened civic protest against police actions carried out on a judge’s orders. On the contrary, the activities already described were part of a complex strategy in which Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sánchez have been involved for a long time as part of a roadmap designed to bring about Catalan independence.” Lamela said that both Sánchez and Cuixart had directed the crowds, with the former telling them: “No one should go home. It’s going to be a long and intense night.” At one point, the two leaders stood on the roof of a Guardia Civil car and called for “permanent mobilisation” to make sure the referendum went ahead. One of the reasons the judge denied them bail was “because of the high likelihood that the two men under investigation could go about hiding, altering or destroying sources of evidence”. However, the court decided that Josep Lluís Trapero, the head of the Catalan police force – who is also being investigated for sedition – could remain free as long as he surrendered his passport, stayed in Spain and kept in regular contact with the court. Under Spanish law, sedition is classified as using “force or illegal means to prevent the application of the law, the legitimate exercise of the functions of public authorities or the observance of administrative or judicial decisions”. It carries a maximum sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment. The Catalan government says hundreds of people were hurt when Spanish police officers used force in an attempt to stop the referendum going ahead on 1 October. Its push for independence has pitched Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades and seen many large companies leave the region amid the economic uncertainty. Puigdemont has refused to clarify whether he declared Catalonia’s independence from Spain last week, instead repeating his calls for negotiations with the Madrid government. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has given Puigdemont until Thursday morning to drop his independence plans or face the suspension of regional autonomy and the imposition of direct rule from Madrid. But the Catalan government is refusing to budge. “Giving up isn’t an option that’s being considered,” a spokesman said on Tuesday. “On Thursday, we won’t give anything different than what we gave on Monday.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/oct/19/niall-horan-flicker-review-awwww-inspiring-radio-2-filler","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-19T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"Niall Horan: Flicker review – awwww-inspiring Radio 2 filler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/19/niall-horan-flicker-review-awwww-inspiring-radio-2-filler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2017/oct/19/niall-horan-flicker-review-awwww-inspiring-radio-2-filler","fields":{"headline":"Niall Horan: Flicker review – awwww-inspiring Radio 2 filler","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It would appear that at some point towards the end of their career as the World’s Biggest Boyband, One Direction were quietly ushered into a room and told they had to face the future. A hat of some description was solemnly produced and the band members told to draw lots from it, in order to see which one would pursue which standard post-boyband solo career. Zayn Malik got “attempt to reinvent yourself as a credible R&amp;B artist”. Cheeky Harry Styles pulled out “vaguely alternative rock” – a tough gig that led to him releasing an album that, depending on your perspective, either demonstrated his deep knowledge of classic rock, or sounded like a bizarre one-man episode of Stars in Their Eyes, with Styles variously impersonating the Rolling Stones, Elton John, U2 and David Bowie. Still, better luck than Louis Tomlinson, who got “pop-dance collaborations with EDM producers” and Liam Payne, stuck with “be a bit like Justin Timberlake or something”. Niall Horan’s piece of paper, meanwhile, seems to have simply read “Radio 2”. His debut solo album corrals an array of talent, including Adele co-writer Tobias Jesso Jr, Kings of Leon producer Jacquire King and Jamie Scott, who helped write a string of One Direction’s hits. You get the feeling they may have been set to work with a copy of Britain’s most popular radio station’s playlist and instructions to cover as many of the bases found on it as possible. Flicker’s main currency is post-Ed Sheeran acoustic balladry, of varying degrees of quality. Single This Town is both a fair forgery of Sheeran’s style and a good song in its own right, blessed with a nagging earworm of a hook. So nagging, in fact, that Horan and his team apparently couldn’t get it out of their heads during the album’s writing sessions: both the title track and Paper Houses sound remarkably similar. Elsewhere, we find stuff that sounds like yacht rock, over which the influence of Fleetwood Mac hangs heavy. Not least On the Loose – very much the song of your dreams if you thought that Haim’s homages to Buckingham and Nicks were too terrifyingly avant-garde for their own good – and Since We’re Alone, a song which, were it any more imbued with the spirit of Rumours, would develop a crippling cocaine habit and start inadvisably sleeping with its bandmates. And there’s country, of the contemporary mainstream Nashville variety, which essentially sounds like pop-AOR with a chewy accent and pedal steel guitar: Seeing Blind is a duet with Maren Morris, 2016’s Country Music Association new artist of the year, and the author of US million-seller My Church. None of it is terribly exciting, but in fairness, setting the listener’s pulse racing with the head-spinning shock of the new clearly wasn’t the intention here. And it would be churlish to argue that swaths of it are anything other than well-crafted – you can easily imagine virtually all of it ending up exactly where it wants to be, punctuating rounds of Ken Bruce’s PopMaster and cropping up between the dedications on Steve Wright’s Sunday Love Songs. It comes with lyrics that cannily position Horan as the cuddly, down-home One Directioner, in marked contrast to the stoned, libidinous mood of Zayn Malik’s Mind of Mine or Harry Styles’ album, on which he seemed to be perpetually waking up hungover in a hotel room, struggling to recall the name of last night’s conquest. Horan gives that kind of thing a go on On the Loose, but it’s not hugely convincing. Instead, he spends most of Flicker singing lyrics you might describe as awwww-inspiring: pining for the simple charms of girls from back home, out of whose orbit he was cruelly lifted by fame. Perhaps that’s not the only thing that’s canny about Flicker. The middle of the road might not be the most thrilling destination for the former boyband member, but it’s a far safer bet commercially than trying to convince sceptical rock or R&amp;B fans that you’re cut from the same cloth as the artists they love. It clearly isn’t going to inspire the hyperventilating profiles in Rolling Stone that Harry Styles’ eponymous debut did, nor the kind of hip fashion mag approval afforded to Zayn Malik’s stylistic transformation. But last month Horan’s single Slow Hands topped the US Top 40 radio chart, and Flicker might hang around longer than either of his bandmates’ efforts did. Its lack of artistic ambition or character of its own is easy to mock, but Horan may well have the last laugh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2017/oct/18/the-asian-century-is-coming-and-universities-must-be-prepared","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-18T06:30:02Z","webTitle":"The Asian century is gaining momentum: universities must prepare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/oct/18/the-asian-century-is-coming-and-universities-must-be-prepared","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/oct/18/the-asian-century-is-coming-and-universities-must-be-prepared","fields":{"headline":"The Asian century is gaining momentum: universities must prepare","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Amidst the handwringing over the effect of Brexit on the UK’s universities, we need to contemplate our place in a future global economy driven by technology and innovation. From where will the most important discoveries of the coming decades emerge? Which countries and cities will give birth to the technologies, cures and ideas that will shape our future? China spends five times that of the UK on R&amp;D each year. For universities hoping to build or maintain their position as global leaders in innovation and enterprise, China is hard to overlook as an option. Not too long ago it would have been safe to assume that the UK would be at the centre of the action. In 1996, research and development activities were firmly rooted in the big four innovation economies, with the US, Japan, the UK and Germany accounting for half of the world’s research publications. But times have changed: by 2015 their share had dropped to 39%. Meanwhile, the big four’s collective share of global R&amp;D spending slipped from two-thirds to 43%, according to Unesco figures. Conversely, the same data shows that China’s annual research publication output ballooned more than 14 times, with its global share of publications rising from just 2 per cent in 1996 to 16 per cent in 2015. Cultural appeal Luckily, the UK has a tremendous head start in partnerships with China, beginning with the nearly 100,000 mainland Chinese students currently enrolled in our universities. Recent research conducted at the British Council suggests that the UK enjoys a significant reputational foothold in the middle kingdom. Our survey of 5,000 respondents and analysis of 9m social media posts showed that the UK ranked as the third-most preferred foreign culture and its education system received the highest proportion of positive buzz on the microblogging website Sina Weibo. On the ground in China, we have seen many UK universities successfully forge bilateral research links with Chinese counterparts, but more impactful partnerships that weave together industry and government funding streams have proved elusive. Our survey suggested that UK universities may struggle to stand out in the increasingly crowded field of China’s potential suitors. While respondents often cited technology and innovation as one of the UK’s top strengths, they tended to see the US and Germany as relatively stronger in these areas. Understanding how China works China is a difficult market to crack for foreign universities, but there are three guiding principles that can help UK universities secure more productive partnerships in research and innovation that will put them in a good position as the Asian century unfolds. Government policy outweighs market forces In China, the state remains firmly embedded in industry. While China has tinkered with reform of its vast state-owned enterprises in recent years, their total assets actually grew by 46% in the 2013 to 2016 period, according to Ministry of Finance figures. The dominance of the state coupled with rising government investment in innovation mean that even fully private enterprises tend to conduct business in policy jargon, which is disorienting to outsiders. Fortunately, however, the central government’s targets for science and innovation are clearly spelled out in its five-year plan documents. The Made in China 2025 strategy, which aims to transform the economy into a global leader in advanced manufacturing, also highlights automotive, aviation, robotics and healthcare technologies. Activities that dovetail with these priorities are more likely to gain traction with key stakeholders in local universities, industry and government. Direction is from central government, but action happens locally Provinces and major cities are assigned more specific research and innovation priorities and often seek to carve out niches in specialist industries. Guizhou, for example, is a historically poor province in south-western China that has recently emerged as a hub for big data, with preferential policies drawing in domestic tech giants Huawei, Foxconn and China Mobile, as well as foreign firms such as Hewlett-Packard and Hyundai. These local governments are often more open to collaboration with foreign entities. Universities want to become global leaders Foreign partners must match China’s depth of ambition with their breadth of collaboration. A bilateral partnership is unlikely to capture their full attention and energy, since the country’s best universities are looking beyond the domestic market. Their resources are vast and their suitors are many. To get the most out of opportunities in China, UK institutions will need to embrace a new model of collaboration that involves interacting with more players than they usually work with, including government, industry and even other universities that have traditionally been viewed as competitors. This will most likely entail thorny issues around equality and diversity, IP protection and how to share credit for research findings. But in the end, the choice is a relatively simple one: would we rather be on the side lines or the front lines of scientific discovery?

Lavalantula? Passé. Supergator? Consider yourself retired. If you’re a fan of objectively bad films with stupid names about large animals, which you’ll watch drunk one night because it sounds funny (only to immediately realise that you much prefer films with things like plot and production design), you are in for a treat. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Snake Outta Compton. I mean, I could just stop there. Really, the title is all you need to know about Snake Outta Compton. There’s a snake – and let’s presume, given our affinity with the genre, that it’s quite a big snake – and it terrorises Compton. The end. We can also assume that the title came long before the film, and that the budget is so tiny that we’ll only actually see the snake in about three scenes. Snake Outta Compton couldn’t have come at a better time. The bargain-bin monster-movie genre has exhausted itself on a diet of empty calories, with every new film combining big animals and meteorological phenomena to ever more ludicrous extremes, until it has found itself with nowhere left to go. So thank god that Snake Outta Compton has found a way out, by splicing its self-aware silliness with the DNA of a well-liked serious movie. Make no mistake, you’re looking at the future here. Let’s break down the trailer: 1) Again, you probably don’t need to watch the film after seeing this still. “Big-ass snake climbs Uppercase Records building” reads the ticker beneath some GNN news footage. That’s basically Snake Outta Compton summed up, isn’t it? But wait! We haven’t actually seen the snake yet, have we? 2) Oh fine then, here it is. And it’s doing battle with some fighter jets – although it doesn’t really look big enough to warrant that level of military response. You could probably get the job done with some tranquilliser darts and a big net. But wait! We don’t know how the big snake came to be yet, do we? 3) Oh, that’s how. A man zapped it with a ray gun. But why Compton? What stories specific to Compton will this giant snake facilitate? What sort of richly drawn tales of urban deprivation will come from the introduction of the big serpent? 4) Oh. Apparently one of the stories will involve a white lady with a bandana who screeches things in hip-hop clubs. Well, maybe we can write this off as a moment of slightly-too-broad comic relief. What else? 5) There’s also the story about a white man who has cornrows and a mesh T-shirt and what appears to be a solid gold AK-47. I mean, I’ve never been to Compton, but I don’t doubt the veracity of these characters for a moment. 6) In fact, this last guy is the catalyst for the entire plot. When he fires his AK-47, a stray bullet smashes a tank and allows the snake to escape. And finally, after more teasing than any of us could demand, we can get to the good part of the trailer. The part where all the special-effects shots are smashed together to make the film appear much less boring than it inevitably will be. 7) So here we go. Here’s the Jurassic Park rip-off scene. Which is no real surprise. After all, didn’t Jurassic Park basically invent the form that allowed Snake Outta Compton? If anything, this is more of a tribute than a rip-off. 8) Here’s the scene where a man gets graphically devoured by the snake. Hooray! Again, clear nods to the part of Jurassic Park where the guy gets eaten off a toilet. 9) And here’s the scene where … Hold on, I think it’s a scene where a puts his hand down a toilet, but the snake is hiding down the toilet, and it bites his hand off, and somehow an inordinately large amount of blood is produced. Yay? 10) And finally, it would be remiss not to include a scene depicting what happens in about 70% of the Straight Outta Compton trailer; a load of people shouting “OHHHH!” like Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys. So this is the future of the monster movie. Let’s all cross our fingers and pray that Snake Outta Compton does well, because that will surely pave the way for other films like The Grand Barracudapest Hotel and Hacksaw Midge and A Streetcar Named Deshirehorse and … Oh God, these are all brilliant ideas. Someone get me a direct line to Hollywood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/17/british-meps-voted-delay-trade-talks-witch-hunt-verhofstadt-davis","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T10:40:31Z","webTitle":"British MEPs who voted to delay trade talks 'facing witch-hunt'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/17/british-meps-voted-delay-trade-talks-witch-hunt-verhofstadt-davis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/17/british-meps-voted-delay-trade-talks-witch-hunt-verhofstadt-davis","fields":{"headline":"British MEPs who voted to delay trade talks 'facing witch-hunt'","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, has condemned David Davis for running a “witch-hunt” against British MEPs who recently voted in favour of delaying trade talks because of insufficient progress in the negotiations. Davis, the UK’s Brexit secretary, has called – with the support of Theresa May – for 18 Labour MEPs and one Liberal Democrat who supported a recent European parliament resolution critical of the British government to be sacked for acting contrary to the national interest. The Conservatives have already removed the party whip from two Tory MEPs who supported the motion, Julie Girling and Richard Ashworth. Girling has spoken of her sadness at the move. “It is the party which has changed, not me.,” she said. Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister who played a key role in drafting the European parliament’s resolution, was said to be astonished by Davis’s demand in letters to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, for them to discipline their MEPs. “Outrageous witch-hunt of British MEPs for standing up for the rights of UK &amp; EU citizens”, he tweeted. A source close to Verhofstadt said: “It is difficult to believe this is a real letter. We had to double-take. Is this real? It is not fair play.” The resolution, passed by a large majority, advised the European council to rule that insufficient progress had been made in protecting citizens’ rights, finding a solution to the issue of the Irish border and reaching agreement on the principles of the UK’s Brexit divorce bill. In his letter to Corbyn and Cable, Davis wrote: “While I would not expect opposition political parties to agree with us all the time about the end state we seek, it is self-evidently part of the national interest to support a discussion about our future relationship with Europe.” Cable told the Guardian that Davis’s letter followed a pattern in which the government accused its critics, including the media, of acting against the interests of the nation. He said: “It is both extraordinary and alarming that David Davis is demanding opposition parties sack representatives simply for doing their jobs. Conservative ministers should stop making these absurd demands and focus on protecting the country’s prosperity and security from Brexit.” In response to losing the whip, Girling said in a statement: “I am disappointed to have had the Conservative whip withdrawn, especially since it happened before any discussion was held with me about the reason for my vote last week. “I have been active in the party for 40 years – 20 as an elected representative – and for 39 of those years our policy has been pro-Europe. I have never considered myself a rebel and have not altered my beliefs. It is the party which has changed, not me, but that does not stop me feeling sadness that such a precipitate response was felt to be appropriate.” The party’s whip in the European parliament, Dan Dalton, said in a letter to the two Tory MEPs: “The Brexit negotiations are the most important negotiations our country faces and reaching a new partnership with the European Union is in the interests of both the UK and the EU. “The resolution by the European parliament sought to delay progress in the negotiations between the UK and the EU by holding back talks on the future relationship. It also proposed that one part of the UK, Northern Ireland, could remain in the single market and customs union, while the rest of the UK departs – which is not acceptable.” Downing Street has backed the calls. “It is surely in everyone’s interests, both in Britain and in Europe, that talks can progress on trade and our future relationship,” a source said. The prime minister also raised the issue with Corbyn during prime minister’s questions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/22/the-eco-guide-to-the-new-mindful-activism","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-22T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"The eco guide to new mindful activism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/22/the-eco-guide-to-the-new-mindful-activism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/22/the-eco-guide-to-the-new-mindful-activism","fields":{"headline":"The eco guide to new mindful activism","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Activists are the vital foot soldiers of the environmental movement. But is the classic activist model – placard-bearing and angry – actually effective? There’s a suggestion that if you’re not shouting in the face of The Man 24 hours a day, do you actually care? Author Sarah Corbett cares very much, not just about activism, but activists themselves. In her book How to be a Craftivist, she warns that the angry variety can be in danger of burning out. She nearly did, until she realised that as an introvert she needed a different style of protest. Corbett found it in craftivism, a term coined by writer Betsy Greer –who describes it as “a way of looking at life where voicing opinions through creativity makes your voice stronger and your compassion deeper”. This is mindful activism as opposed to the “robotic” sort; it is thought-out, strategic and engaging in approach. Of course, it won’t work for every issue: Donald Trump is unlikely to reconsider pulling out of the Paris Climate Treaty on receipt of a needlepoint coaster. But Corbett has scored some impressive successes, changing minds by embroidering hankies asking for action on living wages in the garment industry and giving them to shareholders at a major high street brand’s AGM. Corbett has found a way of doing her own thing rather than running herself into the ground. This brings me to the second new book, which also redefines activism. The Happy Hero, by another British woman, Solitaire Townsend, is the antithesis of the hair-shirt protest model. If you can do activism right, says Townsend – an environmental consultant who persuades major brands to change their ways – you’ll get the most spectacular kickback: it will make you happy. The big picture: exploring a frozen world What’s happening beneath the Earth’s crust? This is the question that haunts explorer Francesco Sauro. He and microbiologist Joseph Cook, who sampled the ice core as they went, spent 13 days on an expedition in Greenland in the deepest glacier cave ever explored. Their trip is captured in a series of images, Inside the Glaciers, sponsored by Moncler (who designed special outerwear for the expedition). Well dressed: khadi – traditional fabric for a modern world Suddenly we’re awash with potential solutions for the polluting global fashion industry. Typically these involve disruptive innovation, such as switching to futuristic new fibres with lower impact. But the Khadi UK Initiative, formed by ethical activists and business owners, is convinced a traditional form of garment production holds the key. Khadi is hand-spun, hand-woven cotton often combined with silk and wool. Mahatma Gandhi saw it as the symbol and means of self-employment and self-reliance for rural India. To khadi fans, this textile production is wholly sustainable and respects everyone in the supply chain, from farmers and designers to the wearer. Enthusiasts will be making their case for khadi as ‘the fabric of sustainable society’ and hoping to attract new fans at Bermondsey’s Fashion and Textiles Museum on 24 November.

A report by the Lord Speaker’s committee is due to be published this month on reducing membership of the house, which has more than 800 peers who have no official retirement age and can serve until they die. Among its recommendations, the committee is likely to recommend two peers must retire or die in order for another to be appointed. The report is not expected to recommend a retirement age, but will rather seek to reduce the number of peers in the Lords by limiting the new appointees and setting term limits, as well as asking parties to find ways to cut their own numbers. It is also said to avoid recommending major reform to the appointment process by parties and will recommend changes are made without legislation by the House of Commons, which critics said could leave them open to legal challenge. Some members of the House of Lords have held their seats for more than 60 years, and rules introduced in 2014 that allowed peers to retire and keep their title have prompted only 70 to do so, far fewer than was hoped. Almost 300 peers have been created since 2010, and seven more in the last couple of weeks, including the former Met police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe and two new Conservative ministers, the former BBC chair Rona Fairhead and academy funder Theodore Agnew. The cross-party committee that will recommend the changes, first reported by the Times, is chaired by the cross-bench peer Terence Burns, and has two Labour peers, two Conservatives and one Liberal Democrat. It is understood both Labour and the Lib Dems are willing to back changes in principle that would reduce the size of the House of Lords. Under the committee’s self-imposed rule, the change would require a majority vote from peers to change the so-called standing orders that govern the rules of the upper chamber, but would not need primary legislation. The Lib Dem peer Paul Tyler, the party’s constitutional affairs spokesman, said the committee was set to “dance around the issue” of the appointment process, which most members of the House of Lords believed was outdated and undemocratic. “You have a parliamentary house where members are selected or deselected by party whim,” he said. “We wouldn’t tolerate that in any other organisation, it is uniquely and absurdly in the House of Lords.” Lord Tyler said the committee would face an uphill battle to get its proposals accepted without proper legislation examined by both houses of parliament. “When this comes before the house the question is rightly going to be asked: by what right should we decide our own membership rules without legislation?” he said. “Those who will find themselves disadvantaged by the proposals will object on that basis and they would have every right to do so. There might even be the potential for legal challenge.” Tyler said the “two out, one in” proposal would make only slow progress in reducing the size of the House of Lords, but he did not think a mandatory retirement age was the right answer. “Should Shirley Williams have to retire when Andrew Lloyd Webber remains doing not very much but far younger?” he said. Most peers believe reform is necessary to ensure there is still public confidence in the upper house. The Electoral Reform Society (ERS) found last month that more than 100 peers had claimed almost £1.3m between them despite not having spoken in the House of Lords for at least nine months. Peers can claim up to £300 a day for appearing in the chamber, but do not have to speak or vote in order to do so. Lloyd Webber quit as a Conservative peer on Monday, saying his busy schedule was incompatible with the demands of the Lords. The committee’s report is understood to be due to be published on 31 October. Labour and Lib Dem peers have been able to inflict defeat on the government dozens of times over the last parliament, because the Conservatives do not have a majority in the Lords. There are 252 Conservative peers, compared with a combined total of 299 Labour and Lib Dems. This means the changes could technically win a majority in the upper chamber without government support, though it is unlikely in practice. Darren Hughes, the chief executive of the ERS, said the time limit alone would not be enough and the process of appointing peers needed greater scrutiny. “Britain’s bloated second chamber is crying out for change, so these proposals are a start,” he said. “However, these reforms avoid dealing with the real problem in the Lords – a total lack of democracy and transparency in how it is composed. “These hyper-cautious proposals are sticking plaster politics, and would do nothing to stop prime ministers packing the chamber with party donors and political friends. The light-touch reforms only apply to new peerages, meaning any substantial reduction in size could take decades.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/oct/17/david-davis-brexit-statement-boris-johnson-holding-up-progress-in-brexit-talks-claims-merkel-ally-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T16:43:39Z","webTitle":"Davis and Rudd contradict each other over whether 'no deal' Brexit 'unthinkable' - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/17/david-davis-brexit-statement-boris-johnson-holding-up-progress-in-brexit-talks-claims-merkel-ally-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/oct/17/david-davis-brexit-statement-boris-johnson-holding-up-progress-in-brexit-talks-claims-merkel-ally-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Davis and Rudd contradict each other over whether 'no deal' Brexit 'unthinkable' - Politics live","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has accused the EU of trying to drag out the Brexit talks to try to get more money out of the UK, as he urged other countries to allow negotiations to move on to discussions about trade. He spoke after Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, told MPs that it is now time for the EU to “get serious” about the Brexit talks. (See 1.27pm.) But a succession of EU figures, including Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator (see 5.23pm), Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, and Samuli Virtanen, state secretary at the Finnish foreign ministry, have said it is the UK, not the EU, that is to blame for the slow pace of the talks. (See 4.16pm.) Davis and Amber Rudd, the home secretary, have contradicted each other about the acceptability of a “no deal” Brexit. Rudd said the idea was “unthinkable” (see 5.16pm), but Davis said it was important for the government to keep the option open. (See 3.26pm.) The Treasury has flatly rejected calls by the west’s leading economic thinktank for a second EU referendum after the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said a second poll would significantly benefit the economy. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that Britain’s financial industry is running out of time for ministers to strike a transitional deal with Brussels over leaving the European Union. Boris Johnson is facing fresh calls to resign after he sidestepped calls to apologise over his claim that a Libyan coastal town could be turned into a luxury resort once the dead bodies were removed. The registration of 3 million EU nationals in Britain will begin by the end of next year with the “default position” of the Home Office to accept applications, the home secretary has told MPs. Britain’s pensioners will receive a 3% increase in their state income next year after the annual inflation rate reached its highest level since early 2012 last month. Theresa May has met Tory MPs threatening to rebel in a Commons vote tomorrow on universal credit. The cornerstones of wildlife and habitat protection have been quietly left out of the withdrawal bill ripping the heart out of environmental law, campaigners say. As Sandra Laville reports, a key principle under EU law which provides a robust legal backstop against destruction of the environment – the precautionary principle - has been specifically ruled out of the bill as a means of legal challenge in British courts.Based on the idea that the environment is unowned, the precautionary principle creates a bottom line forcing those who want to build or develop, for example, to prove in law what they are doing will not damage the environment. Bombardier has raised hopes of safeguarding 1,000 jobs in Belfast, saying it was confident a deal for Airbus to take a majority stake in the C-Series jet programme would help it avoid punishing US import tariffs. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Speaking at a news conference in Luxembourg, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has denied that the EU is to blame for the slow pace of the Brexit talks. He said: If you take a look at the timetable, take a look at the date of the Brexit referendum, the date when we received Theresa May’s letter which triggered the negotiating process almost a year later and then we had to await the general election to allow us to begin at the end of June. In the light of that, just look at the timetable. The EU is not holding anything or anybody back. We are ready and willing to even speed up the negotiations. Downing Street has played down the significance of the rift between David Davis and Amber Rudd over the acceptability of a “no deal” Brexit. (See 3.22pm.) A Number 10 spokeswoman said: I think if you look at her words in full, she’s referring to the fact that a deal is in the best interests of both sides and that’s something the prime minister absolutely agrees with. In her evidence to the Commons home affairs committee Rudd said: I think it is unthinkable that there would be no deal. It is so much in their interest as well as in ours; in their communities’, in their families’, in their tourists’ interests to have something in place. We will make sure there is something between them and us to maintain our security. Davis said something very different during his Brexit statement in the Commons chamber. (See 3.26pm.) Theresa May is meeting with three potential Tory rebels over universal credit. Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston and Johnny Mercer are in Downing Street with the work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, seeing the prime minister. They have expressed serious concerns about the welfare change - which they support in principle but believe needs to be adjusted to prevent some of the poorest people in society facing a financial squeeze. The main concerns revolve around a six week wait for payments, which has forced people to turn to foodbanks. The prime minister will be concerned about any rebellion during an opposition day debate led by Labour tomorrow on this issue. Theresa May has told her Spanish counterpart, Mariano Rajoy, that the UK will not recognise Catalonian independence and thinks the referendum was illegal, Number 10 has revealed. It has just released this readout of a conversation May and Rajoy had earlier today. Here it is in full. This afternoon the prime minister spoke to Prime Minister Rajoy of Spain. The prime minister expressed her condolences over the loss of life and the damage caused by the forest fires in northern Spain. The two leaders discussed the ongoing situation in Catalonia. The prime minister reiterated that the UK is clear that the referendum had no legal basis and that any unilateral declaration of independence would be inconsistent with the rule of law. She added that the UK would not recognise any such declaration of independence by Catalonia. On Brexit, the prime minister and Prime Minister Rajoy discussed progress in the negotiations and looked ahead to meeting at this week’s European Council. ITV’s Robert Peston is out to wind up Liam Fox, the international trade secretary. He has posted this comment ... ... on this tweet. Bill Clinton believes Brexit was a vote against economic inequalities and a protest against rapid social change in the world. The former US president also described the UK vote to leave the EU as about people thinking differences with others were more important than what they have in common. Clinton was speaking after being awarded an honorary doctorate for his efforts to secure peace in Northern Ireland and in particular his role in bringing about the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. On Brexit Clinton said: Now there are lots of people who think they are less human now given the economic inequalities and rapid pace of social change and all the upheaval that’s going on .... People are reassessing whether what we have in common is more important than our differences ... A lot of people begged to differ. That’s really what the Brexit vote is all about. But the ex-president warned that many Brexit voters had not considered the full impact of leaving the EU especially in terms of a loss of access to European markets. Earlier Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, effectively blamed the UK for the slow pace of the Brexit talks. (See 2.15pm.) Other EU leaders have been making the same argument. As the Times (paywall) reports, in an interview for BBC Northern Ireland’s Spotlight Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said: You can’t have the benefits of being a member of a club if you don’t obey the rules and you won’t pay the membership fee. So, it is quite a difficult negotiation when people who want to leave the EU in Britain don’t really seem to agree among themselves what that actually means. And the Express’s Nick Gutteridge has this quote from Samuli Virtanen, the state secretary at the Finnish foreign ministry. (In Finland a state secretary is a senior official, not a minister.) Turning back to the OECD’s report on the UK, Sky’s Ed Conway has posted a good thread on Twitter with some of the charts from the documents illustrating the economic impact of Brexit. It starts here. My colleague Jennifer Rankin has been tweeting the key points from an EU briefing about the Brexit talks. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, has put out this statement about the split between David Davis and Amber Rudd over the thinkability of a “no deal” Brexit. (See 3.22pm.) Brake said: David Davis claims those warning about a ‘no Brexit’ deal are scaremongering, so does that include his cabinet colleague Amber Rudd? The Brexit secretary is living in fantasy land. There’s no way the government can negotiate a final deal in time with the EU when cabinet ministers can’t even agree amongst themselves. David Davis is either sneakily pushing us towards a no-deal, or has no idea what he’s doing. Either conclusion spells chaos for the British people and businesses. This underlines why the public must get the final say, with the choice to avoid a chaotic Brexit and stay in the EU. My colleague Alan Travis has some more lines from Amber Rudd’s evidence to the home affairs committee. This is what David Davis said to the SNP MP Peter Grant in the Commons earlier about why the government had to prepare for the possibility of a “no deal” Brexit. He said: We are intending, we are setting out, we are straining every sinew to get a deal. That will be the best outcome. But for two reasons, we need to prepare for all the other alternatives. One, because it’s a negotiation with many people and could go wrong, and so we have to be ready for that. Secondly, because in a negotiation you always have to have the right to walk away - if you don’t, you get a terrible deal. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has been giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. As my colleague Alan Travis reports, she said it is “unthinkable” that the UK would leave the EU without a Brexit deal. This flatly contradicts what David Davis, the Brexit secretary, told MPs earlier. Although he repeatedly said he thought there would be a deal, he said the government had to prepare for the possibility that it might have to leave without one, a) just in case everything went wrong, and b) because it was important for the EU to know that the UK had the option of leaving without one. (See 1.42pm.) Here are the main points from David Davis’s Commons statement on Brexit. Davis, the Brexit secretary, effectively accused the EU of dragging out the Brexit talks in the hope of getting the UK to pay more. He said: The simple truth is, of course we are in a negotiation. And they are using time pressure to see if they can get more money out of us. Bluntly, that’s what’s going on. It is obvious to anybody ... But we will get there in time, I’m quite sure, to get a decent outcome for everybody. He rejected claims in a Resolution Foundation report today that Brexit without trade deal would lead to average household bills rising by £260 a year. He described the report as “scaremongering”. Asked if he was worried about what it said, he said: If I thought it reflected the reality, I wouldn’t be relaxed about it. But the simple truth is that it doesn’t. It doesn’t reflect the effect of free trade deals. It doesn’t reflect what we would have to do under those circumstances. Later he said the report did not take into account the impact of the tariffs that the UK currently has to impose on food imports from outside the EU because of the EU’s common external tariff. He hinted that EU leaders may make a surprise concession on the transition at their summit later this week. Asked about lack of progress so far, he said there had been five rounds of talks. He went on: Indeed, I had another meeting with Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier last night. Let’s just see what the European council comes up with on Friday, shall we? He said that the proposed transition period would not apply unless there was a final Brexit deal as well. He said: Such a transition phase will only be triggered once we have completed the deal itself. You cannot carry on negotiating through that. He said the UK’s offer on the rights of EU nationals was more generous than the EU’s. He said: In many of these areas, it is a straightforward statement of fact that our proposals go further, and provide more certainty, than those of the commission. He accused Labour MPs warning about the economic impact of Brexit of “talking down the economy”. He said today’s OECD report says the UK economy will continue to grow even if it has to trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. The Davis statement is over. It did not last as long as these statements normally do. I will post a summary soon. Meanwhile, in Luxembourg, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has been talking about last night’s dinner with Theresa May. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. And this is from AFP’s Danny Kemp. So Barnier is effectively renewing his claim that the UK is to blame for the slow pace of progress in the Brexit talks. (How else can you interpret “it takes two to accelerate”?). It is a claim Barnier has often made before. But Davis is claiming the EU is to blame. See 1.43pm. UK and EU blame each other for slow pace of Brexit talks. Labour’s Wes Streeting says the chancellor is being savaged by Tory MPs for pointing out the disadvantages of Brexit. What assurances can Davis give that there will be a transition deal? Davis says people like Streeting have been talking down the economy for two years. They predicted a recession. But “the reverse is true”. The economy is growing and employment is at a record high. Richard Drax, a Conservative, says the UK has to leave the EU to honour the results of the referendum. So leaving with no deal has to be on the table, he says. Davis says this point is “entirely logical”. Davis says, for an implementation phase to have value, it has to be agreed soon. The government wants to get this underway as soon as possible, he says. Rishi Sunak, a Conservative, asks what the government will do to ensure that the transition does not become a “bridge to nowhere”. Davis says the government will try to get the transition agreed as soon as possible. But he says it will only come into force if there is a final deal, he says. Davis says transition deal will not apply unless there is an overall final Brexit deal as well. David Jones, the Conservative former Brexit minister, asks if the government will consider alternative options if the EU refuses to discuss trade talks. Davis says he expects the EU to do what is in their interests. That involves having a deal. So that is what he expects to happen, he says. Labour’s Heidi Alexander asks if the UK will seek to remain a member of EU regulatory bodies after Brexit. Davis says control of these issues will come back to the UK. Then there will be a procedure to manage convergence, he says. Labour’s Chris Leslie says we still have not got an agreement on a transition deal yet. The cliff edge starts at the end of this year, he says. Who will Davis be talking to to make sure we get an agreement on a transition this week. Davis says: Let’s just see what the European council comes up with on Friday, shall we? Davis hints that EU leaders might offer some sort of progress towards a transition at their summit later this week. Labour’s Pat McFadden asks about the Resolution Foundation report about the extra costs to householders of a no deal Brexit. Davis says he would not be relaxed if he thought the Resolution Foundation report was accurate. But it is not, he says. It does not take into account how the government would respond. He says he is “knocking down scaremongering”. Davis accuses Resolution Foundation of “scaremongering” about the impact of a no deal Brexit. Labour’s Hilary Benn asks about a transition deal and how long it will last. Davis says Theresa May has said around two years. Owen Paterson, the Conservative former environment secretary, says up to 29,000 jobs in the German car making sector could go if there is Brexit with no trade deal. When will EU partners realise this? Davis says it is obvious that EU leaders are delaying because they think that will help them get a better deal. But he is confident there will be a deal in the end. The SNP’s Europe spokesman, Peter Grant, says before you accelerate, you should check to see whether you are heading for the cliff edge. He asks if it is reasonable to go into talks with red lines. And Davis may say he is not talking up no deal. But will he talk it down, and say it would be very bad. Davis says the government is “straining every sinew” to get a deal. But it could go wrong, and so it has to prepare for that. And in a negotiation you have to have the option of being able to walk away, he says. Sir Bill Cash, a Conservative, asks about how the government will guarantee the rights of EU nationals in UK laws. Davis says the government is looking at various options. Adjudication will of course by by the UK courts, he says. Davis is responding to Starmer. He denies talking up a no deal Brexit. He says Starmer “carps and carps, but has not option of his own”. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is responding. He says the government has failed to hit an important deadline (getting the EU to agree to move the talks on to phase two in October.) He says Davis is being too confident. Davis and Theresa May were right to go to Brussels last night, he says. He says he would like to claim that was a result of his call for a fresh round of emergency talks last week. Starmer says May’s Florence speech was helpful. But it was then undermined by “self-interested antics” by some cabinet ministers, he says. He says he is glad there was an agreement at the dinner to “accelerate” the talks. But they have been moving at a glacial speech. It is not much for a car moving at 2mph to accelerate to 4mph. (He has nicked this metaphor from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, who used it last night in a blog.) He says Davis should make it clear that no deal is not an option. Davis should not talk up no deal, he says. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is making a Commons statement on Brexit. His opening statement summed up what has been achieved in the talks so far. He said the two sides were reaching the limit of what could be achieved without discussing the future trade relationship. Here are the main points from Foreign Office questions. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, said it was now time for the EU to “get serious” about the Brexit talks. (See 1.06pm.) This is unlikely to go down well in Brussels where the slow pace of the Brexit talks is widely attributed to the UK government’s failure to make more specific commitments about money. He accused Labour MPs of being “supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies”, claiming they would be willing to pay as much as €100bn to the EU. He told MPs: What I said in answer to an honourable friend on these benches was that some of the sums that I heard spoken of were in my view eye-watering, in my honourable friend’s, eye-watering, that they were far too high. Now, the figure I heard was €100bn - is that side of the House, would they cough up a hundred? Would you? Would you? I think they would, I think they would, the supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies. They would. I think that’s the sort of money they’d readily fork out. I think that’s too much. He claimed it was a “scandal” that Labour MPs were willing to appear on RT (formally Russia Today). He said: If you study the output of Russia Today, and if you consider the state of the press in Russia at present, it is a scandal that members of the party opposite are continuing to validate and legitimate that kind of propaganda by going on those programmes. I’m assured by my ministerial team none of them do so. He accused Russia of behaving as though it was in a new cold war. He said: The tragedy is that in many ways Russia is behaving as though there is indeed a new Cold War, and our objective is to prevent that from getting any worse. To constrain Russia, to make sure we penalise Russia for its malign and disruptive activities where they’re taking place, but also to engage where we can. And that’s why, for instance, I’ll be going to Russia later on this year. He said Russia was “up to all sorts of mischief in many countries”. But he said the government had not so far been able to “pinpoint any direct Russian cyber attacks on this country”. He repeatedly refused to apologise for his comments about “dead bodies” in Libya, accusing the opposition of “trivialising” the issue. In response to a comment from the SNP’s Stephen Gethins, he said: I don’t believe that political point scoring of this kind, or trivialising or ignoring the reality of the security situation in Sirte does any favours to the people of Libya. Afterwards Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, suggested he was guilty of hypocrisy. (See 11.56am.) The SNP’s David Linden responded by issues a fresh call for Johnson to resign. (See 11.50am.) Here is the full quote where Boris Johnson told the EU to “get serious” about the Brexit negotiations. He was responding to the Lib Dem MP Jamie Stone (see 12.31pm) who asked Johnson how he would respond to the comments from the German politician Michael Fuchs on the Today programme this morning. Fuchs claimed Johnson was holding up progress in the Brexit talks because he was preventing Theresa May from making a more acceptable offer. (See 9.24am.) Johnson said: It is up to our friends and partners in the EU now to look seriously at the offer we are making, particularly on citizens, and to make progress. Everybody wants to make progress. Everybody wants to give the 3.2m EU citizens in this country the maximum possible reassurance and security. That can only happen once our friends and partners decide to get serious in these negotiations. Tuesday’s post-cabinet briefing from Theresa May’s official spokesman brought no real updates on the Brexit process. We were told that last night’s dinner in Brussels was not even discussed. At the end of the cabinet, the spokesman said, the PM had updated her ministers on the plans for the European council summit later this week, explaining that she believed her speech in Florence on Brexit last month “had created momentum”. There would be a time during the summit, still to be pinned down on the schedule, “where she would set out the UK’s position in relation to the UK leaving the European Union”, the spokesman said, adding: “She said that the Florence speech had had a positive impact on negotiations going forward.” The update came at the end of cabinet, he added, and there was no discussion among ministers. The cabinet also had “a very constructive discussion” on the upcoming budget, the spokesman said, with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, saying he “looked forwards to receiving contributions from colleagues in coming weeks”. Foreign Office has finally finished. It is only supposed to last an hour, but John Bercow, the Commons speaker, has let it overrun by almost 20 minutes. I will post a summary shortly. Johnson says it is a “scandal” that Labour MPs have appeared on Russia Today. By doing so they “validate and legitimate” Russian propaganda, he says. He was responding to a question from a Tory MP that may have been prompted by this Guido Fawkes blog. Here is a nice detail that the BBC’s Esther Webber picked up earlier. In response to a question from Labour’s Hilary Benn, Johnson says the UK does not know yet if the EU will agree to have an “implementation period”. Here is the Labour MP Chi Onwurah about Boris Johnson’s claim a few minutes ago about Tory unity on Brexit. (See 12.26pm.) Onwurah is ignoring the fact that Johnson seemed to be exaggerating for comic effect, and so the “self delusion” charge is probably unfair. But you could argue that not taking the question seriously is also a serious failing. Jamie Stone, a Lib Dem, asks Johnson if he thinks his recent interventions on Brexit have helped the government. Johnson says the government is united behind the government’s approach. And he says the UK’s friends in the EU need to “get serious” about these talks. He suggests they are dragging their feet on the issue of the rights of EU nationals. Johnson says EU states need to “get serious” about Brexit talks. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, asks if Johnson accepts now that the UK will have to pay a divorce bill to the UK. And how much should it be? Johnson says Thornberry has misquoted him. He said he was opposed to the UK paying a substantial sum. Some people were talking €100bn. Would “supine” Labour pay that much? He thinks they would, he says. Thornberry says Johnson has said both that the government is planning for no deal and isn’t. Which is it? Johnson says there is a ruthless consistency in everything he has said. Tory MPs are united behind the principles of the Lancaster House speech, the article 50 letter and the Florence speech, he says. Labour’s Jeff Smith says Johnson said earlier this year that Labour had been far too pessimistic about Donald Trump. Does he accept he was wrong? Johnson says President Trump has not juncked the Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA. Britain intends to keep it alive. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, asks Johnson if he intends to encourage Trump to encourage a negotiated solution to the Korean crisis. Johnson says he wants to see “jaw-jaw, not war-war.” Johnson says British aid workers responded fantastically to the recent hurricanes. Yet before the hurricane was even over, he received a letter two select committees criticising the UK’s response, he says. He says that was “premature”. Turning away from Foreign Office questions for a moment, the OECD has just published its report on the UK. Here is the Guardian’s story about it. And here is how it starts. Britain must secure “the closest possible economic relationship” with the European Union after Brexit to prevent the economy suffering a long-term decline, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) has warned. The thinktank to the world’s richest nations, which has predicted the UK’s growth rate will fall to just 1% next year, said a “disorderly” exit from the EU single market and customs union in 2019 “would hurt trading relationships and reduce long-term growth”. But the report said that the reversal of the Brexit decision by a change of government or a second referendum would have a “significant” positive impact on the UK’s growth. Entering the debate over Brexit at a crucial stage in negotiations, the OECD added that steep falls in the UK’s productivity performance relative to other major economies alied with the failure of its export industries to grab a slice of expanding world trade have left it in a weak position to operate outside the EU. Here is the OECD’s news release about its report. Johnson says there are two “ecosystems of terror” that the UK faces: one at home, and one abroad. He says the government is tackling both. The space the terrorists have in Iraq and Syria has been greatly reduced in the last year, he says. Johnson is still taking questions on Russia. He says there is no direct evidence of a Russian cyber attack on the UK. In one of his answers on Libya Boris Johnson accused the opposition of “trivialising” the security situation in Libya. Here is Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, effectively accusing him of hypocrisy. In response to a question about Russia, Boris Johnson says the UK cannot have a normal relationship with the country. But he says it is important to engage with it. The SNP MP David Linden, who asked the first question (see 11.37am), is saying Boris Johnson should resign in the light of his answer on Libya. The SNP’s Stephen Gethins asks how Johnson thinks his comments impacted on Libya. Johnson says he is trying to bring people together. Gethins agrees. He has brought people together to condemn what he said. Johnson accuses Gethins of “political point scoring”. Ignoring the security problems in Libya does no one any favours, he says. Labour’s shadow foreign minister Fabian Hamilton says Johnson said that the only people criticising him over his Sirte comments had no knowledge of Libya. Quoting a Libyan politician saying the remarks were offensive, he asks Johnson to apologise. Johnson says MPs should get behind the plan to bring security to Libya and Sirte. That would honour those who died, he says. Johnson refuses to apologise for his comment about “dead bodies” in Libya. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is taking questions in the Commons. The SNP’s David Linden asks Johnson if he will apologise for his comments at the Tory conference about the need to clear away the dead bodies in Sirte. Johnson says we must all be aware of the tragic absence of security in Libya and Sirte. But, when those problems are resolved, Libya has fantastic prospects. This year’s Conservative party conference often ended up sounding like a seminar on South America because most speakers seemed to find it impossible to make a contribution without going on about Venezuela. But, in an interesting column in the Telegraph (paywall), the Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch says this was a big mistake. The party is using the wrong language to make the case against Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, she argues. Badenoch, who is seen as one of the stars of the new Tory intake (she was chosen to introduce Theresa May at the Conservative conferences), explains: I asked two of my staff members what they thought of the increased enthusiasm for Corbyn. Separated by 30 years, I listened to these two Conservatives, argue about the problem with young people. It was illuminating. My head of office vividly remembered going hungry every time there was a strike and her father lost his wages. The 3-day week, waiting months for a telephone line and how terrible British Rail was. The carnage after a Left-wing government was obvious. She had seen socialism fail, again and again. “Look at what’s happening in Venezuela!”. I watched my 23 year old researcher’s eyes deaden as she said that. “Yeah, what about Venezuela?” he asked. “I don’t care about Venezuela. I care about what’s happening here. Yes, you waited 6 months for a telephone line, but my family’s been waiting years for a mobile phone signal in my house, the trains are still late but more expensive and I still live at home because a cheap flat is ten times my salary”. The generational and political divides have never been wider, and some of this can be explained by how the Right uses language. Pointing to Venezuela and thinking we’ve successfully won the argument defending capitalism against socialism doesn’t work. It was easier when people had lived through both. The Times’ Rachel Sylvester has another interesting story about reforming parliament. She says John Bercow, the Commons speaker, and Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, are backing a proposal to give MPs six-months paid “baby leave”. In her column (paywall) she writes: At the moment, MPs have no maternity or paternity rights because they are not technically employees but elected representatives. Under the plan drawn up by Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, and backed by John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, politicians would be able to nominate a parliamentary colleague as proxy to vote on their behalf in the Commons while they are on parental leave. In a parallel move, they would be allowed to hire somebody to stand in for them in their constituency during their absence, funded by the taxpayer. The change is expected to be endorsed by the cross-party Commons Reference Group on Representation and Inclusion, chaired by the Speaker, possibly as early as this week. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which would be responsible for funding the constituency cover, is “very supportive in principle”, a spokesman tells me. Its chairwoman, Ruth Evans, was previously the director of the Maternity Alliance and has long campaigned for improved parental rights. Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader (who famously said that motherhood made her a better politician because it gave her a “stake in society”) also backs the introduction of baby leave for MPs. Lucy Fisher has a good story in the Times today (paywall). She says a Lords committee will recommend putting a 15-year time limit on new peerages. Her story goes on: The Lords has almost 800 members, making it the second largest legislative chamber in the world after the National People’s Congress of China, but pressure has grown on the government to reduce its size. There is no retirement age or limit on how long peers can serve. The Lords committee tasked this year with cutting membership of the house will propose the time limits in its report this month. It will also call on the four large parts of the Lords — 252 Tory peers, 199 from Labour, 100 Lib Dems and 180 crossbenchers — to commit to cutting the size of their blocs in stages. A 15-year time limit on new members will be proposed as a way of maintaining a smaller house while providing for a greater degree of continuity in its membership than in the Commons. (Presumably after 15 years these new peers would still be able to call themselves Lord or Lady so-and-so. If the authorities were really serious about discouraging people from wanting to sit in the House of Lords, they would abolish the titles too.) The Electoral Reform Society says these proposals do not go far enough. In a statement its chief executive Darren Hughes said: It’s welcome that peers now recognise the need the cut down the size of the upper house. At around 800 members, Britain’s bloated second chamber is crying out for change, so these proposals are a start. Years of pressure and public outrage have finally forced the Lords into cleaning out their stables. However, these reforms avoid dealing with the real problem in the Lords – a total lack of democracy and transparency in how it is composed. These hyper-cautious proposals are sticking plaster politics, and would do nothing to stop prime ministers packing the chamber with party donors and political friends. The light-touch reforms only apply to new peerages, meaning any substantial reduction in size could take decades. Nor would the changes go any way to addressing the crisis of representation. Over half of peers are aged over 70, nearly half live in London and the South East, and – contrary to claims of independence – almost all vote solely along party lines ... The public are not just fed up with the Lords because it is too big – they are fed up with repeated expenses scandals, allegations of cronyism and the ludicrous continuation of hereditary peers. And they are sick of the Mother of All Parliaments being viewed as a members club for a small elite. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, is one of the most outspoken critics of the UK government in Brussels. He has been at it again this morning, commenting on this story from the Independent. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has this morning announced plans to make it easier for the government to intervene to block company mergers on national security grounds. He has explained the plans in a written ministerial statement here and in a press release here. Here’s an extract from the news release. Today’s proposals include enabling the government to intervene in mergers that raise national security concerns, even when they involve smaller businesses. These changes are targeted at key areas, specifically companies that design or manufacture military and dual use products, and parts of the advanced technology sector. In these areas, currently the government can only intervene in mergers involving companies with a UK turnover of more than £70m or where the share of UK supply increases to 25% or over. Today’s proposals will close these loopholes to enable greater scrutiny of foreign investment in a changing market. In these areas, the government will lower the threshold whereby ministers can scrutinise investment to businesses with a UK turnover of over £1m, and remove the requirement for a merger to increase a business’s share of supply of, or over, 25%. Clark will be publishing a green paper and making a statement in the Commons later. Anas Sarwar has received a useful endorsement in his quest to become the next Scottish Labour leader. In a joint statement Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, and Steve Rotheram, the Labour Liverpool metro mayor, have both endorsed him. They say: We need Labour back in power in Scotland and across all the regions and nations of the UK. Having worked closely with Anas in Westminster and witnessed the passion with which he led the Labour campaign to strengthen Scotland’s place in the UK, it’s clear that he has the energy and experience to lead Labour back to power. Anas is a committed devolutionist, and knows that we need to devolve power from Whitehall to our cities and regions. In these challenging times, we need to work together to ensure we can increase jobs and grow the economies of our great cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Sarwar needs all the help he can get. His opponent, the more leftwing Richard Leonard, is the clear favourite in the contest, which ends with the result being announced on 18 November. Sarwar, who is now an MSP, served as an MP for five years between 2010 and 2015, which is why Burnham and Rotheram know him well. Leonard has only ever been an MSP. The number of hate crimes recorded by police has increased by 29% since last year - the largest annual rise since records began, the Press Association reports. In 2016/17 police recorded 80,393 offences where hate was deemed to be a motivating factor, compared to 62,518 in 2015/16. Since the government began collecting such data in 2011/12, recorded hate crime has steadily increased, with the sharpest rise occurring in the last year. The Home Office report [pdf] said: “The increase over the last year is thought to reflect both a genuine rise in hate crime around the time of the EU referendum and following the Westminster Bridge terrorist attack, as well as ongoing improvements in crime reporting by police.” Yesterday the BBC’s Adam Fleming tweeted a picture of a mystery chart that Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, had at a meeting. Today he has managed to find out what it is. Inflation has hit 3%, its highest level for five and a half years. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on his business live blog. Here are the main points from this morning’s Today programme interview with Michael Fuchs, vice chair of the of the CDU/CSU group in the German parliament. Fuchs claimed that Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, was holding up progress in the Brexit talks by preventing Theresa May making an acceptable offer to the EU. (See 9.24am.) But Fuchs also made it clear that he was not asking for Johnson to be sacked. “Of course not,” he said, when this suggestion was put to him. He said that the UK had not offered to pay enough money to the EU as it left. When it was put to him that Theresa May had made a financial offer, he replied: But that was not enough. Of course, it was not accepted, this proposal ... You have to accept that there are a lot of things to be paid. Let me just say - pensions, which is not solved. This problem has to be solved and the UK has to come up with decent proposals. May’s offer in her Florence speech was “not a decent proposal”, he said. He said European thought that the UK was trying to cherry pick (ie, to keep the advantages of EU membership without accepting the disadvantages). He said: You remember my chancellor’s [Angela Merkel’s] words; in is in, and out is out. And you cannot have just one part soft and the others not. That’s one of the real big problems. Everyone in Europe at the moment has a feeling that there is a little bit of cherry picking going on, and that’s not acceptable. Theresa May’s flying visit to Brussels last night for a 90-minute dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, ended without any significant breakthrough in the Brexit process. The Guardian’s overnight story is here, and Sky has footage of Juncker embracing May and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, as they left. (Davis seemed to get away without a proper continental-style kiss, although perhaps it would have been better for the national interest if he’d copied Tony Blair.) Today Davis will be in the Commons giving MPs an update on the Brexit talks. Before he speaks, his fellow cabinet Brexiter, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, will be taking questions. On the Today programme this morning Michael Fuchs, vice chair of the CDU/CSU group in the German parliament and hence an ally of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, suggested that Johnson was to blame for the lack of progress on the Brexit talks. He told the programme: We have to have a fair deal. I think Theresa May has to come up with fair proposals. At the moment it is not really that much. But I know there are internal problems. Whatever she’s offering, Boris Johnson is saying it’s too much ... His influence seems to be pretty strong. Otherwise she would come up with other proposals, I guess. The problem is she has internal trouble with the Tories. I’ll post more from his interview shortly. I will be covering Johnson’s question session in the Commons and the Davis statement in full. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The cabinet meets. 9.30am: Inflation figures are released. 9.30am: The Home Office publishes figures on hate crimes. 10am: Energy companies and Ofgem give evidence to the Commons business committee on price caps. 11.15am: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. My colleague Graeme Wearden will be covering it on his business live blog. 11.50am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Angel Gurria, the OECD secretary general, hold a press conference to launch the OECD’s economic survey of the UK. 12.30pm: David Davis, the Brexit secretary, gives a statement to MPs. 2.30pm: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

Hate crime offences recorded by the police rose by a record 29% to 80,393 incidents in the 12 months to March 2017, according to Home Office figures published on Tuesday. The Home Office said the figures showed a spike in hate crime in England and Wales following the Westminster Bridge terrorist attack on 22 March as well as in the aftermath of the referendum in June 2016. Provisional police figures show that the number of crimes, which increased after the Westminster Bridge attack, continued to climb until June as the Manchester Arena, London Bridge and Finsbury Park attacks followed. The number of hate crime incidents recorded by the police reached a record monthly level of 6,000 incidents in June. This peak was higher than the previous monthly peak of 5,500 in July 2016 seen in the aftermath of the EU referendum. The 29% increase in the annual figure is the largest rise since the official hate crime figures started to be published five years ago. Home Office statisticians said the increase was thought to reflect both a genuine rise in hate crime and ongoing improvements in crime recording by the police. Race was deemed to be a motivating factor in nearly 80% of recorded hate crime incidents – 62,685 incidents. Sexual orientation was a factor in 9,157 or 11% of incidents, with religious hate crime accounting for 5,940 or 7%. A further 5,558 were recorded as disability hate crimes and 1,248 were deemed to be motivated by transgender hate. The Home Office said the proportions summed to more than 100% as it was possible for a hate crime offence to have more than one motivating factor. Analysis of provisional daily data supplied by 38 police forces to the Home Office national data hub between April 2016 and August 2017 showed a spike in daily hate crime after the Greater Manchester attack on 22 May. “The level of offences decreased in the following days, but again increased with the London Bridge and Borough Market attacks on the 3 June 2017. This pattern is again repeated with the Finsbury Park attack on the 19 June 2017,” reports the Home Office bulletin. Figures tracking the outcome of the 80,393 offences recorded to the police in 2016-17 show that only 16% of “flagged” offences led to somebody being charged or summonsed for the incident. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the rise in hate crime was unacceptable, especially after a drop in the number of police referrals has seen a fall in prosecutions. “The Tories have made great claims about tackling burning injustices. But they are clearly not tackling the great injustice of being attacked simply because of your religion, your sexuality, the colour of your skin or your disability,” she said. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, agreed there was “absolutely no place” for hate crime in Britain but said the government was taking action to tackle it. She said: “I am heartened that more victims are more confident to come forward and report incidents of hate crime, and that police identification and recording of all crime is improving. “But no one in Britain should have to suffer violent prejudice, and indications that there was a genuine rise in the number of offences immediately following each of this year’s terror attacks is undoubtedly concerning.” The Home Office said it was spending £2.4m on protecting places of worship, a further £1m for vulnerable faith institutions and £900,000 to support community projects. The Crown Prosecution Service published data on Tuesday showing record numbers of tougher hate crime sentences being passed by the courts. Sentences in more than half of cases – 6,300 – involving hostility on the grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender activity increased because of this factor. However, the overall number of the number of hate crime prosecutions was down from 15,542 in 2015-16 to 14,480 in 2016-17, while the number of cases referred to prosecutors increased slightly from 12,997 to 13,086."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2017/oct/28/uk-state-pension-ubs-britain-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-28T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"UK pensions among the worst in the developed world, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/28/uk-state-pension-ubs-britain-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2017/oct/28/uk-state-pension-ubs-britain-australia","fields":{"headline":"UK pensions among the worst in the developed world, study finds","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"British workers can expect among the worst pensions in the developed world, according to a report from wealth managers UBS, which compared the retirement outlook for a 50-year-old woman in major cities across the globe. UBS calculated how much a country’s basic state pension, plus “mandated” pensions such as the UK’s automatic enrolment scheme and Australia’s “superannuation” scheme, would pay out as a proportion of the income of a 50-year-old “average Jane” living in the capital city. It found that Jane in London can expect just 41% of her current income in retirement, on a par with Hong Kong and just one place above the lowest-ranked city, Taipei in Taiwan. Singapore, Sydney, Paris and Milan topped the table. UBS found Australia’s pension system was one of the most sustainable, with companies compelled to put aside 9.5% of a worker’s salary in a pension scheme. The UK’s auto-enrolment scheme, which is loosely modelled on the Australian one, compels British employers to pay just 1% of salary, rising to 3% in 2019. The payouts from the Australian “super” scheme, on top of the country’s basic state pension, mean that a 50-year-old female in Sydney today can expect to retire at age 67 with an income of 72% of her current salary, compared with 41% in London. Singapore came top of the table, just ahead of Sydney, helped by its giant $346bn (£262bn) Central Provident Fund. However, UBS said Jane in Zurich was the best off, measured by the amount of additional savings she would have to put aside to finance her lifestyle in retirement. Private pension arrangements were not included in the study, which looked purely at mandatory arrangements in each country – in other words, the compulsory amounts that employers must set aside, plus the payouts from state pensions. UBS said Jane in London would have to save 47% of her income every month at age 50 if she hoped to finance a basic urban lifestyle, assuming she had saved nothing yet privately. “This highlights that the [UK] system relies heavily on private provisions,” it added. “The UK provides a good example of how starting late in life will require more sacrifice to catch up.” Pensions compared How much a state plus “mandatory” pension will be worth at retirement as a proportion of current income, based on a 50-year-old female in each city Singapore 73% Sydney 72% Paris 69% Milan 67% New York 55% Tokyo 55% Munich 50% Zurich 48% Toronto 42% London 41% Hong Kong 41% Taipei 32% Source: UBS Wealth Management"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/17/murdered-panama-papers-journalist-son-malta-crooks-daphne-caruana-galizia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T09:47:23Z","webTitle":"Murdered Panama Papers journalist’s son attacks Malta’s ‘crooks’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/murdered-panama-papers-journalist-son-malta-crooks-daphne-caruana-galizia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/17/murdered-panama-papers-journalist-son-malta-crooks-daphne-caruana-galizia","fields":{"headline":"Murdered Panama Papers journalist’s son attacks Malta’s ‘crooks’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The son of the murdered Maltese investigative journalist and blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia has described finding parts of his mother’s body around the blazing car in which she died and attacked the island as a “mafia state” run by “crooks”. “My mother was assassinated because she stood between the rule of law and those who sought to violate it, like many strong journalists,” Matthew Caruana Galizia, who is also an investigative reporter, wrote in a moving and at times graphic Facebook post. “But she was also targeted because she was the only person doing so. This is what happens when the institutions of the state are incapacitated: the last person left standing is often a journalist. Which makes her the first person left dead.” Dutch forensic experts and a team from the FBI were due to arrive in Malta to help police in the EU’s smallest state investigate the killing of Caruana Galizia, who led the Panama Papers investigation into corruption on the island. She died on Monday afternoon when her Peugeot was destroyed by an explosive device so powerful it blew the car into a nearby field. “I saw a small explosion coming from the car and I panicked,” said one witness, Frans Sant, who was driving in the opposite direction. “A few seconds later, around three to four seconds, there was another, larger explosion. The car continued coming down the hill, skidding at high speed, full of fire. The car missed me by around 10 feet. I tried to help but the fire was too much and the car ended up in the field,” he said. Several hundred people demonstrated outside the main law courts in the island’s fortress capital, Valletta, on Tuesday afternoon to demand justice for the 53-year-old journalist, described as a “one-woman WikiLeaks” whose blogs were as fiercely critical of the island’s politicians as they were of its organised crime gangs. “The state did not defend Daphne,” said Andrew Borg-Cardona, a prominent lawyer who works with the journalist’s husband. Michael Briguglio, a leading member of the island’s Green party, said: “This is a political murder because it clearly has a political context and the state did not protect a journalist who was in danger.” The European commission said it was horrified by the murder. Asked if it would open a procedure to check if Malta was meeting the EU’s rule of law standards, a spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said an “outrageous act has happened and what matters now is that justice will be brought. This is what we need to see.” Matthew Caruana Galizia said he would never forget “running around the inferno in the field, trying to figure out a way to open the door, the horn of the car still blaring, screaming at two policemen who turned up with a single fire extinguisher to use it”. One of the policemen said: “Sorry, there is nothing we can do,” he wrote. “I looked down and there were my mother’s body parts all around me. I realised they were right, it was hopeless. ‘Who is in the car?’ they asked me. ‘My mother is in the car. She is dead. She is dead because of your incompetence.’” Caruana Galizia ran a hugely popular blog relentlessly highlighting cases of alleged high-level corruption among politicians across Malta’s party lines. “There are crooks everywhere you look now. The situation is desperate,” she wrote in a post published barely half an hour before the bomb exploded. Police said the journalist had just left her home and was on a road near the village of Bidnija in northern Malta when the bomb detonated. Local media said she had reported receiving threats two weeks ago, although police officials denied receiving any complaint. Caruana Galizia’s most recent revelations pointed the finger at Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and two of his closest aides, connecting offshore companies linked to the three men with the sale of Maltese passports and payments from the government of Azerbaijan. Muscat denounced the journalist’s killing on Monday, calling it a “barbaric attack on press freedom”. Muscat, who sued the journalist and won a snap election in June called as a vote of confidence to counter her allegations, said he would “not rest until I see justice done in this case”. While Caruana Galizia’s targets were mainly the ruling Labour party and its supporters, she had more recently turned her fire on Malta’s opposition whose leader, Adrian Delia, on Tuesday called on the prime minister to resign and the police chief and attorney general to be sacked. “The political blame for her death lies squarely in [Muscat’s] lap and he should shoulder responsibility for it,” Delia said. “Everything in this country has a price now, but … You can be sure that someone will have to pay for this death.” Caruana Galizia’s targets ranged from allegedly corrupt politicians to banks facilitating money laundering and the links between Malta’s online gaming industry and the mafia. Her recent work had focused particularly on revelations from the Panama Papers, a huge cache of leaked documents from the leading offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. Matthew Caruana Galizia said in his Facebook post that his mother’s killing was “no ordinary murder and it was not tragic. Tragic is someone being run over by a bus. When there is blood and fire all around you, that’s war. We are a people at war against the state and organised crime, which have become indistinguishable.” He criticised “that clown of a prime minister”, making statements to parliament “about a journalist he spent over a decade demonising and harassing”, and highlighted a Facebook post by a police sergeant who shortly after the murder wrote: “Everyone gets what they deserve, cow dung! Feeling happy :)” Caruana Galizia concluded: “Yes, this is where we are: a mafia state … where you will be blown to pieces for exercising your basic freedoms, only for the people who are supposed to have protected you to instead be celebrating it.” He said a “culture of impunity” had been allowed to flourish on the island after the prime minister “filled his office with crooks, then the police with crooks and imbeciles, then the courts with crooks and incompetents. “If the institutions were already working, there would be no assassination to investigate – and my brothers and I would still have a mother.” After an application by the dead journalist’s family, the investigating magistrate, Consuelo Scerri Herrera – who had come under criticism from Caruana Galizia in her blog and subsequently sued her – withdrew from the case on Tuesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/17/iraqi-forces-drive-kurdish-fighters-out-of-sinjar","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T09:02:30Z","webTitle":"Iraqi forces drive Kurdish fighters out of town of Sinjar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/iraqi-forces-drive-kurdish-fighters-out-of-sinjar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/17/iraqi-forces-drive-kurdish-fighters-out-of-sinjar","fields":{"headline":"Iraqi forces drive Kurdish fighters out of town of Sinjar","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kurdish fighters have lost more territory in Iraq, a day after Iraqi forces pushed them out of the disputed oil-rich city of Kirkuk. The commander of local Yazidi fighters, Masloum Shingali, said Kurdish forces had left the town of Sinjar before dawn on Tuesday, allowing Shia-led militia fighting with Iraqi forces to move into the town. Shingali said there had been no clashes and that the Kurdish forces left immediately. “They didn’t want to fight,” he said. The town’s mayor, Mahma Khalil, said the Popular Mobilisation Forces, a predominantly Shia militia coalition, were securing Sinjar. Iraqi troops pushed their Kurdish allies in the battle against Islamic State out of Kirkuk on Monday, seizing oilfields and other facilities as tensions soar over last month’s Kurdish vote for independence. Iraqi forces also took control of the Bai Hasan and Avana oilfields north-west of Kirkuk on Tuesday, after seizing the Baba Gurgur, Jambur and Khabbaz fields the previous day, a senior military officer told Reuters. Oil officials in Baghdad said all the fields were operating normally. The Pentagon sought to play down the scale of clashes between the two sides on Monday, after forces loyal to the central government in Baghdad rapidly took over nearly all of Kirkuk, and Kurdish forces abandoned their positions, retreating to nearby oilfields. Video footage showed streams of Kurdish refugees leaving Kirkuk in cars. Thousands of civilians returned to Kirkuk on Tuesday, a day after fleeing for fear of potential clashes. Baghdad’s move came three weeks after the referendum on Kurdish independence, which included the ethnically diverse city, a contentious move that Baghdad viewed as effective annexation. The peshmerga withdrawal delivered decisive military and political gains to Baghdad and a devastating blow to the Kurdish region’s de facto president, Massoud Barzani, who had staked much of his legacy on the referendum and aimed to use it as a stepping stone to consolidate Kurdish autonomy. The north-western town of Sinjar is infamous as the site of one of Islamic State’s worst atrocities. It killed thousands of Yazidi men and abducted thousands of women and girls as sex slaves in 2014. Tens of thousands of civilians fled into the nearby mountains in appalling conditions, helping to trigger US intervention against the jihadis. The Yazidis are Kurdish-speaking, but follow their own non-Muslim faith that earned them the hatred of the Sunni Muslim extremists of Isis. Following the 2014 exodus, many Yazidis volunteered to fight against Isis, either in their own militias or those sponsored by the Kurds or the Iraqi government. Hashed al-Shaabi, a paramilitary force made up largely of Shia militias trained by Iran said Yazidi fighters in its ranks had deployed in Sinjar. Kurdish forces took the town from Isis in 2015. Sinjar and Kirkuk form part of a swath of historically Kurdish-majority territory that the Kurds want to incorporate in their autonomous region in the north, against the wishes of Baghdad. The Kurds took over parts of the territory in 2014 when many units of the Iraqi army disintegrated in the face of the jihadis’ rapid advance through areas north and west of Baghdad.

Peters said on Tuesday that his board had been sent home and he had withdrawn his commitment to make a decision by the end of this week. The New Zealand First leader has instead held secret meetings with Labour’s Jacinda Ardern and the Nationals’ Bill English at parliament house in Wellington. The New Zealand Herald reported it saw Peters meet with Bill English straight after concluding meetings with his board late on Tuesday afternoon. A little while later the Herald reported seeing Ardern enter parliament via a secret entrance to meet with the NZ First leader as well. “We’ve got things to finish off as urgently as we can, sorting out differences of calculations and opinions and trying to make sure we’ve got, with both sides, a clear understanding,” Peters said in a press conference at parliament house in Wellington. “We’ve spent a couple of days on very comprehensive discussions and preparations for the party to make a final decision. The board’s engagement in terms of that work is complete. “We are going to try and press on and complete this decision as fast as possible.” Peters originally said he would make a decision by 12 October. When that deadline came and went, Peters changed it to the end of this week. Now it is unclear whether he will meet that deadline either. Previously, Peters said his board had the final say on which way NZ First would go. He convened the mysterious group of men and women from around the country to Wellington. Peters met with the board and his caucus on Monday and Tuesday, after spending all of last week in negotiations with Labour and National. None of the parties involved in discussions revealed any hint of which way Peters was expected to go and have scarcely spoken to media, though Labour’s deputy Kelvin Davis did say the negotiations had been “very nice”. Peters said all nine options of how the next government would look were still on the table. “We are 98% there on policy issues,” Peters said in a statement on Facebook, suggesting that only the final details of a deal were yet to be settled on, such as ministerial portfolios for NZ First MPs. After the 23 September election the National party was left with 56 seats and Labour 46 – both short of the 61 needed to form a government in the 120-seat parliament. NZ First has nine seats. The Green party, with eight seats, has thrown its support behind Labour. A National/NZ First government would have 65 seats, while a Labour/Greens/NZ First government would have 63 seats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/oct/17/uk-inflation-wage-squeeze-mark-carney-bank-of-england-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T16:30:53Z","webTitle":"Bank of England's Mark Carney says inflation hasn't peaked yet after hitting 3% today - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/oct/17/uk-inflation-wage-squeeze-mark-carney-bank-of-england-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/oct/17/uk-inflation-wage-squeeze-mark-carney-bank-of-england-live","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England's Mark Carney says inflation hasn't peaked yet after hitting 3% today - as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A down day for equities, with European markets mostly finishing lower. After edging towards another closing high, the FTSE 100 finally ended in the red despite a dip in the pound. Sterling suffered on continuing Brexit fears and following dovish comments from members of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. Elsewhere the main markets took a breather although Spain bucked the trend, with the Ibex recovering from its recent weakness in the wake of the row over Catalan independence. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 10.80 points or 0.14% at 7516.17 Germany’s Dax dipped 0.07% to 12,995.06 France’s Cac closed down 0.03% at 5361.37 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 0.4% to 22,337.78 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.35% at 10,216.8 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.51% to 761.82 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, having briefly moved above 23,000, is currently up 0.09% at 22,976. On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. The Dow above 23,000 was short-lived, for the moment at least. It is still up, but just 0.08% at 22,976. Commenting on the day’s rising stock markets, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global stocks have enjoyed another day of gains, with the now customary record highs in US indices this time driven by an outperformance in the banking sector. The dollar strengthened, with European currencies losing ground amid uncertainty fueled by Catalonia and Brexit. With the yen and gold losing ground, there is a clear shift into risk assets to the detriment of perceived havens. The latest US earnings season is underway, and US financials are heading higher in the wake of impressive figures from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. ..the impressive overall profitability in US banking does help instill confidence in an environment of rising rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has crossed 23,000 for the first time, as the surge in stock markets continues. The move comes not long after it breached the 22,000 barrier on 2 August. The comments from the Bank of England outweighed strong inflation figures as far as the pound is concerned, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Rate hike uncertainty spoiled what could have been an incredibly hawkish day for the pound, given that inflation hit a 5 year high of 3.0% in September. The Bank of England ended up distracting sterling from that alarmingly high CPI reading. New deputy governor Dave Ramsden was pretty dovish this morning, and while his MPC peer Silvana Tenreyro was slightly more open to a rate hike, she said any move is ‘very contingent on the data’ (which, at the moment, isn’t a great sign for sterling). BoE chief Mark Carney arguably dealt the biggest blow to the pound. Though the central bank head honcho said the MPC thinks a hike may be appropriate ‘in the coming months’, that comment potentially pushes the pulling of the interest rate trigger beyond the Bank of England’s next meeting in early November. That wasn’t all. Carney warned on the negative impact a ‘no deal’ Brexit would have on the economy, while stating that businesses are ‘less confident about a smooth transition’. The OECD also got involved, claiming a ‘disorderly’ Brexit would reduce Britain’s ‘long-term growth’. Combine that with the prospect of some miserable wage growth and retail sales figures on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, and some decent import prices and industrial production data from the US, and cable had a truly dreadful afternoon. The pound fell 0.7% against the dollar, sending it back towards $1.31; sterling fared a bit better against the euro, and even then it slipped 0.3%. The FTSE couldn’t squeeze too much growth out of this situation, with the UK index still stuck below 7550, a level its struggled to break for the past week. Here’s a chart from ING Bank showing UK inflation excluding the movements in the pound and oil price: Back with the pound: The outlook for US manufacturing looks upbeat even if the recent hurricanes have a negative effect on the short term figures, reckons James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank. Following the industrial production figures, he said: US Industrial production rose 0.3% month on month, in line with expectations. A two-tenths upward revision to August was also announced (-0.7% versus -0.9% originally reported). The details show that manufacturing output rose 0.1% month on month, utilities grew 1.5% month on month while mining was up 0.4% month on month. The Federal Reserve had suggested in advance of the report’s publication that the data would be liable to revision given a lack of information on which operations were back up and running after Hurricane Harvey while Hurricane Irma will have had a depressing effect on figures from Florida. Nonetheless, the outlook remains positive with manufacturing set to strengthen in coming months. The domestic story is encouraging with the ISM manufacturing headline figure at a 13 year high while the softer dollar (relative to last year) and strengthening foreign demand should support exports. Meanwhile, mining output should gradually move higher given rising oil prices and rig counts. Consequently, we look for the sector to make a meaningful contribution to fourth quarter GDP even if it has disappointed in third quarter through the hit from the storms. Over in the US, industrial production for September has edged up in line with forecasts. It rose 0.3% compared to a decline of 0.7% in August, itself revised up from an initial 0.9% fall. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added around 15 points or 0.07% in early trading to a new record high. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.5 points at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 3.44 points. The uncertain start came despite reasonable results from investment banking giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The pound is down around 0.5%, partly on the downbeat Brexit comments from the OECD and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. It has also been affected by Carney saying interest rates would rise in the months ahead, which was taken to mean not necessarily in November as expected, as well as dovish remarks from other members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee. The fall in sterling has given a lift to the FTSE 100, which has a large number of exporters who benefit from a weaker pound. The leading index is currently up 20 points or 0.28%. Time for a quick recap. Britain’s inflation rate has hit a new five-year high, taking another bite out of wages and bringing more pain for those relying on government benefits. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 3.0% in the 12 months to September, the highest level since early 2012. Food and transport costs were important factors behind the rise, which economists are blaming on the weak pound driving up import costs. The figures mean that the state pension is on track to rise by 3% next year, under the ‘triple-lock’ policy. It also means that real wages have continued to fall -- average earnings only rose by 2.1% in the three months to July; new labour market figures due tomorrow are unlikely to show much improvement. Bank of England governor Mark Carney predicted that inflation will probably rise higher in the next couple of months, before dipping back. Testifying to the Treasury committee, Carney warned that European states have not done as much work as the UK on the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. He also told MPs that firms are losing confidence that Brexit will proceed smoothly to a new trading arrangement. Carney also argued forcefully that a transition period, of at least two years, would help resolve issues such as Britain’s massive derivatives market. The rise in inflation could spur the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. But some City experts warn that this would harm the economy, and do little to bring down import prices. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says Mark Carney et al have a difficult decision: This has been a tricky year for the central bank, especially when considering how elevated inflation levels have squeezed household spending - impacting the outlook for the economy. With inflation leaving average earnings in the dust, consumers are feeling the pinch and as such, it threatens the sustainability of Britain’s consumer-driven growth. While the argument for higher rates is to put a lid on inflation, this may end up punishing the fragile UK economy. Union leaders have urged the government to raise public sector wages, which would help nurses, teachers, police officers et al to handle inflation. Liberal Democrat Leader Vince Cable agrees, saying: “The Brexit squeeze caused by the falling pound is getting worse, and it is hitting the poorest families hardest. “This above-target inflation is increasing the cost of the weekly shop and cutting into people’s living standards. “The Chancellor must end the benefits freeze that is set to leave millions of families hundreds of pounds poorer a year. Above all, the government must change course from a destructive Brexit that would damage living standards and push up prices further.” Here’s a clip of Mark Carney today, warning that inflation will probably rise further in October or November: And finally, governor Carney is asked about the Bank of England’s gender pay gap. He says Bank is planning to publish details next month. But he’s happy to give some top lines now. Namely... The median gender pay gap is 24% The mean pay gap is 21%. But, on an equal work for equal pay assessment, there is no gender pay gap. The gaps exists because there are more men at the top of the Bank than lower down the ranks, who are paid more. Carney insists the Bank is committed to improving diversity. He cites ‘blind’ recruitment panels, spreading the recruitment net beyond economists, hiring from 40 universities (up from just 10). If you start from a position of being almost exclusively a white male institution, you need to have a deliberate strategy of movement. In the end, the Bank expects to be in the “middle of the pack” for the financial services industry on gender, but near the top for the public sector. And that’s the end of the session. Back in the Thatcher Room, Mark Carney is invited to dwell on the benefits of Brexit.... The governor cited a few, including: The opportunity to negotiate trade deals focused on UK interests Tailoring regulations to focus on the specifics of the UK economy. The opportunity to step back and look at a host of wider issues, such as fiscal policy, the labour market, education policy. But, Parliament will have to decide the balance of those opportunities versus striking a transition deal and a new arrangement with the EU. Carney denies that the Bank’s quantitative easing programme, which has bought £425bn of bonds with newly created money, is the monetary equivalent of heroin. Breaking away from Mark Carney (and inflation), the Treasury has slapped down the OECD after it suggested that Britain could stay in the European Union. The Paris-based think tank argued this morning that Britain’s economy would get a boost if it chose not to follow through with Brexit. In its annual assessment of the UK, the OECD predicted that growth would slow in 2018 year and business investment fall. It also warned that a hard Brexit would “would hurt trading relationships and reduce long-term growth”. But there would be a “significant” boost if the Brexit vote was reversed, perhaps through a second referendum, it suggested. In response, the Treasury has insisted that the public won’t get a chance to change last June’s referendum result: ‘We are working to achieve the best deal with the EU that protects jobs and the economy. We aim to agree a Free Trade Agreement that is comprehensive and ambitious. Our £23 billion National Productivity Investment Fund which will improve our country’s infrastructure, increase research and development and build more houses. We are leaving the EU and there will not be a second referendum.’ The OECD’s report was presented to the press in London this morning, but chancellor Philip Hammond didn’t hang around long enough to take questions.... Q: Should fiscal policy be taking more of the strain to help the UK economy? Unsurprisingly, Mark Carney won’t be lured into commenting on tax and spending policies. We take fiscal policy as given, he insists, it’s not for us to advise the government. And on house prices, he says the housing market faces “structural problems” (ie, we’re not building enough new homes) but argues that prices aren’t in a bubble (reminder, they rose by 5% per year in August). He says the government’s Help to Buy hasn’t had a major impact on the market, either in terms of prices or stimulating a lot of new builds. The pound has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar since Mark Carney’s testimony began. Sterling may be suffering from the governor’s warnings about a no-deal Brexit Q: Does the Bank of England have a clue about why UK productivity is so weak? Carney says he does have a clue yes...and after more prodding from the committee he cites weak business investment and the wider impact of economic uncertainty. Q: The UK’s debt burden is growing, thanks to consumer credit products such as PCPs used to buy new cars. When will the bubble blow up? Carney argues that auto finance is not as serious as some claim. If someone walks away from a PCP plan then the debt falls on the car vendor - or in many cases the manufacturer of the car. He says banks are well-capitalised to handle a rise in bad debts. Q: When must a transition deal be agreed, before firms take matters into their own hands and trigger their contingency plans? Carney won’t commit to a fixed date, but says the issue is particularly urgent for the City. Q: How have businesses and consumers’ attitude to Brexit changed? Mark Carney indicates that UK firms have become “less confident about a smooth transition” and less confident about the end state of Brexit. Households are less worried, he says, At present, household expectations are broadly consistent with a smooth outcome to a future arrangement. But consumer confidence has fallen, partly due to lower real incomes (due to rising inflation). Carney adds that financial markets are the most concerned - they have already priced in a significant adjustment to the UK’s future prospects, and they may have to ‘mark up’ the UK’s future performance [if Brexit goes better than some fear]. Q: What preparations are you making for Brexit? Carney says the Bank of England has looked at worse-case scenarios, and what we can do to mitigate those risks. That includes making sure that banks are sufficiently capitalised to handle a very bad outcome. On the upside, the Bank could raise its growth forecasts if Britain agrees a “full, comprehensive, ambitious arrangement” with the rest of the EU. The Treasury committee are probing Mark Carney about how the trillions worth of derivatives contracts between the UK and other EU country members will be handled after Brexit. Mark Carney says this cannot be resolved if Britain crashes out without a deal. Q: Is a two-year transition period enough to resolve this problem? Carney says that the best solution would be legislation that would “grandfather those contracts”, so that they could continue to be honoured after Brexit. He also cites cross-border insurance (European companies and individuals who have taken out insurance from UK entities) and cross-border data concerns. And...he repeats his argument that a hard Brexit would hurt Europe more than the UK on these issues. There’s more data that is relevant to the EU in the UK than vice versa... These issues are bigger for Europe than they are for us, but they’re material for us. Bang on cue, Mark Carney argues that a ‘no-deal’ Brexit poses a threat to Europe’s financial stability. He tells the Treasury committee that Europe would be ‘short of financial services capacity’ in the short term, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. The entire economic impacts are greater for the UK, he says, but the financial stability impact is greater for the EU in the short term. Breaking: Britain faces long-term decline unless it secures “the closest possible economic relationship” with the European Union after Brexit. That’s according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD), in its annual healthcheck on the UK economy. More here: Carney argues that Britain and the EU will agree a transition deal, as avoiding a hard Brexit will be in everyone’s interests. Carney is asked about concerns that some banks aren’t ready for Britain’s departure from the EU in 2019. He replies that European-based institutions have done much less preparation than UK banks for the possibility of a hard exit from the EU without any transition deal. So we’re doing all those preparations for that. There has been much less of that done in the European Union, including by the member firms. Q: What would happen if the City of London’s euro clearing market moved abroad after Brexit? Carney warns that Europe’s real economy would suffer higher costs if the euro clearing market was fragmented [currently, trillions of pounds, euros, dollars and yen-based derivatives contracts are settled in London, under a system of clearing houses set up to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis] Q: So are you lobbying behind the scenes for talks on this issue to begin soon? Carney says the Bank of England would like the UK to have the go-ahead to start talks, with the BoE’s assistance when needed. And he insists that breaking up the derivatives market would mean that European car makers and pension funds, for example, would pay more for financial transactions. Carney also points out that the Bank of England is already trying to stimulate the economy: Q: With interest rates at just 0.25%, the UK doesn’t have much room to cut if there is a recession. Wouldn’t it be wise to raise borrowing costs to give the Bank more ammunition when needed? Carney isn’t at all convinced that this is a good idea. He explains to the committee that the Bank’s job is to keep inflation at 2% in the medium term. Raising rates today so you can cut them tomorrow wouldn’t really fit with that remit. As Carney puts it: Building a war chest in interest rate terms for a potential future shock, isn’t staying on point in terms of the inflation target, nor is it appropriate or necessary given that policy can move quite nimbly if required. Q: Are you concerned that the UK’s net international investment position has been revised down by £490bn (as reported by the Daily Telegraph yesterday)? Carney says that the stock of UK assets, as opposed to the flows, is quite healthy. He points out that Britain still owns a lot of assets in the rest of the world (but not as much as previously thought). And the fall in the pound actually improves that position. The UK owes a lot in sterling, and owns a lot in foreign currency assets. With the depreciation [of the pound] you get a positive move. Carney also warns that the “sustainable level” for Britain’s current account deficit (which is running a hefty deficit) will ultimately depend on the future trade relationship with Europe. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to the Treasury Committee now. It’s being streamed live, here. Q: Inflation has risen to 3% - only 0.1% away from the level when you must write a letter to the chancellor explaining why you have missed your target. Do you expect to write a letter soon? Carney says it is “more likely than not” that he will write to Philip Hammond in the next few months to explain why inflation is more than one percentage point away from 2%. He says the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote means inflation is likely to rise over 3% “in the coming weeks”. He reminds the committee that the Bank of England signalled prior to the referendum that the pound would be hit by a vote to leave the EU. We expected sterling to fall sharply. It did. That passes through to prices.... The sole reason that inflation has gone up as much as it has is the depreciation of sterling. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you’d expect, there’s an at-a-glance agenda of the day’s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Here’s our economics editor, Larry Elliott, on today’s inflation report: Britain’s pensioners will receive a 3% increase in their state income next year after the annual inflation rate reached its highest level since early 2012 last month. The 12-month increase in the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) edged up from 2.9% to 3% - in line with recent Bank of England forecasts. Any further increase would force Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond explaining why inflation was not being kept to its 2% target. The City expects the Bank’s monetary policy committee to raise interest rates next month for the first time in more than a decade. Inflation has risen from 1% to 3% over the past year, largely due to the fall in the value of the pound, which has made imports dearer. The Office for National Statistics said the cost of fuel and raw materials for industry were up by 8.4% on a year ago compared with a 7.6% increase in the 12 months to August. It said more expensive food and a smaller fall in air fares than a year ago were the main factors explaining higher inflation, although clothes had come down in price. The pick-up in inflation means the state pension will rise by at least 3% next year because the so-called triple lock means it rises by the September inflation rate, the September increase in annual earnings or 2.5%. Annual earnings are currently rising by just over 2%. More here: Back in parliament, new Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro has been quizzed by the Treasury committee. Tenreyro told MPs that she could vote for an interest rate rise in the coming months, but only if the data justified it. She said evidence from US studies of interest rate hikes and cuts showed that a premature move to increase the cost of borrowing “can be costly”. [Studies show that] if it turns out to be a mistake it will require a lot more cuts in the future in order to recover that lost ground” Tenreyo is among the majority of MPC members who would vote for a rate hike in the coming months, as articulated at their last meeting in September. But she may hold back from voting to raise rates if the data paints a weaker picture of the economy. “My position now is that if the data outturns are consistent with the picture i’ve just described, of an output gap going towards zero, then i would be minded to vote for a bank rate increase in the coming months. However that’s very contingent, and i should be clear, on the data outturns. If the data undershoots and the data are not in line with those expectations then i will wait until i see further evidence of that output gap being eroded.” Tenreyo also thinks the UK is some way from removing its package of quantitative easing support for the economy. “We are still far from that point at which we will start unwinding given that the bank rate is so low.” Tenreyro also told MPs that her experience growing up in Argentina would be valuable. That raised some eyebrows..... hopefully the UK won’t be turning to the IMF anytime soon..... Labour MP Angela Rayner tweets: The well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies makes in important point. The rise in inflation means the government’s policy of freezing benefits is causing more pain than anticipated. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, says the whole policy is discredited. Could Philip Hammond make changes in next month’s budget? It’s possible, but the problem is that letting benefits rise in line with inflation would cost money. And the chancellor doesn’t have much of a war chest to play with... In other news, UK house price inflation has picked up -- but not in London. Average house prices in the UK rose by 5.0% in the year to August 2017, up from 4.5% in July 2017. However, prices in the capital actually fell during the month, and are only 2.4% higher than a year ago. That might help some younger people to get onto the housing market (although the average London house price is still £484,000). Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC, points out that prices in the financial district have taken a serious knock. The uncertainty over Brexit may be felt more keenly in London than other areas due to the importance of international businesses. Figures from the City of London borough bear this out where prices are down 18.4% compared to a year ago. Amit Kara of the NIESR thinktank warns that UK inflation could keep rising in the next few months: Newsflash: The Bank of England’s newest deputy governor has revealed that he isn’t one of the policymakers who believe interest rates need to rise soon. Sir Dave Ramsden has told the Treasury Committee that he wasn’t among the majority at last month’s meeting who said that they were close to voting for a hike. Instead, Ramsden took the view that the UK economy was ready for higher borrowing costs. The majority of MPC members saw a case for removing some of the monetary stimulus in the coming months. I wasn’t in that majority. This was my first ever MPC member as a voter. I wasn’t in a position where I was part of that majority that thought - the way the degree of slack was diminishing, the way trade off between slack and higher inflation was disappearing - was sufficient to give that signal. Scotiabank also blame the weak pound for driving inflation up: It’s clear that the slump in the pound after last year’s EU referendum is the main factor driving UK inflation up. These charts show how the cost of goods has spiked over the last year. Britain is a net importer of actual stuff, so a weaker pound means it’s simply more expensive to bring raw materials and finished products into the country. In contrast, the eurozone’s inflation rate was just 1.5% in September, meaning most Europeans should be enjoying real wage rises. Open Britain, the campaign group against a Hard Brexit, argues that Britain can’t afford to lose full access to the Single Market. Nick Dixon, investment director at Aegon, fears that the pound could suffer fresh losses if Britain and Brussels don’t achieve progress in the Brexit taslks. While there are signs of a slowing economy, with sterling still at risk as Brexit negotiations remain inconclusive the British economy remains vulnerable to further inflationary forces. UNISON, the public sector union, argues that the government needs to produce a ‘decent pay rise’ to make up for years of austerity. General secretary Dave Prentis says: “There’s no light at the end of the tunnel for public service workers. Unfunded, below-inflation pay awards are apparently the best the government has to offer. “All public servants have seen the value of their pay fall year on year. They need a decent pay rise that more than matches the rising cost of living.” The Treasury has responded to today’s inflation figures, arguing that the government is helping where it can... “We understand that families are feeling the effects of inflation and we are helping them with their living costs. We’ve frozen fuel duty, doubled free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and cut income tax for 30 million people. Increases to the National Living Wage are also delivering the fastest pay rise for the lowest paid in 20 years.”. The Resolution Foundation points out that UK welfare benefits are NOT rising in line with inflation (unlike pensions...). This means that the poorest in our communities will find it even harder to get by next year, even if they are in work. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, warns that rising inflation will eat into our Christmas budgets: “We’re now starting to feel the real impact of Brexit on our wallets. With inflation at a five-year high there’s no escaping the fact that the luxury of low inflation is well and truly over with prices of goods and services rising left right and centre and the shiny new pounds in our pockets will unfortunately buy you less. “Your household budget will be stretched as the cost of transport is creeping up and the price of fuel and food is also on the up. The cost of your supermarket shop is rising too so you must act now to protect yourself from future struggles. “Prices are rising faster than earnings and we are heading into one of the most expensive times of year – Christmas, so budgeting is key.” Britain’s pensioners are the big winners from today’s inflation report, thanks to the triple-lock that guarantees that their pensions won’t lag behind prices. So argues Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. She writes: “Life is getting much more expensive with an increase in the cost of food, fuel and a last-minute price spike in flights all contributing to the rise in inflation. Meanwhile, our pay packets have stagnated with wage growth falling behind inflation, despite UK unemployment being at a record low. “It’s also worth noting that September’s inflation figure matters hugely to both retirees and savers. Under the government’s ‘triple lock’ guarantee, the state pension will rise in April each year by whichever number is the highest out of the September CPI inflation number, average earnings or 2.5%. With inflation running higher than either wages or 2.5%, this will be determine the rise in the State Pension next year, arguably making retirees the biggest winners from today’s inflation figure. The Federation of Small Businesses is aghast that its members face a 3.9% increase in business rates next year, thanks to today’s RPI inflation report (details here) Mike Cherry, the FSB’s national chairman, says UK firms have suffered enough, following the controversial revaluation process that send some bills spiralling higher. Today’s RPI figure follows six months of business rates misery for our small business community. Since April’s bruising revaluation we’ve had the staircase tax, introduction of an unworkable appeals platform and chronic delays to the Chancellor’s £435 million relief package. A near four per cent bill increase next April, on top of losing year one transitional caps, will be the last straw for many. The TUC, which represents millions of British workers, says the government needs to respond to the ongoing wage squeeze that is hurting UK households. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The government needs to face up to Britain’s cost of living crisis. The squeeze on household budgets is getting tighter by the month. “The Chancellor must use November’s Budget to ease the pressure on hard-pressed families. “That means giving five million public sector workers the pay rise they have earned. “Prices are sky-rocketing. Offering hard-working public servants below-inflation increases would amount to yet another real-terms pay cut.” She also argues that the Bank of England should not raise interest rates from their current alltime low of 0.25% “Raising interest rates now would be a big mistake. The UK economy is simply not strong enough. “We need to get wages rising before we start think about hiking rates.” This is one of the most depressing charts in UK economics today -- showing how UK workers’ pay packets are shrinking in real terms. As you can see, its the second wage squeeze in a decade. The retail prices index, another measure of inflation, rose by 3.9% in September. That means that UK firms face a 3.9% rise in their business rates next year, under the current system. It could also drive up costs for motorists. Rising food prices helped to drive UK inflation to a five-year high of 3.0% in September. The Office for National Statistics says: The rate of 2.6% for recreation and culture is the highest since January 2010, whilst the rate of 3.1% for food and non-alcoholic beverages is the highest since October 2013.... Housing and household services costs were the biggest single factor driving the cost of living up, the ONS adds, partly due to utility bills. This chart shows how UK inflation has risen sharply, to its highest level since April 2012 Breaking! Britain’s inflation rate has hit a new five and a half-year high. The consumer prices index jumped by 3.0% in September, up from August’s 2.9%. That’s the highest reading since early 2012. This means that British workers are still suffering a pay squeeze, as average wages only rose by 2.1% per year in the three months to July. But I think it’s better news for pensioners, who can look forward to a 3% increase in the basic state pension next April. Under the triple-lock system, pensions rise in line with earnings growth, September’s CPI reading, or by 2.5%, whichever number is biggest. More to follow! A reminder of why today’s inflation reading is particularly important: Analysts at HSBC reckon the UK’s inflation rate jumped to 3.1% last month: Yikes! Shares in entertainment group Merlin have slumped by 20% in early trading. Merlin has shocked the City by warning it suffered “difficult trading conditions” over the summer. The company, which runs Alton Towers, Madame Tussauds and the London Eye, said terrorism was partly to blame: The spate of terror attacks witnessed in the UK marked an inflection point in Midway London and UK theme park trading. Poor weather in Northern Europe and extreme weather in Italy and Florida also impacted peak season trading. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted some handy graphs on UK inflation, ahead of this morning’s data in 30 minutes time. This one shows how inflation typically tracks moves in the value of the pound (but roughly two years later) This chart shows how the oil price influences the cost of living: Sterling is inching higher this morning, as City traders anticipate UK inflation hitting its highest levels since 2012. The pound has gained almost half a eurocent against the euro, to €1.2175. It’s also up a more modest 0.1% against the US dollar, at $1.3263. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Despite last night’s meeting between Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker (and David Davis and Michel Barnier) producing nothing more than vague promise to ‘accelerate’ negotiations, the pound is on the rise this Tuesday. That’s because investors are eagerly awaiting September’s inflation reading, which is set to see the consumer price index finally hit a 5 year high of 3.0%. Such a reading would put even more pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, though that hawkish urge may be tempered by the continued fall in real wages (set to be confirmed tomorrow) and a sharp month-on-month drop in retail sales (coming on Thursday). Two years ago, CPI inflation was actually negative, at -0.1%. That was partly to falling oil prices, which delivered cheaper petrol, and price wars between UK supermarkets. But, as this chart shows, the inflation rate inched higher in late 2015 and early 2016 - and then accelerated sharply once the pound slumped after the Brexit vote. Higher petrol prices and utility bills probably drove UK inflation up in September. Airline ticket prices could also push the consumer prices index up to 3%. That’s partly Ryanair’s fault; customers scrambled to buy new flights after it cancelled thousands of trips last month. Food, clothing and footwear are all ‘wild cards’ that could push inflation over 3%, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain’s inflation rate could hit a new five-year high this morning, hitting people in the pocket and putting more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates in November. City economists predict that inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, jumped to 3.0% in September. That would be an increase on August’s 2.9%, and the highest level since spring 2012. If so, this would be the latest proof that the fall in the pound since last year’s Brexit vote is pushing up prices and hurting households and businesses. It would also mean that prices are rising faster than earnings. The average pay packet only grew by 2.1% over the last year, meaning that real wages are falling. Finn McLaughlin of Capital Economics says: We expect that CPI inflation (09.30 BST) rose from 2.9% in August to 3% in September, intensifying the real wage squeeze. That said, we suspect inflation is now not far from its eventual peak. We think that it will rise to about 3.2% before year-end. Today’s inflation figures are particularly important as they’ll be used to set next year’s pensions rises (under the UK’s ‘triple lock’, pensions rise in line with wages, prices, or 2.5% - whichever is higher). The retail prices index, another measure of inflation, will be used to set next year’s business rates. It is expected to rise to 4% today, which would mean a 4% rise in business rates for UK firms. If CPI rises by 3.1% or more, then the Bank of England will have to write to the government explaining why it’s not keeping inflation close to its 2% target. With excellent timing, BoE governor Mark Carney and colleagues are testifying to MPs on the Treasury this morning, so we’ll see what they say about inflation, Brexit, and the state of the economy. Also coming up today: The row between aircraft makers Boeing and Bombardier has taken a dramatic turn overnight; Airbus, the European consortium, is taking a controlling stake in Bombardier’s C Series business. That division, which employs thousands in Northern Ireland, was hit with US tariffs totalling 300% last month following a complaint from Boeing. Could this deal protect jobs? We’ll bring you more details as they come in Theme park operator Merlin Entertainment, online fashion retailer ASOS and model toy maker Hornby are all reporting results this morning too.

But it is we who have failed it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At the turn of the millennium, I joined thousands in the streets of Metro Manila to demand the ouster of President Joseph Estrada. His allies in the legislature had been gleefully scuppering his deserved impeachment. In response, Filipinos flooded Edsa, the highway where 15 years earlier the People Power Revolution had peacefully toppled our dictator, Ferdinand Marcos. That protest was my first. A politician’s son, I’d remained rebelliously apolitical well into my 20s, but Estrada’s impunity was unacceptable. His corruption was legendary, and months earlier his son’s bodyguards had pulled me from my car and beaten me when I refused to make way for their convoy. That’s how I learned that politics is always ultimately personal. The Philippines is Asia’s oldest democracy but dynasties have made a sham of it, divvying up a vast majority of public positions. That partly explains why we Filipinos distrust constitutional procedures and turn to our so-called parliament of the streets to remove malignant leaders. But last month, on the 45th anniversary of Marcos’s declaration of military rule, it became clear that populism is now confused with democracy, with the former used by the powerful to the detriment of the latter. On 21 September, facing anger at the violence that recently included teenagers killed allegedly by police, President Rodrigo Duterte suspended work and school and invited Filipinos to participate in what he co-opted as a National Day of Protest. Across the country rallies were organised, either for or against the decisions and actions of Duterte’s 16-month rule. Once again I was among thousands in the streets, this time in a tacit battle for legitimacy of incumbency and ideas. The Duterte administration has been characterised by contentious strategies: an allegiance with the Marcos family, a hero’s reinterment for the dictator, threats of martial law, attacks on opposition figures, empowerment of a new passel of oligarchs, a collaborationist stance with a bellicose China, and thousands killed in the infamous drug war that has set aside due process and human rights. Many Filipinos disagree on whether these are necessary or unacceptable, laudable or condemnable. At separate rallies on the National Day of Protest, supporters for Duterte emphasised the democratic validation for his disciplinarian style, warned of destabilisation plots, and explained that those killed deserved their comeuppance as criminals. Those who oppose Duterte demanded justice and due process, criticised his family’s alleged links to corruption and drug smuggling, and stood against authoritarian efforts to remove the heads of constitutional bodies mandated to keep all presidents in check. It is estimated that the protests brought roughly 20,000 people into the streets of the capital. In the days following, the war of public opinion returned predictably online – where it’s been waged constantly in the interims between rallies and polls. On social media, much was made of each side’s turnout on the day, because in our notoriously machismo Philippine politics, size matters – especially when it comes to crowds. Accusations of paid protestors proliferated, conduct of protesters was criticised, and each side mocked the other for failing to bring out as many as they had predicted. What’s important, if unsurprising, is how social media activity has mirrored, and even replaced, such real-life activism. Indeed, social media popularity is now touted as imprimatur. Those who back Duterte, and his allies such as the Marcos family, take great pride in the numbers of followers, likes, and shares received by the more vociferous supporters – a reflection, it’s implied, of the president’s own popularity, particularly among grassroots citizens said to be outsiders from the mainstream media. Those who oppose Duterte and his allies, however, claim that troll farms and algorithmic bots swell the numbers artificially. Indeed, a study by Oxford university found that Duterte spent a sizeable amount of campaign funds on hundreds of cyber troops who spread propaganda, created fake news sites and false articles, and focused attacks on dissenters. (To these allegations, Duterte called Oxford “a school for stupid people.”) Amid such polarised discourse – if it can be called discourse – rises an alarming fact. Mustering the crowd that is perceived to be larger, whether in the streets or online, is no longer simply a show of support for those whom we elect to lead us. It’s become an effort to control legitimacy, the factuality of history, the morality of extralegal actions, and the very definition of right and wrong. Democracy in the Philippines has always been tenuous – troubled by questionable elections, intoxicated by the parliament of the streets, spun by the carousel of a powerful few. Having lost our faith, we citizens no longer look to democracy as a system of checks and balances that prevents abuse and protects the minority. Our rulers have turned it into a rubber stamp to validate their reign. And while we citizens now take politics personally, it’s not in the way we should. Pitted against each other churlishly, we are less participants in civic society than a mob divided and roused to socialise without civility. The system stymies us, so we seek salvation from political personalities rather than each other. At my first protest, those many years ago, I believed our democracy had failed and we were doing good by working outside the law to buttress a better leader. Populism always believes its righteousness, blind to its wrongfulness. But hindsight, with its infinite pathos, proves that it was not our democracy that failed us, it is we who failed our democracy. And we may yet again, if we again let ourselves be used.

But the emissions reduction trajectory, the most internally sensitive component of the reform, will require new legislation, and the government has been advised to implement the new scheme with the support of state governments passing complementary laws – which could render Turnbull’s reworked proposal dead on arrival. While the government characterised its new energy guarantee as a “game changer”, Labor quickly blasted the decision to dump the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel. A handful of government MPs, including Tony Abbott, expressed objections to the emissions reduction element of the overhaul during party room debate. Labor has also zeroed in on the price aspects of the scheme. The government contends its new energy framework will lower prices for households by between $100 and $115 per year, but the opposition suggests those estimates are rubbery, given serious modelling has not yet been undertaken. After months of internal controversy, the government on Tuesday dumped the clean energy target favoured by Finkel in favour of a new “national energy guarantee” which will impose a reliability and emissions reduction guarantee on retailers and some large energy users. With Coalition conservatives fiercely opposing the Finkel clean energy target on the basis it would provide ongoing subsidies to renewable energy, the prime minister and the energy minister have sold the policy internally as an end to picking winners, and the beginning of technological neutrality. The new rules would oblige retailers to meet a percentage of their load requirements with flexible and dispatchable power resources which can be scheduled by the energy market operator depending on the requirements of the system. The emissions reduction obligation, like the reliability requirement, will require retailers to enter into contracts for the supply of energy at a certain emissions level. If retailers don’t meet their new obligations on a persistent basis, the penalty is market deregistration. The government says the new emissions reduction target for electricity will likely be 26% on 2005 levels by 2030. But if that’s where the target is ultimately set, that will require other sectors of the economy to do most of the heavy lifting if Australia is to have any hope of meeting our target under the Paris climate agreement. Heavy emitters exposed to international competition will be excluded from the emissions reduction obligation, and speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the prime minister said there was “potential for back-ending a fair bit” of the emissions reduction task for electricity because of declining costs. As foreshadowed by Guardian Australia, retailers will also be able to use international permits to help meet their abatement obligations. The existing federal renewable energy target will peak in 2020 and run through to 2030, with projects grandfathered, which means the existing rules and frameworks continue to apply until the scheme wraps. During Tuesday’s party room discussion, Tony Abbott, Matt Canavan, David Gillespie and George Christensen raised concerns about the policy, and Abbott argued that the government should delay any decision. Given there was some dissent, Turnbull asked MPs whether they wanted to continue the discussion later in the afternoon or next week – but the overwhelming view in the party room was to settle the issue by agreement on Tuesday. The government has elevated electricity prices to the centre of the political debate, and is claiming positive price impacts as a consequence of the energy guarantee when compared with the impact of Finkel’s clean energy target. The Energy Security Board, which is a regulatory body set up by the Council of Australian Governments (Coag) to implement the Finkel review, has told the government the guarantee “could lead to a reduction in residential bills in the order of $100 to $115 per annum over the 2020-2030 period”. It contends an end to the policy uncertainty will prompt a reduction in wholesale prices of 20% to 25% a year over the same period. But John Pierce, the chair of the Australian Energy Market Commission, made it clear the figure was based on only preliminary analysis. He said more detailed analysis would be carried out in the lead-up to the Coag meeting in November. He said “firmer estimates of those price effects” would be provided later in the year. In question time on Tuesday, Labor asked Turnbull whether the Energy Security Board had provided lower figures to the government about the level of household savings associated with the policy. The prime minister said the “only information I have” was the $100 to $115 figure, and he rounded on Labor for pursuing the question. “The leader of the opposition is impugning the integrity of the members of the Energy Security Board,” the prime minister said. Australia’s energy sector says no policy solution will fix the current problems unless there is bipartisan support for the reforms to create certainty for investors. Labor is reserving its position on the package. The shadow climate minister, Mark Butler, said the government’s new framework was thin on detail, lacked proper modelling, and was little more than “bare bones”. Butler said the government has presided over an “utterly shambolic process”. Finkel was more diplomatic. He told reporters he had been consulted on the government’s alternative proposal at a late stage, and he had not seen any economic modelling underpinning the national energy guarantee. But Finkel gave the proposal, cautious endorsement, suggesting the approach was “logical” and would likely to have a similar price impact to the clean energy target modelled in his review. Two Labor premiers, Jay Weatherill and Daniel Andrews, were negative about the Turnbull plan. The attitude of the states is crucial to whether or not it can be rolled out without significant controversy. The issue will come before Coag formally in November. While Turnbull emerged with the backing of the party room, the dissidents are also likely to continue their efforts to generate controversy over the emissions reduction commitments, and it is unclear whether some MPs would support legislation establishing a target for the electricity sector. Business groups and the energy retailer AGL gave the proposal cautious backing, but pointed to the need for bipartisanship. The chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, Jennifer Westacott, said the plan might be a better option than the clean energy target if it was “well implemented”. The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said the proposal “offers a plausible new direction for energy policy with a welcome focus on energy security”. But he cautioned “further work will be needed by all concerned to help significantly drive down energy prices for hard-pressed domestic and industrial energy users”. “The government will need to consult deeply with industry, the community, the states and the opposition to make this approach a success, but we are hopeful that cooperation is possible to achieve lower prices, maintain reliability and meet Australia’s emissions commitments.” Tony Wood, energy analyst with the Grattan Institute, gave the proposal strong support. “The Turnbull government’s long-awaited national energy guarantee should be supported, not only within the Coalition but by Labor, the states, the energy industry and by electricity consumers,” Wood said in a column for the Australian Financial Review. “It should be supported within the Coalition because it will reduce electricity prices, maintain reliable supply and meet Australia’s international commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” “It will do this without subsidies for renewable energy and without excluding coal. Indeed, this policy provides a case for maintaining existing coal generators through increasing their efficiency and reducing their emissions.” “The policy should be supported by Labor because it will deliver an environmental outcome as good as the clean energy target recommended by chief scientist Alan Finkel – and it can be scaled up by any future Labor government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/17/the-guardian-essential-report-17-october-results","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T01:27:45Z","webTitle":"The Guardian Essential Report, 17 October results","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/17/the-guardian-essential-report-17-october-results","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/17/the-guardian-essential-report-17-october-results","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian Essential Report, 17 October results","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/17/tuesday-briefing-hard-brexit-and-the-hip-pocket","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T05:37:39Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Hard Brexit and the hip pocket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/tuesday-briefing-hard-brexit-and-the-hip-pocket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/17/tuesday-briefing-hard-brexit-and-the-hip-pocket","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Hard Brexit and the hip pocket","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top story: Poor would pay most for no-deal Brexit Hello, it’s Warren Murray with your first bite of the news this morning. A no-deal Brexit would rip about £260 a year from the average UK household budget, analysis predicts. The Resolution Foundation and Sussex University academics say “just about managing” families in the UK’s poorer regions have the most to lose from trade negotiations failing, with significant price rises forecast on a range of goods, including 8% for dairy products and 6% for meat, while car prices would jump 5.5%. The study found that the impact of rising prices would add 1.1% to the cost of living for the poorest 20% of households, against 0.8% for the richest 20%. Inflation is expected by the City to hit a five-year high of 3% when official figures are released today. Meanwhile, Theresa May has been rebuffed by EU leaders over an attempt to smooth over differences. The PM came away from a dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier having made no apparent inroads on opening negotiations for a transitional Brexit deal. Citizens’ rights, the Irish border and the divorce bill remain the nagging issues on which Brussels is demanding progress before talks about future trade and easing Britain’s exit from the bloc.And if rebel Conservative MPs get their way, Britain will not leave the EU in the spring of 2019 without first securing a proper transitional deal and holding a binding parliamentary vote. They are lining up with Labour and Lib Dem MPs to take advantage of delays with the government’s Brexit bill – shoring up support for amendments that the Labour MP Chukka Umunna said would “ensure we do not jump off a cliff and withdraw from the EU in a job-destroying way”. * * * ‘One-woman WikiLeaks’ slain – There’s been shock and condemnation after a crusading journalist in Malta was killed by a car bomb. Daphne Caruana Galizia led the Panama Papers investigation into corruption in Malta and wrote scathing blogposts about abuse of power and corruption involving the country’s political leaders, social establishment and underworld. She had complained to police about threats against her life in the weeks before her Peugeot 108 was blown apart near her home on Monday. Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, one of Caruana Galizia’s chief targets, said: “Everyone knows Ms Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of mine both politically and personally, but nobody can justify this barbaric act in any way”. Muscat has called in the FBI to help with the investigation. A candlelit vigil was held last night – “Her life was not for nothing,” said family friend Luke Frendo. * * * ‘Very gusty’ day ahead – Scotland, Wales and northern England are waking up to the continued effects of Storm Ophelia following three deaths in Ireland, which bore the brunt of the ex-hurricane. Flood warnings are in place on Scotland’s west coast this morning amid predicted gusts of up to 70mph. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, described Ophelia’s impact as a “national emergency” that forced the closure of schools and colleges and brought the transport network to a standstill on Monday. Three people were killed in accidents involving falling trees. The effects were also felt in Northern Ireland with road closures and power cuts. Bill Clinton was kept away from a meeting with Stormont politicians to try and restore power-sharing. A yellow weather warning for wind covering Northern Ireland, southern and central Scotland, the north of England and north-west Wales is in place until this afternoon. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said commuters should expect “very gusty conditions”, with winds of up to 70mph. He said: “The strong winds will continue but should moderate a little bit compared to what we have seen.” * * * Catalonia crackdown – Two Catalan secessionists are being held without bail and investigated for alleged sedition as Spanish authorities signal a hardening of their stance following the region’s unauthorised independence vote. Prosecutors blame Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart for pro-independence protests that trapped national police inside a Barcelona building and destroyed their vehicles. The Catalan regional president, Carles Puigdemont, said they were civil society leaders being held as “political prisoners”. The high court has also seized the Catalan police chief’s passport as Madrid threatens to impose direct rule unless Puigdemont disavows any claim that the referendum means Catalonia is independent. * * * Heavy metal hit – You might have heard by now about the collision of two dead stars and the gravity waves it threw out. But did you know that atom-smashing cataclysms like this are probably how gold is made? We’re used to huge distances and colossal sizes being bandied about when it comes to cosmic phenomena, but in this case the measurements and times involved seem very much on an earthly scale: these neutron stars were each around 12 miles across, and only about 200 miles apart before they spiralled into each other in under two minutes. Dr Stuart Clark delves into what we learn from our newfound ability to observe such events. * * * Themselves to tank – When a New Zealand town was left without a petrol station, its residents came up with a solution: build their own. Now, people in tiny Pongoroa no longer have to drive a 120-mile round trip lugging jerrycans to keep their cars running. It’s a positive story from a place where, according to one local, “community spirit is oozing out of the ground – there is a local joke that there are more committees than there are residents in Pongoroa”.

His flock live in a Texas town that hasn’t had running water in 30 years and the donated bottled water they rely upon is in short supply. “We got six cases of water from a donor but two have already gone in the last hour,” said Keahey, eyeing the line of people waiting for their weekly handout of food and water from the Mount Zion Baptist church in Sandbranch, a largely African American community that lies 20 minutes and a world away from Dallas. Recent hurricanes in Texas and Florida have diverted the attention of non-profits away from the sisyphean struggle endured in Sandbranch. “I’m going to have to come up with a plan, get on Facebook and beg or borrow water from somewhere,” said Keahey. “People come for donations from outside the town and it’s difficult to say, ‘No you can’t get water because you’ve got running water at home.’ My test is to say ‘What do you do with the bottled water?’ If they just say they drink it, I have to say no because people here shower, brush their teeth with it, everything.” Keahey, a stout man with a greying beard and half-moon glasses, rubbed his face. “This is a full-time job. It’s not part time. Water is like gold here.” Sandbranch has no water pipes, sewerage, trash collection or street lights. In an added dash of irony, the sprawling Dallas Southside water treatment plant is situated about 10 yards from Sandbranch, its rusting barbed wire fence running along the northern boundary of the town. The slow, dry decay of Sandbranch is startling but little known even among the Dallasites who neighbor this crumbling enclave that extends off a quiet stretch of looping highway to the south of the metropolis. The population once stood at more than 500, dwindled to less than 100 by 2010 but has anecdotally rebounded with some newcomers attracted by the cheap land. “Everyone around us has water but not here,” said Detra Newhouse, a 46-year-old who grew up in Sandbranch with her grandparents. “For a while people didn’t even bathe. Some still don’t. There’s a man who lives nearby and I don’t think he’s had a proper bath in 20 years. “We are a dirty little secret no one wants to talk about. I was listening to MSNBC talk about Flint, Michigan, the other day and what is happening there is unconscionable. But I thought, ‘Yeah, and what about us? What about us?’” Many residents are at a loss as to why they have been forgotten. Officially, Sandbranch’s woes stem from being small, unincorporated and situated on a floodplain area that restricts new development. But the fact that low-income minority areas in the US are often blighted by environmental problems, whether it’s tainted water or toxic air from nearby industrial plants, is well understood here. Sandbranch is a jarring example of environmental injustices that have pockmarked the US for decades. “We don’t have water here and you know why?” asked Ivory Hall, a spry 83-year-old black man who deftly slaps my arm as he makes his point. “The pigment of my skin. If I were white like you I bet they’d have water down here.” Newhouse easily draws upon fonder Sandbranch memories; of collecting eggs from the chickens at the back of the house, hanging upside down in trees, getting penny candies from the corner store, playing in the then unpaved streets with other children until the dark finally forced them indoors. There was a well at her grandparent’s house and the children would press their mouths to the nozzle of the pump and gleefully guzzle the water. “It was so refreshing and it was so cool,” Newhouse said. “I had the best childhood ever.” By the mid-1980s, Newhouse had moved in with her parents in Dallas and noticed a difference in the well water when she visited Sandbranch. The liquid was brown, laced with sand. It emitted a nauseating smell. “I got used to being able to fill up a cup of water and drink it but then I’d go to Sandbranch and have to stop and think, ‘I can’t do that – I could die,’” she said. Later, as an adult, Newhouse’s job required trips to India, where it became clear she had diverged from the American norm. “Places like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore – you wouldn’t dare drink the water there,” she said. “I thought, ‘Dang, we are living like India. I’m living like an Indian woman.’” Sandbranch is an unincorporated town - an area not serviced by a municipality - that Dallas County dates back to 1940, although in previous decades properties were established by African Americans lured by cheap land and the opportunity to elude the various indignities inflicted by the white bastion of Dallas. Water pipes were never installed and, like some other unincorporated places, the lack of trash collection means residents have to surreptitiously burn their garbage or take it to relatives in the city. These were tolerable quirks when Sandbranch had a supply of clean groundwater but the wells are now tainted and now either rot or are sparingly used for washing a car or, for those prepared to risk it, a bracing shower. Testing in the 1980s and early 1990s confirmed bacterial contamination of the water. The Sandbranch populace points the finger at gravel mining that has scarred the fringes of the town. Dallas County can’t be sure of the culprit but suggests the widespread keeping of hogs, now banned, created rivers of waste that poisoned the water table. Whatever the cause, the pollution forced residents to trek several miles to buy bottled water or fill up jugs at relatives’ houses. As poverty has tightened its grip on Sandbranch – the average monthly income is now $720 – most people cannot afford to buy an endless supply of bottled water and now lean heavily on the church’s donations. Richard Shivers, a white 59-year-old man who walks with a slight limp, bought a parcel of land last year for a few thousand dollars and moved his trailer to live there with his wife Rachel Garcia and a menagerie of animals, including at least a dozen dogs and cats, a couple of pigs, five donkeys and a brood of chickens. Shivers pays a neighbor $50 a month to use his pump to fill five barrels with water, which he transports back in a sagging van, found next to two other dilapidated vehicles on the land, a former hog farm. He said he not only showers in the water, but also drinks it. “Some people don’t understand how we do it, but I know how to survive,” he said, scooping fetid water from one of the barrels with a grimy hand and offering it to me. “It’s clean. Taste it. I’m serious – taste it.” The Guardian declines the offer. Mount Zion Baptist church is a modest but tidy place of worship with a pitched roof and one of the few functional toilets in Sandbranch. It has a 325-gallon water tank outside for donated water and on Saturdays is transformed into a sort of community triage center, distributing foodstuffs while volunteer nurses from the Texas Woman’s University gather around a fold-out table to offer free blood pressure checks. “It’s a unique environment,” said Keahey, who gave up a rather more comfortable pastorship in Dallas to grapple with Sandbranch’s stubborn maladies. His wife was raised in Flint. “We are the water crisis family,” he said with a chuckle. “You don’t really expect to see these living conditions next to one of America’s wealthiest cities.” Sandbranch has never been financially viable enough for the city of Dallas to subsume and provide water and, in any case, the town sits on a floodplain which, since the 1970s, has pinioned it with federal rules that limit development. The oldest houses have been grandfathered but no new properties are allowed unless they can be elevated on stilts above the flood risk level, to around 10ft. Sandbranch doesn’t have the heft of city services, and the freewheeling nature of being unincorporated is nullified by the federal floodplain rules that limit its growth and therefore tax base. It’s a bind that acted as a slowly tightening ligature around the town for decades. “We looked at it and thought something could be done but it’s a Rubik’s cube and we haven’t been able to line up all the colors on one side,” said Rick Loessberg, who has been planning director at Dallas County for the past 20 years. The county provides roads, signage and law enforcement but doesn’t provide water infrastructure. Loessberg said the county looked at creating a new water utility for Sandbranch the 1990s but no one in the town wanted to run it. The well water can’t be cleansed of its pollution. And the county doesn’t see its role as paying for bottled water. Sandbranch’s decline may now be irreversible. “We tried to get them water but with the cost involved and a declining population was it good policy to spend millions of public dollars for 88 people?” Loessberg said. “With the community in the floodplain it’s unlikely there will be new development so there will be no new houses to share the cost of it. “Whenever you see poverty in a country as prosperous as ours, it’s disconcerting. We like to think we are better than that. I wish we could wave a magic wand, but it’s tricky. It’s complicated.” Wandering around Sandbranch feels a little like stepping into a historical re-enactment with a few modern flourishes. About half of the town’s houses have been torn down or left to ruin, either due to the intervention of Fema, the federal disaster agency, or a Dallas County initiative where residents were offered a small amount of money to leave. The former five and dime store, once a mobile home, has tilted on to an angle with a gaping maw on one side where the rot has set in. The corner store has also gone, as well as the community center, now wreathed in weeds. The lost properties have left behind vacant spaces filled with knots of weeds, grass and trash next to the remaining structures, which are mainly ageing wood-framed houses daubed in white that can only be patched up, not materially improved, under the Fema floodplain rules. The verdant vegetation is slowly enveloping the town, adding a bucolic feel to the decay. There is little noise apart from the continual crackle of gunshots from a firing range that was placed right next to Sandbranch. Keahey has provided an injection of optimism since becoming Sandbranch’s pastor in 2013. He has spearheaded a group that has pulled together the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Department of Agriculture, with a view to obtaining grants to put in pipes and then buying water from the city of Dallas. Should the byzantine bureaucracy work in his favor, Keahey believes Sandbranch’s long drought could end as early as next year. In total it may cost $6m, perhaps more. “It’s realistic, it’s a real thing, we are excited,” he said. “If we get the permits and all that, it could happen next year. Once people get water to the lots, they will come back.” Others are more skeptical. “We wish them the best but it’s a very complicated process,” said Loessberg. “It might even end up cheaper buying bottled water than paying a monthly water bill to the city. It’ll be difficult. You see where the long-term population trend is. You can see which way it’s going.” It may be practical for the county for Sandbranch simply to cease, for its remaining residents to find somewhere else to live where there are jobs and running water and a Tuesday night garbage collection on illuminated streets. But communities put down hardy roots that often weather the most extreme adversity. “If we get water I’ll be down here like a shot because why should I pay a mortgage where I am in Dallas when I have a house here?” said Newhouse. “I think the county is waiting for everyone to die out here so they can redevelop all of this, so they can dig for their precious gravel. I don’t think that will happen. All we are asking for is a water bill.” It’s Sunday and the good people of Sandbranch are neatly dressed and ambling into the church. Two dozen souls fan themselves in the pews as the gospel choir finds its voice and Keahey provides some spiritual perspective. “We don’t have creature comforts and amenities here but we have your love, God,” he bellows into a microphone, prompting several people to stand and shout, “Say it pastor!” The choir launches into I Will Trust in the Lord and does a job that wouldn’t disgrace Aretha Franklin. There’s no shortage of takers for the precious liquid. The two gallons go to Alvin Wayne, who escorts me and the water to his weatherboard house, shuffling on his cane. “Is that all you got?” Wayne, who has completely run out of water, asked. The latest scheme to lay water pipes leaves Wayne naturally skeptical. He has lived in Sandbranch since 1963 and he’s heard it all before. But cynicism doesn’t seem to be able to flourish here, in this friendly forgotten corner of Texas where everyone waves at you as you pass by. “I’ve heard about that plan,” Wayne said. “I hope I live long enough to see it happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/16/guo-wengui-the-maverick-chinese-billionaire-who-threatens-to-crash-xis-party","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T02:30:07Z","webTitle":"Guo Wengui, the maverick Chinese billionaire who threatens to crash Xi's party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/guo-wengui-the-maverick-chinese-billionaire-who-threatens-to-crash-xis-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/16/guo-wengui-the-maverick-chinese-billionaire-who-threatens-to-crash-xis-party","fields":{"headline":"Guo Wengui, the maverick Chinese billionaire who threatens to crash Xi's party","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"He paints himself as the Che Guevara of Chinese crony capitalism, a billionaire insurgent vowing to bring down the system from the comfort of his $68m New York home. “My only goal is to change China,” Guo Wengui, an eccentric and exiled Chinese property magnate, declared earlier this month on the eve of a key political convention in Beijing that he is promising to disrupt with electrifying revelations of skulduggery at the pinnacle of Chinese power. This Wednesday the curtains go up on the 19th Communist party congress – a week-long eruption of socialist pomp and circumstance marking the end of Xi Jinping’s first term as China’s commander-in-chief. As more than 2,200 delegates flock to the capital for this intensely choreographed display of political theatre, Guo, who also uses the name Miles Kwok, is by far the most unusual figure threatening to rain on Xi’s parade. For months, the flamboyant real estate mogul has been disgorging reams of salacious – and largely unsubstantiated – allegations into the public sphere about some of his homeland’s most powerful figures. “They are just a tiny group of mafiosos, pure and simple,” Guo said during one of his most recent assaults on China’s house of cards. Now, with the congress about to commence, Guo claims he has more up his sleeve: “This,” he tweeted ominously on Saturday, “is only the beginning!” Roderick MacFarquhar, a China expert at Harvard University, said it was impossible to predict whether the billionaire would succeed in crashing Xi’s party: “The wild card is what Mr Guo has been spewing out in New York ... He has promised to release his stuff as they are meeting in Beijing – and we will see.” Recent weeks have seen this well-connected globe-trotter – who is a member of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club and has shared private jets with Tony Blair – attempt to recast himself as a selfless freedom fighter battling “to expose the leviathan Chinese mafia state”. “No one can withstand our pursuit of democracy, freedom and the rule of law,” he boasted on Twitter this week. Writing in the Washington Times last month, Guo claimed China had become “the most corrupt, tyrannical and brutal state on earth, bar North Korea”. Only he – and his American hosts – could save it from “tyranny and barbarism”. But Guo, an international man of mystery whose very age remains shrouded in secrecy (depending on who you believe he was born in 1967 or 1970), is an unlikely and – to many unconvincing – advocate for democratic change. He made his fortune as a politically savvy developer, whose reputed contacts with top party officials helped him wangle a string of lucrative projects. By 2014 Guo was China’s 74th richest person, worth some £1.77bn according to a ranking of its top movers and shakers. Last week Guo – now mired in legal disputes and with many of his assets frozen – slipped off that ranking of China’s super rich. But one of Beijing’s most unusual skyscrapers – the dragon-shaped Pangu Plaza – stands as a permanent monument to his success and, many suspect, his intimate and potentially explosive knowledge of the notoriously corrupt intersection between Chinese business and power. “You don’t get to have .... a building on Beijing’s central access without being deep in the mud in China,” said Bill Bishop, the Washington-based publisher of the Sinocism newsletter about Chinese politics. “Clearly over the years he has picked up stuff and Beijing is clearly worried about what he may know.” According to his telling, Guo fled to the US in 2014 after discovering he was to be detained as part of Xi’s war on corruption, and later set up camp in a luxurious 18th floor apartment in Manhattan’s Sherry-Netherland hotel overlooking Central Park. It is from this not-so-humble 16,000 sq ft abode – whose furnishings reportedly include crystal chandeliers, Louis XVI furniture, and a Lego model of London Bridge – that Guo has launched his emoji-riddled online crusade against Communist party corruption. In webcasts, newspaper interviews and tweets to his 449,000 followers Guo has lambasted the party’s finagling while simultaneously flaunting his own wealth and pulling power. (This month he has tweeted photos of guests including Steve Bannon and the New York Times’ Pulitzer-winning columnist, Nicholas Kristof). His prime target has been Wang Qishan, Xi’s anti-corruption czar, whose family he accuses of having a secret stake in HNA, a $53bn Chinese conglomerate known for its deal-making prowess. Beijing has not taken kindly to Guo’s incendiary, if largely unproven, claims. State media has denounced him as a “dirty trickster” peddling “political slander” and accused him of paying millions of pounds in bribes to a former intelligence chief. An Interpol “red notice” for his arrest was issued in April, at Beijing’s behest. Meanwhile the hyperbole-prone mogul claims he has suffered “multiple kidnap and assassination attempts, unprecedented in the last 100 years of Chinese history” while in the US. Last month he asked for asylum claiming his safety was at risk because of his status as “a political opponent of the Chinese regime”. Bishop said the anti-Guo campaign suggested some in Beijing saw his mud-slinging as a genuine threat: “He’s lucky Xi Jinping doesn’t seem to have the proclivities of, say, the Russian president in terms of dealing with dissidents.” There is concern, too, among US dissidents who believe Guo has hijacked their cause in a bid to save his own skin. Wen Yunchao, a New York based campaigner, said Guo’s attempts to pose as an activist – which many suspect is a ploy to help him secure asylum – were an outrage: “As a businessman Guo colluded with the government. Every penny he has earned is dripping with blood.” “Guo is no human rights champion ... he is doing what he is doing simply for his own sake and for the sake of his family, his friends and his property. That’s all,” Wen added. Bishop said some dissidents had latched on to Guo as a potential patron and figurehead: “These people have dedicated their lives to fighting the Communist party and Guo is the biggest potential weapon they have had in a very long time.” “[But] the idea that he is somehow a symbol of human rights work activism or pro-democracy is, I think, quite unfortunate and unfair to the folk who actually are human rights campaigners ... This is all about Guo and his family and getting his money.” Guo did not respond to interview requests but in a recent conversation with the Wall Street Journal he said he had no plans to shut up. “Nothing can stop me,” he vowed. In a podcast about the tycoon’s life and times, Mike Forsythe, a New York Times journalist who has spearheaded coverage of Guo, painted him as a charming if “Trumpish” storyteller whose motivations and future were hard to fathom: “We’ve never seen a tweeting, narcissistic Chinese billionaire before – so it’s kind of new territory.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/17/china-communist-party-congress-agents-stifle-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T23:57:26Z","webTitle":"China's 'stability maintenance' agents move to silence critics before party congress","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/china-communist-party-congress-agents-stifle-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/17/china-communist-party-congress-agents-stifle-activists","fields":{"headline":"China's 'stability maintenance' agents move to silence critics before party congress","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"They came for Yu Wensheng last Tuesday. Their message: stay silent and obey. “They told me not to give any interviews ... and asked me to sign a letter of commitment to ensure I wouldn’t get them into any trouble,” the Beijing-based human rights lawyer recalled of the visit he received from members of China’s vast “stability maintenance” apparatus. Yu, an outspoken attorney, is one of hundreds, possibly thousands of Chinese activists and petitioners coming under pressure in the run-up to a key political summit – the 19th Communist party congress – which kicks off in the capital on Wednesday. Beijing wants no surprises during the twice-a-decade gathering, which marks the end of Xi Jinping’s first five-year term as China’s top leader, and in recent weeks security agents have been fanning out across the country to quell even the slightest hint of dissent. Many government critics, like Yu, have been placed under increased surveillance and instructed to keep a low profile. “I’m under severe control. I can feel the tension,” said the attorney, who has claimed he was tortured during a three-month stint in custody in 2015. A police car has been stationed outside Yu’s house. Li Wenzu, the wife of another campaigning lawyer, Wang Quanzhang, who vanished into secret custody more than two years ago and has yet to emerge, was staying at her parents’ home in Hubei province when police burst in to question her. “I’ve been under close scrutiny 24 hours a day here,” she complained. Others are being forced to leave their homes altogether as part of a long-standing security scheme designed to silence objectors during sensitive occasions such as political summits or anniversaries of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. Hu Jia, perhaps the most outspoken political activist still living in mainland China, said agents had told him he would be forcibly “travelled” from his Beijing home in the coming days. “Perhaps they will send me somewhere remote,” said Hu, who has been under almost constant guard since June. Authorities have also tried to convince Li Heping – another crusading rights lawyer who emerged from secret detention in May – to leave town by offering him an all expenses paid holiday. “We said no,” said his wife, Wang Qiaoling. “We wouldn’t spend a single penny of theirs – it’s taxpayers’ money.” When Xi took control of the world’s largest authoritarian state, in 2012, some hoped he might prove a Gorbachev-style reformer who would usher in a period of political relaxation. The opposite has occurred. Under Xi, dissenters have been pursued with a determination not seen in decades. Hundreds of attorneys, including Yu and Li, have been targeted as part of the so-called “war on law”; liberal academics, bloggers, church leaders and feminist activists have been thrown in jail or have fled abroad to escape the repression. Campaigners expect the congress’ temporary “stability maintenance” measures to subside once delegates return home. But few expect the broader crackdown to ease. Some fear it might even escalate as Xi – who some call China’s most powerful leader since Mao – enters his second term in a position of even greater political strength. “This crackdown has been going on for a long time and seems to really represent a vision of how society should be – that it should fall into line and should be unified. So I don’t expect a significant let-up after the congress,” said Andrew Nathan, a Columbia University political scientist and expert in Chinese human rights issues. Wang Wen, a pro-party scholar from a think tank affiliated to Beijing’s Renmin University, defended the clampdown, claiming China needed “authority” as Xi battled to simultaneously achieve development, reform and, crucially, “social stability”. “Yes, I agree that lawyers, journalists, they face a few difficulties. But the problem is that special times, special periods, need special conditions,” he said. “Yes, we like liberty. We need democracy. We need a liberal free press. Of course. They are all very good. But the problem is the timing,” Wang added. Nathan said Xi’s crackdown was driven by a sense among party leaders that they were under siege from a disparate coalition of political foes including Tibetans, Hong Kongers, Xinjiang Uighurs, Taiwanese and Americans. The offensive would continue in the medium term, he predicted. But in the long run it was a perilous tactic: “The way [Xi’s first term] leaves me feeling in the end is: ‘Why is he cracking down so hard? What is he afraid of? And how can that amount of tension in society last?’” “It leaves me feeling as though this level of social crackdown is not sustainable. Because people, in the end, have some kind of self-respect.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/16/the-cost-of-raising-a-child-should-not-be-a-secure-retirement","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"The cost of raising a child should not be a secure retirement | Edward Cavanough and Tara Moriarty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/16/the-cost-of-raising-a-child-should-not-be-a-secure-retirement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/16/the-cost-of-raising-a-child-should-not-be-a-secure-retirement","fields":{"headline":"The cost of raising a child should not be a secure retirement","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"“A bit over the top”, we now know, is how federal government MP Craig Kelly saw Senator Larissa Waters’s simple act of breastfeeding in parliament. It’s easy, of course, to laugh at the old-school boofheadery of Kelly’s views. But to do so would be to ignore a serious and enduring reality of modern Australian life: motherhood is still very much treated as a liability, rather than as an essential, valued occupation for society and the economy. For too many women, the joy of having a child is contrasted with significant career and financial sacrifices. And these sacrifices are evident nowhere more than in women’s superannuation savings. Today, the average Australian woman is retiring with half the superannuation balance of the average Australian man. Things get worse the deeper you dig into the data. The median superannuation balance for women in 2017 is just $28,000, while for men it is around $100,000. This is not just about justice and equality. Any aspiring politician with their eyes on the treasury portfolio in the years ahead should be looking at this as a ticking fiscal timebomb. The chasm between men and women’s super holdings, if left unaddressed, will cause huge strain on federal budgets as future Australian governments face perpetually rising age pension costs. So clearly there is impetus for government to help overcome this major social and economic inequity. But to do so we need to pinpoint what is driving this yawning super savings gap in the first place. The obvious answer is that super gender gap is simply a legacy issue: women retiring today lived through an age where they worked fewer hours and had no compulsory super, so of course they retire with less. This is partially true. The real and enduring lifetime earnings gap between genders also plays a significant role. But it’s not that simple. Women who take time out from the workforce to have children and care for loved ones create significant hits on their retirement savings. The McKell Institute’s latest report, Guaranteeing Women’s Super, has looked in detail at this aspect of the problem. Most women with new kids opt for at least a few months out of the formal labour market. But for many, a year or two away from work is the best option. During this period, almost all new mums simply forgo superannuation. These forgone retirement savings, at a relatively early stage in work life, cause an irreparable gap in the lifetime growth capacity of the super balances of Australian women. Women forgoing super payments during these key career stages simply never catch up. And for those also juggling caring responsibilities – assisting an impaired child or relative – the security of a healthy superannuation balance is just one more sacrifice they are forced to make. For too long the response of policymakers to this problem has been resignation. This inertia has been driven by a dangerously sexist view about the fundamental qualities of men and women. Perhaps, this view goes, it is simply nature’s way that women should retire with less in super than men. Surely 2017 is the time to consign this kind of thinking to the dustbin of history. We can do better. The fact is there are concrete measures the commonwealth government could start taking to address this issue today. The superannuation guarantee, the percentage of your income that is set aside for super, should be extended to women receiving commonwealth maternity, parenting, and carer payments. The idea of adding at least 9.5% to maternity and carer payments might make any treasurer wince. But McKell’s modelling demonstrates that every dollar the government spends contributing to new mums’ and carers’ superannuation today would save at least $2 in age pension costs over the coming decades. And, economic arguments aside, if we have decided that raising children or caring are legitimate occupations deserving of payment from the government, then why shouldn’t super be included? Superannuation policy in Australia is far too often a political battleground. But one thing we should surely all agree on is that the cost of raising a child should not be a secure retirement.

WeChat, which has almost 900 million users, blamed the use of the racial slur on an error in the artificial intelligence software that translates between Chinese and English. The issue was first noticed by an American living in Shanghai, Ann James, when her friend discussed being late in Chinese in a group chat. James used WeChat’s built-in translation feature, which produced the message: “The nigger is late.” “If you’re a black person in China, you’ve come up against some craziness,” James told the news website Sixth Tone, adding that she is frequently touched and photographed in public. “I know there’s a lot of curiosity and a lot of ignorance about black people.” In subsequent tests, users found the app used the racial slur almost exclusively in negative contexts, including with the words late, lazy, and thief. But in many neutral sentences the word – hei laowai in Chinese – was translated into English as its literal meaning of “black foreigner”. “We’re very sorry for the inappropriate translation,” a WeChat spokesman told local media. “After receiving users’ feedback, we immediately fixed the problem.” Tests by the Guardian showed the translation software had been retooled and no longer produced racial slurs. The company uses AI and machine learning, feeding computers huge amounts of data to train it to pick the best translations based on context. But the system also removes human oversight, leading to incorrect and even offensive words being used. This is not the first time Chinese companies and media have been accused of being tone deaf when it comes to race. Han people constitute approximately 92% of the population of China, and most of the country’s ethnic minorities live in the far west, away from the populated cities along the eastern coast. Last year a television advert for laundry detergent showed a black man covered in paint going into a washing machine and coming out as an sparkling Asian man. The video went viral around the world and caused outrage for its insensitive messaging. Over the summer China’s state news agency published a video during a border standoff with India featuring an offensive parody of a Sikh man, complete with a turban and fake beard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2017/oct/14/diamonds-v-silver-ferns-a-league-and-more-sportwatch-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T11:15:26Z","webTitle":"City win Melbourne derby, Wanderers draw with Mariners, Diamonds beat Silver Ferns: sportwatch – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/oct/14/diamonds-v-silver-ferns-a-league-and-more-sportwatch-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2017/oct/14/diamonds-v-silver-ferns-a-league-and-more-sportwatch-live","fields":{"headline":"City win Melbourne derby, Wanderers draw with Mariners, Diamonds beat Silver Ferns: sportwatch – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Well that’s all she wrote from yours truly. Tip of the hat to City and their fans who get bragging rights until the next Melbourne derby. As cagey as the first half was, the second half was an action-packed affair with thrills, spills and, erm, trills (seagulls trill right?). Thanks for joining me, I’ll catch you next time. Budzinski gets the chance to finish it - one on one with the keeper - but he fluffs it, hitting it straight at Thomas. Moments later, it’s all over. An excellent result for City. Victory must be wondering how they have nothing to show from their opening two games. 90+4 min: Hats off to City for the way they’ve defended tonight. Victory have shown menace and intent for the entire half but City have been equal to almost all of it. 90+2 min: Oooo! Williams gets a header on a free-kick but it shaves the crossbar and goes over. Good chance and there won’t be many more. If any. 90 min: A free-kick for City and they’re in absolutely no rush at all to take it. It’s taken long and Cahill wins the header. Goes without saying. 89 min: They’ve probably been the better side this half but it’s looking like another loss for Victory. Sanchez goes in the book for a tackle from behind on Cahill. 87 min: If it stays like this, it will be a big result for both clubs - even at this early stage. Two home defeats to start the season is not the form of a title-winning team. City, however, have shown some real steel in defence - something they’ve struggled with at times the last couple of seasons. 85 min: Donachie has been shoved up front. Or to give it a more accurate title - out of harm’s way. 84 min: Dear oh dear. That was Victory’s last substitution and Donachie is clearly struggling with a leg injury. City hoping to take advantage with a foray into the Victory half, but it comes to nothing. 82 min: Donachie goes in the book for a professional foul on Fitzgerald. Took him out just before he could launch a counter-attack. Ingham comes on for Valeri. 80 min: And on he comes. McCormack is the man to make way. 79 min: Here we go. Mr Cahill is about to make an appearance. We know he’s good at attacking corners, how useful is he at defending them though? That’d probably be more useful for City at the minute. 77 min: City defending for their lives at the minute - they’re sat way too far back for my liking, offering nothing at the other end. 75 min: Another corner for Victory who are turning the screw. The City defenders have done well so far but will they reach breaking point? They manage to get the cross into the box away to safety. Off comes Milligan, on comes Sanchez. 72 min: Some first-rate histrionics from Schenkeveld there after Berisha’s arm wafts in his general direction. 70 min: Off comes George, much to the displeasure of the Victory fans. He’s already a cult hero. On comes Austin. 67 min: Well this is turning into a rip-snorter. City back in front against the run of play. Victory need to have faith in the way they were playing, they were creating chances left, right and centre. Literally. 65 min: Kamau with a long, long run down the pitch. Somehow none of the Victory defenders manage to catch him until he’s in a position to pull the trigger - the shot takes a deflection and loops into the net. Devastating for Victory who had City on the ropes and were looking for a knockout blow. 63 min: George fires one over the bar - it had the angle but not the height. The Victory fans are loving this. 61 min: City goalscorer Budzinski wins a free-kick as City take a moment to breathe. McCormack curls in a wicked effort and Thomas palms it to safety. It was top-corner bound. 60 min: It’s been a much-improved half from Victory so far. Troisi with another curler but it goes inches wide. Don’t think Galekovic would have got a look in. 58 min: Troisi tries to curl the free-kick beyond the wall but it doesn’t have the angle and deflects out for a corner. Victory piling on the pressure. 57 min: Muscat (not that one) goes in the book for a trip on Troisi just as he was about to break into the box. Victory have their tails up. More importantly they have a free-kick right on the edge of the box. 55 min: Troisi with a beautiful, curling ball to the back post, where George takes one touch then rifles it home between the keeper’s legs. We’re all square again. 54 min: Kamau allowed to turn in the box, but Rhys Williams throws his body in the way and the ball bounces out for a corner. The Victory defence were far too static. 52 min: Lawrence Thomas must have some hot chips in his pocket or something, those seagulls are all flocking to his end. 49 min: Victory seem to have upped the tempo slightly in response to falling behind. That could open the game up, something that was missing in the first half. Victory are making all the early running in this half although no clear sight at goal so far. 46 min: Berisha gets us back under way in Melbourne. Muscat must have had a few choice words to say during the break. They’d worked their way back into the game only to switch off at the death. They’ve started the half well, early pressure on City. Football - Western Sydney Wanderers 2-2 Central Coast Mariners Western Sydney Wanderers twice came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw with Central Coast Mariners at Spotless Stadium. Asdrubal pounced to net from close range after an Andrew Hoole shot bounced off the chest of Wanderers goalkeeper Vedran Janjetovic. Oriel Riera equalised for the home side just before the break after Dutchman Wout Brama was judged to have pushed Roly Bonevacia in the back. The visitors regained the lead in the 63rd minute when Daniel De Silva latched onto a Hoole through ball and Wanderers defender and substitute Brendan Hamill’s desperate slide to keep the ball out of the net was unsuccessful. Bonevacia scored from close range in the 69th minute after Mariners goalkeeper Thomas Glover pushed out a Josh Risdon cross into his path. Hoole was sent off in the 85th minute after getting a second yellow card but the Mariners held on. AAP And that’s pretty much the last action of the half. City nick a goal right before the whistle. Muscat will be furious with his players. See you in 15. 45+2 min: Where did that come from! The sub gets the wrong side of his marker, he’s played in and fires a thunderous shot above Thomas into the roof of the net from a tight angle. 45 min: Well this one’s petering out a little as we approach the break. Victory still probing away in the City half but there’s nothing in the way of gaps. City looking tight in defence. 43 min: Malik is still struggling after that awful challenge and eventually gives up the good fight. He hobbles off minutes before half-time, replaced by Budzinski. 42 min: The mass of seagulls on the pitch just aren’t getting the message, they’re flapping about all over the place. A bit like Galekovic a minute ago. 39 min: OOOF! Milligan with a low drive from about 20 yards, it takes a deflection and Galekovic does well to adjust and spill it to safety. That could have gone anywhere. 37 min: City players starting to look a little more in tune with each other, much like they were at the start of the half. Victory look very dangerous on the break though. 35 min: Bit of argy bargy in the box between Troisi and Muscat. Big roar for a penalty from the Victory fans - but it would have been very harsh to say the least. 30 min: It goes to a review... and it doesn’t look any better on the second look. He gets a booking for his troubles. Probably about right although he couldn’t have complained if it had been red. Risky stuff. 29 min: Oooo! Williams goes in hard - very hard - on Malik. The replays make it look even worse. Malik stays down, and the referee has a decision to make. 26 min: The tempo is much higher than the Mariners-Wanderers game earlier - much more high-pressing from both sides. Victory guilty of a few too many trips and kicks. Not dirty just niggly. They’re getting a lot of curling balls into the box too. 22 min: Broxham tries one from distance but it’s nowhere near close enough to trouble Galekovic. There must have been a memo at Victory about long-range efforts. They’ve had a few already. 20 min: Well 20 minutes gone and we’re still waiting for a bit of a spark to get this game going. And not the sort of spark that Fitzgerald has been on the receiving end of a couple of times already. Both sides settling into a rhythm without committing too many men to attack. It’s a little cat and mouse. 17 min: Victory slowly seeing more and more of the ball. And the City goal for that matter. They’ve already had a few pot shots, just keeping the City defenders on their toes. 15 min: A deep corner from Victory is held well by Galekovic amidst a sea of players. Confident stuff from the shotstopper. Despite struggling for possession, Victory are still creating openings. 12 min: Broxham goes in the book after scything into Fitzgerald. The City man has had some rough treatment already. 9 min: Victory look a little sluggish but the first time they get close to the City box, Troisi whips in a dangerous low delivery that flies across the face of goal. 7 min: City making all the early running as Victory take a while to settle. It’d be interesting to see the possession stats. Victory have barely touched it in this opening spell. 6 min: A lazy pass from Broxham, who makes up for his mistake with a crunching tackle on Fitzgerald. Muscat doesn’t look happy with the way his side’s started. Then again he never looks happy. 4 min: Well he’s forced Thomas into another save. Good signs for City early doors. 3 min: McCormack with a curling effort that forces Thomas into a smart, but relatively easy, save. The young City player has a lot of expectation riding on him. Can he live up to it? 1 min: Peeeeep! Hold on to your hats folks because we’re in for a bumpy ride. Valeri flies into a challenge with 30 seconds gone and that’s the first yellow card of the night. It won’t be the last. Football Apologies to Victory fans but with everything that happened last week it would be remiss of me not to at least point to Tim Cahill’s immediate impact on this fixture on his A-League debut. Never gets old. Football Right here we go, the big one - and blimey charley it sounds loud at the Etihad tonight. Stand By Me blasts out from the speakers. Football Excellent stuff. No time to dawdle though - let’s head straight to Melbourne for the weekend’s big derby. The Mariners get a corner at the death. It comes to nothing but the visitors manage to hold on to the ball and even launch another attack. You wouldn’t think they were a man down in injury time. And that’s it. The referee blows and the Mariners grab a point. 90+3 min: It’s getting a little stop-start as the game draws to a close. Not that the Mariners will mind. They’re seeing this out quite comfortably, it’s certainly no siege. 90+2 min: Golec holds his shin after a tough challenge by Risdon. Risky stuff by the Wanderers man, although the Mariners will be happy to chew up some time. 90 min: Risdon in the book now, for going into the back of Brama. It’s all getting a bit messy in these final few minutes. 89 min: The Wanderers finally look like they’ve found some urgency - although it might be a tad bit late. The clock is ticking, and every wayward ball elicits groans from the home crowd. 87 min: Now then, can the Mariners hold on for these final few minutes? They deserve something today. Santalab in the book now - didn’t take him long to make an impression. De Silva comes off for Appiah. Well played that lad. 85 min: It’s whipped into the crowd from Hoole but defended well... and moments later he gets his marching orders. Hoole is off. He went straight through the back of Cejudo challenging for a high ball. A second booking. 84 min: Free-kick for the Mariners on the left edge of the box. Can they make the most of it? 82 min: Mariners on the attack. It’s been good to see De Silva show flashes of the skill that made him such a sought-after youngster. If he can build on this he’ll be a very dangerous player for the Mariners. McGing comes on for Roux. Bonevacia comes off for Santalab. 80 min: I’m not convinced this is going to stay at 2-2. No idea who will score though - it’s one of those matches. Both teams having sights of goal as we enter end game. 78 min: Llorente seems to be getting a lot of joy down the left flank for the Wanderers. They’re looking for him every time... and usually finding him too. The Mariners have to be careful they don’t throw this away. 76 min: Goalscorer Asdrubal comes off for Bingham. 73 min: Knights of Columbus how did the Wanderers not score! Llorente breaks into the box, it falls to Cejudo who dinks it to the back post beyond the keeper but neither Bridge nor Riera can get on the end of it. They didn’t even stick out a leg! 71 min: Hoole fires one from distance and Janjetovic smothers it with a low dive. Such an open game, although the Mariners should really be in the lead. A couple of poor decisions and they’ve paid both times. 69 min: The Mariners give away possession in the middle of the pitch. Risdon commits two Mariners players and slips it through down the right flank. A half-parry from Glover falls to Bonevacia who fires home. All level again. 66 min: The Wanderers don’t seem to know how to respond. They’re offering nothing at the minute. If they don’t change something soon the game will get away from them. 63 min: Hoole with a cracking throughball to De Silva, who dinks it over the keeper. Excellent goal and the Mariners are well worth it. It was De Silva who started the move off too, continuing the charge up field to round it all off. 63 min: It’s been a bit one-way for the last six or seven minutes, the Wanderers struggling to string possession together. Paul Okon must be pleased by how his side have bounced back from that drubbing last week, although while it’s 1-1... 61 min: De Silva is teed up by Hiariej’s header but he can’t get over the top of it and the ball sails high and wide. Promising from the Mariners. 59 min: Corner take two... it ends up with a bit of a goalmouth scramble that the Wanderers just manage to get to safety. Warning signs for the hosts though. The Mariners are building up possession again. 58 min: Corner to the Mariners. It’s swung in... well not really because the referee stops the run up after hearing something on the mic. Not sure what this is all about. 57 min: Handball in the box? The Mariners think so, the referee doesn’t. Looks like it hit Llorente’s hand but not sure he could have got out the way. 53 min: Lovely ball from Jumpei out wide to Llorente, who plays in Bonevacia. Good defending to stop the shot but that’s better from the Wanderers. 51 min: Golec with some, ahem, “unorthodox” defending - slicing a dangerous cross into the box over his own net. It was possibly the best thing he could have done in the situation. Decent start by the Wanderers... although I said that 45 minutes ago. 49 min: Looks like an early change for the Wanderers. Thwaite indicating something is wrong with his hamstring. Off he trudges to be replaced by Hamill. 48 min: Glover, who has looked solid for the Mariners, slips as he comes to collect a deep ball and almost gives away a handball. Would have been harsh. The Wanderers clearly think they can get some joy from those little dinks over the Mariners back line. No joy so far though. 46 min: Here we go again. It’ll be interesting to see how the Wanderers respond to the previous half, they were definitely on the back foot, largely because they let the Mariners control possession in their own half without any pressure being put on the defence. Jumpei gets caught offside again. Deja vu at the start of the second half. All square as the half comes to a close. The Wanderers finally start to press the Mariners high up the pitch but it’s come a little too late. We’ll see if they adapt after the break. Catch you in 15. 44 min: A great passage of play by the Mariners puts De Silva through into the box. It’s a tight angle though and the best he can do is try to squeeze it through the keeper’s legs. Janjetovic isn’t falling for it though and makes the block. 42 min: That poor effort from Pain minutes before the penalty might come back to haunt the Mariners. It was a bit of a harsh call from the ref. Still a decent half from them though... if it stays like this of course. 39 min: OOOooo, Glover gets a fingertip too it but it’s right in the corner from Riera. Good penalty. 38 min: Kiss of death from yours truly as the Mariners give away a penalty. Looked a little harsh to me, a flailing arm in the box from Brama in a tussle and Bonevacia goes down easily. Be interesting to see the replay. 36 min: Things couldn’t have gone much better tactically for the Mariners. They’ve grown in confidence as the half has gone on. De Silva with a cheeky chip that sails just over. 34 min: Suddenly the Mariners’ decision to play it around in defence looks masterful - perfect away tactics. I take it all back. And they should have been two up! Rose with a great pass through to Pain but the final shot is far too tame and Janjetovic saves it comfortably. 30 min: The Mariners look so much better going forward than they did last season. Huge improvement in terms of finding space and picking out passes. I’m still not entirely convinced by the defence though. They’ve done well so far. 27 min: Hats off to the Mariners... and I should probably eat my own while I’m at it because I was being overly critical of their patient play earlier but it’s paid off. The momentum has shifted, Mariners with their tails up. If their final ball was a bit better they might even be further ahead. 24 min: That goal seems to have flustered the Wanderers a bit. A long ball over the top from Glover almost catches out the home defence... but a replay shows no less than four Mariners men in an offside position. Take your pick linesman. 21 min: A bouncing shot from Hoole, Janjetovic spills it and Asdrubal pounces to stab it home from close range. Poor from the keeper, although the ball went through a few legs before it reached him - he would’ve seen it late. And the Mariners have the lead. 19 min: More ball strokeage from the Mariners. Cough cough. It’s not really going anywhere though... sideways counts I suppose. It seems to be a pattern from the Mariners, pass it around in defence then try a killer ball into a danger area. It’s not brought too much success so far though. 17 min: Great defending from Golec to stop Risdon. He even manages to save the corner. Some nice play from the Wanderers though, they’re asking more questions of the Mariners’ defence than vice versa. 16 min: Some decent enough passing from both sides but not much incision so far. De Silva drives one low from distance but the keeper was always on top of it. Wanderers try a long ball over the top but it’s another offside. 15 min: Hoole in the book for a studs-up challenge. No complaints. 13 mins: It didn’t take long for the brass section to pipe up. Literally. Not sure which set of fans are blowing their own trumpets though. Llorente catches a glimpse of goal from distance, fires it towards the keeper but it slices wide. Glover never looked concerned. 11 min: The Mariners still happy to stroke the ball across the defence, switching flanks as they look for openings. Roux and De Silva almost team up to create a chance but it’s defended well by the Wanderers. 9 min: Glover with a sharp save to deny the Wanderers from close range. Seconds later he’s called into action again, diving at the feet of Riera to cut out a dangerous opening. 7 min: Glover comes running out of his box and makes a diving header to clear a long ball over the top towards Jumpei. Smart, if a little unorthodox, goalkeeping. 6 min: Brama with a poor ball to gift possession to the Wanderers. They try to break but are forced to delay the attack and Jumpei is caught offside for the second time in the opening minutes. 4 min: Quite a sedate start compared to the Mariners’ previous outing. For a team coming off the back of a hammering, they’re passing the ball around confidently - not that the Wanderers are particularly applying much pressure. It’s mostly in the Mariners half anyway. 1min: Aaaaaand we’re off. Bonevacia gets things under way and the Wanderers immediately try to put some early pressure on the Mariners defence. Football In all seriousness, that is a strong squad for the Wanderers (as opposed to a strong starting XI). Bridge and Santalab on the bench? Nice options to have. The general consensus seems to be a big win for the Wanderers - and as we all know, football always goes exactly according to plan. Which is why I’m making no prediction. This fence is getting rather comfortable. Football While we’re waiting for the Wanderers to kick-off, a little look at last night’s match - and the enigma that is Adelaide United. Trying to guess where they’ll finish on the ladder is a sure-fire way to look stupid every pre-season. Cracking finish for the winner. Brisbane Roar 1-2 Adelaide United Netball - AAP match report Australia recovered from a horrible start to complete their first Constellation Cup sweep of New Zealand in four years, with a thumping 58-42 victory in the fourth and final Test. The Diamonds maintained their trend of improving their winning margin with every game of the series, going from three to eight then 12 to 16. Australia trailed 5-0 and took more than three minutes to score their first goal in front of 10,861 spectators on Saturday afternoon at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena. They rallied to pile on eight of the next nine goals, although New Zealand led 13-12 at quarter-time. The Diamonds notched the first six goals of the second quarter. They outscored the Kiwis 14-9 in both middle quarters to lead 26-22 at halftime and 40-31 at the final change. They won last quarter 18-11. Rising Diamonds wing attack Liz Watson continued her stellar series by being named player of the match. Football Well that was a breathless four quarters, and there’s no let up as we trudge our way towards Spotless Stadium for the imminent game between Western Sydney Wanderers and Central Coast Mariners. While we’re waiting, here’s the Mariners mascot after last week’s drubbing by the Jets. It’s fair to say he/she/it wasn’t happy. If you’re easily offended, look away now. If you’re easily offended and still look anyway, there’s some pixelated digits to safeguard your sensibilities. Ominously for the Silver Ferns, they actually raised their game for this match and were within touching distance right up until the final quarter. Despite that, they’ve still been comprehensively beaten by a Diamonds side who are now nailed-on favourites for the Commonwealth Games gold next year. It was ruthless rather than inspired by Australia - but champion teams are capable of both, and that’s exactly what the Diamonds are. Special mention for Caitlin Thwaites who was superb when she came on early, just when it looked like Tutaia might turn the tide for the Silver Ferns. Constellation Cup: 4th 0:00 remaining New Zealand 42-58 Australia And that’s all she wrote. It was tight until that final quarter but the Ferns just weren’t up to the task of matching it with the Diamonds for a full four quarters. A big win to cap off a clean sweep. Constellation Cup: 4th 1:40 remaining New Zealand 40-56 Australia Tutaia penalised for a held ball, but it’s all a bit academic now. There’s been too much of that all game for the Ferns to seriously threaten the Diamonds. Up until this quarter, it really wasn’t that emphatic but the hosts are showing why they’re the team to beat. Constellation Cup: 4th 4:20 remaining New Zealand 37-55 Australia Thwaites is on fire, another goal puts the Diamonds even further ahead. Changes all round - Brandley, Moloney and Nevins all coming on for the final few minutes. Constellation Cup: 4th 6:20 remaining New Zealand 37-52 Australia Tutaia trying desperately to keep the Ferns in this, some quick hands gets her into position for another goal, but it’s all too little too late. They’re fighting at least, but the Diamonds have gone up a gear. They can smell blood. Constellation Cup: 4th 8:40 remaining New Zealand 36-49 Australia This is looking dangerous for the Ferns now, they need to get on the scoreboard before it blows out. Tutaia duly obliges but it barely makes a dent on the Diamonds’ momentum, who hit right back. Thwaites with another. Constellation Cup: 4th 10:00 remaining New Zealand 35-47 Australia The Diamonds have been machine-like today - not inspired but consistent and classy enough to always keep New Zealand at bay. Thwaites has hit 21 from 22 since coming on. Constellation Cup: 4th 12:05 remaining New Zealand 33-45 Australia It’s been a ruthless start from the Diamonds this quarter, bagging the first three goals. The Ferns pull one back from distance but Thwaites - yet again - pushes the Diamonds lead out further. Constellation Cup: 4th 13:50 remaining New Zealand 31-42 Australia Another 15 minutes and the Diamonds will have completed only their second Constellation Cup clean sweep. Difficult to see how the Ferns can come back from this. They’ve worked hard but the Diamonds have just been that little bit better all game... apart from maybe the opening three minutes. First blood to Australia in the 4th quarter and the gap goes into double figures. Constellation Cup: 3rd 0:00 remaining New Zealand 31-40 Australia This is starting to get away from the Ferns now, and you get the feeling they can sense it. They’ve actually played well but made poor decisions at crucial moments. The Diamonds as clinical as ever and the gap is getting bigger and bigger. Constellation Cup: 3rd 1:45 remaining New Zealand 30-38 Australia Tutaia guilty of another held ball. They’ve let themselves down too often when they’ve been in good positions. No such issues for the Diamonds, who go right up the other end and bag two quick goals. There’s that daylight again. Constellation Cup: 3rd 3:30 remaining New Zealand 30-36 Australia The Silver Ferns battling to stay in touch now ... and just about succeeding. Time and chances are running out though. The Diamonds are back in control. I get the feeling the Ferns may have missed their chance. Still time though. Constellation Cup: 3rd 8:10 remaining New Zealand 26-29 Australia After a long-spell with the ball, the Ferns finally get a goal - but they should have had more. The Diamonds weather the storm and Thwaites bags another goal - that’s eight from eight for her, she’s been excellent since she came on. The Ferns still being patient... sometimes a little too patient. Constellation Cup: 3rd 10:40 remaining New Zealand 24-28 Australia The Ferns need to start converting their chances. Another one goes begging, Tutaia the culprit this time - guilty of holding on. They’ve seen plenty of the ball in this quarter but they’ve not made the most of it. Constellation Cup: 3rd 12:15 remaining New Zealand 24-28 Australia An exchange of goals opens the half and it’s as you were in terms of the gap in score. Thwaites puts another one away and there’s the first glimmer of daylight between the teams - but it’s quickly snuffed out as the Ferns hit back on a rebound. Constellation Cup: 3rd 14:30 remaining New Zealand 23-26 Australia Aaaaaand we’re back. A big quarter from either side now could be enough to win it, although it’s been so tight it’s difficult to back either team to pull away. I think that opening five-goal salve from the Ferns is the furthest either side has been ahead so far. As it is, the Diamonds are in the driving seat. Constellation Cup: 2nd 0:00 remaining New Zealand 22-26 Australia And there we go for the half. The Diamonds had the better of it but the Ferns are still very much in this, especially with Tutaia on the pitch and firing. Constellation Cup: 2nd 1:50 remaining New Zealand 21-25 Australia The Diamonds have turned the score around this quarter but there’s still very little in it. Momentum is swinging back and forth but you’d still rather be in the Diamonds’ shoes. They just have the edge. Thwaites and Tutaia have made a difference. Constellation Cup: 2nd 4:40 remaining New Zealand 18-21 Australia Tutaia misses one and the Diamonds are on it like raptors, rushing right up the other end to go further ahead. Thwaites doing the damage for the Diamonds after coming on. Constellation Cup: 2nd 6:15 remaining New Zealand 17-18 Australia Another straight through the hoop from Tutaia - just what the Ferns needed with the game threatening to run away from them. She gets another to bring the game back to one. Constellation Cup: 2nd 8:00 remaining New Zealand 15-18 Australia The Diamonds juuuust starting to get ahead, showing a touch of class and experience in the crunch moments. The Ferns have seen enough - on comes Tutaia - and scores almost immediately. She’s fired up. Constellation Cup: 2nd 10:00 remaining New Zealand 14-14 Australia And in the blink of an eye the Diamonds are all square again., Bassett doing the damage. There is literally nothing in this, both sides going toe to toe. Constellation Cup: 2nd 11:15 remaining New Zealand 14-12 Australia An obstruction, eventually, leads to the Ferns opening the scoring for the quarter but they waste their next opportunity. Some tired hands out there. The crowd roaring the Diamonds on. Constellation Cup: 2nd 13:20 remaining New Zealand 13-12 Australia Off we go again. No changes from either team, and some solid defending at both ends means no goals in the opening few minutes. Tense stuff, no one giving anything away. Constellation Cup: 1st 0:00 remaining New Zealand 13-12 Australia Some quick hands from the Ferns gets them back in front, but the Diamonds hit right back to level things up. It looks like it’s going to stay that way going into the break but the Silver Ferns launch one last attack and edge themselves ahead. Breathless stuff. Constellation Cup: 1st 1:30 remaining New Zealand 11-10 Australia Well as we edge closer to the end of the quarter it’s been a topsy-turvy opening spell. Considering how it started off, Australia probably won’t be too disappointed to be a goal behind. Constellation Cup: 1st 3:30 remaining New Zealand 9-9 Australia The Silver Ferns get a much-needed goal back. The score looks pretty even but it’s been all Australia since that opening four-minute spell - the last few minutes the Silver Ferns have been competitive again. Constellation Cup: 1st 6:10 remaining New Zealand 6-8 Australia Well after that action-packed start from the Silver Ferns things seem to have evened out. The Diamonds hit back very quickly and now they’re nosing ahead. Constellation Cup: 1st 8:30 remaining New Zealand 5-5 Australia That’s better - two quick efforts and the Diamonds are right back in it. Frustrating for the Silver Ferns as another fumble robs them of the chance to hit back. Diamonds get another two quick ones and we’re all square. Constellation Cup: 1st 10:30 remaining New Zealand 5-1 Australia The Diamonds finally get on the scoreboard after that early blitz from the Silver Ferns - but it’s still the visitors making all the early running. The Diamonds need to wrestle back momentum. Constellation Cup: 1st 12:40 remaining New Zealand 3-0 Australia And away we go. A couple of early fumbles but the Silver Ferns settle and get the first goal. It seems to calm their nerves and it’s one-way traffic early doors. Netball Looks like a great crowd in Sydney, especially for a dead rubber. Not long to go now. Anthems ahoy. Cricket While we’re waiting for the netball, there is some rare good news for Australian cricket on the injury front ahead of next month’s Ashes, with Mitchell Starc declaring himself “pretty happy” two matches into his return from a long-term layoff. The fast bowler returned figures of 3-48 playing for NSW in their six-wicket one-day cup win over Queensland on Friday, dismissing three top-order batsman in the process, including Usman Khawaja and Joe Burns. The tall left-armer said there was noticeable improvement in the week since his first match against South Australia, where he produced figures of 1-55. “I was a bit rusty (in the first game),” Starc said. “I was much better with the new ball (this time), and the execution was a lot better with the old ball. The last over probably got the better of me, but besides that I’m pretty happy with where it is all going.” AAP Netball Starting line-ups for today. No Tutaia for the Silver Ferns - although no doubt she’ll make an impact when she does come on. Silver Ferns WD: K.Cullen GD: K.Grant GK: T.Fakahokotau GS: TP.Selby-Rickit GA: B.Mes WA: S.Francois C: S.Sinclair Diamonds WD: G.Simpson GD: J.Weston GK: C.Bruce GS: C.Bassett GA: S.Wood WA: L.Watson C: K.Ravaillion Afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining me for this afternoon’s blogathon. I’ll be welded to my seat for the next eight hours, tapping away on my laptop to keep you up to date on all today’s sporting action - from the netball Test in Sydney to the A-League’s Melbourne derby. And quicker than you can say ‘impressive bladder control’ the first of this afternoon’s matches is almost upon us, so let’s get cracking with the rundown. Netball Kicking things off we have the Australian Diamonds searching for a 4-0 series clean sweep against New Zealand in the Constellation Cup at Qudos Bank Arena. Any doubts there may have been about the Diamonds following their defeat to the Silver Ferns at the Quad Cup in September have been emphatically dispelled in this series, with Wednesday’s 55-43 win in Adelaide giving them an unassailable 3-0 lead and rubberstamping their credentials as the world’s top team. That victory was led by captain Caitlin Bassett, but it’s the team’s lesser stars who will be in the spotlight today with one eye already on the Commonwealth Games. Coach Lisa Alexander hinted in midweek that this match could provide players with a chance to stake their claim for the squad – and with the Diamonds hot favourites to take gold, that’s a plane ride no one will want to miss. The Diamonds didn’t have everything their own way on Wednesday though, and the Silver Ferns will look at their performance in the third quarter – which they won 15-8 – as a potential blueprint to stifle the hosts. A win for the visitors would provide a huge psychological boost if nothing else. A Constellation consolation, if you will. Football The fledgling A-League season continues later this afternoon with Western Sydney Wanderers taking on Central Coast Mariners at Spotless Stadium. I’m not usually one for early season predictions but the Mariners’ 5-1 opening day defeat to Newcastle seems just a tad ominous for Paul Okon’s men. Admittedly the scoreline was a bit harsh - but they gave the Jets enough opportunities and they’ll face more ruthless teams this season. The Mariners will be desperate for a more respectable display against a Wanderers side who haven’t missed a beat since Tony Popovic decided to “do one” just before the start of the season. Wanderers’ 2-1 victory over Perth in the season opener was well deserved and another win today would put caretaker boss Hayden Foxe in the box seat to take the reins on a full-time basis. And yes I did just deliberately squeeze in the phrase ‘fox in the box’ for my own amusement. For tonight’s headline act, we have the Melbourne derby at Etihad Stadium. Both teams will have weary international stars back on deck but whether they’re fit for purpose (we’re looking at you Timmy) is another matter. Who knows, the enticing sniff of a derby clash might work like smelling salts for a few stiff-legged stars. Victory will still be smarting from last week’s 1-0 defeat to Sydney FC, and another loss so early in the season would be a big setback to Kevin Muscat’s premiership ambitions – both in terms of points, and psychologically. Conversely, City kicked off the season with a kapow from Kamau in the A-League curtain raiser against Brisbane Roar and back-to-back wins would get people talking up their silverware chances after going under the radar for much of pre-season. They may not have the usual host of big-name stars to match their moneybags but if Warren Joyce can gel this team together, they could provide a serious title threat. Richard will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s how the Diamonds secured the series in Adelaide on Wednesday:"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/14/private-health-insurance-is-just-another-way-to-rip-off-millennials","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T00:53:21Z","webTitle":"Private health insurance is just another way to rip off millennials | Naaman Zhou","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/14/private-health-insurance-is-just-another-way-to-rip-off-millennials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/14/private-health-insurance-is-just-another-way-to-rip-off-millennials","fields":{"headline":"Private health insurance is just another way to rip off millennials","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Like a lot of young people, my first job was in retail, in the sort of place that was mostly about discounts – cheap CDs, speakers and two-for-one DVDs. Younger Australians, in my experience, are fairly value-conscious thanks to our constant low-level awareness of just how high house prices are compared with our wage growth. But I knew almost nothing about private health insurance until earlier this year, when I reported on a survey that showed how bad a deal it was for people like me. On Friday, the government announced an extensive private health insurance overhaul, aimed at persuading people my age (23) to sign up, with yearly 2% discounts on premiums for those under 30 – capped at 10%. If anything, it has convinced me to do the opposite. Earlier this year, my mother and I decided to allow my private health insurance to lapse. The costs, on anyone’s calculation, are terrible. The industry feels dysfunctional and slightly rotten – with complaints to the ombudsman rising by 24% in 2015. Statistically, health insurance is a bad deal for any young person, who will on average spend more than they get back and rely on the public system more often than not. In many ways, that is the how the system is meant to work. For the young consumer, the maths don’t add up. A discount of between 2% and 10% is not enticing for a package that a young person will probably never use, in an industry where 13% of policies were classed as “junk” for not covering heart attack or cancer. Even for those over 30, there is still no reasonable incentive, according to the consumer group Choice. For every year that someone over 30 goes without insurance, the government adds a 2% loading to their premium, to a maximum of 70%. But Choice’s analysis showed that someone could wait until 45 to take insurance, while copping a 30% loading, and still save $9,000 compared with taking low-quality insurance at 30. For someone my age, a single health insurance policy will cost around $800 a year. On that basis, the discount if I signed up now would be $16 in the first year, rising to $80. It is a middling, pointless incentive. For those simply buying for peace of mind, the cost is frequently unbearable, the discount negligible and the product is an odd bundle of non-ideal features. I am lucky enough to have no outstanding health conditions that would require private insurance. My current plan is a basic version, with dental and optical (which I do not need) but no hospital cover. If a medical condition arose unexpectedly, it would probably be of little use. The plan at the moment is to pay out of pocket for what I need, and look at insurance again if my health situation changes. According to Jennifer Doggett, a fellow for the Centre for Policy Development, the government should not be trying to convince young people to buy insurance, but to find other ways to fund healthcare. “The question is not how we should shoehorn or bribe or coerce young people into private health,” she tells me. “Statistically, it’s a bad deal even for older, middle aged people, in some cases up until 65. “The question should be what is the best way to fund our growing healthcare bill. Private health insurance is not that efficient. Tax is more efficient. It is entirely possible to fund a private health system without private health insurance.” She says many purchases of private insurance are driven by misconceptions. “The problem is that often young people have not had much contact with the health system, their knowledge of what is available on our public system is low. Governments and health funds play on that and create a system of fear – that it’s part of becoming an adult, like moving out of home and getting a driver’s licence. “The quality of care in the public system is just as good if not better, from all the evidence we have. People have this false idea of private health insurance, you take it out and everything is taken care of.” With this push to sign up the young, there is an all-too-familiar generational bind at play. By buying insurance they infrequently use, young people foot the bill for older generations – pooling the risk and cost of healthcare. This would be fine if young people had the same financial prospects that previous generations did. But in other sectors, young people are struggling to afford housing, while generations above them sit on rising property prices. Wage growth is stagnant and insecure work disproportionately affects younger Australians. Wealth is heavily concentrated among older generations, making any plan to prop up healthcare through the spending of the young flawed. It is hard see how anybody my age without a pre-existing medical condition is going to be convinced by a minor change in policy. The government’s initiative is still fundamentally a bad deal, and one that many young Australians will reject."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/13/it-lifted-its-leg-on-a-picnic-basket-share-your-stories-about-dogs-in-public-spaces","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T05:05:10Z","webTitle":"'It lifted its leg on a picnic basket'.

Share your stories about dogs in public spaces","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Dogs can be loyal and caring friends. Or they can get you into trouble with the police. You might have seen the story of the dog who, while on an off-leash beach, licked a baby and whose mother called triple zero saying her child had been attacked. The owner was cautioned by the police and had to fork out $238 for failing to maintain what was called “effective control” of his dog in an off-leash area. Reasonable intervention for irresponsible behaviour or self-righteous overreaction? We asked Guardian staff about their experiences with man’s best friend. Share your story in the comments below. ‘Dog are still just animals – not people’ I love dogs, but I am starting to lose patience with some of their owners. A couple of recent experiences sum it up for me. The first was when my children were on the play equipment at a local park when a personal trainer with his pitbull and a client came along. He left his pitbull to snuffle around while getting his client to do chin ups on the monkey bars. Sod the terrified children running away from his menacing dog. Again, at the children’s playground, a dog walker came through the child’s bike track with his dog off the leash. The dog darted across the track causing children on bikes and scooters to pile up, then came over and lifted its leg on a nearby picnic basket, completely ignoring its owners calls who later tried to laugh it off: “aren’t you a naughty boy”, she said, as if to a toddler who had blown a raspberry. Both of these encounters were in areas where dogs were not permitted – even dogs on a leash. So I have little sympathy for dog owners complaining about children invading their off-leash areas when my experience has been the opposite. The reality is we need to share most of our public spaces between people and dogs – we can’t divide the world into dog areas and human areas – but for that to work dog owners need to be responsible. I know dogs are great companions and endlessly loyal and friendly and lovely, but they are still just animals – not people. In shared public spaces people should come first. – Patrick Keneally ‘Dogs and non-dog-owners can interact with benefits for all’ As the owner of a friendly but exuberant dog, I have occasionally had to deal with situations when her behaviour has annoyed other park users. The sunbathers and the guy sitting cross-legged meditating with his eyes closed did get a bit of a surprise, it’s true, but in both cases it was an off-leash park, so I felt no lasting sense of guilt. In the vast majority of cases real problems arise only when people cannot respect the rules – they let their dogs off in inappropriate places, or have unrealistic expectations of how dogs behave in an off-leash park. Sometimes there are grey areas and everyone needs to use common sense – I regularly take my dogs to a park that is mostly off-leash but also has a children’s play area with no fence around it. As with cycling and other activities where there is competition for public space, no group is ever completely in the right or in the wrong. But in the right environment dogs and non-dog-owners can interact with benefits for all. My regular walking venue, Sydney Park, where off-leash dogs mix freely with cyclists, runners, children, Westconnex protesters and people enjoying all kinds of fitness activities, is a harmonious and quite wonderful place 99% of the time. We regulate dogs in ways that would have been unthinkable a few decades ago – mostly entirely for the good, with microchipping, desexing, changed behaviour on disposing of poo, and rules on where they can run free. But it would be a shame if anxiety over dogs resulted in too many restrictions. As Melinda Houston pointed out in her piece for Fairfax Media, dogs that are rarely exercised off the leash are more likely to be the ones that bark all day or exhibit destructive behaviour because they are bored and have excess energy. For children, learning how to interact with dogs is a necessary and, for many, hugely enjoyable part of growing up. But obviously it is up to dog owners to help make that process as safe and non-stressful as possible for everyone. – Mike Ticher ‘There’s no telling what could spook a dog’ As someone who grew up with four dogs in the family, from very large to small, I love them. I’m completely comfortable with them and don’t mind interacting with a new dog, confident that I would know how to handle the situation if it reacted badly. But that’s with a couple of decades of experience. I don’t own a dog now, but I have small children and have since developed some frustrations with dog owners. Some dog owners. #notalldogowners Despite my own love of dogs, I am furious at owners who do not have their dogs on leashes in public spaces. Whether it’s on the footpath, at the playground or kicking a ball on the oval, I would not have to worry if your dog was on a leash. It could not run up to my child uninvited. It could not, unrestrained, lick their face, or jump up on them, or knock them over in exuberant play. And while those experiences are fun and lovely with a known dog – they can be unpredictable. There’s no way for me as a parent to know if that run, or lick, or jump, is going to be friendly, or irrevocably change my child’s life – and yours – for the worse. I’ve seen too many stories about children and adults being attacked and mauled, even by the family dog. There’s no telling what could spook a dog, and it is the owner’s responsibility to restrain them. This is not a matter of “teach your kids how to behave”. It’s a matter of keeping an animal restrained in places where they should be. I don’t take my children into dog off-leash areas because that’s the place for dogs to run as freely as they wish. Everywhere else, put it on a leash. – Dave Earley ‘Not even replacing the cake could calm the parents’ “Labs are ruled by their stomachs”, I was told when I picked up Tommy as a 10 week old pup. “That’s why you can train them so well”, she added. I bought Tommy as a companion for my wife. She had to spend six months on her own in Canberra when I moved up to Sydney in 2001. Fast forward five years and Tommy was a lively dog who was indeed ruled by his stomach. He basically developed tunnel vision if he saw any eating possibility and took off like an Exocet missile in the direction of food. I could always tell when he was going for food as he had an extra turn of speed that he reserved soley for honing in on an eating possibility. One fine Saturday I went to Sydney park for an afternoon walk with Tommy. I usually walked him down there off his leash without incident. About 200 metres away was a six-year-old’s birthday party. On a small table was a birthday cake in the final stages of having the candles lit. The children were gathered around to sing. Tommy took off at food targeting speed and my manic screams had zero effect. He didn’t even slow as he jumped over the table, sending chips, lollies, drinks and parents flying in all directions and taking the whole cake with him. Not even replacing the cake could calm the parents of the children at this birthday party, and I don’t blame them. Tommy, covered in cream, jam and cake, happily panted as I drove him home, oblivious to the turmoil he had caused. I never let our dogs off the leash now, unless we are in a very remote location – like the Simpson Desert. – Mike Bowers Share your story in the comments below."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2017/oct/13/facebook-advertising-ban-leaves-not-for-profit-dumbfounded","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T01:46:40Z","webTitle":"Facebook ad ban over nude artwork shocks women's not-for-profit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/13/facebook-advertising-ban-leaves-not-for-profit-dumbfounded","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/oct/13/facebook-advertising-ban-leaves-not-for-profit-dumbfounded","fields":{"headline":"Facebook ad ban over nude artwork shocks women's not-for-profit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Victorian Women’s Trust, a not-for-profit organisation that supports women and girls through research and advocacy, has been banned by Facebook from advertising a tote bag for sale as part of a fundraising drive. The bag features a picture of two nude women dancing and was created by the Melbourne artist Frances Cannon, who uses her work to promote self-esteem, positive body image and self-love. The trust is selling the bag to raise funds to carry out its work but fears it will now lose money after it was banned from promoting the ad on Facebook and Instagram. The trust’s manager of strategic communications, Allyson Oliver-Perham, said the trust depended on public donations to do its work. “This bag was in no way meant to be controversial,” she told Guardian Australia. “Our work is centred around research and advocacy and in order to do that work we are dependent on donations and need to reach new audiences. This project was targeted towards younger women, who we are trying to inform about the work we do. “I’m just dumbfounded by Facebook’s response to this. The artwork is supposed be really nice and positive, it depicts a celebration of women supporting each other, dancing and coming together. It fits in with the work of the artist, Frances Cannon, whose work promotes body positivity.” A representative from Facebook told Oliver-Perham: “Your ad was not approved because it violates a number of Facebook’s ad policies. “We don’t allow adverts that depict nudity, even if it isn’t sexual in nature. This includes the use of nudity for artistic or educational purposes. Adverts like these are sensitive in nature and hence are not allowed.” Oliver-Perham tried to adhere to Facebook’s policy by using strategically placed emojis to cover up the nudity in the artwork. But Facebook did not accept the changes because the location of the emojis “imply nudity”. “Such sexual images are not allowed,” the Facebook representative said. Oliver-Perham said she was at a loss as to what to do. “We’re just shocked,” she said. “We worked so hard to bring this bag into fruition and to use female artists and photographers. It’s been months of work. We had photographer Breeana Dunbar come in and take beautiful images of the bag so that we could promote it. “The fact is that organisations need Facebook these days in order to reach new audiences. That’s just the way things are now.” Facebook has previously attracted criticism for allowing photos and posts that depict violence against women while banning inoffensive images of female nudity. In March, the social media giant blocked a promotion by the Melbourne art auction house Mossgreen for a work by the Australian artist Charles Blackman. The oil painting, Women Lovers, depicts two naked women at rest, a black cat next to them. At the time, Mossgreen said artworks it had promoted featuring naked men had not been censored. Last year Facebook came under global criticism for censoring the famous image of Phan Thị Kim Phúc, then nine years old, running naked and screaming from a napalm attack during the Vietnam war, which had been shared by a Norwegian newspaper. It subsequently backtracked, after initially saying it was “difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/14/serco-run-prison-asks-inmates-to-donate-for-national-poverty-week","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T21:00:43Z","webTitle":"Serco-run prison asks inmates to donate for national poverty week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/14/serco-run-prison-asks-inmates-to-donate-for-national-poverty-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/14/serco-run-prison-asks-inmates-to-donate-for-national-poverty-week","fields":{"headline":"Serco-run prison asks inmates to donate for national poverty week","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Multinational outsourcing giant Serco has asked inmates at one of its private prisons to donate money for national poverty week, a move critics have labelled “tone deaf”. Serco, which posted a global £82.1m ($139m) profit in 2016, is hosting a movie night at Acacia prison in Western Australia, as its sole contribution to national poverty week next week. Inmates are asked to make a gold coin donation to participate, because “it is important for people who have committed crimes against society to have the opportunity to give something back”. Serco said the event was the idea of inmates, and was being run by its non-government partner, rehabilitation provider Outcare. The company said the event was part of efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate prisoners through a “responsible prisoner” model, which encourages inmates to make positive choices and plan their post-release future. “These events are chosen by prisoners themselves who, with our NGO partners, then plan, arrange and run the events. Our staff provide outstanding support and make their own contributions,” a spokesman for the company said. But critics have criticised Serco’s approach to national poverty week as a “tone deaf, hypocritical exercise that does nothing to help people in real poverty”. The Anti-Poverty Network of South Australia said most inmates were typically in poverty themselves. “It beggars belief that a multibillion-dollar company like Serco that has made its money from human rights abuses would think it appropriate to demand money from prisoners on anti-poverty week,” its spokeswoman, Nijole Naujokas, said. “Most prisoners are in poverty themselves and many times a lack of financial resources contributes to the decision to commit certain crimes and subsequent recidivism.” The Acacia prison runs another charity program to support local groups, which relies on a prisoner-led reparation committee. This year, the committee identified homelessness, at-risk youth, and domestic violence as its areas of focus. It expects to make a $30,000 commitment of “direct sponsorship, time, and materials” to six groups working in the area. Serco’s operation of the Acacia facility was scrutinised late last year as part of a broader report by the state’s inspector of custodial services, Neil Morgan. The prison held about 1,468 prisoners, but just 36.5% of beds were found to be compliant with Australasian guidelines, the report said. Double bunking had caused crowding in many units, the report said. Many services were found to be insufficient, including dental and mental health support and the access to the oval and gymnasium was restricted. Naujokas said Serco should spend more of its own money “making prisoners lives and detention centres more comfortable, rather than cutting corners”. Serco – a behemoth consultancy that provides a broad range of services for governments and corporations worldwide – found itself in the spotlight this week after the federal government announced it would help run Centrelink’s troubled call centre. Under the deal 250 staff from a Serco subsidiary will join the call centre in a bid to improve performance and waiting times. Labor, the Greens, and the main public sector union all voiced opposition to the privatisation of a critical public service. Serco has run Australia’s onshore immigration detention centres since 2009, and operates private prisons at Acacia, the Wandoo reintegration facility, and the Southern Queensland Correctional Centre. It is also part of a consortium that will build and operate a 1,700 bed prison near Grafton, in New South Wales, expected to be Australia’s largest correctional centre. The Anti-Poverty Network is holding its conference next week, which it said was the only event of its kind organised by low-income people, for low-income people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/12/bruce-arena-usa-coach-future-world-cup-soccer","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T22:18:01Z","webTitle":"Bruce Arena says he has no interest in leading US 2022 World Cup campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/12/bruce-arena-usa-coach-future-world-cup-soccer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/12/bruce-arena-usa-coach-future-world-cup-soccer","fields":{"headline":"Bruce Arena says he has no interest in leading US 2022 World Cup campaign","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The USA coach, Bruce Arena, has hinted he may soon leave his post with the national team in an interview with the Washington Post. The US missed out on qualification for the World Cup for the first time since 1986 when they lost to Trinidad &amp; Tobago on Tuesday night, and Arena said he is unlikely to lead the team in their attempt to reach the 2022 tournament. “Obviously, I have no interest in going on a four-year cycle right now,” Arena told the Post. “I’ll do whatever is right. That is the approach I am going to take.” Arena took over the team last year after Jürgen Klinsmann was fired following a run of poor results. But Arena failed to improve US fortunes and they suffered dismal losses to Costa Rica and Trinidad &amp; Tobago as they missed out on qualification. Arena said his team had been unlucky against Trinidad &amp; Tobago but conceded the fault ultimately lay with the team he leads. “Look at the two goals we conceded: how bizarre,” he said. “Does it get any more bizarre than that? So you are down two goals, you get a goal early in the second half and there’s plenty of time to get a second goal. We had our chances. But what can you say? Even despite conceding those two bizarre goals, we still positioned ourselves to get out of there with a point. I can’t look anywhere else except inside our team.” US Soccer have called a press conference for Friday morning, leading to speculation that Arena or the organization’s president, Sunil Gulati, may stand down. There have also been calls for the federation to address the way it develops young players after the national team were outclassed by teams with inferior resources and revenue. But Arena, who had a long and distinguished career as a domestic coach in the US, said clubs need to do a better job of nurturing players. “Why do people think US Soccer is in charge of player development? Players play in clubs,” said Arena, who won five MLS Cups during spells in charge of DC United and LA Galaxy. “Why is that US Soccer’s responsibility? They support the clubs in this country, they support player development, but that’s not their responsibility. “They are a governing body that runs our national team programs. They have coaching education. All of that has to get better, but the infrastructure now for player development in the United States is set. There will be more players developed over the years. Every MLS club has an academy program. Everyone has done a lot of leg work and invested a lot of money to get it going.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2017/oct/13/champions-cup-2017-18-predictions-saracens-scarlets-exeter","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T08:50:33Z","webTitle":"Rugby Champions Cup predictions: our writers on the 2017-18 competition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/13/champions-cup-2017-18-predictions-saracens-scarlets-exeter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/13/champions-cup-2017-18-predictions-saracens-scarlets-exeter","fields":{"headline":"Rugby Champions Cup predictions: our writers on the 2017-18 competition","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Who will shine in the group stages? Robert Kitson It is hardly original to single out Clermont Auvergne but Les Jaunards will surely conquer Europe eventually. It may just be that having the defending champions Saracens in their pool proves a blessing in disguise. The knockout stage nerves that have undone them in the past will not be a factor. Paul Rees The one that picks up victories on the road, a habit Saracens have got into and, in the league last season, Exeter. Gerard Meagher Exeter have targeted a marked improvement in Europe this season and their fast start to the Premiership can be considered fine preparation. Must stick to what they’re good at though. Mike Aylwin Saracens will shine because they’re still the best team in Europe. But it’s not a very interesting answer [see surprise packages]. No particular reason for looking beyond usual suspects, but if Glasgow don’t count as one of those keep an eye out for them. Who will be surprise packages? RK La Rochelle. The men from the Atlantic Coast like to play a spectacular all-court brand of rugby and have emerged as serious Top 14 players. The crowd at the Stade Marcel-Deflandre are a passionate bunch and their black-and-yellow-clad team will be keen to make an impact in their debut season of Champions Cup rugby. PR What constitutes a surprise? Treviso winning a match? Castres interested in the final rounds? Wales and/or Scotland supplying a quarter-finalist? On current form, Wasps, Clermont Auvergne, Racing 92 and Ospreys getting into the last eight is more possible than probable, but 11 seasons after they last went through the Scarlets look equipped which, as league champions, they should be. GM Hardly a surprise as they are the Pro14 champions but the Scarlets should at least reach the quarter-finals which would be demonstrable progress. There may be life in Toulon yet. MA There aren’t supposed to be any surprise packages in the new Europe, are there? Treviso are the only weak team, and they’ll be gone from next season. The Scarlets are superb but whether, as champions of the Pro14 and thrice European semi-finalists, they would count as a surprise is moot. How will Pro14 teams perform? RK Potentially better than the Premiership’s representatives. Scarlets will need a good start against Toulon and Bath but both they and Leinster are good bets for the last eight. Ulster may well join them and Glasgow will not be far away either. No one should ever write off Munster and only the Ospreys look like enduring a painful campaign. PR It is five seasons since they supplied a finalist, but only four teams have made the final in that time. Leinster and Munster will again lead the charge, Glasgow and the Scarlets have the talent if not the experience and Ulster could have had a worse group. GM Inconsistently. Ulster have been unable to stay the course of the qualifying campaign in recent years while Munster are in transition. Leinster’s pool is very tricky, the Ospreys are cannon fodder, so it may be all up to the Scarlets. MA This is meant to be the category of doom, but let’s not forget they’ve only thrice failed to supply a semi‑finalist, and one of those was in 1998, before the league existed. Mind you, another was 2016. The grip of Munster and Leinster has loosened, but there remain lively propositions. For now… Who will make their name? RK Bath’s Zach Mercer is going to be a serious player; Exeter’s Sam Simmonds is another exciting English back-row prospect. Keep an eye out, too, for Toulon’s Argentinian No8 Facundo Isa, his flying Fijian team-mates Josua Tuisova and Semi Radradra plus Clermont’s rampaging Alivereti Raka. PR Steff Evans (Scarlets), Charles Piutau (Ulster), Nemani Nadolo (Montpellier), Finn Russell (Glasgow), Chris Ashton (Toulon), among others – and any Saracen. GM It is wingers who set the pulse racing and there are two in Pool 5 – Toulon’s recent league convert Semi Radradra and Steff Evans of the Scarlets – who should do precisely that. Also keep an eye out for the Montpellier flanker Yacouba Camara. MA Steff Evans. If the Scarlets are the darlings of those who value wit and ambition, which they are, this guy best represents them. If he’s not in the Wales team this season, they definitely have an obsession with size. Small but deadly. Watch out, too, for Tom Collins of Northampton – a very similar type of player. Who are the ones to watch in the Challenge Cup? RK Toulouse have never previously kicked off the Euro season in the Challenge Cup but they are a big club on the way back up. Their first round opponents Sale should be particularly wary. PR The French aristocrats Toulouse are mucking it with the hoi-polloi for the first time, but Lyon have won three away matches this season; Friday’s game at Cardiff Blues will tell if they are bothered. Newcastle now have the resources to fight on two fronts. GM If Toulouse or Stade Français take it seriously – and that is a big if – they have the pedigree. Gloucester – beaten finalists last season – and Sale lead the English charge, aware that the winners go straight into next season’s Champions Cup. MA Obviously this will be dominated by the English and French, but if we’re simply watching out for someone let’s pick Zebre. Maybe talk of an Italian-free Champions Cup is premature. Zebre are fourth in their Pro14 conference. As things stand, they’d be in a play-off for Europe with Edinburgh, another team worth watching. Who will make the last eight? RK La Rochelle, Ulster, Clermont, Saracens, Leinster, Leicester, Toulon, Scarlets. PR Wasps, Saracens, Leinster, Munster, Scarlets, Toulon, Clermont, Exeter.

An investigation could be opened into suggestions Cahill was paid to promote an online travel agency after scoring an extra-time winner against Syria in the Socceroos’ World Cup qualifying win at ANZ Stadium on Tuesday. The striker’s 109th minute header – his second of the night and 50th goal for his country – sent Australia through to an intercontinental playoff with Honduras. But what happened in the immediate aftermath has prompted scrutiny from the world governing body. After the ball hit the back of the net, Cahill eschewed his usual box-the-corner-flag celebration, instead opting to outstretch his arms, in what appeared to be a physical interpretation of an aeroplane. He then made a T sign with his hands. A Byron Bay-based travel company asked followers on social media soon after full-time if they had seen Cahill, their new brand ambassador, “doing the ... ‘T’” at ANZ Stadium. Cahill replied to the post with eight emojis, including a football and an aeroplane. The post has since been deleted. “Always a pleasure,” Cahill responded on his Instagram account. “Another chapter written and plenty more to come. Amazing team performance and really proud of everyone tonight, team, staff and fans. #FEARLESS.” He added four aeroplane emojis and tagged the travel company. The travel company is also a sponsor of Cahill’s Melbourne City and its logo appears on the back of the club’s shorts. While there is nothing specific in Fifa regulations relating to a player using body parts to promote sponsors, Law 4 on players’ equipment states a player will be sanctioned if they remove their jersey to reveal slogans or advertising. This law would appear to extend to cover the removal of shorts, as Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner found out in 2012 when he was fined €100,000 for promoting a betting company on his underpants. Using gestures to make political points is also outlawed under Fifa’s disciplinary code. The Lazio player Paolo Di Canio received a one-match ban and was fined €7,000 for a Roman salute at an Italian game in 2005, and in 2013 Giorgos Katidis was banned for life from playing for Greece after giving a Nazi salute. The laws of the game state that disciplinary sanctions are the responsibility of the competition organiser and that the referee will include details in the match report. “Fifa is reviewing and analysing the reports from the referees and the match commissioners for all matches in Fifa competitions,” a Fifa spokesman told Sky Sports. “Events which require further attention may be communicated accordingly.” It is not the first time Cahill’s celebrations have made headlines. When at Everton he apologised after celebrating with a “handcuff” gesture – a nod to his brother who had been jailed for an assault that left a man partially blinded in one eye. During the Socceroos’ World Cup qualifier against Kyrgyzstan in Canberra in 2015, Cahill pretended to turn over the pages of a book before delivering his trademark boxing routine by the corner flag. He had just released a children’s book and an autobiography. On New Year’s Eve in 2016 he attracted further attention, this time for not being able to celebrate in his usual style, after a Central Coast Mariners ball boy upended the flag before Cahill reached the corner of the pitch. The day after the Syria game, reports surfaced that Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou would leave his post following next month’s tie, regardless of the result and Cahill said he was disappointed that the speculation over Postecoglou’s future had taken the focus away from World Cup qualification. “I feel that this angle, the day after the biggest game in Australian soccer to qualify for a fourth consecutive World Cup, is not needed,” he said. “I think we concentrate on celebrating a 2-1 victory, firstly, and looking forward to a full house at home in Sydney of 80,000-plus. Speculation is always going to come with our game and it is just disappointing it has come out the day after.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/13/peter-costello-calls-for-nationalisation-of-superannuation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T22:14:54Z","webTitle":"Peter Costello calls for nationalisation of superannuation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/13/peter-costello-calls-for-nationalisation-of-superannuation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/13/peter-costello-calls-for-nationalisation-of-superannuation","fields":{"headline":"Peter Costello calls for nationalisation of superannuation","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Peter Costello has called for the nationalisation of superannuation, arguing that the flow of compulsory contributions should be wrested from unions and banks, and instead invested by a new government agency. Speaking in Melbourne on Thursday the former Coalition treasurer said the government should “show some interest in managing (super) in a cost-efficient way” in order to end “arbitrating” between industry and private funds. “This is my personal view: instead of the government arbitrating between industry funds and private funds, there is a fair argument that compulsory payments, the so-called default payments, should be allocated to a national safety net administrator, let’s call it the Super Guarantee Agency,” he reportedly said, suggesting the system used in Canada was better. “It would be a not-for-profit agency which would set up its own investment board like the Canadian pension plan.” About $2.3tn in workers’ super is sitting in private accounts as part of the former Keating government’s compulsory superannuation system, and the huge sum was expected to earn $23bn in fees. Costello’s intervention comes as the federal government has asked the Productivity Commission to come up with ways to prise default super contributions out of the hands of industry funds. Its draft report in March suggested changing the way funds are allocated by creating one default fund meaning that funds were separated from awards and union-backed funds would lose their special status. However, industry funds have pushed back against the idea. Nicholas Gruen, an economist who sat on the board of the Productivity Commission, argued in the Guardian that public sector superannuation funds, currently used by many workers, should be opened to all Australians. “Public sector funds achieved the highest average net returns over the 14 years to 2013, exceeding those of the entire Apra-regulated superannuation industry by 1.1 percentage points, industry funds by 0.6 percentage points and retail funds by 2.2 percentage points per year over that period,” Gruen said “With $2tn in super, there’s a vast sum at stake. And peace of mind for Australians knowing that they could access the same low-cost, professionally managed super any public servant can access rather than the current regulatory palaver.” Costello said that while he believed people should still be able to choose their super provide, there would be “huge economies of scale” in setting up a national agency. “It would end the fight between the funds that have been unable to attract the money voluntarily,” Fairfax reported. “Default contributions are at the moment spread between many funds, allocated to many different products, many of whom use the same manager and all of whom pay fees to do so.” Costello, who was treasurer during the Howard government and is chairman of the Future Fund, said he was speaking in a personal capacity. Polling has showed that 70% of Australians believe all superannuation funds should be not-for-profit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2017/oct/12/worcester-races-non-runners-peter-scudamore","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T19:26:05Z","webTitle":"Worcester branded ‘a joke’ after drying ground produces 33 non-runners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/12/worcester-races-non-runners-peter-scudamore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2017/oct/12/worcester-races-non-runners-peter-scudamore","fields":{"headline":"Worcester branded ‘a joke’ after drying ground produces 33 non-runners","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Worcester racecourse was subjected to some stinging criticism on Thursday after the embarrassment of a day’s racing blighted by non-runners. The racing surface proved to be drier and quicker than expected, leading to a total of 33 non‑runners, almost as many as the 41 horses who actually turned up, with two races being reduced to only two runners apiece. “Really disappointing” and “shoddy” were words used by one racegoer, who added: “We should be betting on who will be left for the last race.” There were also strong words from Peter Scudamore, an eight-times champion jockey who was born just up the road in Herefordshire and was returning to the track for the first time in years. “I don’t know the politics behind the running of the track but, in a modern society, I can’t see what the attraction is for someone to go there on a day like that,” Scudamore said. “I found it depressing. “It’s like going to see a play and the theatre’s not ready and the actors don’t turn up. Maybe the public are quite happy to stand there and be kicked in the balls. I thought it was bloody quick ground. Maybe I’m just used to northern ground.” Scudamore, who now lives near Perth with his partner, the trainer Lucinda Russell, added: “There’s no justification for that many non-runners. It almost becomes a joke. Everything’s a non‑runner, there’s no interest in being there. What was acceptable in my time and my father’s time is not acceptable now.” Worcester’s going was described in the morning papers as “good”, became “good to firm in places” on Thursday morning and was “good to firm” all round after the first race. That prompted 23 going-related withdrawals after the racing had begun, a level of absenteeism that attracted the interest of the British Horseracing Authority, which will raise the matter with course officials. Alan King sent three horses to the track but withdrew two after his first runner, who generally likes a sound surface, raced as though the ground was too dry even for her. “It’s very disappointing,” King said, “although that’s not the biggest problem I have with Worcester. The facilities for owners and trainers are just awful, the worst of any course I go to. In this day and age, it’s not acceptable and something needs to be done.” “Very disappointing” was also the response from Nigel Twiston-Davies, another trainer who found himself returning home with unraced animals. “I thought it was firm,” he said of the ground and pointed out that the time for the first race was eight seconds faster than the standard for the track, suggesting lightning-quick ground. But there was some support for Worcester, including from the champion jockey Richard Johnson, who rode two winners. “They’ve done a great job, the track’s in good condition. It’s just the weather the last few days; the track’s dried out and it’s fast.” Johnson reckoned the problem was largely to do with trainers being understandably reluctant to risk “winter horses” with six months of action ahead of them. Had the same conditions arisen two months ago, there would have been plenty of summer-ground horses to take part, he suggested. Jonjo O’Neill, who trained a winner on the card, described the ground as “lovely”. “There’s plenty of moisture underneath it, really. I don’t feel there’s any problem with it,” he said. Libby O’Flaherty, Worcester’s clerk of the course, blamed forecast rain that failed to appear on Wednesday. “We were due between 3mm and 10mm yesterday and didn’t get anything. It was supposed to come at 1pm, then they said it would come at 3pm. This morning, we were forecast a normal dry day but it wasn’t, it was a glorious day and breezy and the ground dried out. I can’t change the weather. If I’d watered and we’d got 5mm to 10mm, we’d have ended up with good to soft ground. They all entered expecting good ground.” Responding to King’s point, a spokesperson for ARC, owner of Worcester, said development options were being considered. For Dan Skelton, also a winning trainer on the card, the day showed the limitations of the sport’s recent initiative to curb the number of non-runners. “Everyone wants runners,” he said, “but if you run one on the wrong ground [and injure them], they miss a year or more. We have to be allowed to make those decisions. “A going description is only an opinion. Non-runners leave everyone pissed off. The racecourse looks silly, because they’ve called the ground wrong, the jockeys have gone there and not ridden a horse, trainers and owners can’t see their horses run.

Two women – Asia Argento and Zoë Brock – have claimed that Lombardo, who formerly worked as a Miramax executive in Italy, helped set up encounters with Weinstein under false pretences. Argento, an Italian actor, has accused Lombardo of leading her to Weinstein’s suite in the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc in the south of France in 1997, after he falsely told her she would be attending a party. When they arrived at the room she found the movie mogul alone, and Argento alleges the meeting led to her being raped by Weinstein. Brock, a model and writer from New Zealand, said Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances when she was 23 years old, and that Lombardo was part of the “pack of hyenas” who would “hunt” for him, enabling the producer’s alleged abuses. Sitting in his attorney’s office in Rome, in an old palazzo tucked between the Tiber and the Vatican, an old picture of Federico Fellini and Robert De Niro leaning against the wall, Lombardo responded to the multiple allegations with a mix of irritated incredulity and steadfast denials. “I did not hunt for him,” Lombardo said in direct response to Brock’s allegation. “It is not my style … it is not my relationship with Weinstein,” he added. For decades, Weinstein was a Hollywood kingmaker. He is now facing allegations of sexual misconduct from more than two dozen women, and three allegations of rape. Weinstein has “unequivocally denied” any “allegations of non-consensual sex” and has said he is hoping to get a “second chance”. But as more stories of his allegedly predatory behaviour emerge, so too are questions about the people in Weinstein’s intimate circle who may have known and indeed helped the producer to gain physical access to young and unsuspecting women. Among many questions about Lombardo’s relationship with Weinstein is what role he played at Miramax, which reportedly continued to pay the Italian executive for months after the production company’s short-lived Italy office was closed in 2003, according to an account that was published in 2004 by the New York Times. Lombardo emphatically denies that he ever brought a then-21-year-old Argento to Weinstein’s suite in 1997, when they were attending the Cannes film festival. He also said he could not recall having ever met Brock, although the model told the Guardian that Lombardo invited her to his home in Rome, which he shared with his then-girlfriend and where she once spent the night.Lombardo rejected the notion that any single man can enable another man’s sexual abuse of a woman by bringing the woman to an abuser’s hotel room. “So you can’t complain with the driver or with the doorman of the hotel who sends the woman up, you see what I mean?” Lombardo said. Weinstein, Lombardo said, would not have needed him to meet women or anyone else. “He can pick up the phone and have lunch or dinner with whoever he wants,” he added. He denied any knowledge of Weinstein’s sexual activities, saying that such things were not discussed among men, especially situations in which a man might be rejected by a woman. In an hour-long interview, Lombardo acknowledged, however, that he had introduced the media mogul to “countless” people over the years. He said meetings took place in Weinstein’s hotel suites because he and the people he met with were famous. Asked whether he ever questioned what Weinstein’s intentions might have been when he met young women privately, Lombardo said: “You cannot talk about [intentions]. Out of 1,000 people, to know his intentions with three people, I don’t know ... it’s impossible.” Pressed about whether he knew what was happening behind closed doors, he claimed: “But you are joking. Of course not.” He said: “What world are you talking about?” and added that Guardian journalists had a biased view of men. The allegations against Weinstein have “shocked” him, Lombardo said, but he declined to comment further. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton said she found Weinstein’s alleged behaviour “disgusting” and said the woman who have stepped forward should be “commended” for their courage. Asked how she felt when she first read the allegations of sexual assault by Weinstein who had helped raise substantial sums for her and Barack Obama, she responded: “I was shocked and appalled because I had known him through politics as many Democrats had, he’s been a supporter, he’s been a funder, for all of us for Obama, for me, people who’ve run for office in the United States. “It was just disgusting and the stories that have come out are heartbreaking and I really commend the women who have been willing to step forward and tell their stories,” she told the Andrew Marr programme. But she said society had to do something to make sure this type of alleged behaviour was not tolerated in any sector including politics. Brock, 43, alleged that Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances at Cannes film festival in 1997. She told the Guardian she had been in Weinstein’s hotel room with a few other people when they left, leaving her “suddenly … alone in a remote hotel suite with Harvey fucking Weinstein”. She alleged that Weinstein took his clothes off and asked her for a massage, forcing her to run into a bathroom to escape. She said what most disturbed her was how a network of men, including Lombardo, had allegedly enabled Weinstein on the night of her encounter, seemingly setting her up to be one-on-one in the hotel. “They went behind my back, betrayed me and organised a date with the guy. That was just horrifying to me,” she said. “That is the most sinister thing. We’re all used to predators working alone, but when they band up like a pack of hyenas, that’s a whole other ballgame.” She said of Weinstein’s links to Lombardo: “That is scary that a man is that powerful that he can convince other people to hunt for him ... What does that say about society? What does that say about humanity that we would do that? It’s so disturbing to me.” Argento has also pointed a finger of blame at Lombardo, who she said took her to Weinstein’s room when she was 21, in 1997, and claimed it was a Miramax party. She told the New Yorker that when she questioned why no one else was there, Lombardo – referred to in the article as “the producer” – said they had arrived “too early”, before leaving her alone. The alleged rape occurred after he left. Lombardo contacted Argento for the first time in years last week. On 5 October, the day the New York Times broke the story of Weinstein’s alleged serial abuse and harassment, Lombardo sent Argento two messages on Whatsapp that he claimed were jokes. In one, a man wakes up next to a woman in bed after a night of drinking and tries to escape what he believes to be a bad one-night stand, only to see a photograph of the woman downstairs. She’s his wife. In another alleged joke, former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi – who is known for having had “bunga bunga” sex parties with young women – is pictured with a car and a licence plate that reads “escort”. In an earlier interview with Lombardo’s attorney, Bruno della Ragione, the attorney joked that Argento was the “virgin of 2017”. He also suggested that Weinstein’s rapid downfall could be the result of a financial conspiracy against the producer. Lombardo said he sent the messages to Argento by accident. Pulling out his iPhone, he showed a reporter how he regularly sends memes and jokes to his contacts, and that he unwittingly sent the two to Argento, coincidentally as the Weinstein story was breaking. “I sent it by mistake. Maybe hers was close to another name,” he said. Underlying some of the allegations are broader questions about Lombardo’s role at Miramax. The former executive said he first met Weinstein when the two used to vacation on the Caribbean island of St Barts where Weinstein would stay with his family and Lombardo was with friends. Lombardo was hired by Miramax to head the company’s Italian division a few years after they met. According to the New York Times, Miramax paid Lombardo, who was described by the paper as a “longtime friend” of Weinstein, for months after the Italy division was closed, even though he held another full-time job at a real estate company. Miramax’s decision to hire Lombardo in 1999 was controversial, according to the New York Times. He had scant experience in the film industry, but Weinstein insisted he be brought on board."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/12/the-guardian-view-on-an-energy-price-cap-a-stopgap-not-a-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T18:04:44Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on an energy price cap: a stopgap, not a strategy | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/the-guardian-view-on-an-energy-price-cap-a-stopgap-not-a-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/12/the-guardian-view-on-an-energy-price-cap-a-stopgap-not-a-strategy","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on an energy price cap: a stopgap, not a strategy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is much to be said for a limited cap on energy prices. But the details of the government plan that was published on Thursday, promising lower bills for 11 million households, are so vague and its political purpose so brazen that it needs to be treated with great caution. Buyer, beware. It is now the stuff of political legend that when Ed Miliband first proposed the idea of a cap in 2013, it was dismissed as a neo-Marxist project. Yet last year, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) itself came close to making the same recommendation, following an investigation triggered by the record of apparently unjustified price rises in the newly liberalised industry. Between 2004 to 2014, they rose by between 75% (for electricity) and 125% (for gas), for reasons that were impossible for most people to understand or for suppliers to explain. Then at the last election Theresa May poached the idea in a bid to plant the banner of Mayism firmly on Labour territory: the Conservatives would be the new party of the working class. Weakened by election humiliation, she dropped the idea. Last week it was recalled by a prime minister desperate to talk about something other than Brexit. The Tory version of the energy cap is much more modest in its practical effect than in its political symbolism. Analysts estimate it will be fixed somewhere between the maximum chargeable on prepayment tariffs and the average bill. That might save around £50-£100 a year. It won’t transform household finances, and it won’t come into force before the end of next year at the earliest. But it does send a clear signal to the big six suppliers, which provide energy to six out every seven households: stop exploiting those who through loyalty, lack of familiarity with the internet, because they are renters or simply through inertia, never move off the standard variable tariff. But the lack of consumer engagement is only one part of the problem. In its two-year investigation, the CMA identified a whole series of reasons for the obviously imperfect energy market. The worst of these were the prepayment tariffs, an explicit penalty on the poorest households who cannot pay by direct debit and were charged higher rates than anyone else. On the CMA’s recommendations, Ofgem introduced a cap that came into effect earlier this year; this week the regulator announced it would be extended to another million consumers, bringing the total to 5 million. The CMA report also criticised the relationship between the department and the suppliers and warned of disproportionately burdensome regulatory requirements. Among other suggestions, it argued for smarter incentives on limiting transmission losses and a more transparent way of passing costs from generators to suppliers to customers. All in all, it reckoned consumers had been bearing excess costs of more than £1.4bn a year. Although it might buy time, this cap doesn’t tackle any of these structural defects and it is hard to escape the impression that the suppliers will still have the upper hand. The important detail is to be left to negotiation and the government appears to be relying on consumers being inspired to shop around through the rollout of smart meters – which provide accessible detailed information on usage – in a way they don’t at the moment. Yet so far only 6.6 million households have them, not even a quarter of the total who are supposed to benefit from the programme by the time it is completed in 2020. The business secretary, Greg Clark, seems to be trying to invent a form of light-touch interventionism, a middle way between a bigger role for the state as Labour envisages, and a completely free market that many Tory MPs would be more comfortable with. Mrs May hoped this policy would symbolise a new kind of Conservatism. Instead it has been launched by a weakened leader in an overhasty manner that makes it look more than anything like an exercise in political firefighting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/oct/13/morning-mail-police-investigate-harvey-weinstein","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-12T19:54:27Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: police investigate Harvey Weinstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/13/morning-mail-police-investigate-harvey-weinstein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/oct/13/morning-mail-police-investigate-harvey-weinstein","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: police investigate Harvey Weinstein","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 13 October. Top stories Police in London and New York have opened criminal investigations into allegations of sexual abuse against the disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Scotland Yard told the Guardian on Thursday: “The Met has been passed an allegation of sexual abuse by Merseyside police on Wednesday 11 October. The allegation will be assessed by officers.” In Weinstein’s hometown of New York the NYPD is carrying out a “review” looking for new complaints against him. An English actor, Sophie Dix, has come forward to tell the Guardian how her trajectory was “massively cut down” after an alleged sexual assault by Weinstein in a London hotel. And on Thursday, the French actor Florence Darel also accused the producer of sexual harassment, joining a string of other high-profile actors, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Léa Seydoux and Cara Delevingne. The Weinstein Company board of directors has said they had no knowledge of the alleged sexual abuse and would cooperate with any police investigation. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science is meeting on Saturday to discuss suspending Weinstein’s membership, as the Baftas did this week. “The Academy finds the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent, and antithetical to the high standards of the Academy and the creative community it represents,” it said. In video footage released on Wednesday, Weinstein told reporters: “Guys, I’m not doing OK but I’m trying. I gotta get help … You know, we all make mistakes … second chance I hope.” Tony Abbott needs to explain why he has altered his views on climate change, Julie Bishop has said, after his earlier remarks that it is “probably doing good”. The foreign minister rebuked Abbott by recounting his record of signing the Paris climate agreement and setting the renewable energy target. Her comments follow a similar intervention from the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg. On Monday evening Abbott told a climate sceptic thinktank in London that policies to combat climate change were like “primitive people … killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. He also reprised his 2009 assertion that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap”. Militants linked to the Taliban have released a US woman, her Canadian husband and their three children who have been held in captivity for five years, bringing an end to an ordeal the couple described as a “Kafkaesque nightmare”. The couple were captured five years ago while backpacking through Afghanistan, and had three children while being held prisoner. Pakistani troops, operating on intelligence provided by the US, rescued the family after locating them in the mountainous Kurram Valley region that borders Afghanistan. Donald Trump said the rescue showed Pakistan was beginning to respect the US again. Dozens of disability advocacy groups across the country face closure as states withdraw funding before the transition to the national disability insurance scheme. The sector is warning the cuts threaten to leave “huge gaps” in support at a time when it is most needed. Fifty groups in New South Wales alone are threatened by the move. The vast majority of people requiring advocacy support would not be part of the NDIS and the federal assistant disability services minister, Jane Prentice, is calling on states and territories to maintain an “ongoing investment”. Up to 87% of undamaged, edible tomatoes harvested from a Queensland farm never make it to the shop shelf, a study has found, highlighting the problem of food wastage. At every point in the supply chain, edible tomatoes that were odd-shaped or marked, or deemed too small or too large, were rejected because they didn’t meet market standards for premium, unblemished product. The research also found that between 70% and 84% of tomatoes grown were left in the field, because the cost of harvesting and supplying them to market was greater than any profit to be made. The government estimates food waste costs the Australian economy $20bn each year. Sport The Scottish Football Association’s head coach, Gordon Strachan, has quit, it has announced. Scotland missed out on World Cup qualification, finishing third behind England and Slovakia in Group F. Strachan was appointed in 2013 but has been unable to arrest a long run of qualification failures. Scotland have not reached a tournament since the 1998 World Cup. How do you square a frightening Test fast bowler from the mountains with a tertiary-qualified, tattoo-free man whose favourite hobby is “a really good crossword”? Australia’s Pat Cummins talks to Sam Perry as he prepares to make an impact during his first home Test summer. Thinking time Patrick Lukins grew up in a Catholic family in which three of the four children were gay. As it grew increasingly unconventional, and increasingly dear to him, it helped him accept his own sexuality and set an example for his son. “I always thought of my discretion about my sexuality as a strength and I would go to great lengths to hide it. I’ve since realised that strength is the ability to be yourself in a world that will often tell you that you are somehow a lesser person. I want to set an example for my son: not to hide, not to be afraid, but to push outside your comfort zone and be proud of who you are and where you come from.” The pebble-lined shore that borders King’s Run in north-western Tasmania is speckled with middens and once housed seal hides. Elsewhere on the property, a burial site houses the bones of long-dead Tarkanya people. This week the area was signed over to Aboriginal ownership, in a move that marks the end of a 30-year process that started when a thylacine sighting was reported. Calla Wahlquist visited the region that was protected for decades by Geoff King, a third-generation beef grazier, and describes the pivotal role he played. During Taylor Mac’s extravaganza at the Melbourne festival the performer blindfolds us all. “You’re going to be blind for the next hour. If you peek I will publicly shame you,” Mac says casually. We’re five hours into A 24-Decade History of Popular Music, which weaves cabaret, commentary and comedy through 10 popular songs of each decade, from 1776 to the present day. Mac describes A 24-Decade History as a “radical faery realness ritual sacrifice”. “The gathering of the people, that’s the ritual; the audience is the sacrifice”. And that’s the other thrill of the show: the (forced) participation. What’s he done now? Donald Trump has threatened to pull aid to Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria in a series of furious overnight tweets, criticising the island nation’s poor infrastructure and weakening economy: Puerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making.” says Sharyl Attkisson. A total lack of … accountability say the Governor. Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes. Congress to decide how much to spend … We cannot keep FEMA, the Military &amp; the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever! Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald splashes with a large picture of the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, saying the NSW Liberals are poised to release a significant advertising campaign aimed at “reinventing” her 17 months out from the election. “Bad Oil” declares the Adelaide Advertiser with its front-page report about Chevron’s Australia decision to dump its half billion-dollar plan to drill for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight, which has “drawn fire” from the South Australian government. And the ABC has a moving story from last night’s 7.30 report about a male survivor of the Catholic Church, who said the church made him feel like a “beggar” when he asked it to pay medical bills which resulted from the rapes and beatings he received while in its care in the 1960s. Coming up The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the defence minister, Marise Payne, are in South Korea for talks with their ministerial counterparts. The Reserve Bank of Australia releases its financial stability review. And the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts is hosting a summit on “cost-of-living pressures” in Brisbane, with speakers including Dan Mitchell, from the Center for Freedom and Prosperity, Mark Latham and Ross Cameron.

Here’s how","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The bar is set so low for Donald Trump that every day he doesn’t trigger a nuclear confrontation with a distant adversary is seen as a bonus. Today was one such day, as Trump signalled that he would not, after all, tear up the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, as many – including his closest lieutenants – once feared he would. Sure, he disavowed the accord, slamming Tehran as a “rogue regime”, imposing fresh sanctions on the Revolutionary Guard and refusing to certify that Iran has complied with its terms, but he did not feed it into the shredder. Instead, he kicked the decision on its future over to Congress. That certainly puts the deal’s survival in jeopardy, but it does at least live to see another day. That’s a cause for relief, because the international agreement that put severe, if not watertight, constraints on Tehran’s nuclear ambitions had looked set to be the latest victim of an emerging Trump doctrine. Distilled, that credo amounts to: “In the absence of a vision of my own, I’ll destroy everything Obama did.” The day before the Iran decision, Trump made two moves, one involving the gutting of subsidies, designed to wreck Obamacare. Having tried and failed to get Congress to repeal it altogether, Trump is now working to render it unviable, thereby denying millions of Americans affordable healthcare. Whether it’s health or the Paris accord on climate change, Trump is bent on dismantling every last achievement of his predecessor – whose legitimacy as president, whose legitimacy as a US citizen, he never accepted. But the Iran decision also stands as the latest instance of a strategy of containment. Normally that term is used by diplomats to describe policy towards an enemy state. This time, the one being contained is Trump himself. Those doing the containing are the highest ranking officials in the administration, handily abbreviated as MMTK: national security adviser HR McMaster; defence secretary James Mattis; secretary of state Rex Tillerson; and chief of staff John Kelly. Three are former generals, who have concluded that it is their patriotic duty to save America from their president. Republican senator Bob Corker, chair of the senate foreign relations committee, describes Kelly, Mattis and Tillerson as the “people that help separate our country from chaos”. As he put it, “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him.” The fudged decision on Iran seems to be their handiwork. It fits a pattern in which Trump’s most senior officials work to thwart, defy or deceive him. When Trump was railing against the Iran deal, Mattis told Congress it was in the US national interest. When Trump was taunting North Korea’s “little rocket man” by tweet, Tillerson was opening up a secret back channel for talks with Pyongyang. When Trump tweeted his decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military, Mattis quietly ignored him, ensuring that it remains the military’s decision who can and cannot serve. All these moves, coupled with the sight of Corker – a conservative Republican from conservative Tennessee – breaking ranks have led to fevered talk – and hope – that things might be coming to a head, that the Republican dam might be about to break. It has been fuelled by Tillerson’s failure to deny that he had referred to the president as a “fucking moron”. (Apparently Tillerson was incensed by Trump’s desire, expressed during a White House briefing, to increase America’s already massive nuclear arsenal tenfold – as if the ability to destroy the world several times over is not enough.) This week another Republican senator asked Trump if he was recanting his oath of office, in which he had promised to “preserve, protect and defend” the constitution. Hours earlier, Trump had trampled on the first amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, by saying: “It’s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write.” Trump then called for broadcaster NBC to be stripped of its operating “licence”. Never mind that such a thing does not exist: it’s the thought that counts. The notion that Trump’s own party is about to turn on him is not solely wishful thinking by his opponents or the liberal media. Steve Bannon, who exited the White House in August, is said to have told Trump he had only a 30% chance of serving out his full term. Bannon warned his undoing could be the 25th amendment to the constitution. To which Trump naturally replied: “What’s that?” It’s the section that provides for a situation in which the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. If the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet declare Trump unable to do his job, and Congress agrees, they have the power to remove him. Which is why the question of Trump’s mental capacity has suddenly gained traction. Note this week’s depiction of Trump by Vanity Fair as “unravelling” – a lonely, “increasingly unfocused” figure, raging that he hates everyone in the White House. Note too the comments of Trump’s ghostwriter for The Art of the Deal, Tony Schwartz, who tweeted this week: “I know this man. He’s out of control and it’s getting worse … Trump’s grip on reality is spiralling down into paranoia and delusion.” As a fantasy, the 25th amendment has tremendous appeal: who wouldn’t want to end this presidency, swiftly and cleanly? But it is itself a delusion. Can you imagine the current US cabinet, stuffed as it is with sycophants and billionaire know-nothings, turning on their patron for the sake of the country and the world? Several are in trouble for billing the US taxpayer for the needless use of private jets; one is currently being taunted for insisting that, in the manner of Queen Elizabeth, a flag be raised whenever he is in residence. Selfless patriots they are not. Even if they did turn on Trump, would the invertebrates who make up today’s Republican party in Congress do the same? Corker has spoken out – but only after he announced he’s quitting the Senate. The rest barely dare raise a whisper of protest against Trump, even when he’s soiling the flag they claim to revere. If, by some miracle, they did find their spine and remove him, the Trump loyalists would not just swallow it. There could well be street violence, even civil war. No, the only way to remove Trump is for Democrats to do the hard graft of organising, campaigning and winning elections – starting with the midterms of November 2018. So long as Republicans control the House and Senate, Trump is safe. I’m glad that Mattis, Kelly and the others are there to grab Trump’s wrist should he reach for the nuclear button. But even that is only a small comfort. A democracy that relies on a group of generals to frustrate an elected leader is in a bad way. The president does indeed pose a clear and present danger to America and the world. But democracy is what put him there – and only democracy can get him out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/15/sahel-niger-us-special-forces-islamists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"US special forces deaths in Niger lift veil on shadow war against Islamists in Sahel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/sahel-niger-us-special-forces-islamists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/15/sahel-niger-us-special-forces-islamists","fields":{"headline":"US special forces deaths in Niger lift veil on shadow war against Islamists in Sahel","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When four US special forces soldiers died in an ambush earlier this month in scrubby desert in western Niger, attention was suddenly focused on one of the most remote and chaotic war zones on the planet. The US troops had been embedded with a larger unit of Nigerien troops and were attacked as they left a meeting with local community leaders a few dozen kilometres from the remote town of Tongo Tongo. Some reports claimed US troops were on a mission to kill or capture a high-value target in the area, perhaps even Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahraoui, the leader of the only local faction of fighters to have formally pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. Given the light armament of the US detachment, the scramble to evacuate them, and the lack of medical backup or reinforcements, this seems unlikely. The US troops were eventually rescued by French aircraft, which flew from bases about 300 miles away in neighbouring Mali. That there are conflicting accounts of the clash is not surprising. It occurred in an environment where hard fact is rare, and rumours swirl as fiercely as the dust storms that sweep the scrub and desert. Reuters news agency reported that the attackers were from al-Sahraoui’s group, which calls itself the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. Al-Sahraoui’s background and allegiance is evidence of the extremely fractured nature of the conflict across the swath of northern Africa known as the Sahel. The 40-year-old is thought to have grown up in refugee camps in the south of Algeria, where he was committed to the nationalist cause of the Western Sahara. Little is known about how he became interested in Islamist extremism but by 2012 he was spokesman for the militant coalition that took over Timbuktu, the mythic city in northern Mali. French troops forced the militants back into the northern deserts of Mali in 2013, and a year later the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (Isis) split their coalition. Some factions maintained their ties to al-Qaida in the Maghreb, the tenacious and powerful local affiliate of the veteran group founded by Osama bin Laden in 1988. Al-Sahraoui went his own way with a few dozen extremist followers, eventually pledging allegiance to Isis in May 2015. In recent years disaffected extremist leaders have looked to Isis for sponsorship – and advantage over their rivals – in conflict zones from west Africa to the Philippines. Often such pledges of support have been welcomed by Isis high command. But it took 18 months for al-Sahraoui’s bayat, or oath of allegiance, to be formally accepted – and only after he proved his mettle with a series of attacks. This delay has raised doubts over the substance of al-Sahrouai’s links with Isis. If it is hard to place factions in the Sahel on an organogram of extremist groups, it is even harder to place them on a map. Other than Boko Haram, the Islamic State affiliate based in north-east Nigeria, no Islamic extremist faction in the Sahel currently has a fixed base, making it very difficult to track the whereabouts and evolution of any individual group. Even Boko Haram, which gained global notoriety by abducting more than 200 schoolgirls in 2014, has suffered serious losses of manpower, funds and territory in recent months, and is now very scattered. “Very few factions are looking to govern or control territory … These are highly flexible, mobile units moving frequently, changing areas and it’s very difficult to identify who is who and who controls what,” said Rida Lyammouri, a US-based independent researcher on the Sahel. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, described the group which attacked the US special forces as “new to the area”. The dozen or so extremist factions operating across this vast area have, however, been responsible for scores of bloody attacks, and hundreds of deaths. Recent strikes have included a sophisticated assault on a military camp in Gao, Mali, which killed 77, and a series of attacks on hotels used by westerners and local elites. Most of the groups responsible for these operations are linked to al-Qaida. yet even here there is little solidarity. A recent attempt by al-Qaida leaders to build a coalition among local jihadi groups is seen by analysts as evidence of quite how fractured the movement is in the region. Ideology too is often unclear, with experts describing a complex mix of ethnic and other tensions which fuel militancy. A recent report by the International Crisis Group noted that jihadist groups have established a presence in the northern Tillabery region, close to Tongo Tongo, through targeted recruitment of young members of the Fulani community – one of the largest ethnic groups in west Africa comprising mostly herders – who are looking for ways to counter their ethnic rivals or protect their businesses or communities. “All these armed movements demonstrate a genuine capacity to understand and adapt to local circumstances, and do so better than less-motivated capital-based elites or foreign ‘peacekeepers’ … Instead, jihadist groups are willing to settle down and are developing an expertise in manipulating local intra and intercommunal tensions,” the ICG said. Extremist groups also provide limited services to some communities, most notably security, dispute resolution and rule of law. In central Mali, jihadist groups offer protection to pastoralists, and take the sides of local communities in contests over scant resources with government representatives or local elites. In this complex environment, western military units have to have significant autonomy in order to respond rapidly to local threats and conditions. Reuters has reported that the US special forces soldiers abandoned, or at least extended, their more limited mission in Tongo Tongo when they learned of a raid nearby, deciding to engage the attackers themselves. Former western special forces officers with firsthand knowledge of current operations in the Sahel said this account was “plausible”. “Since [President] Trump took power, US forces deployed around the world have had a lot more room to manoeuvre. Decisions about when and what to engage have been devolved right down to unit level,” the former officer said. “Any soldier knows that if you give guys on the ground more independence, then they will be that much more aggressive and will take more risks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/26/devils-day-by-andrew-michael-hurley-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-26T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"Devil’s Day by Andrew Michael Hurley review – dark tales from the moors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/26/devils-day-by-andrew-michael-hurley-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/26/devils-day-by-andrew-michael-hurley-review","fields":{"headline":"Devil’s Day by Andrew Michael Hurley review – dark tales from the moors","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"“The problem is that in the Endlands one story begs the telling of another and another,” admits John Pentecost to his 10-year-old son Adam, “and in all of them the devil plays his part.” The obliquity of this statement, perhaps our earliest indication of John’s self-deception, will be revealed as things develop. He is telling Adam the devil’s own story, while Andrew Michael Hurley is telling John Pentecost’s. They are inextricably entwined. The Endlands are a cluster of weatherbeaten smallholdings located deep in the Lancashire uplands: less a place than a habit, a node of obsolete human activity. Up there, contrary to their name, nothing is ever finished: farming is a never-ending fight against entropy, with no outcome. The sheep wander off. The buildings rot and decay. Everyone dies “in the midst of repairing something”. Equally, though, the moors bring forth a kind of stilted generosity, generation after generation: hard work though they might be, the Endlands are a commons, never belonging to an individual, “always in the act of being handed on”. No one who lives there spends money on life insurance. They have children instead. It’s back to this primitive arrangement that Pentecost, bored and unfulfilled by life as a teacher in Suffolk, brings his pregnant wife Katherine. “I was certain,” he tells the reader, “that when she saw the Endlands for the first time, she’d ... see that the place was as precious as the baby she’d be holding in her arms next Harvest.” The reader is equally certain she won’t. John, full of guilt at having abandoned the way of life of his buckled and ageing father, now throws himself into the affairs of the farm. Katherine just wants to go home. The Endlands women deride her fragile sense of purpose, her vegetarianism (“How long have you been like that, love?”) and her southern middle-class stylings. Meanwhile, she hallucinates a foul smell – in the yard, in the house, on her clothes, on her skin. And the dark is rising. The Pentecosts prepare for Devil’s Day, a yearly ritual that marks how, a couple of generations ago, the family survived an occult event they call “the Blizzard”. At the same time, down in the nearest village – sitting in its valley, “dark and cramped like something buried at the bottom of a bog” – the local slaughtermen seem to be acting out an old grudge against the Endlands families. Hurley’s first novel, The Loney, was published in 2014 in an edition of fewer than 300 copies by Tartarus, which specialises in limited editions of writers such as Arthur Machen and Robert Aickman. Republished by John Murray a year later, it received the Costa first novel award, completing the fairytale arc of the modern small press author while confirming independent publishing’s growing function as talent scout to the mainstream book industry. Hurley extended the audience of the British folk-horror revival, made impressive sales and drew approving comments from rising gothic stars such as Sarah Perry, who, reviewing it in this newspaper, described The Loney as a masterpiece. The new gothic accepts input from many sources: from industrial archaeology to ecofiction, from contemporary nature writing to the brutalism associated with film-maker Ben Wheatley or novelist Ben Myers. It draws as much from children’s fiction, folk music and horror cinema of the 1960s and 70s as it does from more traditionally gothic sources. In addition to supervising his heavy traffic of issues, influences, sly reference and pastiche, Hurley adopts a discursive storytelling method. He is as happy with births, marriages and deaths as he is with hammed-up folk ritual and dialogue that splits the difference between Stella Gibbons and Susan Cooper. At the same time, he is often as parsimonious with backstory – what exactly was “the Blizzard”? When, exactly, did it happen? Are we to take the devil as real? – as the farmers of the Endlands are with words. As a result, the narrative strands of Devil’s Day can seem unevenly balanced. It’s easy to get lost among them, and sometimes hard to tell the Endlands generations and their accompanying time schemes apart. Though the novel it reminds you of most is Alan Garner’s Thursbitch, there’s less sense here of braided but distinct temporalities, more of a kind of stutter, as if several of Hurley’s time machines were trying to warm up their engines behind the modern-day events but failing. The ghosts of wool production and paternal capitalism in the early 19th century struggle to reach into the present day. Demon child themes we half remember from some TV series vie for our attention with out-takes from a kind of gleefully brutalised One Man and His Dog. Nevertheless, this is a story with pull. Its lively, building sense of evil is thoroughly entangled with the assumptions of the way of life depicted, that apparently timeless relationship of the smallholder and the moor. As the young Adam soaks up his father’s tales of the devil, he’s also learning how to manage the local landscape, how to live in, identify with and take responsibility for the Endlands. These two types of knowledge, the symbolic and the practical, are presented as distinct but interdependent, as if both are necessary if you are to live with – that is to say, both within and off – your territory, your cruel little piece of the land. Like his father, all Adam wants is to feel “his grandfathers at his back” and imagine “his sons walking before him”. In the end, what he is given turns out to be a lot less desirable. The devil flickers and dances in the woods and John Pentecost’s self-deceptions are bared for the reader in a horrific climax. • M John Harrison’s You Should Come With Me Now will be published by Comma next month.

Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, has warned that obesity will bankrupt the health service and has stated his determination to do what he can on hospital premises. Shops inside hospitals have notoriously stocked sugary drinks, sweets and unhealthy snacks in the past, which have been bought not only by patients and their visitors but also by NHS staff. Nearly 700,000 of the NHS’s 1.3 million staff are estimated to be overweight or obese. Stevens has instructed all hospitals not to allow any confectionery on the shelves that contains more than 250 calories. Most regular chocolate bars are below 250 calories, but the supersized varieties contain more. Also out are “grab bags”, which are theoretically to share or save – they may be labelled as containing several portions. Stevens’ edict will force hospitals to ban them because the contents, which could be consumed by one person in one go, contain far more than 250 calories. “The NHS is now stepping up action to combat the ‘supersized’ snack culture which is causing an epidemic of obesity, preventable diabetes, tooth decay, heart disease and cancer,” said Stevens. “In place of calorie-laden, sugary snacks we want to make healthier food an easy option for hospital staff, patients and visitors.” The NHS has already taken action that campaigners hoped to see in the government’s anti-obesity strategy for the whole country. Price promotions have been banned, as has advertising of unhealthy foods – high in salt, fat or sugar – on NHS premises. Healthy options are supposed to be available at all times, for patients, visitors and staff. As part of the crackdown, leading retailers including WH Smith and Greggs agreed in April that no more than 10% of their soft drink sales would be high in sugar. Health authorities are already being given financial incentives to drastically reduce the numbers of packaged sandwiches and other meals sold that contain more than 400 calories or more than 5g of saturated fat per 100g and the numbers of drinks containing more than 5g of added sugar per 100ml. The Royal Voluntary Service, which runs shops, cafes and trolleys on the wards, has introduced a Healthier Choices programme, which is “having a significant effect on consumer behaviour,” said business enterprise manager Andrew Roberts. “In the first quarter of 2017, year-on-year sales of fruit increased by 25%, healthier chilled snacks like salad and sushi by 55% and healthier sweet and savoury snacks like popcorn and dried fruit by 109%.” Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “Hospitals have an important role in addressing obesity – not just treating those suffering the consequences, but helping to prevent it in the first place. Any plans to offer healthier food are a positive step towards tackling the country’s obesity problem.” Helen Dickens of Diabetes UK applauded Stevens’ action. “It’s great to see the NHS taking steps to help make it easy as possible for us all to make healthier choices – particularly for those in hospital – and in doing so reduce our risk of type 2 diabetes, a serious health condition that can lead to blindness, amputation and stroke. We look forward to seeing more information on how it will work in practice,” she said. “However this is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to tackling obesity. We need to go much further, which is why we are also calling for the government to toughen restrictions on junk food marketing to children, end price promotions on unhealthy foods and introduce mandatory front of pack food labelling. We need to act now for the sake of our nation’s health.” Tam Fry, chair of the National Obesity Forum, said Stevens had promised hard-hitting action. “A 250kcal chocolate bar is a quite sufficient snack for anybody and his limits on sugary drinks, fat and savoury items are probably the severest that he can get away with for the time being,” he said. “If levels of obesity continue to rise, however, he could opt for even more draconian measures.” He suggested “a complete crack down on added sugar products on wards” as an option to be considered. “Sugar is the new tobacco: ban it,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/15/god-scotland-football-players-gordon-strachan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T23:03:14Z","webTitle":"God give us a few players who can tackle a fish supper  | Kevin McKenna","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/15/god-scotland-football-players-gordon-strachan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/15/god-scotland-football-players-gordon-strachan","fields":{"headline":"God give us a few players who can tackle a fish supper","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I’ve long harboured a suspicion that God has more than a few questions to answer over Scotland’s failure to qualify for a major football tournament since 1998. Gordon Strachan, Scotland’s latest outgoing national team manager, has hinted at this too. Following last Sunday’s latest failure – against Slovenia – Strachan laid the blame squarely on the Almighty. “Genetically, we are behind,” he said. “In the last campaign we were the second smallest, apart from Spain. Maybe we get big women and men together and see what we can do.” I hardly think that encouraging random acts of unsupervised concupiscence between large people is going to endear Scottish football to a creator who traditionally is thought to take a dim view of such things. Strachan believes that Scottish footballers are too short and this means that they find physical challenges more of an exertion than larger opponents. Common sense tells us there is something in this. Obviously a small chap will rarely outjump a taller opponent when the ball requires to be headed. And a wee bloke’s legs have to go like the clappers to move quickly over distance while big, suave French, Italian and Latin boys move gracefully over long distances while hardly seeming to break sweat. England teams are always full of big lads and that’s why they have sensibly fashioned their unique blue sky approach to the game where the ball is rarely allowed to touch the ground. It is commonly agreed that Scottish strikers traditionally encounter difficulty “en frappant la derrière d’une vache avec un banjo” when they play international football. Thus, it’s not human beings you need to genetically modify but the goals themselves. Strachan has been unfairly ridiculed for his genetics lecture but I think his observations are entirely rational. Chillingly, though, I think we are not simply deficient in height but we also have some serious problems in spatial awareness, mental acuity and motor functions. Being small does not even begin to address the fact that our players exhibit signs of disorientation when they are on the park and seem not to know their position in relation to that of their team-mates. That is why so many passes fail to reach their intended destination. Often it is said that Scottish defenders encounter difficulties in “tackling a fish supper”. I disagree with this, though. Scottish footballers have no difficulty at all in tackling fish suppers; it’s simply that they choose to tackle their fish suppers in the wrong areas of the park. More intelligent and refined players such as Italy’s Franco Baresi and Spain’s Carles Puyol only tackled their fish suppers in areas of the park where it really mattered. This all points to one thing and one thing only: at some point Scotland has severely managed to disenchant the Big Man. I’ve often wondered why Scottish football fell out of favour with God. In the 1960s and 70s and 80s we enjoyed a decent relationship with Him, and our top players often formed the backbone of the best clubs in England. We didn’t go in for all that oily and obsequious blessing ourselves and pointing to heaven. A simple handshake and a silent prayer were enough and I think God appreciated that. I like to think that after He invented football He had a soft spot for Scotland’s unfussy and direct approach, while the apostles (a bunch of glory-hunters, if you ask me) probably backed the big Hollywood productions like Brazil, Italy and Germany. We must have then done something to displease Him. We stopped producing players like Denis Law, Charlie Cooke, Jimmy Johnstone, Jim Baxter and Billy Bremner. Suddenly players like Chris Iwelumo, Richard Hughes, Chris Martin and Matt Phillips were being born. Suddenly fish suppers weren’t being tackled, bags of cement weren’t being trapped and cows’ arses were no longer being struck by banjos. It was also in the late 1970s that we found the wherewithal to start bringing oil onshore. God doesn’t favour very many countries with the black stuff and I think this was His way of saying that He liked the way we played football. But what did we do with all that oil? Like the prodigal son we squandered it on wine, women and song, or at least its 1980s equivalent: the financial services industry. It’s all very well saying that Margaret Thatcher did it and blaming the English for chiselling us out of the oil profits but we let them do it and didn’t lift a finger consistently voting for parties that were secretly shafting us. And then when we had the opportunity finally to do something about it in 2014 we abased ourselves once more. What sort of self-respecting country always does that? No wonder God’s been pissed off for so long. This was actually worse than squandering your inheritance on having a good time; this was squandering your inheritance on letting someone else have a good time. And I don’t think God likes lickspittles. However, I’ve observed a few wee signs recently that God’s attitude to Scotland might be thawing a bit. After all, we did have a right good go during the referendum and lost it narrowly; the Big Man would have been pleased with the effort, application and teamwork. It may even have reminded Him of some of His favourite Scottish teams over the years. And He’ll be happy that we’re opening our doors to the world’s downtrodden peoples and those fleeing persecution. Just the other week Scotland was acclaimed as the most beautiful country in the world. Is this a sign that His heart, like the heart of the prodigal son’s dad, is beginning to melt and that our years of wandering in the wilderness could soon be coming to an end? In the meantime though I like the idea of sending over planeloads of our brightest and best young talent to Brazil for the purposes of seeking relationships (committed and long-lasting, of course) with young, sinewy locals who look like they can all tackle fish suppers and trap bags of cement. They would all be armed with prenups to ensure that the offspring of their unions will be reared in Scotland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/oct/13/healthcare-donald-trump-obamacare-executive-orders","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T18:50:29Z","webTitle":"Dismantling Obamacare: what has Trump done and who will it affect?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/13/healthcare-donald-trump-obamacare-executive-orders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/oct/13/healthcare-donald-trump-obamacare-executive-orders","fields":{"headline":"Dismantling Obamacare: what has Trump done and who will it affect?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Donald Trump took two extraordinary steps to undo his predecessor’s signature health law on Thursday, measures that could fatally damage Obamacare despite the repeated failure of Republicans in Congress to repeal it. Having expanded access to cheaper and less comprehensive insurance – which experts predict will result in health plans for the sick becoming more expensive – with an executive order on Thursday morning, the president issued a surprise notice that night scrapping federal subsidies underpinning the system. Trump’s actions could undermine the health marketplace millions of Americans depend on and hurt some of the US’s most vulnerable people. The president spent much of his campaign issuing vague promises to replace Barack Obama’s health law – which expanded coverage to nearly 20 million people – and he has been frustrated by his fellow Republicans’ inability to coalesce around a plan to do so. What exactly did Trump do? Unlike most developed countries, the US does not have a national health system, and since Americans have the most expensive system in the world, even a hospital trip can be financially ruinous. This is why health insurance is such a necessity. Most Americans get insurance one of three ways: through government programs for the poor and elderly called Medicaid and Medicare, through their employer, or through the online marketplaces set up by Obama’s Affordable Care Act in 2010. It is those online marketplaces that Trump’s moves this week will affect. The group using the marketplaces is dominated by small business owners and the self-employed. Marketplace plans are tightly regulated with a standard set of benefits, including maternity care, mental healthcare, and prescription drugs. On Thursday, Trump changed that system in two ways. First, he signed an executive order to allow health insurers to sell loosely regulated, cheap plans outside the marketplaces. These are called “association health plans”, and are based on the idea that small businesses should band together to get better rates from insurance companies. Conservatives say this turns health insurance into what it should be: a “financial product” meant for emergencies and designed for the middle class. Progressive groups have called these plans “junk”, because they are likely to have few benefits, and may not cover people when they need it most. Second, Trump decided not to fund the subsidies the government gives insurance companies under Obamacare to make health insurance less expensive for low-income people. These are called “cost-sharing reductions”. To accomplish this, all Trump had to do was make an announcement, because a court ruled the subsidies illegal just before the Obama administration left office, before it had time to appeal. Why did he do this? For seven years Republicans campaigned against the ACA, which they consider unwarranted government intrusion into a private industry, and for an end to mandated high-priced insurance plans. However, after gaining control of the presidency, House and Senate at the 2016 election, they could not agree on how to repeal or replace the law. Killing Obamacare would have left more than 20 million Americans without health insurance, a prospect which sparked uproar. Public approval of alternative Republican health plans hovered at around 20%. And Republicans suffered one embarrassing failure after another when they tried to pass the bills through Congress. As Trump demanded Obamacare’s repeal, he also insisted it was imploding. “Let Obamacare fail and it will be a lot easier,” Trump said after one failed legislative attempt this summer. Characterizing the subsidies that help the poor a “bailout” for insurers, and skimpy health plans a solution to the Obamacare “nightmare”, he has now made that implosion a lot more likely. Who will this affect? The poor, the sick, older Americans, women and possibly small business owners will all be affected by Trump’s moves, according to doctors. About 12.7 million people rely on health insurance marketplaces created by Obamacare. A joint statement from six physicians’ groups said Trump’s executive order on low-cost plans would probably “cause significant economic harm to women and older, sicker Americans who stand to face higher-cost and fewer insurance options”. Democrats said the actions could cause serious, structural damage to American healthcare. Democratic congressional leaders Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi called his actions a, “spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage”, in a joint statement. And the Republican senator Susan Collins, whose vote helped doom Republican repeal plans, said she was “very concerned” that Trump had ended “an important subsidy that helps very low income people”. Will Obamacare survive? The problem with both Trump’s ideas is they damage the ACA’s foundational concept: if the costs of the sick are spread among the healthy, insurance is cheaper for everyone when they ultimately need it. But allowing “junk” plans and ending subsidies to the poor, Trump may have set in motion a “death spiral”, or an exodus of the healthy from marketplaces, concentrating costs among the sick. For example, when health insurance becomes too expensive for poor people, they go without insurance. And if small business owners can buy association plans with skimpy benefits, they may also leave marketplace plans behind. That means fewer people to spread the risk to, which causes prices to rise, which causes more people to leave the markets – hence, a spiral. Whether marketplace plans, and the comprehensive benefits they provide, can survive Trump’s decisions is an open question. Most insurers are probably committed to selling insurance in 2018 and have set their rates. Trump changing the rules in the middle of the game could mean they lose money. Next time they may simply refuse to play. Will Trump be blamed if people lose health coverage? The president is sure he won’t. “We’re not going to own it,” he said in July. “I’m not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it.” Earlier this week he told Forbes: “I’ve always said Obamacare is Obama’s fault. It’s never going to be our fault.” The public seems to disagree. A recent poll showed 60% think Trump and the Republicans, not Obama and the Democrats, are responsible for the ACA’s success or failure. “Trump will try to blame the ACA, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it,” Schumer and Pelosi predicted in their joint statement. Trump himself seemed to imply his moves – which are likely to face legal challenge – may have been brinksmanship intended to force Democrats to the table. “The Democrats [sic] ObamaCare is imploding,” he wrote on Twitter. “Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/oct/15/bacon-eggs-every-meal-absurd-diets-rich-famous","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T14:00:32Z","webTitle":"Bacon and eggs for every meal: absurd diets of the rich and famous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/oct/15/bacon-eggs-every-meal-absurd-diets-rich-famous","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/oct/15/bacon-eggs-every-meal-absurd-diets-rich-famous","fields":{"headline":"Bacon and eggs for every meal: absurd diets of the rich and famous","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Their eating habits may not be quite as “insane” as former royal chef Darren McGrady branded them earlier this month, but the British royal family have their share of foibles around food. The Queen hates garlic and eats off diamond-encrusted plates, but also munches fruit out of yellow Tupperware. The Queen Mother was so reliably late to the table that they would lie to her about dinner time, telling her it was 8.15pm when everyone else was down for 8.30pm. Bejewelled crockery aside, however, the Windsors seem quite normal compared to these notably eccentric diners: ▶ Novelist Patricia Highsmith ate the same thing for virtually every meal: bacon and fried eggs. She began each writing session with a stiff drink – “not to perk her up”, according to her biographer, Andrew Wilson, “but to reduce her energy levels, which veered towards the manic”. Then she would sit on her bed surrounded by cigarettes, coffee, a doughnut and a saucer of sugar, the intention being “to avoid any sense of discipline and make the act of writing as pleasurable as possible”. ▶ Almost every morning for 15 years, the painter Lucian Freud had breakfast at Clarke’s restaurant in Notting Hill, London – often returning a few hours later for lunch. He would arrive at 7.30am with his assistant David Dawson and consume saucer-sized pains aux raisins or Portuguese custard tarts with extra-milky coffees (referred to by staff as “Mr Freud lattes”). After innumerable hours sitting in her restaurant, Freud invited owner Sally Clarke to his Victorian townhouse a few doors along on Kensington Church Street to sit for a portrait. He painted her three times, the final work interrupted – along with a decade and a half of loyal custom – by Freud’s death in 2011. ▶ David Lynch claims his relationship with coffee began at the age of three. At one stage, the film-maker was drinking 20 cups a day; nowadays he averages 10, although the cup size has increased. A good coffee, he says, “should have no bitterness, and it should be smooth and rich in flavour. I like to drink espresso with milk, like a latte or a cappuccino, but the espresso should have a golden foam. It can be so beautiful.” ▶ “Coffee is a great power in my life,” wrote Honoré de Balzac in 1830, “I have observed its effects on an epic scale.” Indeed he had. When in the grip of one of his “orgies of work”, the French novelist and playwright would get up at 1am and write until 4pm, with a 90-minute nap in the middle. To fuel himself, he imbibed as many as 50 cups of coffee a day. He also dabbled with “a horrible, rather brutal method” which involved eating pure coffee grounds on an empty stomach. When he did this, he wrote, “Ideas quick-march into motion like battalions of a grand army to its legendary fighting ground, and the battle rages.” For Balzac, the battle raged until his death at 51: he wrote 91 long and short works of fiction in the space of just 16 years. ▶ Marlon Brando had difficulties with his weight throughout his life, veering between crash diets and gorging sprees. Early in his career, he was known to eat peanut butter by the jarful, boxes of cinnamon buns and huge breakfasts consisting of cornflakes, sausages, eggs, bananas and cream, and pancakes drenched in maple syrup. He would devour up to six hotdogs at a time in late-night feasts at Pink’s in Hollywood (they named an all-beef hotdog after him in 2012). Defying attempts by work colleagues and loved ones to regulate his diet, he would break refrigerator locks at night, flee film sets with giant tubs of ice-cream and enlist friends to throw burger bags over the gates of his Mulholland Drive estate. ▶ Journalist and author Hunter S Thompson wasn’t known for his restraint when it came to intoxicants. With food, it seems, his appetites weren’t much less modest, particularly when it came to breakfast, which he described in his autobiography, The Great Shark Hunt, as “a personal ritual that can only be properly observed alone, and in a spirit of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: four bloody marys, two grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crepes, a half-pound of either sausage, bacon or corned beef hash with diced chillies, a Spanish omelette or eggs benedict, a quart of milk, a chopped lemon for random seasoning, and something like a slice of key lime pie, two margaritas, and six lines of the best cocaine for dessert … All of which,” he concluded, “should be dealt with outside, in the warmth of a hot sun, and preferably stone naked.” ▶ “I was on one of my fruitarian diets [and] had just come back from the apple farm.” This is Steve Jobs explaining the origins of the Apple company name to biographer Walter Isaacson and revealing something of his eating habits in the process. Jobs was a vegan for most of his adult life, dabbled with the even more restrictive fruitarian diet* and would spend weeks at a time eating only one or two foods, such as apples or carrots. (He believed his diet neutralised body odour and meant that he didn’t need to wash regularly or wear deodorant, though his co-workers believed otherwise.) Sometimes Jobs stopped eating entirely, savouring the “euphoria and ecstasy” of fasting, though he was also acutely appreciative of a good avocado. “He believed that great harvests came from arid sources, pleasure from restraint,” noted his daughter Lisa. * The diet varies, but usually entails eating raw fruit (at least 75% by weight) and a sprinkling of nuts and seeds. ▶ Walden author Henry David Thoreau professed little enthusiasm for food in general. “The wonder is how … you and I can live this slimy, beastly life, eating and drinking,” he wrote. He avoided meat and alcohol. Coffee and tea were dangerous temptations. Salt he regarded as “that grossest of groceries”. Cranberry-pickers were like butchers who “rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass”. Even water was an indulgence he would gladly have shunned were he able to live without it. ▶ Legend has it that Jackie Onassis would eat one baked potato a day stuffed with beluga caviar and soured cream. She watched the scales “with the rigour of a diamond merchant counting his carats”, according to her social secretary Tish Baldrige. If she went a couple of pounds over her usual weight, she would fast for a day, then confine herself to a diet of fruit until she was back to normal.

Although Wenger feels that Wilshere is almost back to his best after completing 90 minutes against Doncaster Rovers in the Carabao Cup and Bate Borisov in the Europa League, the manager does not want the 25-year-old to endure a setback after his recovery from a broken leg. “If the competition was less ferocious, he is ready to play,” Wenger said. “I wouldn’t be scared to play him. In the Premier League he can play [soon]. He is nearly back to his best.” Wenger responded to speculation that Wilshere, who spent last season on loan at Bournemouth, will need to move in January in order to earn a place in England’s World Cup squad by saying that he will have opportunities at Arsenal. However, Wilshere has not played in the Premier League since April and Wenger knows it will be necessary to adopt a cautious approach with a player whose combative performance against Borisov showed he remains unlikely to shy away from physical confrontations in midfield. “It is part of his game,” Wenger said. “You cannot ask a guy not to go into any contact. I believe it is his strength. His strength is to turn the game forward and have acceleration individually or with the ball. Sometimes when he accelerates individually he pushes the ball too far and gets confronted.” Wenger insisted Mesut Özil remained an important member of his squad despite indicating Arsenal could look to cash in on the Germany international in January. Özil is in the final year of his contract and although he is set to return for Saturday’s trip to Watford after recovering from a knee injury, Arsenal have done well without him in recent weeks. “I genuinely think he wants to stay,” Wenger said. “But I am always positive about that. Of course he is important. But I have many players – we spoke about Jack, we spoke about Iwobi. They are all players who play in this similar position and it is very interesting because it gives me a lot of opportunities to keep them all focused and refreshed. “People go quickly to conclusions. Last year we played the last 11 games and won 10. We beat Man City in the FA Cup semi-finals and Chelsea in the final and he played as well. You can always find the example. But it’s true that we have done well recently. “We live in the world where people have opinions and sometimes they are right and sometimes they are not always proven right on the longer period. You need players who have quality and Özil is one of the best players in the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/13/philip-hammond-saboteur-traitor-tory-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T15:04:52Z","webTitle":"Calling Philip Hammond a ‘saboteur’ or ‘traitor’ reflects terribly on the Tory right | Kate Maltby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/13/philip-hammond-saboteur-traitor-tory-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/13/philip-hammond-saboteur-traitor-tory-right","fields":{"headline":"Calling Philip Hammond a ‘saboteur’ or ‘traitor’ reflects terribly on the Tory right","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Tories are coming for the grey-haired men in suits. It’s not something we are used to seeing from the Conservative and Unionist parties of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but we live in extraordinary times. This week, it is the turn of Philip Hammond to face the tumbrils. For the anti-Conservative crime of counting his pennies, the chancellor was described as “coming very close to sabotage” (by the former chancellor Lord Lawson), a colleague who deserves to be sacked (friends of Boris Johnson and Liam Fox) and a man who “ought to be tried for treason” (by rightwing commentator Julia Hartley-Brewer). Roll up, roll up, fresh heads on spikes for yer pleasure. This week’s row is only one battle in the long war between those in the cabinet who voted leave and those who voted remain. The latest trigger came on Wednesday. That morning, Hammond published a piece in the Times. He promised to plan for all possible outcomes of the Brexit negotiations, but seemed to qualify it: “We are planning for every outcome and we will find any necessary funding and we will only spend it when it’s responsible to do so.” This was widely read as a refusal to spend money pre-emptively on planning for a “no-deal” scenario. Later that day, Hammond appeared at the Treasury select committee. Again, he reiterated that his department was planning for all types of Brexit: hard, soft, floppy. But he pointed out that there are some consequences of a no-deal scenario that would require extreme levels of government spending. Consider what happens, to take one example raised at the select committee, if we had to reconfigure our airports to focus all air traffic on Commonwealth countries because we hadn’t obtained landing licences for any airport in the EU. Sound ridiculous? That’s because there’s no one – not even the most pessimistic remainer – who seriously believes such a situation would occur. Except for the leavers who’d like Hammond to start spending millions on the pre-planning now. Back in the misty realms of memory, some of us can remember a time when the Conservative party stood for the principle of restraint on the public purse. Sure, things are different now: both I and Rafael Behr have previously written for the Guardian of the speed with which the party of calm and quietude has transformed itself into the party of revolutionary destruction. Even so, the lust of the bloodhounds after Hammond is startling. Imagine getting a call from your accountant, warning that a big tax bill may be on its way. Some of us ask the accountant for advice. Johnson and Fox, it seems, dream of shooting the accountant and zooming into the sunset. Westminster’s boomer-generation answer to Bonnie and Clyde, a dashing pair whose fast cars keep them one step ahead of the consequences. Until suddenly the consequences catch up. Yet the fiscal irresponsibility of the Tory right isn’t the saddest part of this sorry tale. What should worry us most is the language used. It is one thing to call for the sacking of an opponent. It is another to demand treason trials for those with whom you disagree. (Treason was, of course, a capital offence in recent memory.) The cry of “saboteur” has already cropped up too often in recent debate.Lawson should know better than to raise the cry of the mob against the scapegoat. Michael Fallon, another wise grey man of the Tory cabinet, gave a speech this July at the Policy Exchange thinktank. This was not the time for infighting, he reminded his party. Instead, Conservatives should focus their energy on challenging the decline of the public sphere. This was a speech riddled with conventional Tory wisdom about western democratic exceptionalism. “We have to stand up for … our democracy, our tolerance, our freedom under the law that enables our people to flourish … the threat to that western narrative is now ferocious, based on misinformation, new media, and a callous disregard for facts.” In a final flourish, Fallon declared that for democracy to thrive, “we need to call out aggression and intimidation” in our political life. Fallon is, of course, right. Enemies of liberal democracy are everywhere – and most of them seem to cast themselves as conservatives. In the White House this week, President Trump described the basic principle of press freedom as “disgusting”. British conservatives haven’t quite reached that rhetorical nadir. If they want to retake the moral high ground of the west, however, they might start by cutting out the language of heads on spikes. • Kate Maltby is associate fellow of Bright Blue, a thinktank for liberal conservatism"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2017/oct/14/s-town-podcast-trial-tyler-goodson","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"S-Town subject faces trial: 'Sometimes I regret speaking into that microphone'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/14/s-town-podcast-trial-tyler-goodson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/oct/14/s-town-podcast-trial-tyler-goodson","fields":{"headline":"S-Town subject faces trial: 'Sometimes I regret speaking into that microphone'","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The wildly popular S-Town podcast entranced listeners and ignited controversy earlier this year with its mesmerising portrayal of the residents of small-town Alabama.

Sometimes I regret ever speaking into that microphone because I was probably upset, or wasn’t thinking clearly.” He added: “I’m no criminal. I’m not the thief. But we’ll see what happens.” S-Town was a podcast series released in March this year created by producers from the celebrated public radio show This American Life. The seven-episode series begins with host Brian Reed traveling to Woodstock, Alabama, to investigate a supposed murder on a tip from the colorful and eccentric McLemore, who refers to Woodstock throughout as “Shit-town”. Reed soon finds that there was no murder, and the series gradually transmutes into an audio biography of the life of McLemore and a novelistic portrait of Woodstock and surrounding Bibb County. The series was downloaded millions of times, led to debates over journalistic ethics, and thrust Woodstock into the national spotlight, with reporters from around the world descending on the small Alabama town. When the Guardian visited in April, locals’ only objection to Reed’s portrayal seemed to be his habit of confusing Woodstock with the nearby towns of Centreville and Bessemer. The podcast series remains ranked at No 15 on Apple’s top podcast charts at the time of publishing. Reed documents the bitter dispute between Goodson and McLemore’s cousin Reta Lawrence following McLemore’s suicide. Goodson is accused of stealing property from the watchmaker’s house after his death. Goodson does not dispute the fact that he took items from McLemore’s property, including two school buses, an 18-wheeler trailer, and a number of tools, despite police telling him not to enter the property, but he says that McLemore would have wanted him to have them. McLemore can be heard on S-Town saying that he intended to leave something for 26-year old Goodson and his family. Reed was not available for comment on the case. The relationship between McLemore and Goodson is a core theme of the show. The younger man had worked on McLemore’s property and helped take care of McLemore’s mother, Mary Grace. McLemore did not leave a will and his mother, who had dementia, was taken into custody by his next of kin, Lawrence. Bryan Jones, the prosecutor, told the Tuscaloosa News of Goodson: “In the podcast, he basically admits to the trespass and the burglaries and the thefts.” After his arrest in 2015, Goodson was freed on bond, but after another arrest for shooting his brother’s dog in April this year, Jones invoked the podcast in an unsuccessful attempt to have Goodson thrown back in jail. He cited a clip in which Goodson tells Reed he wanted to cut the finger off a man who had allegedly stolen from him. Goodson has yet to stand trial in that case. The Tuscaloosa News reported that Goodson’s attorneys, JD Terry and Cedrick Coleman, tried to have the trial moved to a neighboring county as the jury in Bibb County would likely be influenced by the podcast, but the judge refused."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2017/oct/15/rochdale-charitys-demolition-plans-spark-social-cleansing-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T22:30:24Z","webTitle":"Rochdale charity’s demolition plans spark ‘social cleansing’ claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/15/rochdale-charitys-demolition-plans-spark-social-cleansing-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/oct/15/rochdale-charitys-demolition-plans-spark-social-cleansing-claims","fields":{"headline":"Rochdale charity’s demolition plans spark ‘social cleansing’ claims","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"They have been a landmark on Greater Manchester’s skyline for half a century. But four of Rochdale’s Seven Sisters tower blocks are facing demolition, prompting opposition from hundreds of residents and accusations from the council’s housing boss of “social cleansing”. Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH), a charitable trust that runs all former council stock, said it planned to tear down four of the social housing blocks to make way for new townhouses and regenerate the town centre. The high-rises border an estate that was until recently classed as England’s most deprived neighbourhood, and identified by the then prime minister, David Cameron, early last year as typical of the so-called sink estates that should be bulldozed in a “blitz” on poverty. The plan is to build 120 townhouses in place of the four demolished tower blocks and give the three others a multimillion-pound makeover, in what RBH has called a housing regeneration in Rochdale town centre. But the proposals have been opposed by hundreds of residents and described as “crazy” by Neil Emmott, Rochdale borough council’s cabinet member for housing, who said it “smacks of social cleansing” and risked worsening Greater Manchester’s homelessness problem. Emmott said he had been given a presentation by RBH on its proposals and that it “focused on how many people are on benefits and how many people are poor round that area”. “Frankly, I was appalled,” he said. “It really sickened me to see them coming out with this sort of stuff. “We’re all in favour of regeneration but regeneration should be for everybody, regardless of income, regardless of background. We’re not going to have proper regeneration simply by sweeping people on lower incomes under the carpet.” One in 10 working-age adults in the blocks and its surrounding streets are unemployed, three times more than Rochdale’s average and four times the national average. Emmott said he was concerned that RBH’s proposals would lead to a net loss of more than 400 homes – it plans to build 120 townhouses in place of the 528 flats that would be lost – and would add more people to the waiting list for homes in the borough. Every resident of the 761 flats, thought to be more than 1,000 people, would have to move out under the proposals, with only those in the three renovated blocks able to return. RBH said there was “absolutely no truth” in Emmott’s “social cleansing” claim and that all current residents would be able to stay in the town centre. It said its proposals “could result in a net increase of 500 homes” in the area but did not explain the figure. A spokesman said it would cost at least £10m each to renovate the blocks, compared with £1.9m each to demolish. RBH said: “As our homes in College Bank and Lower Falinge have lower demand than some of our other neighbourhoods, currently College Bank and Lower Falinge cost more in maintenance than we collect in rent. By providing a better quality and mix of homes, we can deliver a more sustainable neighbourhood that meets the needs of tenants now and in the future.” Audrey Middlehurst, 82, a retired teacher who has lived in one of the blocks for 29 years, said the blocks’ elderly residents would be “absolutely devastated” to have to move. “It’s just so worrying for them – and there’s no reason why they should move out,” she said. “Can you just imagine having an 80-year-old having the upset of all this upheaval? They feel really devastated.” Robin Parker and Ann Jones, the former mayor and mayoress of Rochdale, who live in the blocks, said their lives had been put on hold until they knew whether they were being evicted. “It distracts you from other things. It’s with you every minute of your waking day. It’s a burden on you,” said Parker, 73. Jones, 62, said the area had been damaged by the bad press it has received but that she was proud to live in the Seven Sisters blocks, which are officially known as College Bank. “The term ‘sink estate’ does so much damage to areas,” she said. “Just that one phrase, use that and the area is then tarnished, the people living there are then tarnished.” Far from being haunted by the Grenfell Tower fire in west London, which triggered a national debate on social housing blocks, Parker said he felt safe in the Seven Sisters. “They were built to be totally self-contained so, if a fire happens in one of these, there is no issues at all of it spreading to others,” he said. “There’s no cladding or anything, so there’s no risk whatsoever of anything like Grenfell happening here.” Saiqa Naz, an NHS mental health worker and Rochdale resident who has offered support to Seven Sisters tenants, said the uncertainty was taking a toll on some of the blocks’ elderly residents. “I’ve spoken to people in their 80s, crying, not eating or sleeping,” she said. “There’s the hidden cost of regeneration, which is mental health, physical health, breaking up a community and moving them away from their support networks.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/16/high-street-outlets-move-to-ditch-plastic-amid-environmental-concerns","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T05:00:50Z","webTitle":"High-street outlets move to ditch plastic amid environmental concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/high-street-outlets-move-to-ditch-plastic-amid-environmental-concerns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/16/high-street-outlets-move-to-ditch-plastic-amid-environmental-concerns","fields":{"headline":"High-street outlets move to ditch plastic amid environmental concerns","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A growing number of outlets selling food and drink in the UK are taking action to ditch plastic amid deepening concern about its effect on the environment, with drinking straws and bottles among items being phased out. Pret A Manger has become the latest to take action, announcing that it has installed taps dispensing free filtered water and started selling empty glass bottles in its three vegetarian stores. The scheme is due to be rolled out to branches in Manchester from the end of October. The move follows a flurry of schemes introduced by businesses and charities, from pub chain Wetherspoons to the Zoological Society of London, to curb plastic waste amid rising concern over the vast tide of containers, bottles and other paraphernalia washing up around the world. While plastic bottles of water will still be available at the Pret stores, the company says the goal is to explore whether customers will take up the plastic-free option. “We’ve been really surprised and encouraged by the hugely positive response on social media – we’ve even sold quite a few glass bottles already,” said Caroline Cromar, the brand director of Pret. “We’ll be listening carefully to feedback from our customers and shop teams before we decide on the next stage.” The move, according to Pret, comes from a growing desire to tackle the impact of plastic waste on the environment. A Guardian investigation this year discovered that a million plastic bottles are bought worldwide every minute, while recent research has revealed that of the 6.3bn tons of plastic waste produced between 1950 and 2015, almost 80% has ended up in landfill or in the environment – including the oceans. Plastic contamination is now found in everything from tap water to sea salt. Pret is not alone is attempting to wean consumers off plastic. Last month Wetherspoons announced that it would stop using plastic drinking straws from 2018, while Borough Market in London promised this summer that it would end sales of single-use plastic bottles and install public drinking fountains. Meanwhile Selfridges, which announced in 2015 that it would stop selling single-use plastic water bottles, has now gone a step further. A spokesperson said that it, too, recently phased out the use of plastic straws in its eateries and restaurants, adding that a permanent water fountain will be installed in its London store in 2018. It is not only high-street retailers that are taking action. The media company Sky recently revealed that it is removing disposable plastic – including bottles of water and cups – from its canteen. UK visitor attractions are also tackling the issue. “Obviously as a conservation charity the subject of plastic in the ocean is very close to our hearts,” said Kathryn England, the head of commercial at ZSL, which runs London Zoo and Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire. Since the summer of 2016 ZSL has no longer sold single-use plastic bottles of water at its London and Whipsnade sites, instead installing water fountains and embracing alternative packaging. The move, said England, was not without difficulties. “There is not that much out there that isn’t plastic at the moment,” she said. “One of the big challenges that we have as a zoo is that we can’t have glass on site for safely reasons.” In the end, ZSL opted for cardboard cartons of plain and flavoured water with polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-free caps, as well as resealable cans of both still and sparkling water. The transition, England said, not only stacked up commercially, but has gone down well with the 2m visitors that visit the zoos every year. “We’ve not had a single element of pushback since we rolled [the scheme] out,” she said, adding that ZSL had taken steps to explain the reasoning behind the move to visitors. With its mission accomplished, England says ZSL is now going further. “By the end of the year, our entire drinks range across our two zoos will be 100% single-use plastic bottle free,” she said, adding that finding healthy and non-carbonated drinks with plastic-free packaging was no mean feat. But not everyone is following suit. A spokesperson for Costa Coffee responded to Pret’s move by pointing out that free water was already available in its stores. “Our baristas are more than happy to provide glasses of tap water to our customers on request,” they said. However, while a recent survey found that 61% of people “wouldn’t pay for bottled water if tap water was available”, 37% said they would be embarrassed to ask for free tap water – even if they were buying items at the same time. England said she welcomed the announcement from Pret, but added that manufacturers and those in the field of waste management needed to facilitate the use of plastic-free options, including compostable corn-starch containers. “I think the more brands like this can come on board, the more pressure that puts on the big manufacturers to actually switch over and start creating and developing innovation that is going to come up with an alternative solution to plastic that will work for everybody,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/13/provident-financial-debt-collection-agents-divided-cancelled","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T17:58:35Z","webTitle":"Provident Financial to hire debt collectors to revive doorstep lending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/13/provident-financial-debt-collection-agents-divided-cancelled","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/13/provident-financial-debt-collection-agents-divided-cancelled","fields":{"headline":"Provident Financial to hire debt collectors to revive doorstep lending","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Provident Financial is hiring debt collection agents, after axing them earlier this year, in an attempt to revive its door-to-door lending operation, which is on course to lose £120m in 2017. As the subprime lender confirmed the cancellation of its full-year dividend, it said it was recruiting 300 more staff to collect debt payments door to door. Many of these had worked for the company before a disastrous new strategy led to a profit warning in August. The warning wiped nearly £1.7bn off the stock market value of the 137-year-old group when the share price plunged from £17.45 to 589.5p. The reorganisation involved replacing 4,500 self-employed collection agents with 2,500 full-time “customer experience managers”. The CEMs were given iPads but were sent to the wrong addresses, or the correct ones at the wrong time, and were unable to make sales or collect payments. As a result, debt collection rates fell. The debacle prompted the departure of Peter Crook as chief executive. The company has admitted the system “was too prescriptive in the way the workforce was managed, removing the ability of local management to prioritise and allocate resources”. Provident has rehired its former debt collection chief Chris Gillespie, who quit in 2013, and is recruiting CEMs to work part-time. The third quarter trading update on Friday helped reassure the City that the situation was not getting worse as Provident enters the crucial pre-Christmas trading period, and the shares jumped by 15% to more than 900p. Manjit Wolstenholme, the chairwoman and acting chief executive, said: “Since the last update, we have moved quickly to appoint new leadership in home credit who have a deep understanding of the business and recognise the importance of the relationship between our frontline staff and our customers.” A replacement for Crook, who is forfeiting pay and bonuses worth up to £4m, is being sought. They will take over a business facing problems in its debt collection arm and under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority over the sale of a credit card product by its banking division, Vanquis Bank. There was no update given on the FCA investigation into how Vanquis sold a “repayment option plan” that allowed customers to freeze repayments on debts. Analysts at Shore Capital have estimated that consumer redress could run to £240m. The banking operation has started to become more selective about granting loans given the uncertain economic backdrop created by Brexit. Provident said year-on-year growth in Vanquis was 13%, which had been delivered against credit standards that have recently been tightened, recognising the uncertainties faced by the UK economy. Earlier this week, Vanquis was fined £75,000 by the Information Commissioner’s Office for sending more than 870,000 texts and 60,000 emails promoting credit cards. Satsuma, Provident’s online payday lending operation, is expected to report a small loss for the year. Its website says a £1,000 six-month loan would require customers to pay £896 in interest. In the debt collection arm, losses are expected to be between £80m and £120m, assuming debt collection and sales continue to improve. In September, lending was down by £6m a week on the same period last year, compared with the £9m a week fall recorded in August. Debt collection rates, which are usually about 90%, rose from 57% in August to 65% in September. But analysts at Royal Bank of Canada remain sceptical. “The small recovery in collections should not be applauded, as this is as we anticipate and management still expects a large loss,” they said. While changes are being made to the debt collection operation, the company is not reverting to its previous model of self-employed agents, but taking people on as employees. Rivals have been cashing in on Provident’s problems, with Morses Club saying its business was growing after hiring agents from its bigger rival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2017/oct/13/crystal-palace-chelsea-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T13:41:38Z","webTitle":"Crystal Palace v Chelsea: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/13/crystal-palace-chelsea-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2017/oct/13/crystal-palace-chelsea-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Crystal Palace v Chelsea: match preview","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Chelsea’s momentum had been checked impressively by Manchester City just before the international break but this fixture should provide an opportunity to rediscover lost rhythm.

United take on Liverpool in the early kick-off conscious the greeting from the home fans will be hostile. Yet Mourinho is confident this can help his side. “You know this is quite funny for me because I think when people speak about big atmospheres, it looks like we don’t like [this],” United’s manager said. “It looks like it’s a problem for us to go to a certain place and to face a big atmosphere – [but] this is what we want. “I am surprised that you speak about that in a negative way, I am even more surprised when I hear former, big players speak about atmospheres like something sinister, something that worries. It motivates us, it is something that we want, it is something that if we could have every match we would have every match.” Mourinho used the recent game at the Camp Nou that was staged behind closed doors to reiterate his point. “You know, when Barcelona played against Las Palmas with an empty stadium, do you think the players were happy with that?” said the Portuguese. “Do you think Las Palmas players wouldn’t prefer to play with Nou Camp full of people and a great atmosphere? We are speaking about Old Trafford, in this case Anfield, like it’s a big problem. It’s a satisfaction, that’s what we want. I never see a player complain: ‘Oh, this atmosphere was very strong’ – we complain when the atmosphere is flat. “When we play at home and we don’t see big enthusiasm in the people, we complain. So we go to where we want to go, we go to play against a big team with a big tradition in an amazing stadium with great tradition. We know that the fans have huge animosity against Manchester United historically, but this is what we want so we are very happy to have one more opportunity in our careers to play in this beautiful conditions. It’s beautiful to play at Anfield. Beautiful.” United are second to Manchester City on goal difference. Mourinho was dismissive regarding whether Liverpool present his team’s first real test as the highest finishers from last season that United will have played. “It is disrespectful to the opposition [we have played to say that]; not us, but for the opposition it’s not nice,” he said. “Everybody knows there are better teams than others and at the end of the season you have the proof of that: the champion, runner-up, third, fourth. I don’t think these teams that aren’t going to be champion or top four mind if everybody says that. But to say they’re easy matches to win is a bit aggressive to them.” Last season’s corresponding fixture ended as a 0-0 draw and Mourinho joked about playing a fresh formation to ensure United attack with more flair. “I will play with one defender and nine strikers, don’t worry about it,” the 54-year-old said. “We play with one guy behind and then we go with the new system, even an evolution of the WM [old formation], and we play with nine strikers. Don’t worry about it.” He was more serious when asked whether Liverpool’s status as United’s fiercest rivals meant the boost of a victory could help his side’s evolution. “If you win you’re in a better position, if you lose you are in a worse position,” he said. “If you win you are not champions and if you lose you don’t lose your chance to be champion. You cannot win every match, and you have to be strong enough mentally, for both sides. If you win, you cannot leave Anfield like you won the Premier League, because you didn’t; if you lose you cannot leave like you are going to be relegated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2017/oct/14/football-lost-boys-ravel-morrison-mario-balotelli","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T07:30:01Z","webTitle":"Football’s lost boys Morrison and Balotelli seek redemption and stir nostalgia | Richard Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/14/football-lost-boys-ravel-morrison-mario-balotelli","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2017/oct/14/football-lost-boys-ravel-morrison-mario-balotelli","fields":{"headline":"Football’s lost boys Morrison and Balotelli seek redemption and stir nostalgia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Thirty yards from goal, the player controls the short square pass on the half-turn before moving smoothly forward. Two light touches, a stepover, two more touches to veer away from a second defender, then a left-footed shot from a yard outside the edge of the penalty area, carefully measured inside the left‑hand post. “MORRI-SON! MORRI-SON! MORRI‑SON! MORRI‑SON!” The Mexican TV commentator is going crazy. It is only a friendly during the international break but he thinks he has seen the future. If only. This is a future that many people have glimpsed before, and then waited in vain for the promise to become reality. Some saw it in the FA Youth Cup final at Old Trafford in 2011, when two calmly taken goals suggested that Ravel Morrison was going to be the future of Manchester United and perhaps even of England. West Ham fans saw it at White Hart Lane in October 2013 when Morrison picked up the ball inside his own half, held off Jan Vertonghen, cut inside Michael Dawson and dinked the ball over Hugo Lloris. A month after that, Gareth Southgate saw it when, as a member of his England Under-21 squad, Morrison scored on the training pitch with an outrageous backheeled volley. Almost 3.5 million people have watched that one on the FA’s YouTube channel. A few weeks earlier, Morrison had scored twice in a 5-0 win in an Under-21 European Championship qualifying match. Their opponents, rather poignantly, were Lithuania, against whom Southgate’s seniors struggled to a wan 1-0 victory last Sunday in Vilnius. Perhaps England’s head coach, watching his players fail to penetrate a packed defence, thought back to what Morrison could do. Seemingly ineradicable flaws in his character and behaviour – including incidents that led to court appearances – have so far prevented Morrison from displaying these gifts more than sporadically, and perhaps they always will. After loan periods at Birmingham City, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City, a permanent transfer to Lazio last summer failed to change his fortunes. Poor timekeeping and an apparent unwillingness to learn Italian failed to endear him to the head coach, Stefano Pioli, and then to Pioli’s replacement, Simone Inzaghi. At the end of August the Serie A club, to whom he is under contract until 2019, sent him to Mexico, where he is now with Atlas, the Guadalajara club, who are currently mid-table in Liga MX, the country’s top division. Since Atlas have won the title only once, all the way back in 1950-51, the expectations and the pressures might not be intolerably high, although they play in a stadium with a capacity of almost 55,000. The Estadio Jalisco is where Jairzinho’s goal enabled Brazil to beat England in a World Cup group match in 1970 and where, 16 years later, Michel Platini’s France lost against West Germany in the semi-final. Mexico, beset by the violence associated with its thriving drug trade, might not be the most obvious place in which to rehabilitate a 24-year-old who grew up amid Manchester’s gang culture and has shown few signs of shaking off the resulting attitudes for more than short periods. So far Morrison has come on as a substitute in two league matches and scored a characteristically breathtaking goal in a friendly against Club América of Mexico City. But anyone who has seen his quality at first hand will be wondering, yet again, if this latest adventure will give him a firmer grip on a place within the game, if not a route back to an England shirt. The story is a little different for another of football’s seemingly lost boys. Mario Balotelli was representing Manchester City – and providing the pass to Sergio Agüero for an historic title-winning goal – at around the time when Alex Ferguson was giving up on Morrison. Balotelli had already played for Internazionale as a teenage prodigy, and left east Manchester for Milan before a fine headed winner for Italy against England in the 2014 World Cup finals prefaced his return to the Premier League with Liverpool. After scoring 26 times in 43 matches for the Rossoneri, one goal in 16 appearances for Brendan Rodgers’ side represented a serious disappointment. His time at Anfield also derailed his career. When Milan took him back on loan, a further 20 appearances yielded only one more goal. It looked very much as though the various episodes of eccentric behaviour that studded his time in England would turn out to be better remembered than his efforts on the football pitch. After Antonio Conte left him out of Italy’s squad for last year’s European Championship finals, and Jürgen Klopp indicated there was no place for him back at Liverpool, Balotelli made a move that seemed to indicate his once‑credible ambition to win the Ballon d’Or was all over. By contrast with his previous four clubs, the talk at OGC Nice is not of contending for the Champions League. But Balotelli scored four goals in his first two games in Ligue 1, and went on to finish last season with 17 in 28 – as well as three red cards and 10 yellows. Nice took third place, behind Monaco and PSG, in the final table. As usual, almost everyone at his new club loves Balotelli’s extrovert character. In August harsh words were exchanged with Lucien Favre, the head coach, following defeat by Napoli in the Champions League play-off round but the air was cleared and since then the Italian has scored five goals in his five league appearances. “This year, for the first time in a long, long time, he’s had the benefit of proper preparation,” Frédéric Gloria, an assistant coach tasked with looking after Balotelli, told the magazine France Football. “He’s rediscovered the life of a footballer.” The experience of being a teenage star in the obscenely rewarded and hyper-scrutinised world of 21st-century football is guaranteed to expose defects and vulnerabilities. Some players, such as Aston Villa’s Lee Hendrie, who made a striking England debut under Glenn Hoddle in 1998, crash and burn and then stumble along until it all fizzles out. For Manchester City’s Michael Johnson, who showed such promise 10 years ago that he was being talked of as the new Colin Bell, it was simply too much. If you love the game, those stories make you sad.

In a vituperative speech on Friday that began by listing Iran’s alleged crimes over the decades, Trump announced he would not continue to certify the agreement to Congress, but stopped short of immediately cancelling US participation in the deal. “Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror and the very real threat of Iran’s nuclear breakout,” Trump said at the White House. Trump put the onus on Congress and US allies to agree to means to toughen the conditions on Iran – and to make restriction on the country’s nuclear programme permanent. He made clear that if those negotiations fail to reach a solution – which is almost certain – he would unilaterally pull the US out of the international agreement, a move likely to lead to a return to nuclear confrontation in the Middle East. “In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,” Trump said. “It is under continuous review and our participation can be cancelled by me, as president, at any time.” The president also announced he had ordered the US Treasury to impose new sanctions on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a backer of terrorist groups in the region, although the state department did not designate the IRGC as a terrorist group itself. The international backlash to Trump’s speech was immediate. The leaders of the UK, France and Germany – also signatories of the nuclear deal – issued a statement vowing their commitment to the agreement. The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted that the agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was working, and that no single country or leader could terminate it. “The president of the United States has many powers, but not this one,” Mogherini told reporters in Brussels. Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, issued a statement restating the agency’s finding that Iran was abiding by its obligations. Within minutes of Trump’s speech, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, went live on state television. He said: “What we heard tonight was a repeat of the same baseless accusations and insults that we’ve heard over the past 40 years. It had nothing new; we weren’t surprised because for 40 years we’ve got used to these words. With your baseless speech you made our people more united.” Rouhani went on: “Today, the US is more isolated than ever against the nuclear deal, [more] isolated than any other time in its plots against people of Iran.” The Iranian president shrugged off Trump’s call for constraints on Iran’s ballistic missile programme. “Our missile and defence activities have always been important to us for our defence, and today it’s more important,” Rouhani said. “We have always made efforts to produce weapons that we need, and from now on we will double our efforts. These weapons are for our defence and we will continue strengthening our defence capabilities.” Trump received rapid support, meanwhile, from Israel and Saudi Arabia, who have emerged as his own major allies on the world stage. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he wanted to “congratulate President Trump for his courageous decision today” and for “boldly confront[ing] Iran’s terrorist regime”. For European diplomats seeking to salvage the JCPOA, the days leading up to Trump’s long-awaited speech were a roller-coaster. Initially fearful that Trump could immediately trigger a possible collapse of the deal, the Europeans were buoyed when they were briefed that Trump would not call for the reimposition of sanctions by Congress. However, in the wake of the president’s speech on Friday, the JCPOA’s survival looked tenuous. In the speech, Trump declared: “I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the deal’s many serious flaws so the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons.” He noted that congressional leaders were already drafting amendments to legislation that would include restrictions on ballistic missiles and make the curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme under the 2015 deal permanent, and to reimpose sanctions instantly if those restrictions were breached. However, any such changes would need 60 votes in the US Senate to pass, and Democrats are high unlikely to give them their backing. Even if they did pass into law, the restrictions would represent a unilateral effort to change the accord that would not be acceptable to the other national signatories. Hours earlier, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson had acknowledged that it was very unlikely that the JCPOA agreement could be change, but suggested that the issue of Iran’s ballistic missile programme and the time limits on some of the nuclear constraints in the deal, could be dealt with in a separate agreement that could exist alongside the JCPOA. Trump, however, made no reference to such a way out of the looming impasse. He appeared to go out of his way to goad Iran, even linking Tehran with al-Qaida and the attacks on US embassies in 1998. He referred to Tehran as a “fanatical regime” and a “dictatorship”. He even referred to the body of water almost universally known as the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf. “How come a president has not yet learned the name of a famous gulf in the world, the same Persian Gulf that US vessels always pass through aimlessly?” a riled Rouhani said in his response. “He needs to study geography, but also international law. How come an international agreement that is endorsed by a UN resolution, which is a UN document … how a US president can annul such an international document?” The exchange of insults mirrored Trump’s continuing spat with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, adding personal animus to already tense situations on opposite sides of the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/14/geoengineering-is-not-a-quick-fix-for-climate-change-experts-warn-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-14T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Geoengineering is not a quick fix for climate change, experts warn Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/14/geoengineering-is-not-a-quick-fix-for-climate-change-experts-warn-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/14/geoengineering-is-not-a-quick-fix-for-climate-change-experts-warn-trump","fields":{"headline":"Geoengineering is not a quick fix for climate change, experts warn Trump","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Leading climate scientists have warned that geoengineering research could be hijacked by climate change deniers as an excuse not to reduce CO2 emissions, citing the US administration under Donald Trump as a major threat to their work. David Keith, a solar geoengineering (GE) expert at Harvard University has said there is a real danger that his work could be exploited by those who oppose action on emissions, at the same time as he defended himself and colleagues from the claims GE strengthens the argument for abandoning the targets set by the Paris climate agreement. “One of the main concerns I and everyone involved in this have, is that Trump might tweet ‘geoengineering solves everything – we don’t have to bother about emissions.’ That would break the slow-moving agreement among many environmental groups that sound research in this field makes sense,” Keith said on the sidelines of the Climate Engineering Conference (CEC) in Berlin. Indeed, utterances from people in or close to the Trump administration – most notably GE proponent secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who has referred to climate change as “just an engineering problem” – make it clear they either tacitly or directly support the idea of climate engineering. Earlier this year, Keith, a professor of applied physics at Harvard announced plans to conduct an outdoor trial into stratospheric aerosol injection, involving launching a high-altitude balloon that will spray a small quantity of reflective particles into the stratosphere. Keith believes the experiment may help to measure the feasibility and risks involved in GE, an umbrella term for a range of techniques to deliberately adjust the climate in an effort to mitigate global warming. They include reflecting sunlight from space, adding huge quantities of lime or iron to the oceans, pumping deep cold nutrient-rich waters to the surface of oceans and irrigating vast swaths of desert to grow trees. Supporters of research into geoengineering argue that its techniques – roughly-speaking divided into carbon dioxide removal (CDR, or negative emission technologies) which removes greenhouse gases, and solar-radiation management (SRM or solar geoengineering) which reduces the amount of solar energy warming the planet – could help to lessen some of the consequences of climate change. However, the common consensus is that the techniques should be used in addition to reductions in CO2 emissions. This week’s conference drew attention to the huge risks involved. “All the techniques being proposed have potentially severe environmental impacts,” said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group, leading campaign monitors of new technologies and their possible impact on the world’s poorest. “They also ignore the question as to why there’s not enough political will to have done more to tackle climate change until now and they in turn serve to justify the inaction,” she added. Concerns focus on techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection, which some experts say has the potential to reduce the amount of rain from Asian and African monsoons and could have a devastating impact on the food supply of billions of people. Aerosol injection also has the potential to reduce the ozone layer and heighten the risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other possible side effects of GE may be an increase in ocean acidification, a change in weather patterns, a rapid rise in temperatures, and a huge uptake in the use of agricultural land, all of which could prompt mass migration of millions of climate change refugees. But scientists such as Keith, and Mark Lawrence, scientific director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) in Potsdam, argue that with the Paris agreement goals to limit temperature rise to two degrees or less, almost impossible to achieve, the world has little choice than to thoroughly explore technical intervention and the potential it has to avoid global disaster. “It will be very difficult to achieve the Paris agreement calls without some form of climate engineering,” Lawrence said. “It’s not impossible, but it’s hard to imagine we would make the major changes in our infrastructure and lifestyles in the time necessary.” Keith also dismissed the view that climate engineers like himself were on a mission to prove that climate engineering worked at all costs, or else see the importance of decades of their life’s work evaporate. “At the best climate engineering is a supplement, and it could be that we shouldn’t do it,” he insisted. “Our work is to inform better choices and it would actually be very useful to know for sure it didn’t work. Right now there are heads of state and others in leadership who are explicitly assuming it could work, that it’s there if we need it. But let’s say we found something deep in the climate models which suggested we were overoptimistic about solar geoengineering, then I would say ‘abandon it’. That would be great. I’d love to publish that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/15/archbishop-of-canterbury-justin-welby-apologises-to-sexual-abuse-survivor-gilo-for-c-of-e-failings","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T07:00:24Z","webTitle":"Justin Welby apologises to sexual abuse survivor for C of E failings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/archbishop-of-canterbury-justin-welby-apologises-to-sexual-abuse-survivor-gilo-for-c-of-e-failings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/15/archbishop-of-canterbury-justin-welby-apologises-to-sexual-abuse-survivor-gilo-for-c-of-e-failings","fields":{"headline":"Justin Welby apologises to sexual abuse survivor for C of E failings","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has personally apologised to a sexual abuse survivor for his office’s failure to respond to 17 letters seeking help and redress. Three bishops have also urged the Church of England’s insurance company to review its settlement with the survivor, saying they are “very concerned about the way in which the claim was handled at the time”. In a letter to the Ecclesiastical Insurance Group (EIG), the bishops expressed disquiet that “horse-trading” between lawyers over settlements has had “little concern for the impact” on survivors. The two letters are the latest developments in a long struggle by Gilo – who is also known as Joe, and whose surname is withheld at his request – to force the C of E to acknowledge both the abuse he experienced as a teenager at the hands of a senior church figure and its failure to respond properly to his disclosures. Gilo told dozens of C of E figures, including three bishops and a senior clergyman later ordained as a bishop, of his abuse over a period of almost four decades. A highly critical independent report commissioned by the C of E into Gilo’s case said last year that the failure of those in senior positions to record or take action on his disclosures was “deeply disturbing”. Welby’s letter to Gilo says: “I am writing to say how profoundly sorry I am for all the abuse you have suffered … I am shocked to hear of what has happened to you and the impact over so many years.” The archbishop wrote that he was aware that Gilo had been “in communication with me here at Lambeth Palace over a period of time. I am sorry that the way your correspondence was handled has not been helpful to you, and has not been to the standard you would expect”. Gilo received only one response to his letters to Welby, from a correspondence clerk offering prayers. Welby wrote that he had asked for a review of processes. “There are lessons to learn and I am keen that we learn them and make any changes necessary.” The archbishop’s letter of apology arose from a mediation session between Gilo and two bishops: Tim Thornton, to whom Gilo says he disclosed details of his abuse in 2003 and who is now bishop at Lambeth; and Paul Butler, the bishop of Durham and the C of E’s lead bishop on safeguarding at the time of the independent review of the case. In a statement issued on Sunday, the two bishops said they “recognise that the church continues to face serious challenges through its response to survivors” and “these matters need to be faced honestly and squarely”. Butler and Thornton, along with Alan Wilson, the bishop of Buckingham, also wrote to the EIG to raise concerns. They called on the insurance company to revisit cases “where past practice may have reached a settlement that did not truly match the significance of the impact of the abuse”. They wrote: “In particular we have been very concerned to hear how ‘horse trading’ around the level of settlements has occurred between lawyers with little concern for the impact such an approach has had on the survivor.” The bishops suggest the EIG should review the settlement it reached with Gilo. He received £35,000 after the church agreed it was at fault, but pastoral care was cut off following the agreement. The bishops’ letter said they were “very concerned about the way in which [the case] was handled at the time”. The impact of abuse on Gilo “has been lifelong and continues. It has seriously impacted his health and wellbeing. This in turn has affected his work and finances.” Gilo has repeatedly criticised the C of E’s close relationship with the EIG and the presence of senior clergy on its board of directors. He has claimed the insurers advised the church to cut off emotional and psychological support in a move that “directly conflicted” with the church’s pastoral and compassionate responsibilities. He told the Guardian: “It’s a courageous and bold move by these bishops to finally grasp a powerful corporate nettle in such a clear way. “They are right. The settlement process is a degrading, demeaning horse trade in which the insurer holds all the cards, and can effectively hold a gun against the heads of survivors and our own lawyers. It is a skewered and broken system that doesn’t serve justice. “The church is finally recognising the cost of impact. And cost, too, for many survivors who have campaigned for change against a silent and discrediting church, and both former and current bishops who have covered up. All those survivors, and the ones who’ve fallen away bitter and angry and left unhealed, need recognition of the cost in their lives and real justice.” In its reply to the bishops’ letter, the EIG said there was no basis to revisit the settlement agreed with Gilo. It had responded to his complaints about EIG’s handling of his case “with patience and sensitivity”, it said. The company sought to “see all survivors treated with sensitivity, fairness, compassion and respect, and to achieve reconciliation”. In a statement, the EIG said: “As independent insurers, we are not responsible for the abuse perpetrated by those for whom the church is accountable. Our role is to handle insured claims for financial compensation fairly for these acts of abuse. “We and other insurers are bound by comprehensive, industry-wide regulation that oversees the way we operate and handle claims, and by the civil justice system. “It is not in our gift to change civil law, which defines the claims process. Negotiations between lawyers – characterised in the bishops’ letter as ‘horse trading’ – are a normal part of that process. So are full and final settlements, which bring certainty to all parties within the civil justice system. “It is, however, in the Church of England’s gift to provide further compensation as well as ongoing pastoral care to victims and survivors of clergy abuse if it so wishes.” • This article was amended on 22 October 2017 because an earlier version said Gilo had disclosed details to Tim Thornton.

The Chelsea manager has been linked with a return to Italy since arriving last year and, speaking before Saturday’s match with Crystal Palace, rejected fresh suggestions that he could move on next summer, attributing them to a mistranslated interview. His wife, Elisabetta, and daughter Vittoria are both now living with him in Cobham after remaining in Italy during his first season at the club, and he expanded on the benefits of an improved work-life balance. “For me to have my family with me is very important,” Conte said. “Last season, honestly, I suffered a lot. When you are in a new country and you are alone, and know that your family don’t stay here, it is not simple. This season I am very happy because my wife and daughter are with me, and for us it is a fantastic experience. I think this is an incredible experience for my daughter and a great gift I am giving her.” It has provided respite from what increasingly looks a difficult title defence for the Premier League’s fourth-placed side. “This season I am driving here and last season was difficult because when you are alone there is only the work,” he said. “Now there is my job but we also take the car to visit different areas and sometimes go to London or Kingston, or to discover new restaurants.” Conte’s satisfaction will ease concerns about his future although, in his earlier press conference, he had stopped short of suggesting he would stay beyond the expiry of his contract in 2019 – saying instead that, like any coach, he would “hope to stay for a long time and try to build something important for the club”. Domestic life may be more straightforward but it has been a tricky week for Conte at Chelsea, who could be deprived of N’Golo Kanté for the next month after he returned from international duty with a hamstring injury. “We don’t have another player with the same characteristics,” Conte said of Kanté, and he will also be missing Álvaro Morata and Danny Drinkwater for the visit to Crystal Palace. This week Conte has also had to deal with Charly Musonda’s dissatisfaction, expressed via Instagram, at a lack of opportunities at Chelsea. He said he had spoken to the 20-year-old winger, who “must be focused on the pitch and not on social media”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2017/oct/15/like-stars-complex-objects-jewish-history-ashmolean-museum-jewish-journey-rebecca-abrams","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T07:15:24Z","webTitle":"‘Like stars in a complex constellation, these objects convey the sweep of Jewish history’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/15/like-stars-complex-objects-jewish-history-ashmolean-museum-jewish-journey-rebecca-abrams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/oct/15/like-stars-complex-objects-jewish-history-ashmolean-museum-jewish-journey-rebecca-abrams","fields":{"headline":"‘Like stars in a complex constellation, these objects convey the sweep of Jewish history’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"We are so small between the stars, so large against the sky, wrote the late, great Leonard Cohen, and perhaps it is this lurking fear of eclipse that explains our desire to preserve the material proof of our presence. Museums are not only treasure troves of material proof that we humans are here and are large, they provide the bulwark of the past as protection against the alarming expanse of the future. Stories in many ways serve the same function, curating the random evidence of existence into meaningful narratives. But inevitably, both museums and stories are selective in how they arrange the evidence, depending on whose story they’re curating, whose presence they’re preserving. Oxford, where I’ve lived for nearly three decades, is home to one of the oldest and greatest museums in the world: the Ashmolean, founded by Elias Ashmole in 1683. When I used to visit as a child, I wasn’t much interested in the past. Egyptian mummies did the job just fine, the creepier the better. The allure of history has grown as I’ve got older, both history in general and those parts of it I can relate to personally. A few years ago, however, as a Jewish visitor to the Ashmolean, I began to realise that “my” history, although present among the vast riches of the museum’s collections, was at the same time curiously hard to see, a faint thread that wove through its galleries but was easily lost. The same is true for many other histories, of course, because curatorial choices have to be made. But in the case of Jewish history, the material evidence was there, on display in many different forms in nearly every gallery. It was just strangely difficult to find, and once found, strangely difficult to make sense of. Absorbed into different and sometimes competing narratives, the specifically Jewish meaning of these objects, even when you knew where to look, remained highly elusive. This realisation led to the idea of curating a selection of the museum’s Jewish artefacts back into view, and with the help of Oxford Jewish Heritage and the Ashmolean itself, I embarked on a hunt through the museum in search of its Jewish treasures. The results far surpassed expectations. Here, preserved in clay, marble, bronze, gold, paper, ink, glass, wood and paint, were objects that spanned the whole 4,000 years of Jewish history, ranging across three continents and 14 countries, from ancient Mesopotamia to the modern day. The mere fact of their existence and survival is in many cases remarkable. Hidden in caves, buried in tombs, dropped in moats, sunk in alpine lakes, a significant number of these objects were never intended to be found. This theme of concealment resonates, inevitably, with one of the darker motifs running through Jewish history: the recurring imperative for Jews to conceal not only their belongings, but themselves. Another strand in the story is the long history of voluntary and partial concealment through assimilation and integration. A pair of viola da gambas, made in Italy by master instrument-makers Gasparo da Salò and Girolamo Amati, bear no outward signs of their Jewish connections, but yielded rich stories related to the pressures on Italian Jews in the 16th and 17th centuries to convert and assimilate. Paintings by Camille Pissarro in the 19th century, and David Bomberg and Mark Gertler in the 20th, remind us, lest we need reminding, that assimilation is not without its difficulties. The past is animated by our capacity to imagine it, and material evidence of the past helps anchor history in a tangible, imaginable reality. In choosing which of these objects to highlight, my aim was not to tell a comprehensive history of the Jews, but to identify those that would connect, like stars in a complex constellation, to convey the sweep of that history and the range of experiences it contains. Inevitably, the objects reflect the history of the Ashmolean itself. The Bodleian Bowl, is one of the museum’s treasures, not because of the story it has to tell about the Jews of medieval England, but because it was one of the museum’s earliest acquisitions. The bowl’s cryptic Hebrew text excited curiosity in Protestant England in the 17th century, a time of renewed scholarly interest in Hebraism, and also explains why, for several hundred years, it was catalogued as a manuscript. Since the objects in the Ashmolean determined the moments in Jewish history that the book I decided to write would cover, there are gaps in the story, places on the Jewish journey that I have had to leave out, but what is in the Ashmolean nevertheless covers a vast and varied terrain. Like the journey of the Jews themselves, the journey described by the 22 objects eventually decided on is both temporal and geographical. It begins with the King List (1800BC) from ancient Iraq, where Abraham, the founding father of Jewish monotheism, may once have lived, and from there wends its way across the centuries and continents, ending with a pottery camel, which has made its own long journey from Tang dynasty China via Nazi Germany to present-day Oxford. The Jewish Journey: 4,000 Years in 22 Objects thus takes the reader on two journeys: a physical journey through the galleries of the Ashmolean Museum, and a metaphorical journey, which traces the steps of the Jewish people through time and space. Why 22 objects? As long as 3,000 years ago, the Hebrew alphabet had fixed on the 22 letters it still uses to this day, and while the script and language have evolved during that time, the letters are recognisably the same, symbolic of the blend of change and continuity that characterises Jewish history itself. According to kabbalistic tradition, the universe was created through 22 hidden paths on the Tree of Life, and the number 22 signifies the meaning of life. The objects in The Jewish Journey are not intended to reveal the meaning of life, but they do, I hope, reveal something of what life has meant to Jewish people at different times in their history, and of the diversity and complexity of that history. Across the centuries, the frequent imperative for Jewish people to move from one place to another as refugees and immigrants gives their story a particular resonance at this moment in time, a reminder that human migration is nothing new and often proves highly beneficial to the countries in which people resettle. While these objects tell stories that sometimes pull in contradictory directions, taken as a whole, they speak to the human capacity for adaptability, resilience and renewal. Journeys necessarily begin with a departure, but where they end is less certain. In the words of another 20th-century Jewish poet, Uri Zvi Greenberg, we are all of us journeying “to somewhere beyond the final point, towards an endless beginning, far in the distance”. • The Jewish Journey: 4,000 Years in 22 Objects by Rebecca Abrams is published by the Ashmolean Museum (£15).

Rebecca Abrams is hosting a Jewish Treasures of the Ashmolean tour at the museum on 9 Nov Jasper seal, 750-700BC Carved from light red jasper, and no bigger than a thumbnail, this oval seal was made in the 8th century BC in Lachish, one of the most important cities in the kingdom of Judah. It is inscribed with a winged sphinx and, in Paleo-Hebrew, the name of its owner: a woman named Hannah. Ancient Near East seals belonging to women are rare, but they suggest that Judaean women took part in official correspondence, held positions of authority, accumulated wealth, and exercised economic and political power. The woman who owned this particular seal lived in turbulent times, her country sandwiched between the great powers of Egypt and Assyria. In 701BC, after King Hezekiah refused to pay tribute, Sennacherib unleashed his army on the kingdom of Judah. Lachish was besieged and destroyed, and its citizens forcibly resettled in other parts of the Assyrian empire. Twentieth-century excavations of the site uncovered thousands of arrowheads of iron, bronze and bone, embedded in the mud-brick debris and bent out of shape, suggesting they’d been fired with powerful bows from close range. The mud bricks themselves had been nearly baked by the heat of the flames that consumed the city. Somehow Hannah’s jasper seal survived the siege, but the destruction of Lachish was a serious blow for the Judaeans, not just a territorial loss but a symbolic wound that would echo through the Jewish narrative for centuries to come. Temple gold coin, 70AD It took more Roman troops to capture Jerusalem in 70AD than it had to conquer Britain 27 years earlier, but in August of that year, after a gruesome five-month siege, the walls were breached and Titus’s army flooded in. The city was razed and with it the sacred Temple, epicentre of religious life for the Jews, as well as its administrative and economic hub. Lavishly expanded by Herod during his reign and famed for its gold-plated facade, the Temple was stripped bare, within and without. A few of its treasures made their way back to Rome, but the majority vanished without trace. This exceptionally rare gold coin was minted in Judaea immediately after the conquest of Jerusalem and brought with a deployment of Roman troops to England soon afterwards. Two thousand years later, it was struck for a second time in a field in Oxfordshire, this time by a farmer’s plough. Stamped on one side with the head of Vespasian and on the other with the figure of Justice, the coin represented a full month’s pay for a Roman soldier. But what was the source of metal for this Judaean coinage? The most plausible explanation is the precious gold melted and looted from the Temple in Jerusalem. Bodleian bowl, 1260 “Forced away from where we dwell, we go like cattle to the slaughter,” lamented the medieval poet Meir of Norwich. On 1 November 1290, not long after he wrote these lines, the entire Jewish community of England was expelled from the country. They had come from northern France 200 years earlier at the invitation of William the Conqueror, spoke a dialect of French, had French as well as Hebrew names, and maintained close links with their former community. As the property of the crown, they enjoyed some privileges, but were taxed out of all proportion to the size of their population, and eventually asset-stripped into oblivion. This magnificent bronze cauldron, made just 30 years before the exp ulsion, is intimately bound up with the fluctuating fortunes of England’s medieval Jews. Following its discovery in a disused Norfolk moat in the 1690s, scholars spent the next two centuries arguing about how it had got there, where it had come from, and what it was for. The Hebrew letters encircling the belly of the bowl likewise resisted comprehension, although it was because of the inscription that the bowl was for many years kept in Oxford’s Bodleian Library and catalogued as a manuscript. Property deeds, which came to light in the late 19th century, finally unlocked the bowl’s mysteries, revealing a 500-year-old story of a Colchester rabbi named Joseph, a prison sentence, the head of the Paris yeshiva, and a father and son’s last journey from England to the Holy Land. Wedding ring, 17th century A portrait of Glückel of Hameln, whose lively memoir provides a detailed glimpse into the daily life of a 17th-century Jewish housewife and businesswoman, shows her wearing a wedding ring similar to this one strung on a cord around her neck. Decorated with enamel flowers and fine gold filigree, elaborate rings of this kind were used ceremonially in Jewish weddings from the late middle ages on. Known as “house rings”, they often featured small buildings or canopies, symbolising both the lost temple in Jerusalem and the newlyweds’ future home. A line from the Song of Songs or other Hebrew text was frequently inscribed somewhere on the ring, in this case concealed inside the hinged roof. Made in northern Italy in the 17th century, where many Jews settled after fleeing the Inquisitions in Spain and Portugal, the craftsmanship of this ring attests to the skill of Jewish artisans and their active involvement in many areas of the Italian Renaissance. Gilbert Cannan and His Mill, by Mark Gertler, 1916 The youngest child of Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe, Mark Gertler was born in 1891 and raised in grinding poverty in the East End of London. In 1908, he became the first working-class Jewish boy of his generation to attend the Slade School of Art and was subsequently taken up by the Bloomsbury set. Gertler’s relationship to his Jewish identity was fraught with contradictions: fiercely loyal to his roots, he also saw it as an obstacle to his artistic ambitions and, outwardly at least, began to distance himself from the world of his childhood. But this painting tells a different story. The spindly figure at the centre of the work, completed in 1916, is the writer Gilbert Cannan, a close friend of Gertler. Queasy with ambiguities, the painting expresses in part Gertler’s ambivalence about the English society in which he was now moving. And beneath its surface, revealed by a recent x-ray, is an unfinished work (above): a painting of a Jewish couple, based on an earlier watercolour, Rabbi and Rabbitzin. This work, in stark contrast to the atmosphere of instability in Gilbert Cannan and his Mill, conveys a resilience rooted in centuries of stoical suffering. Taken together, the visible painting and its ghost-companion go to the heart of Gertler’s tormented double identity as a British artist and as a Jew, a conflict he was tragically never able to resolve. Forged banknote, 1943 Few of the insanities dreamed up by the Nazis backfired as spectacularly as Operation Bernhard. Named after SS officer Major Bernhard Krüger, who was in charge of it from 1942, the plan was to destabilise the British economy by flooding the country with forged banknotes. This £5 note, virtually indistinguishable from the real thing, is one of the forgeries. Krüger gathered his team of counterfeiters from Jewish prisoners in Nazi concentration camps, chosen not just for their relevant skills as printers and artists, but so that they could be killed as soon as their job was done. Assembled in Sachsenhausen, 36km from Berlin, the prisoners worked in top secret, strictly segregated from the rest of the camp. By late 1943 and all through 1944, the forged notes rolled off the presses at the rate of 650,000 a month. But by the time the forgeries were ready, the Luftwaffe no longer had planes to supply German troops in Stalingrad, never mind drop banknotes over England. Thanks to Operation Bernhard, the counterfeiting team survived the war, and with fitting irony, many of the forged notes were later used to help smuggle Jews into British-Mandate Palestine. This particular note was retrieved from an Austrian lake, where it had been hastily dumped in 1945 by the retreating SS."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2017/oct/16/lucy-worsleys-nights-at-the-opera-review-dressing-up-singing-and-sex","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-16T06:00:52Z","webTitle":"Lucy Worsley's Nights at the Opera review – dressing up, singing and sex","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/16/lucy-worsleys-nights-at-the-opera-review-dressing-up-singing-and-sex","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/16/lucy-worsleys-nights-at-the-opera-review-dressing-up-singing-and-sex","fields":{"headline":"Lucy Worsley's Nights at the Opera review – dressing up, singing and sex","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I haven’t always had the best relationship with opera. My parents took me to a few – dress rehearsals – when I was a kid, probably with the aim of making me more refined and cultured. Clearly, it didn’t work, I hated it. Everything about it – the ponciness, the fact that it took so long for them to say anything (why couldn’t they speak instead of sing?), that I couldn’t understand what they were saying, that it went on for ever ... That was a long time ago, though. Now I’ve reached an age where I wouldn’t mind a bit more culture; I find more and more solace in classical music; I may be ready for opera. I bought myself a hedge-trimmer the other day (MacAllister op MHTP520, if you’re interested) and I’ve been enjoying that; I think the two – an interest in hedge-trimming and opera – come at around the same time in life. I’ll need some help, though, from Lucy Worsley’s Nights at the Opera (BBC2, Saturday). She will, no doubt, bring sex into it, she always does. And she’ll dress up a lot. Those are her two things, sex and dressing up. OK, a bit of history, too. That’s actually what she’s doing here, looking at how what was going on inside the opera house reflected what was going on outside, in Europe, between the 17th and 19th centuries. First, though, she’s in a London taxi, dressed as Lucy Worsley. Nessun Dorma is on the radio (Radio 3! Isn’t it more of a Classic FM number?). “It’s a song about football, isn’t it?” she says, before explaining that really it’s about emotion, death, love, all the big themes … That’s what you said, isn’t it, Lucy – football, right? Anyway, this seems to be pitched about right for me. We also get Ride of the Helicopters by Wagner (the one from Germany not X Factor) and Mozart’s Duettino Shawshank. Opera has permeated everyone’s skin, whether you like it or not, that’s what Lucy’s saying. She’s popping into Covent Garden, to see the Royal Opera House’s music director, Antonio Pappano. Sir Tony is on hand to shed light on some of the tunes – again, nothing too technical, more about major emotions than minor thirds. Now Lucy’s in Venice, in a gondola, of course. No ice-cream aria? She missed a trick there … oh, it’s not from an opera, of course I knew that. Here, in 1643, Monteverdi wrote The Coronation of Poppea. “For the first time ever in opera, we meet real people,” says Lucy. “With real passions, including … sexual passions.” There it is! Told you! And then, right on cue, she reaches for a plumed helmet and slips it on. Dressing up, too. Next she’s Nero, in a toga and crown of leaves, with a bowl of grapes and a bottle of wine, reclining on a Roman couch. Oh, there’s some history, too, some attitudes and politics of the time, working their way in there as well. And so it goes on: tra-la-la, little sing-song with the soprano Danielle de Niese, holding hands, “Ooh, that was sexy.” Vienna next, where Lucy explains – with the help of what looks like a sachertorte – how Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro was a rebellious masterpiece, before managing – with the help of technological trickery – to dress as all four principal characters AT THE SAME TIME. Sir Tony P’s the one talking about sex this time; he explains the eroticism of the Countess and Susanna’s duet, AKA That One From The Shawshank Redemption. Still in Vienna for Beethoven’s Fidelio, about revolution, and personal sacrifice for political ends, and – unsurprisingly – fidelity. Serious intellectual and political argument, through music – although this doesn’t prevent Lucy from finding an excuse to dress up. And finally to Milan, and Nabucco, an opera that in 1841 reflected the hopes and dreams of a whole people as they struggled towards nationhood. Lucy ends up, dressed as herself again, in the building where Verdi is buried, now a retirement home for singers and musicians. She joins them as they sing Va, Pensiero, the Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves. Maybe less polished than the Royal Opera House version earlier, but it’s beautiful and moving, as well as encapsulating the dreams of a generation and of a nation. Brilliant, sold, cured. Now I’m going to blast out Now That’s What I Call Opera, Vol 1, while trimming the hedge (again). Hurry though, I need to get to Wagner by the second part next weekend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/oct/13/woman-could-face-hate-prosecution-over-anti-dup-banner","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T14:57:37Z","webTitle":"Woman could face hate crime prosecution over anti-DUP banner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/woman-could-face-hate-prosecution-over-anti-dup-banner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/oct/13/woman-could-face-hate-prosecution-over-anti-dup-banner","fields":{"headline":"Woman could face hate crime prosecution over anti-DUP banner","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A woman has been questioned by police and could face a hate crime prosecution after she waved a banner at Belfast’s Pride parade reading “Fuck the DUP”. In a case that could have consequences for free speech and the right to offend across the UK, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) says it will pass a file to the region’s public prosecution service (PPS) after Ellie Evans, 24, held up the placard at the August parade to protest against the party’s policies on gay marriage. The investigation was prompted by a complaint from DUP politician Jim Wells, who told the Guardian that the slogan constituted “incitement to hatred and potential public disorder”. Evans, originally from Essex, confirmed that two PSNI detectives questioned her under caution on Monday. She said that in a later phone call she was told that the PPS would decide whether she should be prosecuted for a hate crime or a breach of public order. “I said to them: ‘Why?’” she said. “To say this placard and its message was a hate crime is insulting to all those many LGBT people in Northern Ireland who are affected by genuine hate crimes on a daily basis. “How many people have the PSNI arrested here for the burning of effigies of nationalist politicians or flags of that tradition on loyalist bonfires? I just can’t believe they have referred this to the PPS. I just thought it would be a laugh.” Evans said that she held up the banner to highlight how the party that props up Theresa May’s government blocks gay marriage equality in Northern Ireland. The charity worker, who has lived in Northern Ireland for two years, was questioned at a central Belfast police station after a detective visited her at home on 5 October. “I got a knock on my door and there was a plainclothes PSNI detective standing there,” she said. “He said that they would like me to come in to answer a few questions then gave me his details and we arranged a time. “So on Monday evening I took a lawyer with me and I had to speak to two detectives. They asked me questions like did I think the F word was offensive, and if I thought it was appropriate to display this word in a public place where children were around. They asked if I was trying to be provocative and what my intentions were, which should have been obvious. “They were like questions you would expect to be asked by a teacher at school over graffiti scrawled in a toilet or a cloakroom. The whole thing was weird.” She told the PSNI officers she was simply doing her bit for the campaign to promote marriage equality in Northern Ireland. The region is the only part of the UK where same-sex couples cannot be married. This is because the DUP, now shoring up the minority Conservative government in Westminster, has consistently used a parliamentary veto in the Northern Ireland assembly to veto legislation to legalise same-sex marriages. The DUP politician who first complained about Evans’s placard back in August at Pride was unapologetic about his actions. Jim Wells, the DUP’s assembly member for South Down, previously resigned from the National Trust, for whom he worked for a decade, over its participation in the Pride parade. Wells told the Guardian it had been overlooked that a slogan such as “Fuck The DUP” breached the strict rules concerning marching in Northern Ireland as set down by the Parades Commission – the body that adjudicates on controversial demonstrations in the region. Wells, who avoids swearing, said: “If someone at an Orange Order march held up a banner stating, ‘eff Sinn Féin’ or if someone from a religious group held up a placard with the slogan, ‘eff LGBT’ at parade that would be a clear breach of the Parades Commission’s rules barring offensive slogans. “This ‘eff The DUP’ placard is exactly the same,” he went on. “I don’t mind if they hold up banners criticising the DUP, saying we are idiots or whatever. But to use a swearword is tantamount to an incitement to hatred and potential public disorder. “You may not agree with the DUP but we represent 300,000 people and are the largest political party in this province. They deserve some respect free from offence. As a unionist I would find it unacceptable and offensive if anyone used that same slogan, that same swearword against any of the nationalist parties here.” LGBT campaigners expressed their concern at PSNI’s approach. “We would ask that PSNI detail their reasoning as to why they felt there was sufficient evidence of a crime being committed to warrant questioning,” said Gavin Boyd, policy and advocacy manager at the Rainbow Project. “We would also ask PSNI whether additional weight was given to the complaint because it came from an elected politician and whether any anti-Pride protesters have ever been questioned about the content of their placards.” A spokesperson for the PSNI said: “When any complaint is received PSNI will examine the report and speak to all relevant parties to establish if any offence has been committed. In relation to this specific case, inquiries are ongoing and a file will be submitted to the PPS in due course.” • This article was amended on 18 October 2017 to correct a quote mistakenly attributed to Gavin Boyd."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2017/oct/13/senior-judge-warns-over-shaming-impact-of-legal-aid-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-13T15:06:50Z","webTitle":"Senior judge warns over 'shaming' impact of legal aid cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/13/senior-judge-warns-over-shaming-impact-of-legal-aid-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2017/oct/13/senior-judge-warns-over-shaming-impact-of-legal-aid-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Senior judge warns over 'shaming' impact of legal aid cuts","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"One of the most senior family court judges has warned about the impact of legal aid cuts and said it was “shaming” to preside over cases in which individuals are forced to represent themselves. Speaking at a ceremony to mark his retirement, Mr Justice Bodey explained how he sometimes had to help litigants in person by cross-examining witnesses on their behalf. His comments highlight dismay among the judiciary about the Ministry of Justice’s slow progress towards reviewing the effect of the 2012 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act. The legislation removed more than £350m from the legal aid budget and ended the right to legal representation in large areas of the law on divorce, child custody, clinical negligence, welfare, employment, immigration, housing, debt, benefit and education. Last year, Amnesty International said the cuts were far worse than anticipated and had created a “two-tier” system that denied the poorest people access to justice. The family courts have been the worst-affected part of the justice system. More than a third of family cases involve litigants who are unrepresented on both sides. Last week, the new president of the supreme court, Lady Justice Hale, described Laspo cuts as probably “a false economy”. She said early legal advice would help resolve many legal problems. A Labour-party-backed review led by Lord Bach published last month called for an additional £400m a year to be spent restoring access to a more generous system of legal aid. “When the government first introduced Laspo it estimated it would save £450m a year in today’s prices,” Bach’s report said. Last year, legal aid spending was £950m less than in 2010. At a conference organised by the law reform and human rights organisation Justice on Thursday, Lady Justice Hallett, one of the most senior court of appeal judges, said cuts to legal aid had created a “huge burden” on judges, lawyers and litigants themselves. She did not welcome having to “descend into the arena” of the dispute, she added, because there was a temptation to become a litigant’s advocate. Bodey, who has been based in the family division of the high court in London for 18 years, said more people had been forced to represent themselves at hearings he had overseen in recent years, and they did not have the required knowledge or skills. The judge said he had felt “first hand” their frustration and he had sometimes had to act as their counsel and ask questions on their behalf. He told his audience, which included Sir James Munby, the most senior family court judge in England and Wales: “I find it shaming that in this country, with its fine record of justice and fairness, that I should be presiding over such cases.” The government’s own statistics show spending on legal aid has fallen sharply from £2.6bn in 2005-06 to £1.5bn last year. The steepest decline came after 2013 when Laspo came into effect. The Ministry of Justice is due to review the impact of Laspo but is not expected to report until next spring. There has also been widespread criticism of the cuts by the National Audit Office, other senior judges, parliamentary select committees and campaign groups. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Maintaining access to justice remains vital and continues to be at the heart of our reforms. “We are focussing legal aid resources on those who most need help, which is why we are making wider changes which will make it easier for domestic violence victims to qualify for the financial support they need to pay for legal representation. We will announce details of the planned review of legal aid reforms in due course.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
